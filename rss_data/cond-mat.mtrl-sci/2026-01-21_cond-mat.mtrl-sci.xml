      <title>Homogeneous Microwave Delivery for Quantum Sensing with Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers at High Pressures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers have been demonstrated as a useful tool in high pressure environments. However, the geometry and small working area of the diamond anvil cells (DACs) used to apply pressure present a challenge to effective delivery of microwave (mw) fields. We designed and characterized a novel slotted design for mw transmission to nitrogen-vacancy centers (NVs) in a diamond anvil cell via zero-field and in-field optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) measurements across pressures between 1 and 48 GPa. The mw fields experienced by NVs across the diamond culet was calculated from Rabi frequency and found to be higher and more uniform than those generated by an equivalent simple mw line, which will improve performance for wide-field, high-pressure measurements to probe spatial variations across samples under pressure.</description>

      <title>Chemical Vapor Deposition Growth and Characterization of ReSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) flakes of ReSe2 structure were grown by chemical vapor deposition and investigated at room temperature using Raman, photoluminescence, and absorption spectroscopies. The Raman spectra revealed eighteen phonon modes in the range of 100-300 cm-1 that were found in good agreement with the density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The thickness profiles of the ReSe2 flakes are in the range of 5-50 nm. The ReSe2 crystal structure and morphology were investigated using XRD, atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The energy dispersion spectroscopy confirmed the 1:2 elemental composition. The absorption spectra were obtained for ReSe2 flakes and found to exhibit excitonic peaks in the spectral region of 885 - 942 nm. These peaks are used to define the band gap of the material. The DFT calculations predicted an indirect bandgap of 0.88 eV for the bulk structure, while a direct bandgap of 1.26 eV was predicted for the monolayer.</description>

      <title>Quantum Kernel Machine Learning for Autonomous Materials Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous materials science, where active learning is used to navigate large compositional phase space, has emerged as a powerful vehicle to rapidly explore new materials. A crucial aspect of autonomous materials science is exploring new materials using as little data as possible. Gaussian process-based active learning allows effective charting of multi-dimensional parameter space with a limited number of training data, and thus is a common algorithmic choice for autonomous materials science. An integral part of the autonomous workflow is the application of kernel functions for quantifying similarities among measured data points. A recent theoretical breakthrough has shown that quantum kernel models can achieve similar performance with less training data than classical models. This signals the possible advantage of applying quantum kernel machine learning to autonomous materials discovery. In this work, we compare quantum and classical kernels for their utility in sequential phase space navigation for autonomous materials science. Specifically, we compute a quantum kernel and several classical kernels for x-ray diffraction patterns taken from an Fe-Ga-Pd ternary composition spread library. We conduct our study on both IonQ's Aria trapped ion quantum computer hardware and the corresponding classical noisy simulator. We experimentally verify that a quantum kernel model can outperform some classical kernel models. The results highlight the potential of quantum kernel machine learning methods for accelerating materials discovery and suggest complex x-ray diffraction data is a candidate for robust quantum kernel model advantage.</description>

      <title>Deriving a comprehensive dataset of optical constants for metal halide perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate optical constants are essential for modelling light propagation, absorption, and ultimately photovoltaic performance in state of the art perovskite solar cells and is especially important for multiple junction or tandem cells. However, available datasets for metal halide perovskites remain sparse, inconsistent in quality, and often suffer from unphysical sub bandgap extinction caused by surface roughness and limitations of conventional ellipsometry fits. Here, we present a comprehensive library of complex refractive indices (n,k) for a technologically relevant set of FA based lead perovskites, spanning bromide compositions from 0 to 100 percent, and mixed Pb Sn perovskites with Sn fractions from 0 to 60 %. Using state of the art fabrication protocols that yield high quality films, we combine variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements with highly sensitive sub bandgap probes, including photothermal deflection spectroscopy for neat lead based perovskites and Fourier transform photocurrent spectroscopy for Pb Sn alloys, to reconstruct fully zeroed dielectric functions across and below the band edge. The measured data are then stitched and recalculated via a Kramers Kronig consistent framework, ensuring physically accurate behaviour across the full spectral range. Finally, we introduce a transformation based interpolation scheme that preserves spectral shape and feature alignment, enabling reliable determination of (n,k) for any intermediate composition or band gap. This complete dataset and interpolation protocol provide a standardized foundation for optical modelling of perovskite and tandem solar cells, addressing longstanding data gaps and supporting accurate simulations of next generation photovoltaic architectures.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Van Hove Singularities: Electronic Fingerprints of 3Q Magnetic Order in a van der Waals Quantum Magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetically intercalated transition metal dichalcogenides are emerging as a rich platform for exploring exotic quantum states in van der Waals magnets. Among them, CoxTaS2 has attracted intense interest following the recent discovery of a distinctive 3Q magnetic ground state and a pronounced anomalous Hall effect below a critical doping of x=1/3, both intimately tied to cobalt concentration. To date, direct signatures of this enigmatic 3Q magnetic order in the electronic structure remain elusive. Here we report a comprehensive doping dependent angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy study that unveils these long-sought fingerprints. Our data reveal an unexpected "inverse Mexican hat" dispersion along the K-M-K direction, accompanied by two van Hove singularities. These features are consistent with theoretical predictions for a 3Q magnetic order near three-quarters band filling on a cobalt triangular lattice. These results provide evidence of 3Q magnetic order in the electronic structure, establishing TMD van der Waals magnets as tunable materials to explore the interplay between magnetism and topology.</description>

      <title>Spin-Valley Locking in 2H-TaS2 and Its Co-Intercalated Counterpart: Roles of Surface Domains and Co Intercalation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tuning and probing spin-valley coupling is key to understanding correlated ground states in 2$\it{H}$-TaS$_2$. Its magnetically intercalated analogue, Co$_{1/3}$TaS$_2$, introduces additional degrees of freedom, including modified interlayer coupling and magnetism, to modulate spin-valley physics. Surface-sensitive probes like ARPES are essential for accessing surface spin texture, yet previous studies on 2$\it{H}$-TMDs have reported conflicting results regarding spin-polarized bands, leaving open whether these discrepancies are intrinsic or extrinsic. Here we performed spatially resolved spin-ARPES measurements on 2$\it{H}$-TaS$_2$ and Co$_{1/3}$TaS$_2$. Our results reveal robust spin-valley locking on both compounds. Importantly, Co intercalation enhances interlayer hybridization and introduces magnetism while preserving the TaS$_2$-derived spin texture. We further observe a spatial reversal of the out-of-plane spin polarization, which we attribute to different surface domains. This effect complicates quantifying spin textures and may underlie prior inconsistent observations. Our findings provide microscopic insight into how interlayer interactions and surface domains together govern spin-valley phenomena in layered TMDs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Patterning of precipitates along dislocation lines arising from nonequilibrium segregation during ion irradiation is investigated in model binary alloys. Lattice kinetic Monte Carlo simulations reveal that the competition between solute advection by point defects to the dislocation and thermal diffusion along the dislocation can stabilize self-organized nanostructures with distinct morphologies, including tubes and quasi-periodic necklaces. The stabilization of nano-necklaces is rationalized by heavy-tail power-law distributions for solute redistribution along the dislocation due to advection.</description>

      <title>Local Structure of Epitaxial Single Crystal UO$_{2+x}$ Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The influence of oxygen stoichiometry on the uranium local environment is explored in epitaxial single crystal uranium oxide thin films grown by DC magnetron sputtering. Through post-growth annealing, the stoichiometry of as-grown UO$_{2}$ films are tuned over an approximate stoichiometry range of $0.07 \leq x \leq 0.20$, estimated with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements of the U$-4f$ and O$-1s$ peaks. The local structure of the thin films are then probed using extended X-ray absorption fine structure measurements at the U $L_{3}$ absorption edge. We observe both the evolution of the U local environment of as a function of oxidation in UO$_{2+x}$, and that the near stoichiometric UO$_{2}$ film replicates the local structure of bulk UO$_{2}$ material standards well. The series of stoichiometrically varied samples highlights the non-trivial transitional behaviour of the UO$_{2+x}$ oxygen sublattice with increasing oxygen content in this stoichiometric regime, while also demonstrating the efficacy of this thin film synthesis route for actinide studies beyond their established use as idealised surfaces, which could be readily adapted for further stoichiometrically tailored material studies and UO$_{2+x}$ device fabrication.</description>

      <title>Transition Metal Dichalcogenide MoS${}_2$: oxygen and fluorine functionalization for selective plasma processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-temperature plasma processing is a promising technique for tailoring the properties of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) because it allows for precise control of radical and ion energies and fluxes. For chalcogen substitution, a key challenge is to identify the ion energy window that enables selective chalcogen removal while preserving the metal lattice. Using ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD), we demonstrate that oxygen and fluorine functionalization through thermal chemisorption significantly lowers the sputtering energy threshold ($E_{sputt}$) of MoS${}_2$ from $\sim 35$ eV to $\sim 10$ eV. In addition, we find that a non-orthogonal impact angle $\sim 30{}^{\circ}$ reduces the sputtering energy threshold, while cryogenic-range TMD temperatures may increase. To explain the observed trends, a multi-step sputtering mechanism is proposed. Our results show that oxygen/fluorine functionalization, impact angle, and material temperature are key control parameters for selective, damage-free chalcogen removal in TMD processing.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic assessment of the Ba-La-S and Ga-La-S systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the first thermodynamic assessment of binary and pseudo-binary phase diagrams in the Ba--La--S and Ga--La--S systems by means of the CALPHAD method. Experimental phase diagram equilibrium data and thermodynamic properties available from the literature were critically reviewed and assessed using thermodynamic models for the Gibbs energies of individual phases. The associated solution model was used to describe the short-range ordering behavior of the liquid phases. To supplement the limited experimental data reported in the literature, ab initio molecular dynamics calculations were employed to derive mixing enthalpies of the liquid phases in the binary subsystems. The resulting phase diagrams and calculated thermodynamic properties show good agreement with available literature within the investigated compositional ranges of binary and pseudo-binary systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CP-PAW is a combined electronic structure and ab-initio molecular dynamics code to perform mixed quantum and classical simulations of atomistic condensed phase systems, such as solids, liquids, and molecular systems. As the name suggests, the CP-PAW code unifies the all-electron projector augmented-wave method with the Car-Parrinello approach to determine not only the electronic and nuclear ground state of condensed matter, but also to study their properties and dynamics. In addition to briefly outlining the underlying theory, the focus will be on unique aspects of CP-PAW and how to correctly employ them as a user. How to install CP-PAW using the new build system will also be briefly mentioned.</description>

      <title>Spin-dependent Raman and Brillouin light scattering on excitons in CsPbBr$_3$ perovskite crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin properties of excitons and charge carriers in CsPbBr$_3$ lead halide perovskite crystals are investigated by spin-dependent light scattering in magnetic fields up to 10 T. Spin-flip Raman scattering spectra measured under resonant excitation of exciton-polaritons show a rich variety of features provided by the Zeeman splittings of excitons and of electrons and holes interacting with the excitons. The magnitudes and anisotropies of their Land\'e $g$-factors are measured. A detailed consideration of the responsible mechanisms is presented and discussed in relation to the experimental data, in particular on the polarization properties of the Raman spectra. We consider several mechanisms for the combined spin-flip Raman scattering processes involving resident carriers and photoexcited excitons and suggest new ones, involving trions in the intermediate scattering state. A double electron spin-flip caused by the exciton interaction with two localized or donor-bound electrons is revealed. The spectral lines of Brillouin light scattering on exciton-polaritons shift in energy and become polarization-sensitive in magnetic field, evidencing the splitting of the exciton-polariton dispersion.</description>

      <title>Electric Charge Transport and Dielectric Properties of the Barium Titanate Ceramics Obtained by Spark-Plasma Sintering with Different Controlled Carbon Content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Barium titanate (BaTiO3) ceramics with a different controlled content of carbon were synthesized by spark-plasma sintering (SPS) at the temperature of 1100 C in vacuum under pressure. The concentration and distribution of carbon impurity inside the samples is estimated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The resistivity vs temperature and electric field dependences of the SPS ceramics with different carbon concentration have been studied. It is shown that their conduction is determined by the variable range hopping mechanism and obeys the Mott law. The density of localized states and localization radius of the electron wave function are determined. The difference in low-temperature resistivity of the SPS ceramics is caused by carbon concentration and connected with it variation of the dielectric permittivity. The relative dielectric permittivity of the SPS ceramics is colossal and reaches the values of 10^5 - 10^6 order. The larger carbon concentration is, the smaller the permittivity and resistivity are within the Mott hopping conduction temperature range. In the range from 250 K to 408 K one observes that the dielectric permittivity strongly increases forming a maximum in all samples, which may be related to the phase transition. Along with this, resistivity manifests a simultaneous sharp decrease. The decrease of resistivity along with the characteristic dependence of resistivity vs dielectric permittivity in the Mott conduction temperature range, evidences the validity of Heywang model for the description of SPS ceramics conduction mechanisms. The resistivity strongly decreases with increasing frequency in the AC regime, which agrees both with models of hopping conduction and effects based on the Maxwell-Wagner model. The studied SPS BaTiO3 ceramics are attractive for applications in energy storage and sensorics.</description>

      <title>Single-Atom Tuning of Structural and Optoelectronic Properties in Halogenated Anthracene-Based Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strategies for tuning structural and (opto-)electronic properties are fundamental to the rational design of functional materials. Here, we present a molecular design approach for precisely modulating the optoelectronic properties of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) through single-atom halogen substitution on $\pi$-extended anthracene linkers. Using a Wurster-type tetratopic amine (W-NH$_2$) and a series of anthracene-based dialdehydes bearing H, Cl, Br, or I at the 2-position, a family of imine-linked COFs, W-A-X (X = H, Cl, Br, I), was synthesized, all displaying well-ordered porous structures. The halogen substituent strongly influences framework formation, with brominated COFs forming substantially larger crystalline domains than their chloro- and iodo-functionalized analogues. UV-vis absorption and photoluminescence measurements reveal a systematic redshift across the series $(\mathrm{H &lt; Cl &lt; Br &lt; I})$, demonstrating that a single-atom modification effectively tunes the optical response. Time-dependent density functional theory calculations on both isolated fragments and extended COF models attribute these trends to halogen-induced changes in the COF band structure and provide a mechanistic understanding of how single-atom substitution influences the optoelectronic properties of the extended $\pi$-framework. Overall, this study establishes single-atom halogen substitution as a powerful and modular strategy for tailoring the structural and optical properties of anthracene-based COFs.</description>

      <title>Significant impact of Al1-xGaxN interlayer on GaN/AlN thermal boundary conductance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AlN-GaN heterostructures are central to high-power and high-frequency electronics, including RF devices, power converters, and AI accelerators. An intermediate Al1-xGaxN (AlGaN) layer is often present, either unintentionally during growth or intentionally to induce a 2D electron gas, yet its impact on the interfacial thermal boundary conductance (TBC) remains unknown due to the lack of reliable measurement or modeling methods. Here, we report a first principles-based evaluation of the TBCs of AlN-AlGaN, AlGaN-GaN, and AlN-AlGaN-GaN interfaces over the full alloy range. This is realized by the development of accurate deep learning interatomic potentials based on first-principles simulations. Contrary to other material systems where mixed interlayers enhance thermal coupling, we find that an AlGaN interlayer markedly degrades TBC between GaN and AlN, explaining the observation in experiments. Finally, we show that if the Al composition is sigmoidally transitioned from 0 to 1 across the AlN-GaN interface, it can remarkably increase the TBC, compared to an abrupt or a linear transition. This work is expected to shed light on an accurate thermal analysis and electro-thermal co-design of future AlGaN-based devices.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic and electronic properties of rutile Sn$_{1-x}$Ge$_x$O$_2$ alloys from first principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rutile Sn$_{1-x}$Ge$_x$O$_{2}$ alloys are promising materials for high-power electronic applications due to their dopability and tunable ultra-wide band gaps. We use first-principles density functional theory and statistical mechanics to investigate the crystallographic, electronic, and thermodynamic properties of rutile $\text{Sn}_{1-x}\text{Ge}_x\text{O}_2$ alloys. We predict that the lattice parameters follow Vegard's law, while band gaps calculated with the hybrid HSE06 functional exhibit strong bowing, consistent with experiment. We also predict that the disordered phase has a large positive mixing enthalpy and a slight tendency for Ge-Sn clustering, indicated by weakly negative short-range order parameters. This large positive mixing enthalpy produces a miscibility gap with a critical temperature above 2300 K, implying that the high Ge and Sn solubilities observed in thin-film synthesis cannot be explained by the incoherent phase diagram alone. We demonstrate that coherency strain during epitaxial growth substantially alters phase stability. Calculations of the coherent spinodal show significant suppression of the miscibility gap, reducing the critical temperature to $\approx 900$ K. These coherent phase boundaries account for the experimentally observed high solubilities at typical growth temperatures. Our results indicate that coherency strain stabilizes these metastable alloys and enables bandgap engineering in this ultrawide-bandgap material system.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic ductility enhancement in Mg alloys elucidated via large-scale ab-initio calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnesium is the lightest structural alloy, yet its practical use is limited by its low ductility. Recent studies suggest ductility enhancement in dilute Mg alloys may stem from favorable solute modification of &lt;c+a&gt; pyramidal I/II screw dislocation core energy difference, activating &lt;c+a&gt; slip via a double cross-slip mechanism. This work conducts large-scale DFT calculations, reaching ~6,000 atoms, of &lt;c+a&gt; dislocation energetics in Mg and Mg-Y/Zn alloys. We find that relative solute strengthening effects on pyramidal I and II screw dislocation glide are crucial for cross-slip enhancement in Mg-Y, in contrast to prior investigations, that find solute-mediated dislocation-core energy modification as the main driver. Our predictions align with single- and poly-crystal experimental results and also capture the transition from pyramidal II to I preferred slip in Mg-Y.</description>

      <title>Atomic Alignment in PbS Nanocrystal Superlattices with Compact Inorganic Ligands via Reversible Oriented Attachment of Nanocrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanocrystals (NCs) serve as versatile building blocks for the creation of functional materials, with NC self-assembly offering opportunities to enable novel material properties. Here, we demonstrate that PbS NCs functionalized with strongly negatively charged metal chalcogenide complex (MCC) ligands, such as $Sn_2S_6^{4-}$ and $AsS_4^{3-}$, can self-assemble into all-inorganic superlattices with both long-range superlattice translational and atomic-lattice orientational order. Structural characterizations reveal that the NCs adopt unexpected edge-to-edge alignment, and numerical simulation clarifies that orientational order is thermodynamically stabilized by many-body ion correlations originating from the dense electrolyte. Furthermore, we show that the superlattices of $Sn_2S_6^{4-}$-functionalized PbS NCs can be fully disassembled back into the colloidal state, which is highly unusual for orientationally attached superlattices with atomic-lattice alignment. The reversible oriented attachment of NCs, enabling their dynamic assembly and disassembly into effectively single-crystalline superstructures, offers a pathway toward designing reconfigurable materials with adaptive and controllable electronic and optoelectronic properties.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Interlayer Coupling and Excitons in Twin-Stacked Two-Dimensional Magnetic CrSBr Bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The degree of electronic coupling between individual layers in few-layer van der Waals heterostructures offers a route to engineer their magnetic, electronic, and optical functionalities. Using state-of-the-art first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that the electronic coupling between two monolayers of CrSBr, an anisotropic two-dimensional magnetic semiconductor, is highly nonlinear and nonmonotonic with respect to their relative twist angle, exhibiting a pronounced maximum at the twin-stacking configuration. The coupling strength scales with both the degree of overlap of Br orbitals adjacent to the van der Waals gap and the cosine of half of the interlayer spin angle. This enhanced interlayer electronic coupling gives rise to excitons delocalized across the two layers with a strong polarization dependence that reflects the details of the interlayer spin alignment. Our results reveal a sensitive interplay between twist angle, magnetism, and excitonic properties in twin-stacked CrSBr bilayers, and they establish twin stacking as an effective route to engineering interlayer coupling and optical response in anisotropic two-dimensional magnets with rectangular lattices.</description>

      <title>Sub-domain structure in a single crystal of the magnetic topological insulator MnSb2Te4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The domain structure of a MnSb$_2$Te$_4$ single crystal with a Curie temperature $T_C \approx 45~K$ was studied using the high-resolution Bitter decoration technique. Magnetotransport measurements confirm a soft ferromagnetic ordering with a coercive field of $ \sim 100$ Oe. We revealed the formation of a hierarchical domain structure characterized by two distinct spatial scales. These results indicate the existence of two magnetically weakly coupled subsystems -- surface and bulk. The observed sub-domain structure can be attributed to the formation of a ferromagnetic well due to an inhomogeneous distribution of $\mathrm{Mn_{Sb}}$ antisite defects, with an additional contribution from symmetry breaking in the near-surface layer.</description>

      <title>Transition from conventional ferroelectricity to ion-conduction-like ferroelectricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cross-unitcell long displacements in some recent emergent ferroelectrics have actually challenged the classical definition of ferroelectricity, while the relative explorations are still in the early stage and even controversial. In this paper we provide a general model that gives the picture for the evolution and transition from typical ferroelectricity to long displacement ferroelectricity, which is classified into type-I and type-II. In particular, type-I with two switching modes of different barriers may switch between conventional ferroelectricity and ion-conduction-like ferroelectricity depending on various factors including electric field, boundaries, vacancies, temperature, etc.., which is demonstrated by first-principles calculations on {\gamma}-AlOOH and CuInP2S6 as two paradigmatic cases. Intriguingly, their polarizations are nonlocal since the boundaries also determine the switching mode and polarization direction, which can be different for the same given crystal structure. Such type-I can be evolved from conventional ferroelectricity as the migration barrier across unitcell is reduced, and will behave like type-II at elevated temperature as the conventional part becomes paraelectric. These unconventional behaviors can be applicable to various systems, and many previously unclarified phenomena can be well explained.</description>

      <title>A non-equilibrium strategy for the general synthesis of single-atom catalysts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-atom catalysts (SACs) maximize atom efficiency and exhibit unique electronic structures, yet realizing precise and scalable atomic dispersion remains a key challenge. Here, we report a non-equilibrium strategy for the scalable synthesis of SACs via ion implantation, enabling precise stabilization of metal atoms on diverse supports. Using an industrial-grade ion source, wafer-scale ion implantation with milliampere-level beam currents enables high-throughput fabrication of SACs, while the synergistic energy-mass effects stabilize isolated metal atoms in situ. A library of 36 SACs was constructed, and the resulting Pt/MoS2 exhibits outstanding hydrogen evolution performance with an overpotential of only 26 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and exceptional long-term stability, surpassing commercial Pt/C. This work demonstrates ion implantation as a versatile platform bridging fundamental SACs design and scalable manufacturing, providing new opportunities for high-performance catalysts in energy conversion applications.</description>

      <title>Accurate and efficient simulation of photoemission spectroscopy via Kohn-Sham scattering states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an efficient first-principles framework for simulating angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) by computing photoelectron states as solutions of the Kohn-Sham equation with scattering boundary conditions. This approach is formally equivalent to the Lippmann-Schwinger formalism but offers superior computational efficiency and direct integration with plane-wave or real-space density functional theory. By enabling direct calculation of photoemission matrix elements, our method bridges the gap between intrinsic electronic properties and experimental ARPES spectra. We demonstrate its accuracy through circular dichroism ARPES simulations for monolayer graphene and bulk $2H$-WSe$_2$, achieving excellent agreement with experimental data and highlighting the critical role of pseudopotentials in describing high-energy photoelectron scattering. Our results establish a robust and accessible route for quantitative ARPES modeling, paving the way for advanced studies of orbital textures, many-body effects, and time-resolved photoemission.</description>

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence is rapidly transforming materials science and engineering, offering powerful tools to navigate complexity, accelerate discovery, and optimize material design in ways previously unattainable. Driven by the accelerating pace of algorithmic advancements and increasing data availability, AI is becoming an essential competency for materials researchers. This review provides a comprehensive and structured overview of the current landscape, synthesizing recent advancements and methodologies for materials scientists seeking to effectively leverage these data-driven techniques. We survey the spectrum of machine learning approaches, from traditional algorithms to advanced deep learning architectures, including CNNs, GNNs, and Transformers, alongside emerging generative AI and probabilistic models such as Gaussian Processes for uncertainty quantification. The review also examines the pivotal role of data in this field, emphasizing how effective representation and featurization strategies, spanning compositional, structural, image-based, and language-inspired approaches, combined with appropriate preprocessing, fundamentally underpin the performance of machine learning models in materials research. Persistent challenges related to data quality, quantity, and standardization, which critically impact model development and application in materials science and engineering, are also addressed.</description>

      <title>INTERFACE Force Field for Alumina with Validated Bulk Phases and a pH-Resolved Surface Model Database for Electrolyte and Organic Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alumina and aluminum oxyhydroxides underpin chemical-engineering technologies from heterogeneous catalysis, corrosion protection, functional coatings, energy-storage devices, to biomedical components. Yet molecular models that predictively connect phase structure, pH-dependent surface chemistry, electrolyte organization, and adsorption across operating conditions remain limited. Here we introduce a unified INTERFACE Force Field (IFF) parameterization together with a curated, ready-to-use pH-resolved surface model database that provides the most accurate and transferable atomistic description of major alumina phases to date. The framework covers a-Al2O3, g-Al2O3, boehmite, diaspore, and gibbsite using a single, physically interpretable parameter set that is directly compatible with CHARMM, AMBER, OPLS-AA, CVFF, and PCFF. Across structural, thermodynamic, mechanical, and interfacial benchmarks, simulations reproduce experimental reference data with more than 95 percent accuracy, exceeding existing force fields and the reliability of current density-functional approaches. A key advance is the first transferable treatment of surface ionization and charge regulation across alumina phases over a broad range of pH values, enabling simulations of realistic solid electrolyte interfaces without phase-specific reparameterization. Quantitative reliability is demonstrated by reproducing trends in zeta potentials and pH-dependent adsorption of a corrosion inhibitor at alumina-water interfaces. Predicted adsorption free energies and surface contact times correlate with experiments across more than an order of magnitude. Relative to ML-DFT workflows, the speed 100 to 1000 times faster, reaching system sizes and time scales inaccessible to quantum methods. The results establish a predictive computational platform to design alumina-containing functional materials under realistic process conditions.</description>

      <title>Ontology-aligned structuring and reuse of multimodal materials data and workflows towards automatic reproduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reproducibility of computational results remains a challenge in materials science, as simulation workflows and parameters are often reported only in unstructured text and tables. While literature data are valuable for validation and reuse, the lack of machine-readable workflow descriptions prevents large-scale curation and systematic comparison. Existing text-mining approaches are insufficient to extract complete computational workflows with their associated parameters. An ontology-driven, large language model (LLM)-assisted framework is introduced for the automated extraction and structuring of computational workflows from the literature. The approach focuses on density functional theory-based stacking fault energy (SFE) calculations in hexagonal close-packed magnesium and its binary alloys, and uses a multi-stage filtering strategy together with prompt-engineered LLM extraction applied to method sections and tables. Extracted information is unified into a canonical schema and aligned with established materials ontologies (CMSO, ASMO, and PLDO), enabling the construction of a knowledge graph using atomRDF. The resulting knowledge graph enables systematic comparison of reported SFE values and supports the structured reuse of computational protocols. While full computational reproducibility is still constrained by missing or implicit metadata, the framework provides a foundation for organizing and contextualizing published results in a semantically interoperable form, thereby improving transparency and reusability of computational materials data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron backscatter diffraction is one of the most prevalent techniques used for microstructural characterization. In recent years, there has been an increase in the use of data-driven methods to analyze raw Kikuchi patterns. However, most of these require user input and the interpretation of the data-derived features is often challenging and subject to \textit{informed interpretation}. By using a combination of principal component analysis, constrained non-negative matrix factorization, and a variational autoencoder along with information-theoretical considerations on a multimodal dataset, it is shown that a) automated decision on method-specific hyperparameters, here the number of components in principal component analysis, the number of components for constrained non-negative matrix factorization, and the selection of reference constraints; and b) latent space features can be mapped to physically-meaningful quantities. In addition, the recommended region-of-interest (ROI) size for optimal model performance is approximated automatically to be twice the characteristic grain size based on information content of the dataset. Implemented in a workflow, this allows for a transferable, dataset-specific autonomous data-driven phase and grain segmentation including grain boundary detection and the analysis of very-small-angle intra-grain variations to complement conventional electron backscatter analysis.</description>

      <title>Successful growth of low carrier density $\alpha$-In$_2$Se$_3$ single crystals using Se-flux in a modified Bridgman furnace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indium selenide (In$_2$Se$_3$) has garnered significant attention for its intriguing properties and applications in batteries, solar cells, photodetectors and ferroelectric devices. However, the controlled synthesis of single phase $\alpha$-In$_2$Se$_3$ remains challenging owing to its complex phase diagram, presence of multiple polymorphs and the high volatility of selenium that induces non-stoichiometry and unintentional carrier doping. For ferroelectric {\alpha}-In2Se3, minimizing the carrier density is essential because leakage current can obscure polarization switching. Here, we report the growth of $\alpha$-In$_2$Se$_3$ single crystals using a unique approach, the Se-flux assisted modified vertical Bridgman technique combined with liquid encapsulation under high pressure. This approach creates a high-pressure, Se-rich environment that effectively minimizes Se-vaporization. Structural and compositional analysis using X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy confirm the formation of pure $\alpha$-In$_2$Se$_3$ single crystals with 3R stacking. Furthermore, the crystals exhibit remarkably low carrier density of 1.5-3.2 $\times$ 10$^{16}$ cm$^{-3}$ at 300K$-$the lowest reported to date, reflecting a significant suppression of Se-vacancies relative to the conventional Bridgman or melt-grown crystals. Through transport and ARPES measurements on different batches of crystals, we also demonstrate that the amount of Se-flux plays a crucial role in controlling Se-vacancies. Our results thus establish this modified Bridgman method as an effective strategy for synthesizing large $\alpha$-In$_2$Se$_3$ single crystals with reduced intrinsic defects. This technique can be broadly applied to grow other volatile chalcogenides with reduced defects and controlled stoichiometry.</description>

      <title>Spatially-resolved coherence of organic molecular spins at room-temperature</title>

Abstract: Molecular spins are a versatile platform for quantum sensing. Not only are the spin-bearing molecules themselves widely tunable, they are also capable of being used as sensors as crystals, films and in solution. Using thin-films offers the advantages of high doping ratios and the ability to control the thickness with nanometre precision, however they also introduce disorder to the system. High proximity sensing can also be realised by using micro- and nano-crystals, however in many solid-state systems this leads to a reduction in coherence. In this paper we combine room-temperature optically detected coherent control of molecular spins and microscopy to image the coherence properties of both thin-films and micro-crystals of pentacene doped p-terphenyl. In thin-films we find large amounts of variation in both the contrast and coherence times, leading to a variability in the magnetic field sensitivity of approximately 7.6 %. Applying the technique to micro-crystals shows much lower sensitivity variability (1.3 %), and we find no evidence of coherence loss toward the edge of the crystal. Finally we perform optically-detected coherent control on a nano-crystal, showing minimal loss in coherence and contrast compared to the bulk crystal, with a coherence time of 1.09 {\mu}s and a contrast of 25 %.</description>

      <title>3D atomistic imaging of polymer nanocomposites with Atom Probe Tomography: experimental methodology, preliminary results and future outlook</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of polymer nanocomposites as gas barrier materials has seen increasing interest, including applications involving hydrogen transport and storage. Better understanding of gas transport through those polymeric systems requires 3D nanoscale detection of distributions and the possible trapping of gas molecules within nanoparticles and polymer/nanoparticle interfaces While atom probe tomography (APT) offers promising means for such nanoscale characterisation, its use for polymers has been mainly limited to thin organic layers deposited onto substrates or pre-fabricated metal needle shaped specimens. This work provides the very first application of APT to bulk polymer nanocomposites. Particularly, site specific atom probe sample preparation by Focused Ion Beam (FIB) liftout has been shown for the first time in a model system of hexagonal boron nanoparticles within a PVDF polymer matrix, using a variety of FIB workflows including Xe FIB, Ga FIB, cryogenic Ga FIB and deuterium charging. Mass spectra from the bulk polymer and the nanoparticle were collected using pulsed laser atom probe using standard conditions and compared. Several challenges encountered during this research including damage of the polymeric matrix during sample preparation were extensively discussed in this paper. Once those challenges have been resolved (e.g. by developing site specific sample preparation protocols), the application of APT to polymer nanocomposites can open new options for nanoscale characterisation of those systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the thermal conductivity of amorphous solids by constructing a continuum model whose degrees of freedom are propagating vibrational modes (phonons) and extended Volterra dislocation line defects with their own vibrational degrees of freedom which do not propagate in space. Our working assumption is that these additional degrees of freedom account for the "boson peak" that is observed in glassy materials. This identification allows us to obtain the length distribution of dislocations from experimental data of the boson peak for each material, which we use as input to calculate the phonon self-energy in a quantum field theory framework using that the phonon-dislocation interaction is given by the Peach-Koehler force. The tail of the distribution for long dislocations is consistent with an $L^{-5}$ power law. Our results show that this power law yields a linear rise in the thermal conductivity, as observed in glasses at low temperatures. We then consider two approaches to describe thermal conductivity data quantitatively. In the simplest approach we only keep the low-frequency behavior of the phonon self-energy with one free parameter, plus an adjustable UV cutoff. In the more realistic approach we keep the full frequency dependence of the phonon self-energy as dictated by the phonon-dislocation interaction plus an additional contribution due to scattering with point defects, with a cutoff set by the typical interatomic spacing of the material. We obtain a satisfactory description of thermal conductivity data with both approaches. We conclude by discussing prospects to test the predictive power of this model.</description>

      <title>Lithium and sodium decorated PHE-graphene for high capacity hydrogen storage: A DFT and GCMC study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Porous nanocarbon materials are seen as potential excellent materials for hydrogen storage due to their high surface area, excellent cycling stability and favorable kinetics. This study employs Density Functional Theory (DFT) simulations to investigate key property of Li$^-$ and Na$^-$ modified PHE-graphene, including structural stability, electronic properties, and hydrogen storage capabilities. The results show that when each Li atom adsorbs six hydrogen molecules, the material reaches the maximum hydrogen adsorption gravimetric density of 15.20 wt%. Additionally, through Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations, we obtained the hydrogen weight ratios and adsorption enthalpy curves for Li- and Na-modified PHE under varying temperature and pressure conditions. These findings indicate that both Li- and Na-modified PHE-graphene are exceptional candidates for hydrogen storage materials, particularly in mobile applications.</description>

      <title>Room temperature intrinsic anomalous Hall effect in disordered half-metallic ferromagnetic quaternary Heusler alloy CoRuFeSi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quaternary Heusler alloys offer a versatile platform for engineering magnetic and topological transport phenomena through chemical flexibility and tunable disorder. Here, we report a comprehensive experimental and theoretical investigation of the magnetic, magnetotransport, and anomalous Hall properties of the quaternary Heusler alloy CoRuFeSi. The compound crystallizes in the LiMgPdSn-type structure with significant Co--Ru antisite disorder and exhibits soft ferromagnetism with a saturation magnetization of $4.21~\mu_{\mathrm{B}}/\mathrm{f.u.}$ at low temperature and a Curie temperature well above room temperature. Hall measurements reveal a robust anomalous Hall effect persisting up to 300~K, with an anomalous Hall conductivity of $\sim 74$~S/cm that is nearly temperature independent. Scaling analysis demonstrates that the anomalous Hall response is dominated by the intrinsic Berry-curvature mechanism. First-principles calculations identify CoRuFeSi as a topologically nontrivial nodal-line semimetal in its ordered phase. Incorporation of experimentally relevant Co--Ru antisite disorder redistributes the Berry curvature and quantitatively reproduces the experimentally observed anomalous Hall conductivity, while preserving half-metallicity. These results establish CoRuFeSi as a disorder-tolerant half-metallic ferromagnet with a sizable intrinsic anomalous Hall effect at room temperature, highlighting its potential for spintronic and Hall-based device applications.</description>

      <title>Inverse Chiral Phonon Zeeman Effect in Noncentrosymmetric Crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a microscopic theory of the inverse chiral phonon Zeeman effect in noncentrosymmetric crystals. Within micropolar elasticity, coupled translational displacements and microrotations give rise to intrinsically chiral phonons, which generate an elliptically polarized internal magnetic field through dynamical piezoelectricity. In the high-frequency Floquet regime and under incomplete electronic screening, this field acts as an effective longitudinal Zeeman field on electronic spins, leading to spin polarization and band splitting. The results establish a purely lattice-driven mechanism for the inverse chiral phonon Zeeman effect in noncentrosymmetric crystals.</description>

      <title>Engineering of Orbital Hybridization: An Exotic Strategy to Manipulate Orbital Current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current-induced spin-orbit torque (SOT) plays a crucial role in the next-generation spin-orbitronics. Enhancing its efficiency is both fundamentally and practically interesting and remains a challenge to date. Recently, orbital counterparts of spin effects that do not rely on the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) have been found as an alternative mechanism to realize it. This work highlights the engineering of copper oxidation states for manipulating the orbital current and its torque in the CuO$_x$-based heterostructures. The orbital hybridization and thus the orbital-Rashba-Edelstein effect at the CuO$_x$/Cu interfaces are significantly enhanced by increasing the copper oxidation state, yielding a torque efficiency that is almost ten times larger than the conventional heavy metals. The Cu$_4$O$_3$/Cu interface, rather than the widely accepted CuO/Cu interface, is revealed to account for the enhanced SOT performance in the CuO$_x$-based heterostructures. In addition, the torque efficiency can be alternatively switched between high and low thresholds through the redox reaction. The current results establish an exotic and robust strategy for engineering the orbital current and SOT for spin-orbitronics, which applies to other weak-SOC materials.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Ferroelectric Twin Boundaries in a Photoactive Halide Perovskite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Halide perovskites have emerged as promising materials for next-generation photovoltaics, laser sources and X-ray detectors. There is intense debate as to whether some photoactive halide perovskites exhibit ferroelectric behaviour and whether it might be possible to utilise the bulk photovoltaic effect to enhance the performance of halide perovskite solar cells. Here, using low-dose scanning transmission electron microscopy, we discover the existence of ferroelastic twin boundaries in vapor-deposited CsPbI3 thin films, parallel to {110} and {112}. Remarkably, despite photoactive CsPbI3 being centrosymmetric and non-polar, we observe directly that Pb atoms shift at {110} twin boundaries driving a local ferroelectric-like polarisation. These polar twin walls form an intrinsic array of nanoscale functional interfaces, spaced ~30-50 nm apart, embedded within the non-polar perovskite lattice. In contrast, {112} twin boundaries remain non-polar but strongly suppress octahedral tilt and off-centre Cs atom displacements, revealing a different untapped ferroic degree of freedom. These discoveries together uncover previously hidden ferroic functionality in halide perovskite semiconductors, opening opportunities for enhanced conductivity and photovoltaic behaviour through domain wall engineering.</description>

      <title>Effect of uniaxial compressive stress on polarization switching and domain wall formation in tetragonal phase BaTiO3 via machine learning potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectric materials such as BaTiO3 exhibit spontaneous polarization that can be reoriented by an external electric field, forming the basis of various memory, actuator, and sensor applications. The polarization switching behavior, however, is strongly influenced by mechanical boundary conditions due to the intrinsic electromechanical coupling in ferroelectrics. In this study, we employ a machine learning interatomic potential to investigate the effect of uniaxial compressive stress on polarization switching and domain wall evolution in the tetragonal phase of BaTiO3. This study revealed a critical stress about 120 MPa which 90 degree polarization switching occurs. Beyond the critical stress, larger supercells exhibit lower activation energies for polarization switching with 180-degree domain wall formation and weaker constraints from periodic boundary conditions, thereby facilitating domain-wall formation. Besides, Increasing compressive stress reduces both the remnant polarization and the coercive field, while a double hysteresis loop emerges at a stress level of 80 MPa. These findings provide atomistic insights into stress-controlled ferroelectric switching and highlight the crucial role of mechanical loading in designing reliable ferroelectric devices.</description>

      <title>Water Phase Diagram from a General-Purpose Atomic Cluster Expansion Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water's phase diagram remains one of the most intricate and challenging benchmarks in molecular modeling. In this study, we compute the phase diagram of water using an Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE) potential trained on density-functional theory (DFT) calculations based on the revPBE-D3 exchange and correlation functional. We compute solid-liquid chemical potential differences and melting points using biased coexistence simulations with the On-the-Fly Probability Enhanced Sampling (OPES) method. Starting from these points, we trace coexistence lines using Gibbs-Duhem integration. This combination of methods allows us to consistently map pressure-temperature phase boundaries and reconstruct the full phase diagram between approximately 100-500 K and 0-4 GPa. The stability regions of the main ice polymorphs (Ih, II, V, VI, and VII) are reproduced in close agreement with experiments. As in earlier studies based on DFT, ice III is metastable and there are systematic shifts of coexistence lines with respect to experimental results. Our results demonstrate the capability of our general-purpose ACE potential to capture the complex phase behavior of water across wide thermodynamic conditions.</description>

      <title>Machine learning interatomic potentials for solid-state precipitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are routinely used to model diverse atomistic phenomena, yet parameterizing them to accurately capture solid-state phase transformations remains difficult. We present error metrics and data-generation schemes designed to streamline the parameterization of MLIPs for modeling precipitation in multi-component alloys. We developed an algorithm that enumerates symmetrically distinct transformation pathways connecting chemical decorations on different parent crystal structures. Additionally, we introduce the weighted Kendall-$\tau$ coefficient and its semi-grand canonical generalization as metrics for quantifying MLIP accuracy in predicting low-temperature thermodynamics. We apply these approaches to parameterize an MLIP for a dilute Mg-Nd alloy. The resulting potential reproduces the complex early-stage precipitation behavior observed in experiment. Large-scale atomistic simulations reveal competition between order-disorder and structural transformations. Furthermore, these results suggest a continuous transition between high-symmetry hcp and bcc crystal structures during aging heat treatments.</description>

      <title>Visual Luminescence Thermometry Enabled by Phase-Transition-Activated Cross Relaxation of Tb3+ Ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of visual luminescent thermometers capable of exhibiting pronounced color changes in response to temperature variations requires the rational design of phosphors with high spectrally selective thermal sensitivity. In this work, we present a strategy based on phase-transition-induced activation of cross-relaxation processes in LiYO2:Tb3+. The monoclinic-to-tetragonal structural phase transition modifies the point symmetry of Tb3+ ions in the host lattice, enhances the Stark effect, and enables energetic resonance required for efficient cross relaxation. Consequently, emission originating from the 5D3 excited state is rapidly quenched relative to that from the 5D4 level above approximately 300 K, resulting in a distinct temperature-dependent color change of the emitted light from blue to green. This mechanism yields exceptionally high chromaticity-coordinate-based sensitivities, reaching SRx,max = 0.40% K-1 and SRy,max=0.72% K-1 at 410 K. Furthermore, phase-transition-driven modifications of the Tb3+ emission spectral profile enable the realization of a multimode luminescent thermometer with a maximum relative sensitivity of SRmax=13% K-1. The practical applicability of this system is demonstrated through an ON-OFF luminescent thermal switch and fully filter-free, dynamic two-dimensional thermal imaging using the blue and green channels of a standard digital camera, enabling intuitive visualization, remote readout, and temperature mapping under dynamic conditions.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions in Low-Dimensional Layered Double Perovskites: The Role of the Organic Moieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Halide double perovskites are an interesting alternative to Pb-containing counterparts as active materials in optoelectronic devices. Low-dimensional double perovskites are fabricated by introducing large organic cations, resulting in organic/inorganic architectures with one or more inorganic octahedral layers separated by organic cations. Here, we synthesize layered double perovskites based on 3D Cs2AgBiBr6 that consist of double (2L) or single (1L) inorganic octahedral layers, using ammonium cations of different size and chemical structure. Temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy reveals phase transition signatures in both inorganic lattice and organic moieties by detecting variations in their vibrational modes. Changes in the conformational arrangement of the organic cations to an ordered state coincide with a phase transition in the 1L systems with the shortest ammonium moieties. Significant changes of photoluminescence intensity observed around the transition temperature suggest that optical properties may be deeply affected by the octahedral tilts emerging at the phase transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uranium tellurides span magnetic and superconducting ground states, yet systematic electronic-structure information across the U-Te series remains scarce. In this study, we perform photoemission measurements on freshly prepared UxTey thin films covering the range of bulk stoichiometries under ultra-high vacuum (10^-9 Pa), enabling clean surfaces and compositions matching bulk phases, including the celebrated UTe2. X-ray and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS/UPS) reveal consistent evolution of the U 4f and Te 3d core levels and valence states across the series, in good agreement with the limited bulk data. Supported by uniform ab initio calculations for all U-Te compounds, we identify systematic trends in U-Te hybridization and charge-transfer effects across the series. These results establish thin-film photoemission as a reliable route for mapping electronic-structure trends in tellurides of heavy elements with diverse electronic ground states.</description>

      <title>Robust phonon engineering and symmetry-selective lattice dynamics in CrSBr$_{1-x}$Cl$_{x}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic substitution provides a controlled route to engineer lattice dynamics in low-symmetry two-dimensional materials. Here, by combining polarization-resolved Raman spectroscopy and first-principles calculations, we investigate the evolution of phonon characteristics in CrSBr$_{1-x}$Cl$_{x}$ ($0 \leq x \leq \sim 0.5$) upon partial substitution of Br with Cl atoms. Progressive Cl substitution of Br induces systematic shifts of parent CrSBr out-of-plane $A_\textrm{g}$ phonon modes and activates additional Raman features. These features persist across different polarization configurations and excitation energies, reflecting substitution-induced symmetry lowering and local lattice perturbations. Explicit supercell phonon calculations combined with Raman $\Gamma$-density-of-states simulations identify these features as symmetry-lowered descendants of parent modes arising from alloy disorder. Complementary strain-dependent calculations reveal that anisotropic lattice compression plays a key role in renormalizing Cr-S dominated phonons. Under near-resonant excitation, stimulated Raman scattering-like amplification remains observable with increasing Cl content, highlighting the resilience of anisotropic electron-phonon coupling in this system.</description>

      <title>Disentangling the Discrepancy Between Theoretical and Experimental Curie Temperatures in Ferroelectric PbTiO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately predicting the Curie temperature ($T_c$) of ferroelectrics from first principles remains a major challenge, as theoretical estimates often fall significantly below experimental values. In this work, we investigate the origin of these discrepancies in the prototypical ferroelectric PbTiO$_3$ by performing extensive constant-pressure ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations and benchmarking them against classical molecular dynamics (MD) using machine learning force fields (MLFFs) derived from first-principles data. Our results show that the underestimation of $T_c$ primarily stems from the limitations of the exchange-correlation functional, rather than inaccuracies in the MLFF fitting. We uncover a critical interplay between finite-size effects and the range of interatomic interactions: although short-range MLFFs appear to yield better agreement with experimental $T_c$, this improvement results from a fortuitous cancellation of errors. Incorporating explicit long-range interactions improves accuracy for larger supercells but ultimately leads to lower predicted $T_c$ values. These findings highlight that accurate finite-temperature predictions require not only high-quality training data and sufficiently large simulation cells, but also the explicit treatment of long-range interactions and improved exchange-correlation functionals.</description>

      <title>Magnetism and 3D Electron Diffraction Solution of Hydrated Rubidium-Ruthenium Oxide Rb$_2$Ru$_2$O$_7$.H$_2$O</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The crystal structure of Rb$_2$Ru$_2$O$_7$.H$_2$O was determined by three-dimensional electron diffraction from the individual crystallites of a solid-state powder product. Rb$_2$Ru$_2$O$_7$.H$_2$O crystallizes in space group \textit{C}2/\textit{c} ($a=7.841(3)$ \AA, $b=12.500(3)$ \AA, $c=8.392(2)$ \AA, $\beta=93.57(4)^\circ$, Z=4). The structure contains infinite chains that run normal to the (101) plane and consist of alternating RuO$_6$ octahedra and square-pyramidal RuO$_5$ units connected via shared O-O edges. Magnetic properties were measured on the bulk powder, showing a diamagnetic baseline from 300 to 60 K with a small Curie tail below 55 K. The magnetic moment, calculated from the 1.8 K isotherm, saturates at $M=4.4\times10^{-3}\,\mu_\mathrm{B}\,\mathrm{Ru}^{-1}$, much less than would be expected for $S=1$ ruthenium. Bond-valence-sum analysis indicates high-valent Ru, and the near-diamagnetic response is consistent with the edge-sharing Ru-Ru motif, where weak direct Ru-Ru overlap yields a local singlet.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Guided Polymorph Selection in Molecular Beam Epitaxy of In2Se3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indium selenide (In2Se3), a layered chalcogenide with multiple polymorphs, is a promising material for optoelectronic and ferroelectric applications. However, achieving polymorph-pure thin films remains a major challenge due to the complex growth space. In this work, Bayesian Optimization (BO) is successfully leveraged to guide the molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth of In2Se3 on Al2O3 substrates. By training a predictive Gaussian Process Regressor with sequential learning, we efficiently explored substrate temperature, indium flux, selenium flux, and cracker temperature, reducing experimental trials required for successful synthesis. A {\gamma}-In2Se3 film with 91% phase purity was achieved after fewer than ten trials. Attempts to isolate {\alpha}-In2Se3 were limited by amorphous film formation at low temperatures, indicating that single-step co-deposition is unsuitable for crystalline {\alpha}-In2Se3 on Al2O3. Overall, this study validates Bayesian Optimization as a powerful approach for phase-selective growth in complex materials systems.</description>

      <title>Beta-AlGaO/Ga2O3 Tri-Gate MOSHEMT with 70GHz fT and 55GHz fmax</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report Beta-AlGaO/Ga2O3 tri-gate heterostructure MOSHEMTs incorporating a thin 5 nm Al2O3 gate oxide layer for improved gate control and reduced leakage. The devices were fabricated on AlGaO/GaO heterostructures grown by ozone MBE on Fe-doped Ga2O3 (010) substrates. The tri-gate MOSHEMTs, with 1 micron-wide fins and Lg=155 nm, exhibit a peak current-gain cut-off frequency fT=70 GHz and a power-gain cut-off frequency fMAX=55 GHz.The fT.L product of 10.85 GHz-micron is the highest among reported Ga2O3 FETs to date. The devices show Vth =-0.5 V, an on/off ratio 10^6 I=80 mA/mm, a peak gm=60 mS/mm, and a low gate leakage current of 10^(-10) mA/mm at Vgs=0.5 V. Passivation with a 100 nm ALD Al2O3 layer effectively removes DC/RF dispersion and maintains stable operation under pulsed IV and repeated RF measurements. These results demonstrate the potential of tri-gate AlGaO/GaO MOSHEMTs for next-generation high-frequency and high-power applications.</description>

      <title>High-Resolution Capacitance Dilatometry of Microscopically Thin Samples Using a Miniature Dilatometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel application of our high-resolution capacitance dilatometer, specifically engineered for the precise characterization of quantum materials. These materials, which often appear as ultrathin, platelet-shaped crystals, are known for exotic phenomena such as superconductivity, topological order and quantum spin liquid. However, these crystals seldom reach macroscopic dimensions, making them unsuitable for conventional dilatometry techniques. By introducing a modified sample-mounting configuration, our design enables high-resolution measurements of thermal expansion and magnetostriction along in-plane crystallographic directions in samples with thicknesses well below 500 $\mu$m. Validation measurements using a Quantum Design PPMS system confirm reliable performance for a 300 $\mu$m-thick silver platelet, relatively hard ferromagnetic EuB$_6$ single crystals down to 50 $\mu$m, and a 40 $\mu$m-thin, soft AgCrS$_2$ single crystal. This advancement significantly broadens the applicability of capacitance dilatometry, providing a powerful platform for investigating emergent phenomena in reduced-dimensional quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Rotating Magnetocaloric Effect in First-order Phase Transition Material Gd5Si2Ge2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rotating magnetocaloric effect (RMCE) induced by self-demagnetization has been investigated in the giant magnetocaloric effect (GMCE) material Gd$_5$Si$_2$Ge$_2$. This shape-dependent effect had thus far only been reported in pure Gd, marking this as the first analysis of the effect in a sample with a magnetostructural first-order phase transition. By rotating the applied magnetic field vector while keeping its intensity constant, the demagnetizing field within a high-aspect ratio sample changes significantly, resulting in a RMCE. We characterize RMCE by determining the adiabatic temperature change ($\Delta T_{ad}^{rot}$) directly through temperature measurements, and the isothermal entropy change ($\Delta S_M^{rot}$) via magnetometry and magnetostatic simulations. We obtain a remarkable maximum $\Delta T_{ad}^{rot}$ of 1.77 K for a constant external field of 0.8 T, higher than that obtained under 1.0 T. The magnetostatic simulations not only corroborate the highly non-monotonous field-dependence of $|\Delta S_{M}^{rot}|$, which reaches 95\% of its maximum value at 0.8 T, 6.12 J K$^{-1}$ kg$^{-1}$ for the experimentally measured shape, but also estimate a 35\% increase in the maximum $|\Delta S_{M}^{rot}|$ up to 8.67 J K$^{-1}$ kg$^{-1}$ in a simulated shape with higher aspect ratio.</description>

Abstract: We explore the U-Ge phase diagram using thin film growth by co-deposition of U and Ge via d.c. magnetron sputtering. Using three different single crystal substrates - MgO, CaF$_2$ and SrTiO$_3$ - we have stabilised mixed phase films of mostly UGe$_3$ and UGe, with evidence of UGe$_2$ as well. At higher temperatures UO$_2$ forms as a consequence of gettering of oxygen from several types of substrate. Several UGe$_3$ dominated samples grown on MgO substrates have also been characterised electrically, showing residual resistivity ratios up to six.</description>

      <title>Colossal low-field negative magnetoresistance in CaAl$_{2}$Si$_{2}$-type diluted magnetic semiconductors (Ba,K)(Cd,Mn)$_{2}$As$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the magnetic and magnetotransport properties of the layered CaAl$_2$Si$_2$-type diluted magnetic semiconductor (Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$)(Cd$_{1-y}$Mn$_y$)$_2$As$_2$ over a broad Mn (spin) substitution range of $0.05 \le y \le 0.5$. K substitution introduces hole carriers, whereas Mn provides local moments, resulting in bulk ferromagnetism with Curie temperatures up to $\sim 17$ K. Intrinsic magnetic ordering is further supported by an anomalous Hall contribution and a specific-heat anomaly near $T_{\mathrm{C}}$. A key performance feature is a colossal negative magnetoresistance: for heavily Mn-doped compositions ($y \ge 0.3$), $\mathrm{MR}=[\rho(H)-\rho(0)]/\rho(0)$ reaches approximately $-100\%$ at 2 K and nearly saturates at a relatively low magnetic field of $\sim 0.35\,\mathrm{T}$. The combination of soft ferromagnetism, strong spin-charge coupling, and low-field MR saturation highlights (Ba,K)(Cd,Mn)$_2$As$_2$ as a promising bulk platform for low-temperature magnetoresistive functionalities.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Negative-U Centers in Freestanding LaAlO3/SrTiO3 Micro-membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The LaAlO3/SrTiO3 (LAO/STO) interface hosts a rich range of electronic phenomena, including unconventional electron pairing that in quantum dots gives rise to a negative effective charging energy U. Here, we show freestanding LAO/STO micro-membranes naturally hosting negative-U centers, where lateral confinement arises intrinsically, rather than from engineered nanostructures. These centers coexist with gate-tunable superconductivity and can remain stable upon thermal cycling from millikelvin temperatures to room temperature. Transport is in excellent agreement with calculations based on a negative-U Anderson model, and electrostatic simulations indicate characteristic center sizes of 20-80 nm. Our findings suggest that negative-U centers may arise from the intrinsic interfacial inhomogeneity typical of LAO/STO, and should therefore be considered a general feature of the LAO/STO interface. This could have important consequences for the microwave response of interfacial superconducting devices.</description>

      <title>Insights into $CO_{2}$ activation on defective ZnS surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate $CO_{2}$ activation on ZnS using Near Ambient-Pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements (NAP-XPS) and density functional theory calculations (DFT). Our NAP-XPS experiments reveal that $CO_{2}$ adsorbs onto a defective ZnS surface upon heating above $473 \ K$ in a $CO_{2}$ atmosphere (up to $0.55 \ mbar$). The $CO_{2}$ adsorption fingerprint is detectable even after cooling to room temperature under ultra-high vacuum. Our DFT calculations suggest that $CO_{2}$ adsorption is energetically favorable on ZnS surfaces containing zinc vacancies, highlighting defect sites as key adsorption centers. Additionally, oxygen adsorption on a defective ZnS surface is exothermic, in contrast to the endothermic behavior observed on a defect-free surface. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of defect-driven surface reactivity and may inform ZnS-based catalyst's design for $CO_{2}$ capture and reutilization.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The center of mass and helicity are two dynamic degrees of freedom of skyrmions. In this work, we study the current-driven skyrmion motion in frustrated altermagnets. Contrary to conventional wisdom, we find that the skyrmion helicity is not locked with the skyrmion Hall angle, but unidirectionally rotates with a global angular velocity proportional to the square of the current density. In addition, we find that the helicity rotation velocity is highly anisotropic, depending on the direction of current flows. We also observe helicity oscillation in the terahertz regimes, where the nonlinear mixing between the fast and slow modes generates a magnon frequency comb. Full atomistic spin dynamics simulations verify our theoretical predictions. Our results establish frustrated altermagnets as a promising platform for skyrmionics, THz technology, and frequency comb.</description>

      <title>CatMaster: An Agentic Autonomous System for Computational Heterogeneous Catalysis Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) is widely used to connect atomic structure with catalytic behavior, but computational heterogeneous catalysis studies often require long workflows that are costly, iterative, and sensitive to setup choices. Besides the intrinsic cost and accuracy limits of first-principles calculations, practical workflow issues such as keeping references consistent, preparing many related inputs, recovering from failed runs on computing clusters, and maintaining a complete record of what was done, can slow down projects and make results difficult to reproduce or extend.
  Here we present CatMaster, a large-language-model (LLM)-driven agent system that turns natural language requests into complete calculation workspaces, including structures, inputs, outputs, logs, and a concise run record. CatMaster maintains a persistent project record of key facts, constraints, and file pointers to support inspection and restartability. It is paired with a multi-fidelity tool library that covers rapid surrogate relaxations and high-fidelity DFT calculations for validation when needed. We demonstrate CatMaster on four demonstrations of increasing complexity: an O2 spin-state check with remote execution, BCC Fe surface energies with a protocol-sensitivity study and CO adsorption site ranking, high-throughput Pt--Ni--Cu alloy screening for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) descriptors with surrogate-to-DFT validation, and a demonstration beyond the predefined tool set, including equation-of-state fitting for BCC Fe and CO-FeN4-graphene single-atom catalyst geometry preparation. By reducing manual scripting and bookkeeping while keeping the full evidence trail, CatMaster aims to help catalysis researchers focus on modeling choices and chemical interpretation rather than workflow management.</description>

Abstract: Hybrid superconductor--semiconductor platforms can host subgap electronic excitations such as Andreev bound states (ABSs); in topological regimes, a special zero-energy class, Majorana bound states (MBSs), can emerge. Here we report the growth of epitaxial Al films by molecular-beam epitaxy on $\mathrm{In_{0.75}Ga_{0.25}As}$ under near-room-temperature substrate conditions. Using a combination of AFM/SEM, cross-sectional TEM, and \emph{in situ} RHEED, we map how substrate temperature and Al deposition rate govern film morphology, continuity, and interface quality. We identify a growth window that yields continuous, superconducting Al films with an abrupt $\mathrm{Al}/\mathrm{In_{0.75}Ga_{0.25}As}$ interface and no detectable indium interdiffusion. We further investigate the thermal stability of these films under \emph{in situ} post-growth heating and \emph{ex situ} annealing following surface oxidation. For unoxidized Al, rapid surface diffusion triggers solid-state dewetting at approximately $165\,^\circ\mathrm{C}$, resulting in the formation of $\{111\}$-faceted Al islands. In contrast, the presence of a native oxide largely suppresses dewetting, with failure occurring only locally at surface defects. Annealing above the indium melting point ($156.6\,^\circ\mathrm{C}$) induces significant In surface migration in both cases, leading either to localized interfacial In inclusions beneath Al agglomerates or to uniform surface contamination at sites of localized layer breakdown. Together, these results define growth and annealing conditions for thermally robust epitaxial Al on III--V semiconductors and provide practical guidance for fabricating high-quality superconductor--semiconductor hybrid platforms for quantum devices.</description>

      <title>GPUTB-2:An efficient E(3) network method for learning high-precision orthogonal Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although equivariant neural networks have become a cornerstone for learning electronic Hamiltonians, the intrinsic non-orthogonality of linear combinations of atomic orbitals (LCAO) basis sets poses a fundamental challenge. The computational cost of Hamiltonian orthogonalization scales as O(N^3), which severely hinders electronic structure calculations for large-scale systems containing hundreds of thousands to millions of atoms. To address this issue, we develop GPUTB-2, a framework that learns implicitly orthogonality-preserving Hamiltonians by training directly on electronic band structures. Benefiting from an E(3)-equivariant network accelerated by Gaunt tensor product and SO(2) tensor product layers, GPUTB-2 achieves significantly higher accuracy than GPUTB across multiple benchmark systems. Moreover, GPUTB-2 accurately predicts large-scale electronic structures, including transport properties of temperature-perturbed SnSe and the band structures of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene. By further integrating this framework with the linear-scaling quantum transport (LSQT) method, we investigate the electronic properties of million-atom amorphous graphene and uncover pressure-induced electronic structure transitions in more complex amorphous silicon. Together, these results establish GPUTB-2 as a high-accuracy and scalable approach for predicting orthogonal Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Scaling of Two-Dimensional Semiconductor Nanoribbons for High-Performance Electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) field-effect transistors (FETs), with their atomically thin bodies, are promising candidates for future gate-all-around (GAA) nanoribbon architectures. While state-of-the-art Si GAA nanoribbon transistors feature channel widths in the tens of nanometers, most reported TMD-based FETs remain limited to micrometer-scale dimensions, limiting their relevance for ultra-scaled electronics. In this work, we investigate the channel width scaling in nanoribbon transistors based on monolayer MoS2 grown on 2-inch wafers, achieving widths of approximately 30-40 nm. Remarkably, nanoribbon width scaling enhances the on-current by 30-40%, reaching up to 700 uA/um for the smallest-width devices, while also improving the subthreshold slope (SS) to as low as 70 mV/dec. This enhancement is attributed to a stronger electric field at the nanoribbon edges without significant degradation from edge-related scattering. To further demonstrate the scalability of the nanoribbon device, we evaluate the variability of extremely scaled monolayer MoS2 nanoribbon transistor arrays featuring a contact pitch of 60 nm and an effective oxide thickness (EOT) of approximately 0.9 nm. Beyond MoS2, we extend the nanoribbon structure to WS2 n-type and WSe2 p-type FETs, demonstrating a viable path toward complementary monolayer TMD nanoribbon FETs for future ultra-scaled electronics.</description>

      <title>Near-atomic investigation on the elemental redistribution during co-precipitation of nano-sized kappa phase and B2 phase in an Al-alloyed lightweight steel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present study, correlative transmission Kikuchi diffraction transmission electron microscopy (TKD-TEM) measurements, atom probe tomography (APT), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations are used to reveal the elemental redistribution during co-precipitation of nanosized kappa and B2 phases in an FCC matrix of an Al alloyed Fe-10Al-7Mn-6Ni-1C (wt.%) steel. Upon ageing at 800 C for 15 min, two co-nanoprecipitation modes are observed: B2 forming together with kappa and B2 forming separately from kappa in the FCC matrix. APT reveals that the B2 precipitate next to kappa (referred to as B2I) is close to an FeAl type phase, while the isolated B2 precipitate (referred to as B2II) is close to a NiAl type phase. The kappa precipitates maintain a nearly constant Al content of approximately 18.4 at.% regardless of their precipitation position. DFT confirms that kappa may accommodate limited Ni substitution at Fe sites without losing structural stability, and that Fe Ni atomic exchange between kappa and B2 is thermodynamically favorable at 800 C. This exchange drives the B2 phase to evolve from a NiAl type towards an FeAl type, improving the stability of both phases during co-precipitation. These results provide understanding of kappa B2 interactions and offer insights for designing nanosized intermetallic strengthened microstructures in Al alloyed lightweight steels.</description>

      <title>Influence of Ru content on electrocatalytic activity and defect formation of Au-Pd-Pt-Ru compositionally complex solid solution thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compositionally complex solid solutions (CCSSs) consist of a randomly mixed single phase with the potential to enhance electrocatalytic activity through their polyelemental surface atom arrangements. However, microstructural complexity originating from multiple principal elements influences local structure, chemistry, and lattice strain, which might also affect electrocatalytic activity. Here, we investigate the effect of Ru content on electrochemistry and defect formation in Au-Pd-Pt-Ru CCSS thin films. Such defects could provide active sites when terminating at the CCSS surface or modify surface composition through preferential segregation. A thin-film material library covering a wide composition range was fabricated by room-temperature combinatorial co-sputtering. High-throughput compositional, structural and functional characterization, including electron microscopy equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and electrochemical screening, were used to correlate composition and microstructural features with catalytic activity. Three representative compositions selected from the library - Au68Pd13Pt15Ru4, Au27Pd24Pt23Ru26, and Au9Pd21Pt18Ru52 - were examined in detail. The three samples exhibit face-centered cubic structures, with lattice contraction occurring with increasing Ru content. In addition, with increasing Ru content, a transition from a high density of nanotwins to high-density, atomic-layer stacking faults was observed. Moreover, the hydrogen evolution reaction activity improves with higher Ru content. Atom probe tomography reveals local compositional fluctuations, including element-specific enrichment and depletion at grain boundaries. The findings provide a new insight into surface atom arrangement design in the CCSS electrocatalysts with enhanced performance.</description>

      <title>Nanoparticle Self-assembly Assisted by Polymers: The Role of Shear Stress in the Nanoparticle Arrangement of Langmuir and Langmuir-Blodgett Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose to use the self-assembly ability of a block copolymer combined with compression-expansion cycles to obtain CdSe quantum dots (QDs) structures of different morphology. The methodology proposed consists in transferring onto mica mixed Langmuir monolayers of QDs and the polymer poly (styrene-co-maleic anhydride) partial 2 buthoxy ethyl ester cumene terminated, PS-MA-BEE, previously sheared by 50 compression-expansion cycles. Results indicate that the shear stress takes out nanoparticles at the air-water interface from metastable states and promoted a new equilibrium state of the Langmuir monolayer, then it was transferred onto mica by the Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) methodology and the morphology of the LB films was analyzed by Atomic Force Microscopy and Transmission Electron Microscopy measurements. Our results show that when the amplitude strain increases the QDs domain size decreases and the LB film becomes more ordered. The dynamic of the monolayer relaxation after cycling involves at least three timescales which are related to the damping of surface fluctuation, raft rearrangement and component movements inside each raft. Brewster Angle Microscopy allowed visualizing in situ the raft rearrangement at the air-water interface.</description>

      <title>Janus MoSSe/WSSe Heterobilayers as Selective Photocatalysts for Water Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying materials that simultaneously straddle the water redox potentials and possess an intrinsic electric field is crucial for achieving high solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency. Using state-of-the-art first-principles calculations, including a range-separated hybrid functional and spin-orbit coupling, we investigate MoXY/WXY (X, Y = S, Se) Janus bilayers for overall water splitting. We find that the Se-Se interfaced heterobilayer is intrinsically capable of driving water splitting, while its S-S counterpart can meet the redox requirements through pH modulation. For both configurations, a remarkable STH efficiency of 17.1\% is predicted. Compared with homo-bilayers, hetero-bilayers benefit from the chemical potential difference between Mo and W, which generates a built-in electric field and promotes spatial separation of photogenerated carriers, suppressing recombination and overall enhancing hydrogen production. These results demonstrate the promise of Janus heterobilayers for efficient solar-driven water splitting.</description>

      <title>Determinants of Self-Interstitial Energetics in Refractory High-Entropy Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-interstitials play a central role in governing the mechanical and anti-irradiation properties of refractory high-entropy alloys (RHEAs), however, the prediction of interstitial formation energies (Ef) is formidable due to the chemically complex environments in RHEAs. Herein, we develop a framework based on the tight-binding model to quantify the effects of complex alloying and lattice distortion on Ef. Our scheme reveals that Ef is jointly determined by the average d-band center of RHEAs and the d-band width of interstitial sites. Notably, the d-band width mainly depends on the interatomic hopping matrix and atomic size-determined coordination number, which together make the metallic bonding around interstitials in RHEAs resemble the distance-dependence law of van der Waals forces. By capturing d-band coupling character, our descriptor describes both interstitial configurations within a universal framework. Our model reveals a new physical picture of interstitial formation, providing a useful tool for the design of high-performance RHEAs.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Multiband Microscopy: A Universal Paradigm for Quantitative Nanoscale Metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM) is the primary tool for exploring nanoscale functionality, yet standard single-frequency operation is fundamentally limited, because the dynamic tip-sample interaction is mathematically underdetermined. While advanced methods such as Dual Amplitude Resonance Tracking (DART) and Band Excitation (BE) address this by tracking resonance, they face critical limitations: DART suffers from feedback instability on complex topographies, while Band Excitation is constrained by severe trade-offs between spectral resolution and acquisition speed. Here, we introduce Dynamic Multiband Microscopy (DMM), a general framework that bridges these gaps by combining multifrequency excitation with continuous frequency sweeping. We implement this within an automated experimental workflow that autonomously identifies and targets measurement points of interest. In combination with quantitative interferometric detection, this approach brings SPM to the fundamental limits of noise and spectral sensitivity. Validated on ferroelectric nanofibers, this platform enables simultaneous, crosstalk-free 3D polarization mapping, establishing a universal framework for autonomous, high-fidelity nanoscale metrology.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum geometric tensor (QGT), whose real and imaginary parts define the quantum metric and Berry curvature, encodes the intrinsic geometry of quantum states. While electronic QGT has been directly observed and linked to various phenomena like electron-phonon coupling, its bosonic analogue remains both theoretically and experimentally unexplored. We demonstrate that the dynamical structure factor directly encodes the full QGT throughout the Brillouin zone, establishing it as a sensitive probe of both quantum metric and Berry curvature. Applying this framework, we uncover clear geometric signatures in a twofold quadruple Weyl phonon in BaPtGe and the node-line magnon in Gd. Our results establish a general, direct route to measuring quantum geometry in bosonic systems, a crucial step toward elucidating its impact on condensed matter phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grain growth in polycrystals typically stagnates at long times. We identify disconnection climb, limited by vacancy diffusion, as a fundamental microscopic mechanism underlying this behavior. Using a phase-field crystal framework extended to model vacancy diffusion, we resolve grain-boundary migration on diffusive time scales and show that disconnection climb rates correlate with the characteristic grain size at which growth arrests. These results link vacancy transport, disconnection dynamics, and microstructural evolution, establishing vacancy diffusion as a key governing factor.</description>

      <title>Correlated domain and crystallographic orientation mapping in uniaxial ferroelectric polycrystals by interferometric vector piezoresponse force microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ongoing advances in scanning probe microscopy techniques are continually expanding the possibilities for nanoscale characterization and correlated studies of functional materials. Here, we demonstrate how a recent extension of piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM), known as interferometric vector PFM, can be utilized for simultaneously mapping the local crystallographic orientations and the domain structure of distributed grains in uniaxial ferroelectric polycrystals. By shifting the laser beam position on the cantilever, direction-dependent piezoresponse signals are acquired analogous to classical vector PFM, but without the need to rotate the sample. Using polycrystalline ErMnO$_{3}$ as a model system, we demonstrate that the reconstructed piezoresponse vectors correlate one-to-one with the crystallographic orientations of the micrometer-sized grains, carrying grain-orientation and domain-related information. We establish a versatile approach for rapid, multimodal characterization of polycrystalline uniaxial ferroelectrics, enabling automated, high-throughput reconstruction of polarization and grain orientations with nanoscale precision.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new approach for determining the binding energies of charged particles, such as ions and electrons, on dielectric surfaces in cryogenic liquids is introduced. The experimental technique outlined in this paper is employed to observe the buildup of charged particles on nonconductive surfaces using the electro-optic Kerr effect. The initial results of binding energy measurements on surfaces of deuterated tetraphenyl butadiene (dTPB)-coated and uncoated polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) in liquid nitrogen are presented. Under these conditions, the ions or electrons displayed binding energies of less than 1 meV. Although these findings were obtained in liquid nitrogen, the methodology is not limited to cryogenic liquids and is applicable to a wide variety of fluids, with no essential dependence on temperature.</description>

      <title>Gilbert Damping Parameters of Epitaxially-Stabilized Iron Gallium Thin Films from Ferromagnetic Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Iron gallium (FeGa) alloys are excellent rare-earth-free magnetostrictors. Through epitaxial stabilization, the disordered A2 alloy can be extended from 19% to 30% gallium resulting in a magnetostrictive coefficient almost twice than that which is seen in rare earth magnetostrictors like SmFe2. In a composite magnetoelectric structure, this makes epitaxially-stabilized iron gallium a key material for energy-efficient beyond CMOS technologies. The energy dissipation and speed of magnetoelectric switching, however, is affected by the magnetic resonance frequency and damping. Here we report the evolution of the ferromagnetic resonance and key materials parameters (magnetic anisotropy, magnetic damping, and magnetostriction coefficient) for 70 nm thick epitaxially-stabilized single crystal A2 FeGa films beyond 19% Ga. Using flip chip ferromagnetic resonance (1-14 GHz), we find that the Gilbert damping parameter spans the range of 0.09-0.16 and decreases as the Ga concentration increases. This correlates an increasing magnetoelastic coupling with a reduction in the Gilbert damping. We find that the effective damping is a mix of contributions from the intrinsic magnon-phonon scattering and other scattering/dissipation mechanisms, with the latter being dominant especially at high Ga composition. Our results provide insight into the mechanism of magnetic relaxation in metastable high magnetostriction materials and potential switching behavior of composite magnetoelectrics.</description>

      <title>Resolving Overlapping EBSD Patterns by Experiment -- Simulation Residuals Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the technique of Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD), the accurate detection and identification of different phases existing in a sample is often limited by overlapping Kikuchi diffraction patterns originating from the extended probing volume of the individual EBSD map points measured in the scanning electron microscope (SEM). We present an iterative approach that uses simulated Kikuchi patterns to resolve several overlapping diffraction signals. For each measured EBSD pattern, our method first identifies the best-fit simulated Kikuchi pattern using dynamic template matching. This simulated, ideal reference pattern is then further processed to optimally match the experimental image, uncovering any underlying weaker signals after subtraction. Repeatedly utilizing dynamic template matching and pattern subtraction on residual signals of subsequent steps enables the identification of minor phases that might otherwise be missed from the probing volume of the EBSD map point. This method significantly improves phase detection in complex materials, addressing a key limitation of conventional EBSD analysis that conventionally assigns a single phase to each map point. The present method does not require a known orientation relationship between the phases of the overlapping patterns or close neighbor experimental patterns like previously published approaches.</description>

      <title>Faster grain-boundary diffusion with a higher activation enthalpy than bulk diffusion in ionic space-charge layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Faster diffusion of cations along grain boundaries is reported in the literature for a variety of acceptor-doped $AB\mathrm{O}_{3}$ perovskite-type oxides. The ratio $r$ of the activation enthalpy of grain-boundary diffusion ($\Delta H^\mathrm{gb}$) to the activation enthalpy of bulk diffusion ($\Delta H^\mathrm{b}$) is seen experimentally to lie in the range $0.7 &lt; r = \Delta H^\mathrm{gb} / \Delta H^\mathrm{b} &lt; 1.3$, albeit with substantial errors. In a previous publication [Parras and De Souza, Acta Mater. 195 (2020) 383] it was shown through a set of continuum simulations that cation-vacancy accumulation within negative space-charge layers at grain boundaries in acceptor-doped perovskites will give rise to faster grain-boundary diffusion of cations, with the associated values of $r$ approaching but not exceeding unity. In the present study, we demonstrate by means of continuum simulations that under certain conditions $r &gt; 1$ is achievable for faster cation diffusion along grain boundaries in an acceptor-doped perovskite ceramic. Diffusion profiles for a two-dimensional bicrystal geometry are obtained by solving, first, Poisson's equation, and subsequently, the diffusion equation. The specific case we consider is cation migration occurring by two related mechanisms, by isolated cation vacancies and by defect associates of cation and anion vacancies; the electric potential within the space-charge layers shifts the association equilibrium so that associate diffusion dominates in the bulk whereas isolated vacancy diffusion dominates within the space-charge layers. The conditions under which $r &gt; 1$ is observed are described, and issues with experimental confirmation are discussed.</description>

      <title>Machine learning model for predicting surface wettability in laser-textured metal alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface wettability, governed by both topography and chemistry, plays a critical role in applications such as heat transfer, lubrication, microfluidics, and surface coatings. In this study, we present a machine learning (ML) framework capable of accurately predicting the wettability of laser-textured metal alloys using experimentally derived morphological and chemical features. Superhydrophilic and superhydrophobic surfaces were fabricated on AA6061 and AISI 4130 alloys via nanosecond laser texturing followed by chemical immersion treatments. Surface morphology was quantified using the Laws texture energy method and profilometry, while surface chemistry was characterized through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), extracting features such as functional group polarity, molecular volume, and peak area fraction. These features were used to train an ensemble neural network model incorporating residual connections, batch normalization, and dropout regularization. The model achieved high predictive accuracy (R2 = 0.942, RMSE = 13.896), outperforming previous approaches. Feature importance analysis revealed that surface chemistry had the strongest influence on contact angle prediction, with topographical features also contributing significantly. This work demonstrates the potential of artificial intelligence to model and predict wetting behavior by capturing the complex interplay of surface characteristics, offering a data-driven pathway for designing tailored functional surfaces.</description>

      <title>Universal wrinkling dynamics of a sheet on viscous liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the wrinkling dynamics of a thin elastic sheet that is indented or compressed while floating on a viscous liquid. We show that the deformation speed controls the dynamics, leading to a wrinkle wavelength significantly smaller than that selected under quasistatic compression. Once active compression ceases, the wrinkles coarsen until their wavelength relaxes toward the equilibrium value. We develop a theoretical model coupling Stokes flow in the liquid to elastic bending of the sheet, which quantitatively predicts both the initial wavelength selection and its subsequent coarsening. We demonstrate that the same mechanism governs two dimensional and axisymmetric geometries, thereby extending classical static wavelength selection laws to dynamic situations. Although developed from controlled laboratory experiments, the model captures a generic viscous-elastic coupling and applies broadly to thin elastic films interacting with viscous environments, including the formation of surface wrinkles in pahoehoe lava flows.</description>

Abstract: In a recent letter [T. D. K\"uhne, M. Krack, F. Mohamed and M. Parrinello, Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 066401 (2007)], we outlined a new Car-Parrinello-like approach to Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics. Here, we provide a guide to performing actual calculations using our method and demonstrate this on liquid water at ambient conditions. We do not go into methodological details beyond those necessary for applying this approach, but focus on practical details pertinent to our particular implementation within the CP2K/Quickstep code [T. D. K\"uhne et al., J. Chem. Phys. 152, 194103 (2020)].</description>

      <title>Stabilizing van der Waals NbOI2 by SiO2 encapsulation for Photonic Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Niobium oxide diiodide (NbOI2) is an emerging material for photonics and electronics, distinguished by its exceptional second-order nonlinearity and pronounced in-plane ferroelectricity, both originating from its highly anisotropic ABC-stacked crystal structure. Its broken inversion symmetry enables its optical nonlinear efficiency to scale with thickness, making multilayer NbOI2 highly promising for nonlinear frequency conversion like second harmonic generation or and spontaneous parametric down-conversion in bulk or waveguides. However, under ambient conditions NbOI2 degrades into an amorphous oxide within weeks, severely diminishing its nonlinear response. To overcome this, we investigate SiO2 encapsulation via physical vapor deposition to protect NbOI2 multilayers from environmental degradation. Our systematic study reveals that encapsulation preserves structural integrity and nonlinear optical performance, establishing NbOI2 as a stable candidate for heterogeneous integration in foundry-compatible photonic platforms and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Giant Damping-like Spin-Torque Conductivity in a GeTe/Py van der Waals Heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations of large unconventional spin-orbit torques in van der Waals (vdW) materials are driving intense interest for energy-efficient spintronic applications. A key limitation of ferromagnet (FM)/vdW heterostructures is their lower value of damping-like torque conductivity ($\sigma{\rm_{DL}^{y}}$) compared to the conventional heavy metal-based systems, limiting their prospects for commercial spintronic devices. Here, we report both a giant $\sigma{\rm_{DL}^{y}}$ of $-(1.25 \pm 0.11)\times 10^{5}~\hbar/ 2e~\Omega^{-1}$m$^{-1}$ and an unconventional spin-orbit torque in a heterostructure comprising an FM (Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$) and the vdW material GeTe. The value of $\sigma{\rm_{DL}^{y}}$ represents the highest reported torque conductivity for any FM/vdW interface and is comparable to benchmark heavy metal heterostructures. First-principles calculations reveal that this substantial torque originates from the cooperative interplay of the spin Hall effect, orbital Hall effect, and orbital Rashba effect, assisted by interfacial charge transfer. These findings demonstrate the potential of carefully engineered vdW heterostructures to achieve highly efficient electrical manipulation of magnetization at room temperature, paving the way for next-generation low-power spintronic devices.</description>

Abstract: We report a comprehensive study of the electronic structure of CeCoGe$_3$ throughout the entire Brillouin zone in the non-magnetic regime using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). The electronic structure agrees in large part with first principles calculations, including predicted topological nodal lines. Two new features in the band structure are also observed: a surface state and folded bands, the latter which is argued to originate from a unit cell reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Reorienting off-path Nudged Elastic Bands (RONEB) via Minimum Mode Following</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate determination of transition states remains central to understanding reaction kinetics. Double-ended methods like the Nudged Elastic Band (NEB) ensure relevant transition states and paths, but incur high computational costs and suffer stagnation on flat or rough potential energy surfaces. Conversely, single-ended eigenmode-following techniques offer efficiency but cannot often be constrained between specific states. Here, we present the Reorienting Off-path Nudged Elastic Bands (RONEB), an adaptive hybrid algorithm that integrates the double ended nature of the NEB with the acceleration of single ended Min-Mode Following methods. RONEB provides stability based on the history of the path optimization, relative force triggering, and an alignment-based back-off penalty to dynamically decouple the climbing image from the elastic band constraints. We benchmark the method against the standard Climbing Image NEB (CI-NEB) across the Baker-Chan transition state test set using the PET-MAD machine-learned potential and the OptBench Pt(111) heptamer island surface diffusion set. A Bayesian analysis of the performance data quantifies a median reduction in gradient calls of 46.3% [95% CrI: -54.7%, -36.9%] relative to the baseline, while surface diffusion tests reveal a 28% reduction across 59 metallic rearrangement mechanisms. These results establish RONEB as a highly effective tool for high-throughput automated chemical discovery.</description>

      <title>Purely equatorial lasing in spherical liquid crystal polymer microlasers with engineered refractive index gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Liquid crystal whispering gallery mode microlasers show high sensitivity to external stimuli and distinct spectral features, rendering them ideally suited for various sensing applications. They also offer intrinsic anisotropic optical properties, which can be used to shape and manipulate light even inside spatially highly symmetric structures. Here, we report the synthesis and detailed optical characterization of a spherical bipolar liquid crystal polymer microlaser that tightly confines the optical path of whispering gallery modes to the equatorial plane. By controlled anchoring of the liquid crystal mesogens followed by polymerization, a fixed refractive index gradient is formed within the spherical microcavity. Consequently, only transverse electric (TE) modes oscillating in the equatorial plane experience the high extraordinary refractive index, allowing to confine lasing into a single plane. Furthermore, we observe that the refractive index gradient causes a characteristic splitting of the TE modes. By combining hyperspectral imaging and analytical modeling, we demonstrate that the observed splitting is caused by lifting of the energy degeneracy of higher order azimuthal laser modes, enabling direct insights into the complex interplay of refractive index gradients and resulting whispering gallery mode confinement. In addition, the unique ability to confine lasing of a spherical microbead into only a single plane makes these microlasers independent of the exact position of the pump beam, which allows consistent localized sensing especially in combination with fast point scanning microscopes or inside highly dynamic biological environments.</description>

      <title>Development of next-generation light-weight ternary Mg--Al--Li alloys for beampipe applications in particle accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The current study reports the design of advanced light-weight materials for high-energy accelerator beampipe applications. The objective is to optimize the combined requirements of high radiation length and stiffness properties of the designed materials. The present study targets conventional beampipe materials such as aluminum, titanium, and stainless steel as primary performance benchmarks. These conventional beampipes are used at synchrotron radiation sources, such as Indus-1 and Indus-2 in India, the Nuclotron-based Ion Collider Facility in Russia, and the ring synchrotron facility SIS 100/300 at the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research in Germany. In this context, a series of ternary Mg--Al--Li alloys is systematically investigated to enhance the figure of merit. Two aluminum--rich alloys, A1 ($\mathrm{Al_{61.5}Li_{10.8}Mg_{27.7}}$) and A2 ($\mathrm{Al_{66}Li_{19.4}Mg_{14.6}}$), along with three magnesium-rich alloys, M1 ($\mathrm{Al_{23.9}Li_{29.3}Mg_{46.8}}$), M2 ($\mathrm{Al_{19}Li_{20.6}Mg_{60.4}}$), and M3 ($\mathrm{Al_{39.8}Li_{20.1}Mg_{40.1}}$) are explored. Thermodynamic stability, density, liquidus temperature, and phases are evaluated using Latin hypercube sampling within the Thermo-Calc TC-Python framework. Elastic properties are obtained from density functional theory calculations performed using the Vienna \textit{Ab Initio} Simulation Package. Our results show that, although the elastic moduli ($E$) of the investigated Mg-Al-Li alloys are comparable to those of conventional beampipe materials, their significantly higher radiation lengths ($X_0$) lead to an overall improvement in the figure of merit $X_0 E^{1/3}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pyvale is an open-source software package that aims to become an all-in-one tool for sensor simulation, sensor uncertainty quantification, sensor placement optimization, and calibration/validation. Central to this is support for image-based sensors, with a dedicated Digital Image Correlation (DIC) module designed for both standalone use and integration within broader experimental design workflows. The design philosophy behind the DIC engine in Pyvale prioritizes a user-friendly Python interface with performant compiled code under the hood. This paper covers Pyvale's 2D DIC engine design, implementation, metrological performance compared to other DIC codes, and the unique ability to handle gigapixel size scanning electron microscope (SEM) images. Finally, we compare runtimes between Pyvale and other open-source DIC codes and show strong computational performance across a range of image resolutions and thread counts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a multiscale modeling approach that integrates molecular dynamics simulations, machine learning, and the Elastically Collective Nonlinear Langevin Equation (ECNLE) theory to investigate the glass transition dynamics of polymer systems. The glass transition temperatures (Tg) of four representative polymers are estimated using simulations and machine learning model trained on experimental datasets. These predicted Tg values are used as inputs to the ECNLE theory to compute the temperature dependence of structural relaxation times and diffusion coefficients, and the dynamic fragility. The Tg values predicted from simulations show good quantitative agreement with experimental data. While machine learning tends to slightly overestimate Tg, the resulting dynamic fragility values remain close to experimental fragilities. Overall, ECNLE calculations using these inputs agree well with broadband dielectric spectroscopy results. Our integrated approach provides a practical and scalable tool for predicting the dynamic behavior of polymers, particularly in systems where experimental data are limited.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laser hardening of metals occurs under the influence of a shock wave, which changes the distribution and density of one-dimensional defects - dislocations. There is a relationship between the density of dislocations, the grain size and the resistance of a single crystal to shear loading. The mechanism of hardening processes continues to be intensively studied, and the dynamics of defects plays a central role here. In this paper, the dislocation entropy is analyzed from a combinatorial point of view and from the point of view of a physical oscillator with a given energy reserve. Both contributions play an important role in describing the free energy of a one-dimensional ensemble of dislocations, and are necessary to take into account the dynamic processes inside the grain of a polycrystalline structure.

The bulk band structure hosts Weyl nodes with higher and conventional chiralities ($\chi = \pm 2$ and $\chi = \pm 1$) located at high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone. Through analytical evaluation of the Berry curvature, we identify the positions and chiralities of these Weyl nodes. Furthermore, slab calculations for the (001) surface reveal Fermi arcs that connect Weyl nodes of opposite chirality, including those linking $\chi = \pm 2$ nodes with pairs of $\chi = \mp 1$ nodes. These results demonstrate that the $K_4$ crystal is a spinless Weyl semimetal featuring topologically protected surface states originating from multiple types of Weyl nodes.</description>

      <title>Weakly anisotropic superconductivity of Pr4Ni3O10 single crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the discovery of high-temperature superconductivity, studying the upper critical field and its anisotropy has been crucial for understanding superconducting mechanism and guiding applications. Here we perform in situ high-pressure angular-dependent electrical transport measurements on Pr4Ni3O10 single crystals using a custom diamond anvil cell (DAC) rotator and confirming its anisotropic superconductivity. The anisotropy parameter is approximately 1.6, decreasing with increasing temperature and approaches 1 near Tc. Comparing effective mass anisotropy and inter-block distance in cuprates and iron-based superconductors (FeSCs) reveals that Pr4Ni3O10 single crystals superconductors are consistent with a two-band model, where intralayer quantum confinement within the unit cell induces interlayer coherence, thereby leading to three-dimensional (3D) superconductivity. This study not only establishes the existence of anisotropic superconductivity in bulk Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates, but also provide critical insight into the role of dimensionality in high-temperature superconductivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in pressurized Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates stimulated intense research into their correlated electron physics. Establishing the diversity of ground states across different Ruddlesden-Popper phases is crucial for elucidating the superconducting mechanisms in these nickelates. Motivated by the recent report of superconductivity in hybrid 1212-type La5Ni3O11, we synthesized and investigated the long-range-ordered hybrid 1313-type La3Ni2O7. In contrast to its bilayer counterpart, the 1313-type La3Ni2O7 exhibits characteristic semiconducting behavior at ambient pressure, displaying a distinct anomaly at 170 K. This behavior is consistently evidenced by measurements of both magnetic susceptibility and specific heat. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy unambiguously indicates a spin-density-wave transition occurring at 170 K. High-pressure electrical transport measurements demonstrate the induction of metallization under pressure, yet reveal no discernible traces of superconductivity up to 65 GPa. Our findings establish hybrid 1313-type La3Ni2O7 as a new member of the Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate family exhibiting a distinct spin-density-wave transition, and offers a new platform for investigating the interplay among crystal structure, electronic orders, and superconductivity in hybrid nickelates.</description>

      <title>Improving the electrical conductivity of Pt nanowires deposited by focused electron beam induced deposition using thermal annealing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated the electrical conductivity of platinum nanowires with heights ranging from 2 nm to 200 nm, deposited by focused electron beam induced deposition (FEBID). Post-deposition processing was employed to enhance the electrical conductivity of the platinum nanowires. Thermal annealing of as-deposited nanowires in air at 225$^{\circ}$C for 4 hours increased electrical conductance by up to five orders of magnitude. After annealing, 22.5 $\mathrm{\mu m}$-long nanowires with a height of 36 nm exhibited resistances of approximately 10 k$\Omega$. This nanowire underwent a reduction in height to one-quarter of its original value, a reduction in width to one half, and a reduction in cross-sectional area by approximately one order of magnitude. The platinum-to-carbon weight ratio increased from 35:65 to 85:15. The electrical resistance decreased monotonically as temperature was lowered from room temperature to 100 mK, confirming that annealed FEBID platinum nanowires are promising building blocks for nanoelectronic devices operating at millikelvin temperatures.</description>

      <title>Strongly Quenched Kramers Doublet Magnetism in SmMgAl11O19</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report magnetic susceptibility, isothermal magnetization, and specific-heat measurements on the rare-earth hexaaluminate SmMgAl$_{11}$O$_{19}$, where Sm$^{3+}$ realizes a strongly quenched Kramers doublet on a triangular lattice with an exceptionally weak net exchange scale. The Curie--Weiss analysis yields strongly reduced ground-doublet $g$ factors, $g_{ab}\simeq 0.65$ and $g_{c}\simeq 0.70$.
  This indicates that the low-temperature response is governed primarily by single-ion physics, with crystal-field splitting and $J$-multiplet mixing jointly renormalizing the Sm$^{3+}$ moment, rather than collective exchange. For $H \parallel c$, the specific heat shows no $\lambda$-type anomaly down to 0.35~K but evolves into a well-defined two-level Schottky peak whose gap grows linearly with field, yielding $g_c\simeq0.62$ and recovering nearly all of $R\ln2$ at high fields, thereby confirming an effective $S_{\mathrm{eff}}=\tfrac12$ Kramers doublet description for $T\lesssim10$~K.
  Together, these results establish SmMgAl$_{11}$O$_{19}$ as a weak-exchange, nearly single-ion triangular Kramers magnet in which frustration produce an anisotropic low-field correlated regime without inducing long-range order.</description>

      <title>Classical transport theory for the planar Hall effect with threefold symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the planar Hall effect (PHE) has become a key probe of Berry curvature and the anomalous Hall effect (AHE). Threefold-symmetric signals under in-plane fields are often attributed to such quantum mechanisms. Here, we establish a purely classical origin for a three-fold-symmetric PHE. The idea is simple yet decisive: a third-order expansion of the Boltzmann equation in the magnetic field reveals that the threefold component originates from the relative positions of the mirror planes in the crystals with respect to the measurement setups. Remarkably, the threefold contribution should be ubiquitous because this symmetry condition can be realized across a broad range of crystals. Numerical estimates based on concrete models further show that its amplitude is comparable to that expected from the AHE.</description>

      <title>When electrons meet ferroelastic domain walls in Strontium Titanate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strontium titanate (SrTiO$_3$), famously described by Nobel laureate K. A. M\"uller as the "drosophila of solid-state physics", has been extensively investigated over the last seventy five years for its intricate coupling of structural, electronic, and dielectric properties and continues to serve as a foundational platform for advancing oxide electronics. In its pristine form, SrTiO$_3$ exhibits quantum paraelectric behavior below 35 K and undergoes an antiferrodistortive phase transition near 105 K. This transition generates ferroelastic twin domains separated by a dense network of domain walls, which function as nanoscale structural defects with far-reaching consequences. While the static influence of ferroelastic domain walls on carrier transport in electron-doped SrTiO$_3$ is well established, recent experimental results show that the emergence of polarity at these walls, combined with strain fields and inherent quantum fluctuations, induces correlated dynamical phenomena such as glass-like relaxations of electrons and memory effects. In this review, we highlight these recent advances, focusing on the subtle interplay between the emergence of nanoscale polar order, quantum fluctuations, and long-range strain fields. We propose that understanding charge carrier dynamics in the background of these complex ferroelastic domain wall landscapes offers a new paradigm for exploring electronic transport in the presence of local polar order and quantum fluctuations, with broad implications for correlated oxides.</description>

      <title>Large magneto-optical Kerr effect induced by collinear antiferromagnetic order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In modern technology, the optical readout of magnetic information is conventionally achieved by the magneto-optical Kerr effect, i.e., the polarization rotation of reflected light. The Kerr rotation is sensitive to time-reversal symmetry breaking and generally proportional to magnetization, enabling optical readout of the up and down spin states in ferromagnets. By contrast, antiferromagnets with a collinear antiparallel spin arrangement have long been considered inactive to such magneto-optical responses, because of Tt-symmetry (time-reversal T followed by translation t symmetry) and lack of macroscopic magnetization. Here, we report the observation of giant magneto-optical Kerr effect in a room-temperature antiferromagnetic insulator alpha-Fe2O3. In this compound, the up-down and down-up spin states induce the opposite sign of spontaneous Kerr effect, whose Kerr rotation angle turned out to be exceptionally large (~ 80 mdeg, comparable to typical ferromagnets). Our first-principles calculations successfully reproduce both the absolute magnitude and spectral shape of the Kerr rotation and ellipticity with remarkable accuracy, which unambiguously proves that it originates from a Tt-symmetry-broken collinear antiferromagnetic order, rather than magnetization. This compound hosts temperature-dependent transition between easy-plane and easy-axis antiferromagnetic states, and their contrasting behaviors are also investigated in detail. The present results demonstrate that even a simple collinear antiferromagnetic order can induce a giant magneto-optical Kerr effect, and highlight Tt-symmetry-broken antiferromagnets as a promising material platform for highly sensitive optical detection of up-down and down-up spin states.</description>

      <title>Interpretable, Physics-Informed Learning Reveals Sulfur Adsorption and Poisoning Mechanisms in 13-Atom Icosahedra Nanoclusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transition-metal nanoclusters exhibit structural and electronic properties that depend on their size, often making them superior to bulk materials for heterogeneous catalysis. However, their performance can be limited by sulfur poisoning. Here, we use dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT) and physics-informed machine learning to map how atomic sulfur adsorbs and causes poisoning on 13-atom icosahedral clusters from 30 different transition metals (3$d$ to 5$d$). We measure which sites sulfur prefers to adsorb to, the thermodynamics and energy breakdown, changes in structure, such as bond lengths and coordination, and electronic properties, such as $\varepsilon_d$, the HOMO-LUMO gap, and charge transfer. Vibrational analysis reveals true energy minima and provides ZPE-based descriptors that reflect the lattice stiffening upon sulfur adsorption. For most metals, the metal-sulfur interaction mainly determines adsorption energy. At the same time, distortion penalties are usually moderate but can be significant for a few metals, suggesting these are more likely to restructure when sulfur is adsorbed. Using unsupervised \textit{k}-means clustering, we identify periodic trends and group metals based on their adsorption responses. Supervised regression models with leave-one-feature-out analysis identify the descriptors that best predict adsorption for new samples. Our results highlight the isoelectronic triad \ce{Ti}, \ce{Zr}, and \ce{Hf} as a balanced group that combines strong sulfur binding with minimal structural change. Additional DFT calculations for \ce{SO2} adsorption reveal strong binding and a clear tendency toward dissociation on these clusters, linking electronic states, lattice response, and poisoning strength. These findings offer data-driven guidelines for designing sulfur-tolerant nanocatalysts at the subnanometer scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contact electrification give rise to charge accumulation at the interface when two materials are brought into contact with each other. The charge accumulation at the interface will diffuse to the interior of the conducting material if the dimensions of the contacting conducting material is of the order of an unknown critical length scale. This contact electrification induced interlayer charge transfer will modify the fundamental physical properties of both the contacting materials. This review first discusses the reported experimental evidence of flexoelectricity induced contact electrification and interlayer charge transfer in conducting thin film based heterostructures. The interlayer charge transfer creates a gradient of charge carrier in both the thin films constituting the heterostructure and also modifies the electron-electron interactions. Further, the interlayer charge transfer changes the electron-phonon coupling, spin-phonon coupling and magnetoelectronic coupling that give rise to new physical behavior, which did not exist prior to the interlayer charge transfer. The new physical behaviors from interlayer charge transfer and their mechanistic origins are reanalyzed and discussed, which include spin-Hall effect of charge carriers, topological Hall effect of magnetoelectronic electromagnon, inhomogeneous magnetoelectronic multiferroic effect, flexoelectronic proximity effect and topological spin texture. This review article presents a unified picture of current status and future directions that will provide the scientists a stepping stone for research in the field of flexoelectricity mediated contact electrification and interlayer charge transfer mediated behavior in the micro/nanoscale heterostructures of the conducting materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulator is uniquely characterized by the topological Chern number C. Controlling the Chern number is a key step toward functional topological electronics and enables access to exotic quantum phases beyond the traditional quantum Hall physics. Here, we report a series of QAH insulators in twisted rhombohedral graphene family, in which the Chern number can be tuned through layer configuration, in-situ electrostatic doping, and displacement field. Specifically, in twisted monolayer-rhombohedral N-layer graphene, denoted as (1+N) L, we observe QAH states with C=N at moire filling v=1, where N=3,4,5 represents the layer number of rhombohedral graphene. These results are experimentally confirmed by quantized Hall resistance and the Streda formula. In twisted monolayer-trilayer graphene, we also observe states with |C|=3 at v=3, whose sign can be switched by either electrostatic doping or displacement field. Furthermore, in twisted Bernal bilayer-rhombohedral tetralayer graphene denoted as (2+4) L, we demonstrate a displacement-field-driven topological phase transition between two distinct QAH states with C=3 and C=4 at v=1. Our work establishes twisted rhombohedral graphene as a highly versatile, layer-engineered platform for designing and dynamically controlling high-Chern-number topological matters.</description>

      <title>Efficient charge transfer in solution-processed PbS Quantum Dot-reduced graphene oxide hybrid materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum dot - graphene hybrid materials have raised significant interest due to the unique synergy of the optical properties of colloidal quantum dots (QDs) and the transport properties of graphene. This stimulated the development of low-cost and up-scalable solution-processed strategies for hybrid materials with potential application in light harvesting and opto-electronic devices. Here we report a versatile covalent-linking based approach for the functionalization of reduced graphene oxide (rGO), to prepare a variety of QD-rGO hybrid dispersions with QDs of different size and composition (PbS, PbS/CdS and CdSe QDs), and shape (CdSe/CdS dot-in-rods). We achieved a well-controlled QD coverage of the rGO sheets by functionalizing the rGO surface with mercapto-silane linkers. A further spectroscopic investigation of near-infrared PbS QD-rGO materials demonstrates efficient electronic coupling between both materials. The QD photoluminescence emission quenching and exciton lifetime shortening up to 95%, together with subtle graphene Raman G-band shifts upon QD linking, supports electron transfer as the dominant relaxation pathway from the QD to the rGO. The use of core/shell PbS/CdS QDs allows tuning of the transfer efficiency from 94% for a 0.2 nm thin CdS shell, down to 30% for a 1.1 nm thick shell.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of altermagnetism, the collinear magnetic phase characterized by momentum-dependent spin-split bands but zero net magnetization, has fundamentally reshaped the classification of magnetic order. We propose an altermagnetic (AM) order in a repulsive Hubbard model on the Lieb-$5$ lattice. Considering only nearest-neighbor hoppings within the lattice, we show a phase transition from the nonmagnetic to a unique AM isolated band metal phase (AMIM), allowing clear identification of spin-split states. Additionally, the AM metallic phase (AMM) is also shown to appear as an intermediate phase during the transition from the normal metal to the AMIM in the presence of the diagonal hopping within each unit cell of the Lieb-$5$ lattice. The manifestation of distinct AM phases and the phase transitions, driven by Hubbard interaction and hopping integrals, have been explored in terms of spin-resolved band structure, spectral function, and the behavior of the AM order parameter. The stability of these AM phases against the spin-orbit coupling and temperature is also established.</description>

      <title>Non-linear anomalous Edelstein response at altermagnetic interfaces</title>

Abstract: In altermagnets, time-reversal symmetry breaking spin-polarizes electronic states, while total magnetization remains zero. In addition, at altermagnetic surfaces Rashba-spin orbit coupling is activated due to broken inversion symmetry, introducing a competing spin-momentum locking interaction. Here we show that their interplay leads to the formation of complex, chiral spin textures that offer novel, non-linear spin-to-charge conversion properties. Whereas altermagnetic order suppresses the canonical linear in-plane Rashba-Edelstein response, we establish the presence of an \textit{anomalous} transversal Edelstein effect for planar applied electric and magnetic field, or alternatively, an in-plane magnetization. Additionally, we predict a purely electric-field-driven non-linear out-of-plane magnetization. We compute the anomalous response within a general altermagnet $d$-wave model, with parameters extracted from the ab-initio electronic structure of an altermagnetic bilayer. Our results suggest altermagnetic surfaces as a promising platform for unconventional spintronic functionalities.</description>

      <title>Going beyond density functional theory accuracy: Leveraging experimental data to refine pre-trained machine learning interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are inherently limited by the accuracy of the training data, usually consisting of energies and forces obtained from quantum mechanical calculations, such as density functional theory (DFT). Since DFT itself is based on several approximations, MLIPs may inherit systematic errors that lead to discrepancies with experimental data. In this paper, we use a trajectory re-weighting technique to refine DFT pre-trained MLIPs to match the target experimental Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) spectra. EXAFS spectra are sensitive to the local structural environment around an absorbing atom. Thus, refining an MLIP to improve agreement with experimental EXAFS spectra also improves the MLIP prediction of other structural properties that are not directly involved in the refinement process. We combine this re-weighting technique with transfer learning and a minimal number of training epochs to avoid overfitting to the limited experimental data. The refinement approach demonstrates significant improvement for two MLIPs reported in previous work, one for an established nuclear fuel: uranium dioxide (UO2) and second one for a nuclear fuel candidate: uranium mononitride (UN). We validate the effectiveness of our approach by comparing the results obtained from the original (unrefined) DFT-based MLIP and the EXAFS-refined MLIP across various properties, such as lattice parameters, bulk modulus, heat capacity, point defect energies, elastic constants, phonon dispersion spectra, and diffusion coefficients. An accurate MLIP for nuclear fuels is extremely beneficial as it enables reliable atomistic simulation, which greatly reduces the need for large number of expensive and inherently dangerous experimental nuclear integral tests, traditionally required for the qualification of efficient and resilient fuel candidates.</description>

Abstract: This review exhaustively evaluates the role of nanomaterials across the synthesis, characterization and application stages of biofuel systems. Common types of nanomaterials that are used for biofuel applications include metal oxides, carbon-based structures, and hybrids, which are evaluated for their effectiveness in efficient biofuel production. The properties of such nanomaterials are being utilized as an aid to produce biofuels through improved catalysis, enzyme immobilization and thermal stability. Common synthesis methods, such as sol-gel, coprecipitation, and green synthesis, are compared, alongside characterization tools, such as TEM, SEM, FTIR, and BET. This study focuses on transesterification, biomass pretreatment, and fermentation processes, where nanomaterials significantly improve yield and reusability. There are several challenges, despite the merits of using nanomaterials, and the trade-offs include cost, scalability, and environmental impact, which further expand into evaluating the life cycle of such materials. This review outlines the practical potential of nanomaterials in enabling efficient and sustainable biofuel production.</description>

      <title>From High-Entropy Ceramics (HECs) to Compositionally Complex Ceramics (CCCs) and Beyond</title>

Abstract: Over the past decade, the field of high-entropy ceramics (HECs) has expanded rapidly to encompass a broad range of oxides, borides, silicides, and other ceramic solid solutions. In 2020, we proposed extending HECs to compositionally complex ceramics (CCCs), where non-equimolar compositions and the presence of long- or short-range order, although reducing configurational entropy, create new opportunities to tailor and enhance properties, often surpassing those of higher-entropy counterparts. Along these lines, several fundamental scientific questions arise. Is the entropy in HECs truly high? Is maximizing entropy always desirable? In this perspective article, I revisit key concepts and terminologies and highlight emerging directions, including dual-phase CCCs, ultrahigh-entropy phases, and novel processing routes such as ultrafast reactive sintering. I propose that exploring compositional complexity across vast non-equimolar spaces, together with exploiting correlated disorder (coupled chemical and structural short-range order), represents a transformative strategy for designing ceramics with superior performance.</description>

Abstract: On the basis of the extended classical elasticity theory, we propose universal semi-empirical analytical expressions for the energy and the equation of state for poly-crystalline solids. The validation of the relations has been made by means of first principle density functional theory simulations with the use of pseudo-potential approach and generalized gradient approximation for the exchange-correlation energy. The calculations performed for a large number of inorganic crystalline compounds with metal, covalent and ionic bonding (including diamond, Mg, sphalerite, B, magnesium carboboride, topaz, rocksalt, etc.) within the pressure range up to 300 GPa demonstrated an excellent agreement with the predictions of the analytical theory comparable in accuracy with Birch-Murnaghan approach.</description>

      <title>Defect Landscape of Orthorhombic Ba$_2$In$_2$O$_5$ from First-Principles Calculations: The Role of Oxygen Interstitials</title>

Abstract: The brownmillerite-type oxide barium indate (Ba$_2$In$_2$O$_5$, BIO) is a potential electrolyte for mixed ionic-electronic conduction in solid oxide fuel cells. Despite its structural relation to perovskite oxides, the defect chemistry of BIO has remained largely unexplored. Using Density Functional Theory within the generalized gradient approximation, complemented by selected hybrid functional calculations, we evaluate the formation energies, charge transition levels, and concentrations as a function of oxygen partial pressure of vacancies, oxygen interstitials, and Frenkel pairs. Our results reveal that oxygen vacancies and interstitials dominate the intrinsic defect landscape. Among the interstitials, we identify stable dumbbell configurations that remain neutral across the entire band gap. Other interstitial configurations show charged states and become the prevailing compensating defect with oxygen vacancies at high oxygen partial pressures. These results provide a consistent picture of the thermodynamics of intrinsic defects in BIO, setting the stage for future investigations into the diffusion dynamics of oxygen vacancies and interstitials.</description>

      <title>Insights into the adhesion and delamination strength of carbon films on metals by high-throughput ab initio calculations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diamond and diamond-like carbon (DLC) coatings are widely employed for their exceptional mechanical, thermal and chemical properties, but their industrial application is often limited by weak adhesion to metallic substrates. In this work, we employ a high-throughput ab initio approach to systematically investigate the adhesion of diamond/metal interfaces, combining a set of technologically relevant metals (Al, Ag, Au, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ir, Mg, Mo, Pt, Rh, Ti, V, W, Zn) with the C(111), C(111)-2x1 (Pandey reconstructed), C(110), C(100) surfaces, that are most common in diamond and are representative of different types of bonds present in DLC. Thanks to our automated and accurate computational protocol for interface construction and characterization, databases are populated and relevant trends are identified on the effect of surface graphitization, ability to form carbides and metal reactivity on carbon film adhesion and delamination strength. Beyond capturing trends, our workflow yields predictive insights. Indeed, we found that adhesion energy scales with the geometric mean of the constituent surface energies, providing a simple descriptor for rapid screening; while comparing the work of separation with the metal's cohesive energy anticipates the fracture location under tensile loading. A novel method based on the radial distribution function g(r) analysis is introduced to identify when contact with a metal drives rehybridization of surface carbon from sp2 to sp3, the structural signature of improved resistance to delamination. These structural changes are mirrored by an electronic rearrangement at the interface, quantified by a charge-redistribution descriptor that strongly correlates with adhesion.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Analysis of Plasma-Modified Silk Fibroin and Chitosan Films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biological interactions with material surfaces span a wide range of length scales, yet conventional surface measurements often fail to account for scale, limiting the insights they provide for surface engineering. Here, we investigate how multiscale surface descriptors of plasma-modified silk fibroin and chitosan surfaces modify bacterial and immune cell response. Surface chemistry and topography were characterized using X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), followed by sliding bandpass filtration and multiscale curvature tensor-based methods to measure scale-dependent topographic features. Macrophage response and biofilm growth were assessed by fluorescence microscopy. Correlation strength showed scale-dependence with respect to surface features and biological structure: individual bacteria and small colonies correlated more strongly with fine-scale topographic features, whereas macrophage morphology correlated more strongly with larger-scale surface features. Notably, measured surface chemical descriptors generally did not correlate strongly with biofilm formation; nonetheless, chitosan and silk fibroin showed distinct trends in bacterial support, suggesting that material identity was not captured by the measured surface properties and that prevention of biofilms likely benefits from combinatorial approaches as opposed to physical surface modification alone. These results show that different biological structures interact with material surfaces at distinct length scales, as well as demonstrate the utility of multiscale analysis in identifying scales of interest in biological interactions with surfaces. Moreover, the data suggests that tailoring topographic feature size to the characteristic scale of the targeted biological entity is a potential strategy for antibacterial wound-healing materials without incurring cytotoxicity.</description>

      <title>Unveiling pressurized bulk superconductivity in a trilayer nickelate Pr4Ni3O10 single crystal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity in pressurized Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelates has provided new perspectives on the mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity. Up to now, most experiments concentrated on the lanthanum-related RP phase, so the discovery of new superconducting RP nickelates is highly desirable to reveal their generality. Here we report that high-quality Pr4Ni3O10 single crystal is grown with an optical floating zone furnace under high oxygen pressure. High-pressure transport measurements show that the superconducting state arises above 10 GPa, and the maximum Tc reaches 39 K without saturation, significantly exceeding the value of 25-30 K of La4Ni3O10. Ultrasensitive d.c. magnetic susceptibility measurements under high pressure indicate bulk superconductivity with appreciable superconducting volume fractions. By performing in situ high-pressure synchrotron X-ray diffraction measurements at 16 K, a structural transition is found from monoclinic to tetragonal. Unlike La4Ni3O10, the electronic structure of the high-pressure phase of Pr4Ni3O10 from density functional theory exhibits a dramatic metallization of the sigma-bonding band consisting of three dz2 orbitals and van Hove singularity of coupled bands of dx2-y2 orbitals near the Fermi level, similar to the bilayer nickelate La3Ni2O7. These findings reveal some generic features of both crystal and electronic structures for high-temperature superconductivity in nickelates and multi-layer cuprates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20855v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a combined Dynamical Mean Field Theory and Hartree (DMFT+H) calculation we study the transport and optical properties of the 8-band heavy fermion model for Twisted Bilayer Graphene (TBG) in the normal state. We find resistive states around integer fillings which resemble the ones observed in transport experiments. From a Drude fitting of the low frequency optical conductivity, we extract a very strongly doping-dependent Drude weight and scattering rate, resetting at the integers. For most dopings, particularly above the integers, the Drude scattering rate is high but notably smaller than that of the local electrons. This highlights the important role of itinerant electrons in the transport properties, despite their limited spectral weight on the flat bands. At far infrared frequencies, the optical conductivity exhibits cascades characterized by highly asymmetric resets of the intensity and oscillations in the interband peak frequencies.</description>

Abstract: Altermagnetism defies conventional classifications of collinear magnetic phases, standing apart from ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism with its unique combination of spin-dependent symmetries, net-zero magnetization, and anomalous Hall transport. Although altermagnetic states have been realized experimentally, their integration into functional devices has been hindered by the structural rigidity and poor tunability of existing materials. First, through cobalt intercalation of the superconducting 2H-NbSe$_2$ polymorph, we induce and stabilize a robust altermagnetic phase and using both theory and experiment, we directly observe the lifting of Kramers degeneracy. Additionally, we present spectroscopic insight into a previously hinted low-temperature phase, and provide evidence of its electronic origin. While shedding light on overlooked aspects of altermagnetism, these findings open pathways to spin-based technologies and lay a foundation for advancing the emerging field of altertronics.</description>

      <title>Localized necking under global compression in two-scale metallic hierarchical solids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hierarchically structured cellular solids have attracted increasing attention for their superior mass-specific mechanical properties. Using a remeshing-based continuum finite element (FE) framework, we reveal that two-scale metallic hierarchical solids exhibit a distinct, localized deformation mode that involves necking and fracture of microscale tension members even at small global compressive strains (3-5%). The tensile failure is always preceded by plastic buckling of a complementary compression member. This combined necking-buckling (NB) mode critically underlies the collapse of hexagon-triangle (HTH) hierarchical lattices over a wide range of relative densities and length-scale ratios and is also seen in diamond-triangle (DTH) lattices. In lattices with very slender microscale members, necking is prevented by a competing failure mode that involves coordinated buckling (CB) of multiple members. Our custom remeshing FE framework is critical to resolve the localized large plastic strains, ductile failure, and complex local modes of deformation (including cusp formation) that are characteristic of the NB mode. A theoretical buckling analysis supports the inevitability of the NB and CB modes in HTH lattices. The occurrence of the NB mode has consequences for energy absorption by two-scale hierarchical solids, and hence influences their design.</description>

      <title>Kagome goldene with flat bands and Dirac nodal line fermions via line-graph epitaxy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The kagome lattice has emerged as a promising platform for investigating exotic quantum phases. However, achieving a single-atomic-layer kagome lattice in elemental materials remains a significant challenge. Here, we introduce line-graph epitaxy, a novel approach that enables the atomic-scale synthesis of goldene, a monolayer of elemental gold atoms arranged in a kagome lattice. Through scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrate the formation of kagome goldene, featuring a flat band with a van Hove singularity approximately 1.1 eV below the Fermi level, signaling strong electron correlation effects. Notably, the flat band is disrupted at the zigzag edges of goldene nanoflakes, revealing substantial edge effects. Furthermore, our calculations show that weak interlayer interactions between goldene and the underlying Au2Ge substrate generate dual Dirac nodal lines through a proximity effect. These findings offer not only a novel strategy for constructing elemental kagome lattices, but also a generalizable framework for fabricating and controlling line-graph materials.

      <title>A Quieter State of Charge -- Ultra-Low-Noise Collective Current in Charge-Density-Wave Nanowires</title>

Abstract: Electronic flicker noise limits phase stability in communication systems, reduces the sensitivity and selectivity of sensors, and degrades coherence in quantum devices. There is a strong need for unconventional materials and strategies for achieving ultra-low-noise performance in nanoscale and quantum electronics. Here, we demonstrate that in nanowires of the quasi-one-dimensional, fully gapped charge-density-wave material (TaSe4)2I, low-frequency electronic noise is suppressed below the limit of thermalized charge carriers in passive resistors. When the current is dominated by the sliding Frohlich condensate, the normalized noise spectral density decreases linearly with current, I -- a striking departure from the constant value observed in conventional conductors. No residual minimum noise level is reached for the current of the electron-lattice condensate in (TaSe4)2I nanowires. Repeating the measurements for another charge-density wave conductor, NbS3-II, we found a similar reduction below the normal electron limit at room temperature. Our findings signal intrinsically lower current fluctuations within a correlated electron transport regime.</description>

      <title>Impact of the honeycomb spin-lattice on topological magnons and edge states in ferromagnetic 2D skyrmion crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02192v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnons have been intensively studied in two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnetic (FM) skyrmion crystals (SkXs) stabilized on Bravais lattices, particularly triangular and square lattices. In these systems, topological edge states (TESs) have been reported in higher-energy magnon gaps, while the first magnon gap is found to be topologically trivial. In this context, antiferromagnetic (AFM) SkXs on the triangular spin lattice have been considered potentially more interesting for applications, since TESs emerge already in the first magnon gap. Meanwhile, the magnon topology of SkXs stabilized on non-Bravais spin lattices remains largely unexplored. In this work, we theoretically investigate the magnon band structure and TESs in 2D FM SkXs stabilized on the honeycomb spin lattice, including experimentally motivated parameter sets relevant to van der Waals magnets. We show that chiral TESs emerge in the first magnon gap over significant ranges of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and single-ion magnetic anisotropy. Magnetic-field-driven topological phase transitions modify the number of these TESs before eventually trivializing them. In addition, we find that TESs can coexist in the first and higher magnon gaps, which could enable frequency-multiplexed magnonic edge transport. These findings highlight the role of lattice geometry in shaping the magnon topology and edge transport in noncollinear spin textures.</description>

      <title>Interfacially arrested melting in thin films: capillarity-driven suspension of phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Melting is typically viewed as a bulk first-order phase transition that proceeds once nucleation barriers are overcome. Here we demonstrate an interfacially arrested melting regime in molecularly thin crystalline films, where large liquid droplets remain stably trapped well above the bulk melting temperature. Using long-chain alkane films as a model system, we show that melting is suspended by the competition between bulk melting enthalpy and interfacial energy costs associated with capillary confinement. The arrested state is governed by a single control parameter, the product of temperature offset and film thickness, and is independent of droplet size. As a consequence, small temperature variations produce pronounced and reversible changes in droplet morphology, enabling intrinsic thermodynamic amplification of thermal signals. These results reveal a general mechanism by which interfacial constraints can arrest first-order phase transitions in thin films.</description>

      <title>Electro-viscoelasticity of polymer melts in continuum theory</title>

Abstract: Electro-viscoelastic polymers have been studied experimentally for the past century, primarily for manufacturing purposes; however, the mechanisms governing their behavior in combined flow and electric fields remain poorly understood. To address this, we model charged polymers across scales. We extend the Rouse model to include charge density along the polymer chain and ambient electric fields, deriving the shear stress under homogeneous shear and electric fields. Viscosity exhibits anisotropic enhancement dependent on field-flow orientation with a scaling factor dependent on a charge sequence relaxation time, dielectric constant, and quadratic electric field term. These results inform a new continuum model--the upper-convected electro-Maxwell (UCEM) model--resembling an upper-convected Maxwell model with polarization stresses expressed through an electric field dyadic subject to upper-convected time derivatives. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of Kremer-Grest chains with charge sequences reveal distinct relaxation timescales for overall chain dynamics versus charge redistribution, manifested in shear and normal stress responses. Critically, upper-convected time derivatives of the electric field dyadic reproduce the viscosity scaling observed in both the Rouse and MD results; while standard continuum formulations without these terms fail to capture the scaling. Analysis of the dynamic rheological properties show that the phase shift is unaffected by the electric field, in agreement with recent PMMA experiments.</description>

      <title>Probing the quantum metric of 3D topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The surface states of 3D topological insulators possess geometric structures that imprint distinctive signatures on electronic transport. A prime example is the Berry curvature, which controls, for instance, electric frequency doubling via its higher order moments. In addition to the Berry curvature, topological surface states are expected to exhibit a nontrivial quantum metric, which plays a key role in governing nonlinear magnetotransport. However, its manifestation has yet to be experimentally observed and controlled in 3D topological insulators. Here, we provide evidence for a nonlinear response activated by the quantum metric of the topological surface states of Sb$_2$Te$_3$. We measure a time-reversal odd, nonlinear magnetoresistance that is independent from the temperature and the scattering time below 30 K, and is thus of intrinsic geometrical origin. This quantum metric magnetoresistance can be controlled by tuning the contributions of the top and bottom topological surface states by voltage gating. Our measurements thus demonstrate the existence and tunability of quantum geometry-induced transport in topological phases of matter and provide strategies for designing novel functionalities in topological devices.</description>

      <title>Multiphase transport and compositional mixing mechanisms in twin-wire laser directed energy deposition: toward process stability and graded material fabrication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13142v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Twin-wire laser directed energy deposition (TW-LDED) provides a promising route for alloying and fabrication of compositionally graded structures. However, inherent multiparameter coupling in twin-wire systems critically exacerbates both process instabilities and compositional inhomogeneity. This unresolved issue escalates into a fundamental technological bottleneck, as the underlying physical mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study developed a high-fidelity multi-physics and multiphase simulation framework coupled with experimental validation to reveal thermal-fluid behavior and heat-mass transfer mechanisms in TW-LDED using Inconel 718 and SS316L fine wires. Three distinct transition modes were identified: twin-wire melt droplet, twin-wire liquid bridge, and droplet-bridge mixed transitions, with the twin-wire liquid bridge regime delivering optimal stability and uniform mixing. Parametric analysis demonstrates that increasing wire feeding speed or decreasing wire initial height promotes stable liquid bridge formation, while small laser spots at low feeding speeds induce excessive volumetric energy density and bridge instability. Simulation and single-track experiments confirm that liquid bridge transitions reduce dimensional fluctuations by 85% while enhancing compositional homogeneity. Conversely, the melt droplet-bridge transition mode creates periodic flow switching and compositional discontinuities along the scan direction. Finally, a 60 mm functionally graded ring was successfully fabricated using optimized parameters, achieving uniform elemental distribution in the transition zone without significant segregation, validating the feasibility of TW-LDED for functionally graded components.</description>
