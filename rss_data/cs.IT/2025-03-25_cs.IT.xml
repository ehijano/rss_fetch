      <title>Optimal Neural Compressors for the Rate-Distortion-Perception Tradeoff</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent efforts in neural compression have focused on the rate-distortion-perception (RDP) tradeoff, where the perception constraint ensures the source and reconstruction distributions are close in terms of a statistical divergence. Theoretical work on RDP describes interesting properties of RDP-optimal compressors without providing constructive and low complexity solutions. While classical rate distortion theory shows that optimal compressors should efficiently pack the space, RDP theory additionally shows that infinite randomness shared between the encoder and decoder may be necessary for RDP optimality. In this paper, we propose neural compressors that are low complexity and benefit from high packing efficiency through lattice coding and shared randomness through shared dithering over the lattice cells. For two important settings, namely infinite shared and zero shared randomness, we analyze the rate, distortion, and perception achieved by our proposed neural compressors and further show optimality in the presence of infinite shared randomness. Experimentally, we investigate the roles these two components of our design, lattice coding and randomness, play in the performance of neural compressors on synthetic and real-world data. We observe that performance improves with more shared randomness and better lattice packing.</description>

      <title>Quantized Analog Beamforming Enabled Multi-task Federated Learning Over-the-air</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over-the-air computation (AirComp) has recently emerged as a pivotal technique for communication-efficient federated learning (FL) in resource-constrained wireless networks. Though AirComp leverages the superposition property of multiple access channels for computation, it inherently limits its ability to manage inter-task interference in multi-task computing. In this paper, we propose a quantized analog beamforming scheme at the receiver to enable simultaneous multi-task FL. Specifically, inspiring by the favorable propagation and channel hardening properties of large-scale antenna arrays, a targeted analog beamforming method in closed form is proposed for statistical interference elimination. Analytical results reveal that the interference power vanishes by an order of $\mathcal{O}\left(1/N_r\right)$ with the number of analog phase shifters, $N_r$, irrespective of their quantization precision. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed analog beamforming method and show that the performance upper bound of ideal learning without errors can be achieved by increasing the number of low-precision analog phase shifters.</description>

      <title>An algorithm for computing generalized Hamming weights and the Sage package GHWs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the Brouwer-Zimmermann algorithm, which is the most efficient algorithm for computing the minimum distance of a random linear code, to the case of generalized Hamming weights. We also adapt this algorithm to compute the relative generalized Hamming weights of a nested pair of linear codes. In the package GHWs we provide an implementation of this algorithm in Sage, as well as several other utilities for working with generalized Hamming weights. With this implementation, we show that the proposed algorithm is faster than the naive approach of computing the generalized Hamming weights using the definition.</description>

      <title>Channel Capacity Saturation Point and Beamforming Acceleration for Near-Field XL-MIMO Multiuser Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most important technologies in the fifth generation (5G) and the sixth generation (6G) is massive multiple input multiple outputs (MIMO) or extremely large-scale MIMO (XL-MIMO). With the evolving high-frequency technologies in millimeter band or tereHz band, the communication scene is changing into near-field rather than the conventional far-field scenario. In this letter, instead of advertising the XL-MIMO in the near-field, we appeal that a limit should be set on the size of the antenna array, beyond which the channel capacity will not show a significant increase. We show capacity saturation point can be analytically determined. Moreover, we propose a new beamforming algorithm that relieve the heavy computation due to the large antenna size even around the saturation point. Numerical results are provided to validate our analysis and show the performance of our newly proposed beamforming scheme.</description>

      <title>A Tutorial on Six-Dimensional Movable Antenna Enhanced Wireless Networks: Synergizing Positionable and Rotatable Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA) is a new
  and revolutionary technique that fully exploits the wireless
  channel spatial variations at the transmitter/receiver by flexibly
  adjusting the three-dimensional (3D) positions and 3D rotations
  of antennas/antenna surfaces (sub-arrays), thereby improving the performance of wireless
  networks cost-effectively without the need to deploy additional
  antennas. It is thus expected that
  the integration of new 6DMAs into future sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks will fundamentally enhance
  antenna agility and adaptability, and introduce new degrees
  of freedom (DoFs) for system design. Despite its great potential,
  6DMA faces new challenges to be efficiently implemented in wireless
  networks, including corresponding architectures, antenna position and rotation optimization, channel estimation,
  and system design from both communication and sensing perspectives. In
  this paper, we provide a tutorial on 6DMA-enhanced wireless
  networks to address the above issues by unveiling associated new channel models, hardware implementations and
  practical position/rotation constraints, as well as various appealing applications in
  wireless networks. Moreover, we discuss two special cases of 6DMA, namely, rotatable 6DMA with fixed antenna position and positionable 6DMA with fixed antenna rotation, and highlight their respective design challenges and applications.
  We further present prototypes developed for 6DMA-enhanced communication along with experimental results obtained with these prototypes. Finally, we outline promising directions for further investigation.</description>

      <title>Byzantine-Resilient Over-the-Air Federated Learning under Zero-Trust Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over-the-air computation (AirComp) has emerged as an essential approach for enabling communication-efficient federated learning (FL) over wireless networks. Nonetheless, the inherent analog transmission mechanism in AirComp-based FL (AirFL) intensifies challenges posed by potential Byzantine attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel Byzantine-robust FL paradigm for over-the-air transmissions, referred to as federated learning with secure adaptive clustering (FedSAC). FedSAC aims to protect a portion of the devices from attacks through zero trust architecture (ZTA) based Byzantine identification and adaptive device clustering. By conducting a one-step convergence analysis, we theoretically characterize the convergence behavior with different device clustering mechanisms and uneven aggregation weighting factors for each device. Building upon our analytical results, we formulate a joint optimization problem for the clustering and weighting factors in each communication round. To facilitate the targeted optimization, we propose a dynamic Byzantine identification method using historical reputation based on ZTA. Furthermore, we introduce a sequential clustering method, transforming the joint optimization into a weighting optimization problem without sacrificing the optimality. To optimize the weighting, we capitalize on the penalty convex-concave procedure (P-CCP) to obtain a stationary solution. Numerical results substantiate the superiority of the proposed FedSAC over existing methods in terms of both test accuracy and convergence rate.</description>

      <title>Physical-Layer Security of Pinching-Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the performance of physical-layer security of a pinching-antenna system on a lossless dielectric waveguide. In particular, the system uses a single pinching-antenna to convey confidential information from a base station to a legitimate destination equipped with a single antenna, while an eavesdropper, also equipped with a single antenna, attempts to decode the transmitted information. As such, the performance of the pinching-antenna system is evaluated in terms of average secrecy capacity, strictly positive secrecy capacity, and secrecy outage probability. To this end, accurate mathematical expressions for the aforementioned performance metrics are provided. To validate the analysis, the analytical results are numerically evaluated and further validated through MonteCarlo simulations. The results demonstrate that secrecy capacity between the base station and the legitimate destination improves when the height of the pinching-antenna placed closer to the destination. Additionally, the performance can be improved when the eavesdropper's location over a rectangular area increases.</description>

      <title>Umlaut information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sphere-packing bound quantifies the error exponent for noisy channel coding for rates above a critical value. Here, we study the zero-rate limit of the sphere-packing bound and show that it has an intriguing single-letter form, which we call the umlaut information of the channel, inspired by the lautum information introduced by Palomar and Verd\'u. Unlike the latter quantity, we show that the umlaut information is additive for parallel uses of channels. We show that it has a twofold operational interpretation: as the zero-rate error exponent of non-signalling-assisted coding on the one hand, and as the zero-rate error exponent of list decoding in the large list limit on the other.</description>

      <title>Entropic Analysis of Time Series through Kernel Density Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a novel framework for time series analysis using entropic measures based on the kernel density estimate (KDE) of the time series' Takens' embeddings. Using this framework we introduce two distinct analytical tools: (1) a multi-scale KDE entropy metric, denoted as $\Delta\text{KE}$, which quantifies the evolution of time series complexity across different scales by measuring certain entropy changes, and (2) a sliding baseline method that employs the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to detect changes in time series dynamics through changes in KDEs. The $\Delta{\rm KE}$ metric offers insights into the information content and ``unfolding'' properties of the time series' embedding related to dynamical systems, while the KL divergence-based approach provides a noise and outlier robust approach for identifying time series change points (injections in RF signals, e.g.). We demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of these tools through a set of experiments encompassing diverse domains. In the space of radio frequency (RF) signal processing, we achieve accurate detection of signal injections under varying noise and interference conditions. Furthermore, we apply our methodology to electrocardiography (ECG) data, successfully identifying instances of ventricular fibrillation with high accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of our tools for dynamic state detection by accurately identifying chaotic regimes within an intermittent signal. These results show the broad applicability of our framework for extracting meaningful insights from complex time series data across various scientific disciplines.</description>

      <title>LZMidi: Compression-Based Symbolic Music Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in symbolic music generation primarily rely on deep learning models such as Transformers, GANs, and diffusion models. While these approaches achieve high-quality results, they require substantial computational resources, limiting their scalability. We introduce LZMidi, a lightweight symbolic music generation framework based on a Lempel-Ziv (LZ78)-induced sequential probability assignment (SPA). By leveraging the discrete and sequential structure of MIDI data, our approach enables efficient music generation on standard CPUs with minimal training and inference costs. Theoretically, we establish universal convergence guarantees for our approach, underscoring its reliability and robustness. Compared to state-of-the-art diffusion models, LZMidi achieves competitive Frechet Audio Distance (FAD), Wasserstein Distance (WD), and Kullback-Leibler (KL) scores, while significantly reducing computational overhead - up to 30x faster training and 300x faster generation. Our results position LZMidi as a significant advancement in compression-based learning, highlighting how universal compression techniques can efficiently model and generate structured sequential data, such as symbolic music, with practical scalability and theoretical rigor.</description>

      <title>On the Minimax Regret of Sequential Probability Assignment via Square-Root Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of sequential probability assignment under logarithmic loss, both with and without side information. Our objective is to analyze the minimax regret -- a notion extensively studied in the literature -- in terms of geometric quantities, such as covering numbers and scale-sensitive dimensions. We show that the minimax regret for the case of no side information (equivalently, the Shtarkov sum) can be upper bounded in terms of sequential square-root entropy, a notion closely related to Hellinger distance. For the problem of sequential probability assignment with side information, we develop both upper and lower bounds based on the aforementioned entropy. The lower bound matches the upper bound, up to log factors, for classes in the Donsker regime (according to our definition of entropy).</description>

      <title>Dynamic structural resilience of international staple food trade networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is important to maintain the resilient international food trade network for food security. We have constructed the international trade networks of maize, rice, soybean, and wheat based on bilateral flows data between economies. Drawing on information theory, we have measured their dynamic resilience based on efficiency and redundancy during 1986 to 2022. We have also investigated the impact of economies and relationships on their resilience. Overall, we argue that rice and soybean trade networks deserve more attention while resilience in maize and wheat shows a steady upward trend. Meanwhile, our findings emphasize the importance of diversity of trade flows and partners for enhancing resilience. Currently, for example, excessively high monopolization of soybean trade may not be beneficial for its resilience. Also, we have found that major exporters and relationships between geographically bordering economies have greater impact on the resilience. Moreover, we have confirmed the existence of different network structures with the optimal resilience as relationships are removed cumulatively, which may be an informative guide for the international food trade.</description>

      <title>RIS-Assisted Localization: A Novel Conditional Sample Mean Approach without CSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been recognized as a promising solution for enhancing localization accuracy. Traditional RIS-based localization methods typically rely on prior channel knowledge, beam scanning, and pilot-based assistance. These approaches often result in substantial energy and computational overhead, and require real-time coordination between the base station (BS) and the RIS. In this work, we propose a novel multiple RISs aided localization approach to address these challenges. The proposed method first estimates the angle-of-directions (AoDs) between the RISs and the user using the conditional sample mean approach, and then uses the estimated multiple AoD pairs to determine the user's position. This approach only requires measuring the received signal strength at the BS for a set of randomly generated phase shifts across all RISs, thereby eliminating the need for real-time RIS phase shift design or user-to-BS pilot transmissions. Numerical results show that the proposed localization approach improves localization accuracy while significantly reducing energy and signaling overhead compared to conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Zak-OTFS for Identification of Linear Time-Varying Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linear time-varying (LTV) systems model radar scenes where each reflector/target applies a delay, Doppler shift and complex amplitude scaling to a transmitted waveform. The receiver processes the received signal using the transmitted signal as a reference. The self-ambiguity function of the transmitted signal captures the cross-correlation of delay and Doppler shifts of the transmitted waveform. It acts as a blur that limits resolution, at the receiver, of the delay and Doppler shifts of targets in close proximity. This paper considers resolution of multiple targets and compares performance of traditional chirp waveforms with the Zak-OTFS waveform. The self-ambiguity function of a chirp is a line in the delay-Doppler domain, whereas the self-ambiguity function of the Zak-OTFS waveform is a lattice. The advantage of lattices over lines is better localization, and we show lattices provide superior noise-free estimation of the range and velocity of multiple targets. When the delay spread of the radar scene is less than the delay period of the Zak-OTFS modulation, and the Doppler spread is less than the Doppler period, we describe how to localize targets by calculating cross-ambiguities in the delay-Doppler domain. We show that the signal processing complexity of our approach is superior to the traditional approach of computing cross-ambiguities in the continuous time / frequency domain.</description>

      <title>Ice-Filling: Near-Optimal Channel Estimation for Dense Array Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06806v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By deploying a large number of antennas with sub-half-wavelength spacing in a compact space, dense array systems (DASs) can fully unleash the multiplexing and diversity gains of limited apertures. To acquire these gains, accurate channel state information acquisition is necessary but challenging due to the large antenna numbers. To overcome this obstacle, this paper reveals that designing the observation matrix to exploit the high spatial correlation of DAS channels is crucial for realizing near-optimal Bayesian channel estimation. Specifically, we prove that the observation matrix design for channel estimation is equivalent to a time-domain duality of point-to-point multiple-input multiple-output precoding, except for the change in the total power constraint on the precoding matrix to the pilot-wise discrete power constraint on the observation matrix. Inspired by Bayesian regression, a novel ice-filling algorithm is proposed to design amplitude-and-phase controllable observation matrices, and a majorization-minimization algorithm is proposed to address the phase-only controllable case. Particularly, we prove that the ice-filling algorithm can be interpreted as a ``quantized" water-filling algorithm, wherein the latter's continuous power-allocation process is converted into the former's discrete pilot-assignment process. To support the near-optimality of the proposed designs, we provide comprehensive analyses on the achievable mean square errors and their asymptotic expressions. Finally, numerical results confirm that our proposed designs achieve the near-optimal channel estimation performance and outperform existing approaches significantly.</description>

      <title>Locally recoverable algebro-geometric codes from projective bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A code is locally recoverable when each symbol in one of its code words can be reconstructed as a function of $r$ other symbols. We use bundles of projective spaces over a line to construct locally recoverable codes with availability; that is, evaluation codes where each code word symbol can be reconstructed from several disjoint sets of other symbols. The simplest case, where the code's underlying variety is a plane, exhibits noteworthy properties: When $r = 1$, $2$, $3$, they are optimal; when $r \geq 4$, they are optimal with probability approaching $1$ as the alphabet size grows. Additionally, their information rate is close to the theoretical limit. In higher dimensions, our codes form a family of asymptotically good codes.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Information Freshness of IEEE 802.11ax Uplink OFDMA-Based Random Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05588v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The latest WiFi standard, IEEE 802.11ax (WiFi 6), introduces a novel uplink random access mechanism called uplink orthogonal frequency division multiple access-based random access (UORA). While existing work has evaluated the performance of UORA using conventional performance metrics, such as throughput and delay, its information freshness performance has not been thoroughly investigated in the literature. This is of practical significance as WiFi 6 and beyond are expected to support real-time applications. This paper presents the first attempt to fill this gap by investigating the information freshness, quantified by the Age of Information (AoI) metric, in UORA networks. We establish an analytical framework comprising two discrete-time Markov chains (DTMCs) to characterize the transmission states of stations (STAs) in UORA networks. Building on the formulated DTMCs, we derive an analytical expression for the long-term average AoI (AAoI), facilitating the optimization of UORA parameters for enhanced AoI performance through exhaustive search. To gain deeper design insights and improve the effectiveness of UORA parameter optimization, we derive a closed-form expression for the AAoI and its approximated lower bound for a simplified scenario characterized by a fixed backoff contention window and generate-at-will status updates. By analyzing the approximated lower bound of the AAoI, we propose efficient UORA parameter optimization algorithms that can be realized with only a few comparisons of different possible values of the parameters to be optimized. Simulation results validate our analysis and demonstrate that the AAoI achieved through our proposed parameter optimization algorithm closely approximates the optimal AoI performance obtained via exhaustive search, outperforming the round-robin and max-AoI policies in large and low-traffic networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In communication theory, attacks like eavesdropping or jamming are typically assumed to occur at the channel level, while communication parties are expected to follow established protocols. But what happens if one of the parties turns malicious? In this work, we investigate a compelling scenario: a multiple-access channel with two transmitters and one receiver, where one transmitter deviates from the protocol and acts dishonestly. To address this challenge, we introduce the Byzantine multiple-access classical-quantum channel and derive an achievable communication rate for this adversarial setting.</description>

      <title>Can Non-Signaling Assistance Increase the Degrees of Freedom of a Wireless Network?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An open question posed by Fawzi and Ferme [Transactions on Information Theory 2024], asks whether non-signaling (NS) assistance can increase the capacity of a broadcast channel (BC). We answer this question in the affirmative, by showing that for a certain K-receiver BC setting, called Coordinated Multipoint (CoMP) that arises naturally in wireless networks, NS-assistance provides multiplicative gains in capacity and degrees of freedom (DoF), even achieving K-fold improvements in some cases. Somewhat surprisingly, this is shown to be true even for 2-receiver broadcast channels that are semi-deterministic and/or degraded. In a CoMP BC, B single-antenna transmitters, supported by a backhaul that allows them to share data, act as one B-antenna transmitter, to send independent messages to K receivers, each equipped with a single receive antenna. A fixed and globally known connectivity matrix M, specifies for each transmit antenna, the subset of receivers that are connected to (have a non-zero channel coefficient to) that antenna. Besides the connectivity, there is no channel state information at the transmitter. The DoF region is fully characterized for a class of connectivity patterns associated with tree graphs. Sum-capacity with NS-assistance for arbitrary connectivity patterns is bounded below and above by the triangle number and the min-rank of the connectivity matrix, respectively. While translations to Gaussian settings are demonstrated, most of our results are presented under noise-free, finite-field (Fq) models. Converse proofs for classical DoF adapt the Aligned Images bounds to the finite field model. Converse bounds for NS-assisted capacity extend the same-marginals property to the BC with NS-assistance available to all parties. Even stronger (unbounded) gains are established for certain 'communication with side-information' settings, such as the fading dirty paper channel.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of Proximity Operator for Squared Loss and Performance Prediction of Nonconvex Sparse Signal Recovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2103.10300v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Proximal splitting-based convex optimization is a promising approach to linear inverse problems because we can use some prior knowledge of the unknown variables explicitly. An understanding of the behavior of the optimization algorithms would be important for the tuning of the parameters and the development of new algorithms. In this paper, we first analyze the asymptotic property of the proximity operator for the squared loss function, which appears in the update equations of some proximal splitting methods for linear inverse problems. Our analysis shows that the output of the proximity operator can be characterized with a scalar random variable in the large system limit. Moreover, we apply the asymptotic result to the prediction of optimization algorithms for compressed sensing. Simulation results demonstrate that the MSE performance of the Douglas-Rachford algorithm can be well predicted in compressed sensing with the $\ell_{1}$ optimization. We also examine the behavior of the prediction for the case with nonconvex smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) and minimax concave penalty (MCP) regularization.</description>

      <title>Equivalences of biprojective almost perfect nonlinear functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.04197v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two important problems on almost perfect nonlinear (APN) functions are the enumeration and equivalence problems. In this paper, we solve these two problems for any biprojective APN function family by introducing a strong group theoretic method for those functions. Roughly half of the known APN families of functions on even dimensions are biprojective. By our method, we settle the equivalence problem for all known biprojective APN functions. Furthermore, we give a new family of biprojective APN functions. Using our method, we count the number of inequivalent APN functions in all known biprojective APN families and show that the new family found in this paper gives exponentially many new inequivalent APN functions. Quite recently, the Taniguchi family of APN functions was shown to contain an exponential number of inequivalent APN functions by Kaspers and Zhou (J. Cryptol. 34 (1), 2021) which improved their previous count (J. Comb. Th. A 186, 2022) for the Zhou-Pott family. Our group theoretic method substantially simplifies the work required for proving those results and provides a generic natural method for every family in the large super-class of biprojective APN functions that contains these two family along with many others.</description>

      <title>Limits to Analog Reservoir Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14474v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reservoir computation is a recurrent framework for learning and predicting time series data, that benefits from extremely simple training and interpretability, often as the the dynamics of a physical system. In this paper, we will study the impact of noise on the learning capabilities of analog reservoir computers. Recent work on reservoir computation has shown that the information processing capacity (IPC) is a useful metric for quantifying the degradation of the performance due to noise. We further this analysis and demonstrate that this degradation of the IPC limits the possible features that can be meaningfully constructed in an analog reservoir computing setting. We borrow a result from quantum complexity theory that relates the circuit model of computation to a continuous time model, and demonstrate an exponential reduction in the accessible volume of reservoir configurations. We conclude by relating this degradation in the IPC to the fat-shattering dimension of a family of functions describing the reservoir dynamics, which allows us to express our result in terms of a classification task. We conclude that any physical, analog reservoir computer that is exposed to noise can only be used to perform a polynomial amount of learning, despite the exponentially large latent space, even with an exponential amount of post-processing.</description>

      <title>Cramer-Rao bound and absolute sensitivity in chemical reaction networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06987v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chemical reaction networks (CRN) comprise an important class of models to understand biological functions such as cellular information processing, the robustness and control of metabolic pathways, circadian rhythms, and many more. However, any CRN describing a certain function does not act in isolation but is a part of a much larger network and as such is constantly subject to external changes. In [Shinar, Alon, and Feinberg. "Sensitivity and robustness in chemical reaction networks." SIAM J App Math (2009): 977-998.], the responses of CRN to changes in the linear conserved quantities, called sensitivities, were studied in and the question of how to construct absolute, i.e., basis-independent, sensitivities was raised. In this article, by applying information geometric methods, such a construction is provided. The idea is to track how concentration changes in a particular chemical propagate to changes of all concentrations within a steady state. This is encoded in the matrix of absolute sensitivities. As the main technical tool, a multivariate Cramer-Rao bound for CRN is proven, which is based on the the analogy between quasi-thermostatic steady states and the exponential family of probability distributions. This leads to a linear algebraic characterization of the matrix of absolute sensitivities for quasi-thermostatic CRN. As an example, the core module of the IDHKP-IDH glyoxylate bypass regulation system is analyzed analytically and numerically by extensive random sampling of the concentration space. The experimentally known findings for the robustness of the IDH enzyme are confirmed and a hidden symmetry at the level of distributions is revealed, providing a blueprint for the analysis of the robustness properties of CRNs.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-Aided Joint Source Channel Coding For High Realism Wireless Image Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17736v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning-based joint source-channel coding (deep JSCC) has been demonstrated to be an effective approach for wireless image transmission. Nevertheless, most existing work adopts an autoencoder framework to optimize conventional criteria such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) which do not suffice to maintain the perceptual quality of reconstructed images. Such an issue is more prominent under stringent bandwidth constraints or low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. To tackle this challenge, we propose DiffJSCC, a novel framework that leverages the prior knowledge of the pre-trained Statble Diffusion model to produce high-realism images via the conditional diffusion denoising process. Our DiffJSCC first extracts multimodal spatial and textual features from the noisy channel symbols in the generation phase. Then, it produces an initial reconstructed image as an intermediate representation to aid robust feature extraction and a stable training process. In the following diffusion step, DiffJSCC uses the derived multimodal features, together with channel state information such as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), as conditions to guide the denoising diffusion process, which converts the initial random noise to the final reconstruction. DiffJSCC employs a novel control module to fine-tune the Stable Diffusion model and adjust it to the multimodal conditions. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets reveal that our method significantly surpasses prior deep JSCC approaches on both perceptual metrics and downstream task performance, showcasing its ability to preserve the semantics of the original transmitted images. Notably, DiffJSCC can achieve highly realistic reconstructions for 768x512 pixel Kodak images with only 3072 symbols (&lt;0.008 symbols per pixel) under 1dB SNR channels.</description>

      <title>Transversal Clifford and T-gate codes of short length and high distance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12752v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-local interactions in several quantum device architectures allow for the realization of more compact quantum encodings while retaining the same degree of protection against noise. Anticipating that short to medium-length codes will soon be realizable, it is important to construct stabilizer codes that, for a given code distance, admit fault-tolerant implementations of logical gates with the fewest number of physical qubits. To this aim, we construct three kinds of codes encoding a single logical qubit for distances up to $31$. First, we construct the smallest known doubly even codes, all of which admit a transversal implementation of the Clifford group. Applying a doubling procedure [arXiv:1509.03239] to such codes yields the smallest known weak triply even codes for the same distances and number of encoded qubits. This second family of codes admit a transversal implementation of the logical $\texttt{T}$-gate. Relaxing the triply even property, we obtain our third family of triorthogonal codes with an even lower overhead at the cost of requiring additional Clifford gates to achieve the same logical operation. To our knowledge, these are the smallest known triorthogonal codes for their respective distances. While not qLDPC, the stabilizer generator weights of the code families with transversal $\texttt{T}$-gates scale roughly as the square root of their lengths.</description>

      <title>Coarse Set Theory for AI Ethics and Decision-Making: A Mathematical Framework for Granular Evaluations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07347v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) systems become increasingly embedded in ethically sensitive domains such as education, healthcare, and transportation, the need to balance accuracy and interpretability in decision-making has become a central concern. Coarse Ethics (CE) is a theoretical framework that justifies coarse-grained evaluations, such as letter grades or warning labels, as ethically appropriate under cognitive and contextual constraints. However, CE has lacked mathematical formalization. This paper introduces Coarse Set Theory (CST), a novel mathematical framework that models coarse-grained decision-making using totally ordered structures and coarse partitions. CST defines hierarchical relations among sets and uses information-theoretic tools, such as Kullback-Leibler Divergence, to quantify the trade-off between simplification and information loss. We demonstrate CST through applications in educational grading and explainable AI (XAI), showing how it enables more transparent and context-sensitive evaluations. By grounding coarse evaluations in set theory and probabilistic reasoning, CST contributes to the ethical design of interpretable AI systems. This work bridges formal methods and human-centered ethics, offering a principled approach to balancing comprehensibility, fairness, and informational integrity in AI-driven decisions.</description>

      <title>Joint Transmit and Pinching Beamforming for Pinching Antenna Systems (PASS): Optimization-Based or Learning-Based?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel pinching antenna system (PASS)-enabled downlink multi-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) framework is proposed. PASS consists of multiple waveguides spanning over thousands of wavelength, which equip numerous low-cost dielectric particles, named pinching antennas (PAs), to radiate signals into free space. The positions of PAs can be reconfigured to change both the large-scale path losses and phases of signals, thus facilitating the novel pinching beamforming design. A sum rate maximization problem is formulated, which jointly optimizes the transmit and pinching beamforming to adaptively achieve constructive signal enhancement and destructive interference mitigation. To solve this highly coupled and nonconvex problem, both optimization-based and learning-based methods are proposed. 1) For the optimization-based method, a majorization-minimization and penalty dual decomposition (MM-PDD) algorithm is developed, which handles the nonconvex complex exponential component using a Lipschitz surrogate function and then invokes PDD for problem decoupling. 2) For the learning-based method, a novel Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)-guided dual learning (KDL) approach is proposed, which enables KKT solutions to be reconstructed in a data-driven manner by learning dual variables. Following this idea, a KDL-Tranformer algorithm is developed, which captures both inter-PA/inter-user dependencies and channel-state-information (CSI)-beamforming dependencies by attention mechanisms. Simulation results demonstrate that: i) The proposed PASS framework significantly outperforms conventional massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO) system even with a few PAs. ii) The proposed KDL-Transformer can improve over 30% system performance than MM-PDD algorithm, while achieving a millisecond-level response on modern GPUs.</description>
