      <title>Nano-topographical changes in latent fingerprint due to degradation over time studied by Atomic force microscopy -- option to set a timeline?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Latent fingerprints, if present, are crucial in identifying the suspect who was at the crime scene. If there are many latent fingerprints or the suspect is from the same household, crime investigators may have difficulty identifying whose latent fingerprints are time-related to the crime. Here, we report changes in the nanoscale topography of latent fingerprints, which may serve as a timeline and could help estimate when the latent fingerprint was imprinted. On the latent fingerprint of an adolescent, we observed a change in nano-topography over time, specifically the formation of nano-chain structures in space between the imprinted papillary ridges. We consequently compared this observation with the decomposition of the latent fingerprints of a child and adult. We observed a significant difference in the time change in nano-topography of latent fingerprints of a child, adolescent, and young adult. The nano-topographical changes of latent fingerprints were studied by atomic force microscopy over 70 days. In the case of child's and adolescent's latent fingerprints, the first nano-chains were observed already 24 hours after imprinting of the latent fingerprint, and the number of nano-chains increased steadily up to 21 days, then we observed that another organic material covered the nano-chains, and they started slowly deteriorating; nevertheless, the nano-chains were still present on the 70th day.</description>

      <title>Amplification of quantum transfer and quantum ratchet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Amplification of quantum transfer and ratchet--type processes are important for quantum technologies. We also expect that quantum ratchet works in quantum photosynthesis, where possible role of quantum effects is now widely discussed but the underlying dynamical processes are still not clearly known. In this work, we study a model of amplification of quantum transfer and making it directed which we call the quantum ratchet model. The model is based on a special quantum control master equation with dynamics induced by a feedback-type process. The ratchet effect is achieved in the quantum control model with dissipation and sink, where the Hamiltonian depends on vibrations in the energy difference synchronized with transitions between energy levels. A similarity between this model and the model of coherent transport in quantum photosynthesis, where the time dependence of the Hamiltonian arises due to vibrons, is studied. Amplitude and frequency of the oscillating vibron together with the dephasing rate are the parameters of the quantum ratchet which determine its efficiency. We study with which parameters the quantum ratchet minimizes the exction recombination time and show that the experimentally known values of the parameters of the photosynthetic reaction center correspond to values of the parameters of the quantum ratchet which realize a local minimum of the exciton recombination time. We also find another values of the parameters of the quantum ratchet minimizing the exciton recombination time, which corresponds to a twice smaller frequency of the vibron compared to that observed in experiments.</description>

      <title>A functional exchange shunt in the umbilical cord: the role of coiling in solute and heat transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The umbilical cord plays a critical role in delivering nutrients and oxygen from the placenta to the fetus through the umbilical vein, while the two umbilical arteries carry deoxygenated blood with waste products back to the placenta. Although solute exchange in the placenta has been extensively studied, exchange within the cord tissue has not been investigated. Here, we explore the hypothesis that the coiled structure of the umbilical cord could strengthen diffusive coupling between the arteries and the vein, resulting in a functional shunt. We calculate the diffusion of solutes, such as oxygen, and heat in the umbilical cord to quantify how this shunt is affected by vascular configuration within the cord. We demonstrate that the shunt is enhanced by coiling and vessel proximity. Furthermore, our model predicts that typical vascular configurations of the human cord tend to minimise shunting, which could otherwise disrupt thermal regulation of the fetus. We also show that the exchange, amplified by coiling, can provide additional oxygen supply to the cord tissue surrounding the umbilical vessels.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Parameter Inference and Uncertainty Quantification for a Computational Pulmonary Hemodynamics Model Using Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Patient-specific modeling is a valuable tool in cardiovascular disease research, offering insights beyond what current clinical equipment can measure. Given the limitations of available clinical data, models that incorporate uncertainty can provide clinicians with better guidance for tailored treatments. However, such modeling must align with clinical time frameworks to ensure practical applicability. In this study, we employ a one-dimensional fluid dynamics model integrated with data from a canine model of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) to investigate microvascular disease, which is believed to involve complex mechanisms. To enhance computational efficiency during model calibration, we implement a Gaussian process emulator. This approach enables us to explore the relationship between disease severity and microvascular parameters, offering new insights into the progression and treatment of CTEPH in a timeframe that is compatible with a reasonable clinical timeframe.</description>

      <title>Branching with selection and mutation II: Mutant fitness of Gumbel type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a model of a branching process subject to selection, modeled by giving each family an individual fitness acting as a branching rate, and mutation, modeled by resampling the fitness of a proportion of offspring in each generation. For two large classes of fitness distributions of Gumbel type we determine the growth of the population, almost surely on survival. We then study the empirical fitness distribution in a simplified model, which is numerically indistinguishable from the original model, and show the emergence of a Gaussian travelling wave.</description>

      <title>Turning on the Light: Polymorphism-Induced Photoluminescence in Cysteine Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photoluminescence of non-aromatic supramolecular chemical assemblies has attracted considerable attention in recent years due to its potential for use in molecular sensing and imaging technologies. The underlying structural origins, the mechanisms of light emission in these systems, and the generality of this phenomenon remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that crystals of L-Cysteine (Cys) formed in heavy water ($\text{D}_2\text{O}$) exhibit distinct packing and hydrogen-bond networks, resulting in significantly enhanced photoluminescence compared to those prepared in $\text{H}_2\text{O}$. Using advanced excited-state simulations, we elucidate the nature of electronic transitions that activate vibrational modes of Cys in $\text{H}_2\text{O}$, particularly those involving thiol (S-H) and amine (C-N) groups, which lead to non-radiative decay. For the crystal formed in $\text{D}_2\text{O}$, these modes appear to be more constrained, and we also observe intersystem crossing from the singlet to the triplet state, indicating a potentially more complex light emission mechanism. Our findings provide new insights into this intriguing phenomenon and introduce innovative design principles for generating emergent fluorophores.</description>

      <title>Why epithelial cells collectively move against a traveling signal wave</title>

      <description>arXiv:2008.12955v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The response of cell populations to external stimuli plays a central role in biological mechanical processes such as epithelial wound healing and developmental morphogenesis. Wave-like propagation of a signal of ERK MAP kinase has been shown to direct collective migration in one direction; however, the mechanism based on continuum mechanics under a traveling wave is not fully understood. To elucidate how the traveling wave of the ERK kinase signal directs collective migration, we constructed the mechanical model of the epithelial cell monolayer by considering the signal-dependent coordination of contractile stress and cellular orientation. The proposed model was studied by using an optogenetically-controlled cell system where we found that local signal activation induces changes in cell density and orientation with the direction of propagation. The net motion of the cell population occurred relative to the wave, and the migration velocity showed a maximum in resonance with the velocity of the ERK signal wave. The presented mechanical model was further validated in \textit{in vitro} wound healing process.</description>

      <title>Finer-Focused Partial Wave Spectroscopy (ff-PWS) and Detection of Cancer Stages From Human Tissue Samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.14194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.14194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The progression of cancer is associated with different genetic and epigenetic events which result in nano to microscale structural alterations in cells/tissue. However, these structural alterations in the early stage of the disease remain undetectable by conventional microscopy due to the diffraction-limited resolution of ~200nm. With cancer being an epidemic worldwide, early and accurate detection methods are always in demand. In this sense, we developed a finer focusing mesoscopic physics-based partial wave spectroscopy (PWS) imaging and quantification technique, which can probe the precise scattering volume in cells/tissue to detect such structural alterations. Therefore, we employ the highly sensitive PWS technique to quantify the nanoscale refractive index fluctuations using commercially available paraffin embedded tissue microarrays (TMA) samples with the goal of the standardized early and accurate detection of stages of different cancers. Recently the use of scientific TMA samples has gained research interest in diagnosing different diseases and drug-effect in treatment since they are commercially easily accessible. In this work, deadly cancer such as pancreatic, prostate, breast, and colon cancer TMAs containing multiple cores of different stages for each cancer are analyzed using the PWS technique and the degree of disorder strength Ld was quantified. The finer focusing PWS results show that an increase in the disorder strength with the increase in the stage of each cancer. This quantitative analysis of different cancer stages using commercially available TMA samples could enhance and standardize early, accurate cancer diagnosis modalities.</description>

      <title>ToSkA: Topological Skeleton Analysis for Network-Based Shape Representation and Evaluation of Objects from Cells to Death Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10539v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Shape analysis and classification are popular methods for biologists, biophysicists and mathematicians investigating relationships between object function and form. Classic shape descriptors, such as sphericity, can be powerful but may be insufficient for more complex shapes. Here, we present 'napari-toska' a topological skeleton based method to analyze complex objects by representing their shape asymmetries as networks. Using global neighborhood principles, classic network science metrics and spatial feature embedding we create instance segmentation object profiles to be used for immediate or downstream classification. napari-toska can also follow temporal dynamics and identify network features capable of differentiating between experimental phenotypes. We incorporated the capacity to measure absolute spatial features of objects to bring in aspects of scale. Furthermore, napari-toska identifies certain segmentation errors through the emergence or loss of network cycles. Combined, napari-toska functions allow for flexible and in-depth shape profiling of intricate shapes often observed in biological and physical settings where robust, yet precise, system configuration is essential to downstream processes.</description>

      <title>Correlation Between DNA Double-Strand Break Distribution in 3D Genome and Radiation-Induced Cell Death</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07579v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The target theory is the most classical hypothesis explaining radiation-induced cell death, yet the physical or biological nature of the target remains ambiguous. This study hypothesizes that the distribution of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) within the 3D genome is a pivotal factor affecting the probability of cell death. We propose that clustered DSBs in DNA segments with high interaction frequencies are more susceptible to leading to cell death than isolated DSBs. Topologically associating domain (TAD) can be regarded as the reference unit for evaluating the impact of DSB clustering in the 3D genome. To quantify this correlation between the DSB distribution in 3D genome and radiation-induced effect, we developed a simplified model taking into account the DSB distribution across TADs. Utilizing track-structure Monte Carlo codes to simulate the electron and carbon ion irradiation, we calculated the incidence of each DSB case across a variety of radiation doses and linear energy transfers (LETs). Our simulation results indicate that DSBs in TADs with frequent interactions (case 3) are more likely to induce cell death than clustered DSBs within a single TAD (case 2). Moreover, case 2 is more likely to induce cell death than isolated DSBs (case 1). The curves of the incidence of case 2 and case 3 vs LETs have a similar shape to the radiation quality factor used in radiation protection. This indicates that these two cases are also associated with the stochastic effects of high LET irradiation. Our study underscores the crucial significance of the 3D genome structure in the fundamental mechanisms of radiobiological effects. The hypothesis proposed in our research offers novel perspectives on the mechanisms that regulate radiobiological effects. Moreover, it serves as a valuable reference for the establishment of mechanistic models that can predict cell survival under different LETs.</description>
