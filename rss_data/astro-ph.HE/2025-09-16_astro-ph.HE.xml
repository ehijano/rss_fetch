      <title>Systematic Effects of Chaotic Magnetic Fields on Neutron Star Tidal Deformability: Implications for Gravitational Wave Constraints on Dense Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of strong magnetic fields on the equation of state (EoS) of neutron star matter and the resulting implications for tidal deformability measurements in binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. A critical issue with previous magnetized neutron star studies is the treatment of magnetic field anisotropy in the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations. To address this fundamental problem, we employ the chaotic magnetic field approximation, which allows for a self-consistent treatment of magnetic pressure while maintaining isotropy. Using a relativistic mean field approach with properly implemented magnetic field corrections, we compute mass-radius relations and tidal deformability parameters for neutron stars with magnetic field strengths ranging from $10^{15}$ to $10^{16}$ G. Our systematic study reveals that magnetic fields induce increases in both stellar radii (0.8--2.3\%) and tidal deformabilities (4.2--18.1\%) compared to field-free cases, with effects scaling approximately as $B^{1/2}$. These modifications, while modest, are potentially detectable with current and next-generation gravitational wave detectors. For a canonical $1.4\,M_\odot$ neutron star, the tidal deformability increases from $\Lambda_{1.4} = 678 \times 10^6$ in the absence of magnetic fields to $\Lambda_{1.4} = 803 \times 10^6$ for $B = 10^{16}$ G. We demonstrate that magnetic field effects must be considered when constraining the neutron star equation of state using gravitational wave observations, particularly for populations including highly magnetized neutron stars. Our results suggest that the current GW170817 constraint on tidal deformability may require systematic corrections when accounting for magnetic field effects. We provide scaling relations for magnetic field corrections and discuss the implications for population studies of neutron star mergers with next-generation detectors.</description>

      <title>Star-Black Hole Interactions in Young Star Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Close encounters between stars and black holes can trigger micro-tidal disruption events (micro-TDEs) in dense young star clusters (YSCs). Using direct N-body simulations with PETAR, we found that most micro-TDEs arise from few-body multiple encounters. The inferred rate is approximately 350-450 Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$. Micro-TDEs could be detected both by upcoming surveys such as LSST, expected to observe roughly 10-100 events per year, and by their gravitational-wave (GW) signals peaking in the deci-Hertz band, detectable with future instruments such as LGWA and DECIGO.</description>

      <title>When IIb Ceases To Be: Bridging the Gap Between IIb and Short-plateau Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen-rich supernovae (SNe) span a range of hydrogen envelope masses at core collapse, producing diverse light curves from extended plateaus in Type II SNe to double-peaked Type IIb SNe. Recent hydrodynamic modeling predicts a continuous sequence of light-curve morphologies as hydrogen is removed, with short plateau SNe (plateau durations ~50--70 days) emerging as a transitional class. However, the observational boundary between IIb and short-plateau remains poorly defined, and thus far unobserved. We report on extensive photometric and spectroscopic follow-up of SN 2023wdd and SN 2022acrv, candidate transitional events on the low-mass end of the short-plateau class. Both exhibit weak, double-peaked light curves which we interpret as exceptionally short plateaus (10--20 days), and hybrid spectral features: persistent H$\alpha$ absorption with He I contamination, but without the helium dominance characteristic of IIb SNe. Using analytic shock-cooling models and numerical light curve fitting, we estimate hydrogen-rich envelope masses of ~0.6--0.8 $M_\odot$ -- significantly larger than canonical IIb values ($\lesssim0.1\,M_\odot$) but consistent with the ${\sim}0.9\,M_\odot$ threshold predicted for short-plateau behavior. Although the progenitor radii inferred from analytic and numerical methods differ by factors of 2--5, envelope mass estimates are consistent across approaches. Comparisons to well-studied IIb (SN 2016gkg, SN 2022hnt), short-plateau (SN 2023ufx, SN 2006ai, SN 2016egz, SN 2006Y), and II SNe (SN 2023ixf, SN 2013ej) suggest a monotonic relationship between hydrogen envelope mass and plateau length consistent with analytic and numerical expectations. These findings provide additional evidence for a continuous distribution of envelope stripping in hydrogen-rich core-collapse progenitors and place SN 2023wdd and SN 2022acrv along the IIb/short-plateau boundary.</description>

      <title>The Photospheric Emission of a Short-Duration Gamma-Ray Burst Emerging from a Realistic Binary Neutron Star Merger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The almost simultaneous detection of GRB170817A and GW170817 ushered in nearly a decade of interest in binary neutron star mergers and their multi-messenger signals, resulting in a greater understanding of the processes that produce short-duration gamma-ray bursts and gravitational waves. However, open questions remain regarding the emission mechanism of these bursts. In this work we present results from the first study of an electromagnetic signal produced from a realistic treatment of a binary neutron star merger, both for on-axis and off-axis observations. We accomplish this by using the PLUTO hydrodynamical code to inject a relativistic jet into the ejecta of a realistic binary neutron star merger, which was itself obtained from the simulation of a 3D BNS merger. Then, we model the prompt photospheric emission that would emerge from this jet using the MCRaT radiative transfer code. We find that the resulting photon spectra can peak around ~1 MeV for on-axis emission and falls off noticeably for off-axis observations. We also find distinctly non-thermal low and high-energy tails in multiple observations, ranging from shallow to mid-off axis observations. Our on-axis results are consistent with the Amati Correlation for short bursts, with some strain evident at higher observing angles. Finally, we find that the radiative efficiency is much lower than seen in previous studies of the photospheric emission of long-duration gamma-ray bursts.</description>

      <title>Extreme High-Energy Neutrinos: IceCube vs. KM3NeT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the state of the art in the detection of extreme high-energy neutrinos, focusing on the IceCube and KM3NeT neutrino telescopes. IceCube, operating deep in Antarctic ice, and KM3NeT, a new array in the Mediterranean Sea, employ distinct designs to capture Cherenkov light from neutrino interactions. We examine their detector architectures, readout and reconstruction performance for PeV-scale and higher-energy neutrinos. Recent candidate events above 5 PeV are highlighted. These include a ~120 PeV muon track observed by KM3NeT in 2023, and IceCube's highest-energy detections, which comprise several-PeV showers and tracks. We outline current approaches to neutrino energy reconstruction and explore scenarios that might explain the apparent differences in observed event characteristics. Finally, we summarize future prospects for extreme-energy neutrino observations and their implications for astrophysical source populations and cosmogenic neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Deciphering Profile Stability in Millisecond Pulsars: Timescales, Frequency Evolution, and Implications on Emission Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulse profile stability in millisecond pulsars (MSPs) is a key factor in achieving high-precision timing essential for detecting nanohertz gravitational waves with Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs). In this work, we present a systematic analysis of profile stabilization timescales in MSPs using a direct method based on pulse stacking, applied to long-term multi-epoch observations. Our study utilizes data from the upgraded GMRT (uGMRT) between 300--750 MHz for nine MSPs over 3--5 years and Parkes Ultra-Wideband low-frequency receiver observations (Parkes UWL; covering 704--4032 MHz) for three of them. We find that stable profiles typically require averaging over $10^{5}$--$10^{6}$ pulses. This is the first time such a quantitative approach has been applied to MSPs across a wide frequency range, providing an indirect but practical estimate of jitter noise, a dominant noise source in PTA datasets. We observe that stabilization timescales depend on signal-to-noise ratio, pulse morphology, and surface magnetic field strength, with a moderate correlation indicating a possible role of the magnetic field in emission stability. A complementary single-epoch analysis of nine bright MSPs with uGMRT Band-3 (300--500 MHz) reinforces these results and demonstrates the method's applicability to broader MSP populations. We show that a strong correlation exists between profile-stability slope and the jitter parameter, implying that for faint MSPs, profile-stability analysis can act as an effective proxy for intrinsic pulse-shape variability. Our work provides a novel and scalable framework to assess intrinsic profile variability, helping to guide integration time choices and reduce timing noise in PTA experiments.</description>

      <title>Investigating the capability of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory to detect gamma-ray emission from simulated stationary neutrino sources identified by KM3NeT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simultaneous observation of gamma rays and neutrinos from the same astrophysical source offers a unique opportunity to probe particle acceleration and interaction mechanisms in ultra-high-energy environments. The Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) is a next-generation ground-based gamma-ray facility, sensitive to energies from 20~GeV to 300~TeV. In this work, we present for the first time a performance study of CTAO based on joint simulations of steady-state sources emitting both neutrinos and gamma rays, under the assumption that neutrino events are detected by the KM3NeT telescope in the Northern Hemisphere. To identify potentially observable sources, we apply a neutrino-based selection filter according to KM3NeT's discovery potential. We then simulate gamma-ray detectability with CTAO, taking into account visibility, sensitivity, and extragalactic background light absorption. The analysis is specifically focused on exploring the detectability of sources at low neutrino luminosities, limited to values below $10^{52}\,\mathrm{erg\,yr^{-1}}$, in order to assess the performance of CTAO and KM3NeT in identifying faint extragalactic emitters. Particular attention is given to the strategic role of KM3NeT's geographic location, which provides access to Southern-sky sources, and to the impact of the planned CTA+ upgrade, which will enhance CTAO-South with Large-Sized Telescopes (LSTs). Our results highlight the importance of coordinated multi-messenger strategies between KM3NeT and CTAO to maximize the discovery potential of astrophysical neutrino sources.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Reconnection as a Potential Driver of X-ray Variability in Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic analysis on the X-ray variability in 13 bright quasars at z &gt; 4.5, combining recent Swift observations from 2021 to 2023 and archival multi-epoch observations. Upper limits of the luminosity measurements were included in the analysis by using the Kaplan-Meier estimator method. It is found that the high-z quasars exhibit X-ray variability on both short-term (hours-to-days) and intermediate-term (weeks-to-months) timescales, with short-term variability dominating the overall variation. A linear correlation exists between the global mean ($\mu_{\mathrm{L_{2-10\,keV}}}$) and standard deviation ($\sigma_{\mathrm{L_{2-10\,keV}}}$) of X-ray luminosities, which is independent of the X-ray photon index and optical-to-X-ray spectral slope. The localized stochastic magnetic reconnection mechanism is strongly favored, which can naturally lead to a scale-invariant power-law energy distribution and satisfactorily explain the correlation. The $\sigma$-$\mu$ correlation parallels with the well-documented rms-flux relation of low-z active galactic nuclei (AGNs), implying the magnetic reconnection mechanism could drive short-timescale X-ray variability in both high- and low-z AGNs. The highest-z quasar in our sample, J142952+544717 (z = 6.18), shows a luminosity distribution extending to ${10}^{47}\ \rm{erg\ {s}^{-1}}$ with a not conspicuous median luminosity. On the other hand, J143023+420436 (z = 4.7), which hosts the most relativistic jet among known high-z blazars, is dominated in the high-luminosity regime (${10}^{47}\ \rm{erg\ {s}^{-1}}$ ), making it an ideal target for multi-wavelength follow-up observations. J090630+693030 is found to have a rest-frame period of 182.46 days and J143023+420436 has a period of 16.89 days, both could be explained by the global evolution of plasmoid chains, in which magnetic islands formed during reconnection may merge successively.</description>

      <title>Probing the millisecond pulsar origin of the GeV excess in the Galactic Centre with LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The GeV $\gamma$-ray excess observed towards the Galactic Centre remains unexplained. While dark matter annihilation has long been considered a leading interpretation, an alternative scenario involving a large population of millisecond pulsars has not been ruled out. Testing this hypothesis with electromagnetic observations is difficult, as pulsar searches in the bulge are strongly affected by scattering, high sky temperature, and source confusion. We investigate whether gravitational-wave observations with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) could provide an independent probe of the millisecond pulsar binary population in the Galactic bulge.
  We construct synthetic populations of millisecond pulsar-white dwarf binaries under two illustrative formation scenarios: an accreted scenario, in which systems are deposited by disrupted globular clusters, and an in situ scenario, in which binaries form through isolated binary evolution. In both cases, only $10^{-5}$--$10^{-4}$ of the underlying bulge population is detectable by LISA. Nevertheless, even a few detections would imply tens to hundreds of thousands of unseen systems. Accreted binaries are expected to have lower chirp masses ($\sim$0.4 M$_\odot$), while in situ binaries produce more massive companions ($\sim$0.9 M$_\odot$).
  LISA will measure binary frequencies with high precision, but chirp masses can only be determined for the most massive or highest-frequency systems. Distinguishing millisecond pulsar binaries from the far more numerous double white dwarfs will be challenging, though LISA detections could provide valuable targets for follow-up with the Square Kilometre Array, enabling a critical test of the millisecond pulsar origin of the $\gamma$-ray excess.</description>

      <title>Muon number reconstruction with IceTop using a two-component lateral distribution function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The IceCube Neutrino Observatory, situated at the geographic South Pole, comprises both a surface component, IceTop, and a deep in-ice component. This unique setup allows for simultaneous measurements of low-energy ($\sim \rm{GeV}$) and high-energy ($\gtrsim 400\,\rm{GeV}$) muons generated in cosmic-ray air showers. The correlation between these low- and high-energy muons can serve as a valuable tool not only for analyzing cosmic-ray composition but also for tests of hadronic interaction models. However, IceTop does not feature dedicated muon detectors, making it challenging to measure the low-energy muon component for individual air showers. \\ \noindent For this reason, a two-component lateral distribution function is utilized for the simultaneous reconstruction of the primary energy and low-energy muon number on a single-event basis. This is achieved by combining analytical descriptions of the electromagnetic and muon lateral distributions. In this work, the underlying principles of this method will be discussed, as well as its capability for muon number reconstruction using the hadronic interaction models Sibyll 2.1, QGSJet-II.04, and EPOS-LHC.</description>

      <title>Archival Search for IceCube Sub-TeV Neutrino Counterparts to Sub-Threshold Gravitational Wave Events from the Third Observing Run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The IceCube Neutrino Observatory actively participates in multimessenger follow-ups of gravitational-wave (GW) events. With the release of the Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalogue (GWTC)-2.1 and -3, the sub-threshold GW event information from the third observation run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) detectors is publicly available. These sub-threshold GWs are identified via template-based and minimally modelled search pipelines. Neutrino counterparts can enhance their astrophysical significance and improve their localisation. In this contribution, we propose a catalogue-based search for sub-TeV neutrino counterparts to sub-threshold GWs. For this search, we use archival data from IceCube's dense infill array, DeepCore. Using the unbinned maximum likelihood method, we search for correlation between IceCube sub-TeV neutrinos and the $\sim$ 100 most significant sub-threshold GW source candidates. With this study, we aim to contribute to the ongoing efforts to identify common astrophysical sources of neutrinos and GWs. We present the current status of this search and its role in advancing multimessenger astronomy, paving the way for deeper exploration of GW events and their sources.</description>

      <title>Radio detection of Cosmic Rays with the IceCube Surface Array Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The surface array of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, IceTop, measures cosmic rays in the PeV-EeV primary energy range. Stations comprising radio antennas and scintillation detectors will be added to enhance the existing surface detectors. A prototype station, consisting of eight scintillation detectors and three radio antennas, has been in operation in with the instrumentation in final design since the beginning of 2023. Radio signals from air showers are measured by antennas that are read-out when the trigger condition from the scintillation detectors is met. This contribution reports on air-shower coincidence measurements of these radio antennas with IceTop. Geometric shower parameters reconstructed from the radio antennas are compared with those from IceTop to determine the angular resolution. We also present details on the two new stations that were tested, deployed and commissioned with their respective data acquisition systems during the latest field season at the South Pole.</description>

Abstract: Pulsars and their pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) are unique laboratories for extreme astrophysical processes. This dissertation combines Fermi-LAT observations with a time-dependent leptonic PWN model (TIDE) to explore their gamma-ray emission. The model was validated on benchmark PWNe and applied to a systematic LAT search, leading to the discovery of new MeV-GeV candidates and the first population-level characterization. Several sources were modeled in detail, and predictions for potential TeV-emitting PWNe were tested against current and future observatories. Ultra-high-energy gamma-ray sources were also examined, revealing limits of standard leptonic scenarios. Beyond PWNe, stringent upper limits were obtained for the binary pulsar 1A 0535+262, and steady emission was detected from the globular cluster M5. Together, these results advance our understanding of pulsar environments and establish a framework for future multi-wavelength and next-generation gamma-ray studies.</description>

      <title>Thermonuclear X-ray bursts across the eclipse transitions in the LMXBs EXO 0748-676 and XTE J1710-281</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13299</link>

Abstract: The primary radiation from thermonuclear X-ray bursts observed in the neutron star low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) systems can interact with various parts of the binary system. This interaction gives rise to secondary radiation in different wavelength ranges, known as reprocessed emission. In eclipsing LMXBs, the reprocessed emission from the bursts can be examined during eclipses, as the primary emission is blocked and only the reprocessed emission is visible. We searched for bursts during eclipses in the archival RXTE data of the eclipsing LMXBs and found them in EXO 0748-676 and XTE J1710-281. In EXO 0748-676, seven bursts were found to occur near eclipse egress, with their tails extending beyond the eclipse, and one such burst was found for XTE J1710-281. We estimate the reprocessing fraction at orbital phases near eclipse egress by modeling the peculiar eclipse bursts detected in both systems, which have tails extending beyond the eclipses. We observe an increasing trend in reprocessing fraction as these eclipse bursts occur closer to the eclipse egress. We discuss the possibilities of reprocessing in the ablated wind from the companion star, the accretion disc, and the disc wind in EXO 0748-676 and XTE J1710-281. Additionally, we observe two decay components in the bursts in EXO 0748-676, which could suggest a complex composition of the accreting fuel. From the burst rise timescales, we place an upper limit on the size of the reprocessing regions in both EXO 0748-676 and XTE J1710-281, finding it comparable to the size of the respective X-ray binaries.</description>

      <title>SN 2024aecx: Double-Peaked Light Curves and Rapid Evolution in a Nearby Type IIb Supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SN 2024aecx is a nearby ($\sim$11 Mpc) Type IIb SN discovered within $\sim$1 d after explosion. In this paper we report high-cadence photometric and spectroscopic follow-up observations, conducted from as early as 0.27 d post discovery out to the nebular phase at 158.4 d. We analyze the environment of SN 2024aecx and derive a new distance, metallicity and host extinction. The light curve exhibits a hot and luminous shock-cooling peak at the first few days, followed by a main peak with very rapid post-maximum decline. The earliest spectra are blue and featureless, while from 2.3 d after discovery prominent P-Cygni profiles emerge. At nebular phase, the emission lines exhibit asymmetric and double-peaked profiles, indicating asphericity and/or early dust formation in the ejecta. We simulated the progenitor and explosion using a two-component model of shock cooling and radioactive $^{56}$Ni heating; our model favors an extended, low-mass H-rich envelope with$ M_{\mathrm{e}} = 0.08^{+0.02}_{-0.03}\, M_{\odot} $ and a low ejecta mass of $ M_{\mathrm{ej}} = 2.65^{+1.21}_{-0.73} \, M_{\odot}. $The comprehensive monitoring of SN 2024aecx, coupled with the detailed characterization of its local environment, establishes it as a benchmark event for probing the progenitors and explosion mechanisms of Type IIb SNe.</description>

      <title>Examining the influence of anisotropy on the fundamental mode of nonradial oscillation in quark stars on a complete general relativistic scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The anisotropic influence on the $f$-mode frequency of oscillations and dimensionless tidal deformability of strange quark matter are analyzed by employing the nonradial oscillation equations for the complete general relativity frame and tidal deformability equations, which are derived and modified from their standard form to introduce the anisotropic factor. The fluid in the compact star follows the MIT bag model with vector coupling. For the anisotropic function, we use a local anisotropy, which is regular along the whole star and is null both at the center and on the star's surface. We show that the $f$-frequency of oscillation and dimensionless tidal deformability change considerably with the anisotropy. Finally, we investigate the correlation between the dimensionless tidal deformability of the GW$170817$ event with the anisotropy.</description>

      <title>Generalized Lema\^itre time for rotating and charged black holes and its near-horizon properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the behavior of the analogue of the Lemaitre time when a particle approaches the horizon of a rotating black hole. For the Kerr metric, the aforementioned time coincides with the Doran or Natario time but we consider a more general class of metrics. We scrutiny relationship between (i) its finiteness or divergence, (ii) the forward-in-time condition, (iii) the sign of a generalized momentum/energy, (iv) the validity of the principle of kinematic censorship. The latter notion means impossibility to release in any event an energy which is literally infinite. As a consequence, we obtain a new explanation, why collisions of two particles inside the horizon do not lead to infinite energy in their center of mass frame. The same results are also obtained for the Reissner-Nordstr\"om metric</description>

      <title>On the (Im)possibility of Electrically Charged Planck Relics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I revisit whether black-hole remnants, from sub-Planckian compact objects to Planck relics and up to (super)massive black holes, can preserve Standard-Model (SM) electric charge. Two exterior-field mechanisms -- Coulomb-focused capture from ambient media and QED Schwinger pair production -- robustly neutralize such objects across cosmic history. I first derive the general capture rate including both Coulomb and gravitational focusing, and sum the stepwise discharge time in closed form via the trigamma function, exhibiting transparent Coulomb- and gravity-dominated limits. I then integrate the Schwinger rate over the near-horizon region to obtain an explicit $\dot Q(Q)$ law: discharge proceeds until the horizon field falls below $E_{\rm crit}$, leaving a residual charge $Q_{\rm stop}^{(e)}\!\propto\! r_h^2$ that is $\ll e$ for Planck radii. Mapping the mass dependence from sub-Planckian to astrophysical scales, I also analyze dark-sector charges with heavy carriers (including kinetic mixing and massive mediators). In a conservative ``no-Schwinger'' limit where vacuum pair creation is absent, cumulative ambient exposures alone force discharge of any integer SM charge. Three possible loopholes remain. (i) A fine-tuned SM corner in which the relic sits arbitrarily close to Reissner-Nordstr\"om extremality so greybody factors suppress charged absorption, while Schwinger pair creation is absent due to Planck-scale physics. (ii) Charge relocated to a hidden $U(1)_D$ with no light opposite carriers, e.g. if the lightest state is very heavy and/or kinetic mixing with $U(1)_{\rm EM}$ is vanishingly small. (iii) Discrete or topological charges rather than ordinary SM electric charge. Outside these cases, the conclusion is robust: within SM electromagnetism, charged black-hole relics neutralize efficiently and cannot retain charge over cosmological times.</description>

      <title>Wind Accretion in Massive Binaries Experiencing High Mass Loss Rates: I. Dependency on Mass Ratio and Orbital Period</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We run numerical simulations to study high-power wind accretion in a massive binary system during a high mass loss event. The system consists of an evolved primary star with a zero age main sequence mass of $ M_{1} = \rm 100~M_{\odot}$ and a hot secondary star with a mass ranging from $ M_{2} = \rm 30-80~M_{\odot}$, orbiting in a circular orbits with periods between 455 and 1155 days. We initiate a weak eruption event with mass loss at a rate of $10^{-3}~\rm {M_{\odot}}\rm~yr^{-1}$ for 1.5 years. During this event, a fraction of the mass lost by the primary is accreted onto the secondary, with the accretion rate being dependent on the orbital and stellar parameters. From the set of simulations, we derive an analytical relation describing the dependence of the mass accretion rate on the orbital period and stellar mass ratio. We also identify the transitional orbital period for which Roche lobe overflow begins to dominate over wind accretion. We find that accretion leads to a reduction in the effective temperature of the secondary star. However, the mass average accretion rate we obtain in the simulations is low enough for the secondary to remain in thermal equilibrium and avoid radial expansion.</description>

      <title>The AdvCam: Designing the future cameras for the Large-Sized Telescope of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An international collaboration composed of Italian, Japanese, Spanish and Swiss institutes, is developing the advanced camera (AdvCam), the next-generation camera for Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes, designed specifically for the Large-Sized Telescopes (LST) of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory. AdvCam incorporates cutting-edge Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) and a fully digital readout system, setting new standards for performance and efficiency. The upgraded camera will feature four times more pixels for the same field of view as the existing PMT-based camera, enabling finer image resolution and significantly improving angular precision and background noise rejection. To cope with the increase in number of pixels, many technological challenges are being tackled, from low power and high speed integrated chip design to real-time data processing on hardware accelerators. This technological leap will lower the energy threshold by allowing operation at lower observation threshold and providing brighter images. The increase in effective area, angular and energy resolution will enhance the sensitivity, unlocking new potential for gamma-ray astronomy. In this work, we present the performance of the AdvCam's core building blocks and its innovative architecture capable of enabling unprecedented triggering capabilities. We also showcase the latest performance results based on Monte-Carlo data that has been tuned to reflect the latest stages of the on-going technological developments, highlighting the transformative capabilities of this next-generation instrument.</description>

      <title>Hyperons in Neutron Stars across the observed mass range: Insights from realistic $\Lambda$-N and $\Lambda$-$\Lambda$ interactions within a Microscopic Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the equation of state (EOS) and macroscopic properties of neutron stars (NSs) and hyperonic stars within the framework of the lowest order constrained variational (LOCV) method, extended to include interacting $\Lambda$ hyperons. The nucleon-nucleon interaction is modeled using the AV18 potential supplemented by Urbana three-body forces, while $\Lambda N$ and $\Lambda \Lambda$ interactions are described by realistic spin- and parity-dependent potentials fitted to hypernuclear data. Cold, charge-neutral, and $\beta$-equilibrated matter composed of neutrons, protons, electrons, muons, and $\Lambda$ hyperons is considered. We compute particle fractions, chemical potentials, the EOS, speed of sound, tidal deformability, and stellar structure by solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations, and compare our results with recent NICER and gravitational-wave observations. The inclusion of $\Lambda$ hyperons leads to EOS softening, reducing the maximum NS mass from $2.34M_\odot$ to $2.07M_\odot$, while keeping it consistent with the $2M_\odot$ mass constraint. At $1.4M_\odot$, the model satisfies observational limits on radius and tidal deformability, with the $\Lambda$ onset occurring below this mass. Comparison with other microscopic and relativistic mean-field models shows that our EOS remains consistent with the allowed pressure-energy density range, while also permitting even canonical-mass NSs of about $1.4M_{\odot}$ to accommodate hyperons. These results suggest that hyperons can appear in NSs across the observed mass range without violating current astrophysical constraints, and that the extended LOCV method provides a consistent, microscopic approach to modeling dense hypernuclear matter.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of the Equations of State (EoSs) of Compact Stars using machine and deep learning regression techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This dissertation focuses on the reconstruction of Equations of State (EoSs) describing the interior of compact stars, using modern machine learning and deep learning methods. The pipeline is based on data from mass-radius (M-R) curves, obtained by numerically solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations for a wide range of admissible EoSs. The manuscript is divided into a Theoretical Part (Chs. 1-4) and a Computational Part (Chs. 5-7). The theoretical chapters analyze the properties of neutron and quark stars, the physical constraints of viable EoS models, and introduce regression algorithms (Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost) and neural networks with normalization and dropout techniques. The computational part presents the generation of artificial EoSs for hadronic and quark stars (MIT bag, CFL), the numerical solution of the TOV equations, data preparation, and hyperparameter tuning. Results include training and evaluation of models using MSE/MSLE metrics, learning curves for neural networks, and reconstruction of 21 hadronic and 20 quark star EoSs. Source code and tools for reproducibility and future research are provided. The work aims to establish a reusable and scalable framework, strengthening the connection between theoretical astrophysics and computational science.</description>

      <title>Rotating neutron stars within the macroscopic effective-surface approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The macroscopic model for a neutron star (NS) as a perfect liquid drop at the equilibrium is extended to rotating systems with a small frequency $\omega$ within the effective-surface (ES) approach. The NS angular momentum $I$ and moment of inertia (MI) for a slow stationary azimuthal rotation around the symmetry axis is calculated by using the Kerr metric approach in the Boyer-Lindquist and Hogan forms for the perfect liquid-drop model of NSs. The gradient surface terms of the NS energy density $\mathcal{E}(\rho)$ [Equation of State] are taken into account along with the volume ones at the leading order of the leptodermic parameter $a/R \ll 1$, where $a$ is the ES crust thickness and $R$ is the mean NS radius. The macroscopic NS angular momentum $I$ at small frequencies $\omega$, up to quadratic terms, can be specified for calculations of the adiabatic MI, $\Theta=d I/d \omega$, by using Hogan's inner gravitational metric, $r\le R$. The NS MI, $\Theta=\tilde{\Theta}/(1-\mathcal{G}_{t\varphi})$, was obtained in terms of the statistically averaged MI, $\tilde{\Theta}$, and its time and azimuthal angle correlation, $\mathcal{G}_{t\varphi}$, as sumes of the volume and surface components. The MI $\Theta$ depends dramatically on its effective radius $R$ because of a strong gravitation. We found the significant shift of the Schwarzschild radius $R_{\rm S}$ to a much smaller position due to the time and azimuthal correlation term $\mathcal{G}_{t\varphi}$. The adiabaticity condition is carried out for several neutron stars in a strong gravitation case.</description>

      <title>Axion-photon conversion in transient compact stars: Systematics, constraints, and opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study magnetic conversion of ultra-relativistic axion-like particles (ALPs) into photons in compact-star environments, focusing on the hot, transient conditions of core-collapse supernova (SN) remnants and neutron-star mergers (NSMs). We address previously overlooked uncertainties, particularly the suppression caused by ejected matter near the stellar surface, a region crucial to the conversion process. We derive analytical expressions for the transition rate; they reveal the influence of key parameters and their uncertainties. We update constraints using historical gamma-ray data from SN~1987A and find $g_{a\gamma}&lt;5\times10^{-12}~{\rm GeV}^{-1}$ for $m_a\lesssim10^{-9}$ meV. We also forecast sensitivities for a future Galactic SN and for NSMs, assuming observations with Fermi-LAT or similar gamma-ray instruments. We distinguish ALPs -- defined as coupling only to photons and produced via Primakoff scattering -- from axions, which also couple to nucleons and emerge through nuclear bremsstrahlung. We omit pionic axion production due to its large uncertainties and inconsistencies, though it could contribute comparably to bremsstrahlung under optimistic assumptions. For the compact sources, we adopt time-averaged one-zone models, guided by numerical simulations, to enable clear and reproducible parametric studies.</description>

      <title>On the use of the Axelrod formula for thermal electron collisions in Astrophysical Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Axelrod approximation is widely used in astrophysical modelling codes to evaluate electron-impact excitation effective collision strengths for forbidden transitions. Approximate methods such as this are a necessity for many heavy elements with open shells where collisional data is either non existent or sparse as the use of more robust methods prove prohibitively expensive. Atomic data for such forbidden transitions are essential for producing full collisional radiative models that do not assume Local-Thermodynamic-Equilibrium (LTE). In this short work we repeat the optimization of the simple Axelrod formula for a large number of $R$-matrix data sets, ranging from Fe and Ni to the first r-process peak elements of Sr, Y and Zr, to higher Z systems Te, W, Pt and Au. We show that the approximate treatment of forbidden transitions can be a significant source of inaccuracy in such collisional radiative models. We find a large variance of the optimized coefficients for differing systems and charge states, although some general trends can be seen based on the orbital structure of the ground-state-configurations. These trends could potentially inform better estimates for future calculations for elements where $R$-matrix data is not available.</description>

      <title>How do recollimation-induced instabilities shape the propagation of hydrodynamic relativistic jets?</title>

Abstract: Recollimation is a phenomenon of particular importance in the dynamic evolution of jets and in the emission of high-energy radiation. Additionally, the full comprehension of this phenomenon provides insights into fundamental properties of jets in the vicinity of the Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN). Three-dimensional (magneto-)hydrodynamic simulations revealed that the jet conditions at recollimation favor the growth of strong instabilities, challenging the traditional view-supported from two-dimensional simulations-of confined jets undergoing a series of recollimation and reflection shocks. To investigate the stability of relativistic jets in AGNs at recollimation sites, we perform a set of long duration three-dimensional relativistic hydrodynamic simulations with the state-of-the-art PLUTO code, to focus on the development of hydrodynamical instabilities. We explore the non-linear growth of the instabilities and their effects on the physical jet properties as a function of the initial jet parameters: jet Lorentz factor, temperature, opening angle and jet-environment density-contrast. The parameter space is designed to describe low-power, weakly magnetized jets at small distances from the core (around the parsec scale). All collimating jets we simulated develop instabilities. Recollimation instabilities decelerate the jet, heat it, entrain external material, and move the recollimation point to shorter distances from the core. This is true for both conical and cylindrical jets. The instabilities, that are first triggered by the centrifugal instability, appear to be less disruptive in the case of narrower, denser, more relativistic, and warmer jets. These results provide valuable insights into the complex processes governing AGN jets and could be used to model the properties of low-power, weakly magnetized jetted AGNs.</description>

      <title>Evidence of the association of repeating fast-radio-burst sources with fast-spinning super-twisted magnetars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are bright millisecond radio events of unknown extragalactic origin. Magnetars are among the main contenders. Some sources, the repeaters, produce multiple events but so far generally without the characteristic periodicity that one could associate with the spin of a neutron star. Aims: Assuming that the bursts originate from a magnetar magnetosphere, we aim to fit our geometrical model to the two main repeaters of the CHIME/FRB catalogue, namely FRB 20180814A and FRB 20180916B, and thus characterise the star. Methods: The model can generate dynamic spectra that can be directly compared to FRBs. We applied nested sampling in order to evaluate the main parameters of the model. These parameters being common to all bursts from a given repeater, they were fitted together as a single dataset. Results: We constrained the spin and magnetic parameters of the star, which were encoded into burst spectro-temporal morphologies. We estimate that a very strong toroidal magnetic component together with spin periods of, respectively, $2.3\_{-0.5}^{+0.5} ~ \rm s$ and $0.8\_{-0.2}^{+0.1} ~ \rm s$ best explain the data. We argue that this points towards young magnetars with super-twisted magnetospheres, and possibly low-field magnetars.</description>

      <title>The Relative Contributions of Accretion Disk versus Jet to the Optical and Mid-infrared Variability of Seyfert Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We performed a comprehensive analysis of flux and color variability in a redshift-matched sample of Seyfert galaxies, comprising 23 gamma-ray-detected narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (gNLS1s), 190 non-gamma-ray-detected narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (ngNLS1s), and 10 gamma-ray-detected broad-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (gBLS1s). Utilizing multi-band light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) in g, r, and i bands, along with mid-infrared (MIR) observations in W1 and W2 bands from the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), we observed that gBLS1s exhibit more significant variability than gNLS1s, while ngNLS1s display minimal variability across both optical and MIR wavelengths. The pronounced variability in gBLS1s may be attributed to a more closely aligned jet relative to the observer's line of sight or their comparatively lower accretion rates. In contrast, the subdued variability in ngNLS1s suggests that their flux changes are primarily driven by accretion disk instabilities. A strong correlation between optical and MIR variability amplitudes across different time scales supports the reprocessing scenario, where accretion disk emission variations are re-emitted by surrounding dust. Furthermore, our long-term color variability analysis revealed both stronger bluer-when-brighter (BWB) and redder-when-brighter (RWB) trends from the current sample, but a stronger RWB in approximately 50%, 49%, and 50% of gNLS1s, ngNLS1s, and gBLS1s, respectively, in the longer side of the optical wavelength, and 55%, 28%, and 30% in the MIR wavelength, strengthen the reprocessing scenario. The prevalent RWB trend observed in both optical and MIR wavelengths from the current sample on the longer time scales is likely associated with accretion disk instabilities.</description>

      <title>Turbulent drag on stellar mass black holes embedded in AGN discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate how AGN disk turbulence affects the orbital dynamics of a stellar-mass black hole (BH) initially located at a migration trap, focusing on the long-term behavior of eccentricity and inclination in the quasi-embedded regime. We develop a semi-analytical framework in which turbulence is modeled as a stochastic velocity field acting through a modified drag force. We integrate the resulting stochastic differential equations both in Cartesian coordinates and in orbital elements using a linearized perturbative approach, and compare these results with full numerical simulations. Eccentricity and inclination evolve toward steady-state Rayleigh distributions, with variances determined by the local disk properties and the ratio of the gas damping rate to the orbital frequency. The analytical predictions agree well with the numerical simulations. We provide closed-form expressions for the variances in both the fast and slow damping regimes. These results are directly applicable to Monte Carlo population models and can serve as physically motivated initial conditions for hydrodynamical simulations. Turbulent forcing prevents full circularization and alignment of BH orbits in AGN disks, even in the presence of strong gas drag. This has important implications for BH merger and binary formation rates, which are sensitive to the residual eccentricity and inclination. Our results highlight the need to account for turbulence-induced stochastic heating when modeling the dynamical evolution of compact objects in AGN environments.</description>

      <title>Distinct Fe-K Line Complexes in MAXI J1744-294 Revealed by XRISM High-Resolution Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22964v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The newly discovered Galactic transient MAXI J1744-294 went into its first X-ray outburst in 2025. We study the spectral properties of this source in the 2-10 keV energy band during this outburst using X-ray data from the XRISM satellite for both of its Resolve and Xtend instruments, taken on March 03, 2025. High-resolution spectroscopy has revealed, for the first time, complex iron line features in this source, corresponding to distinct components of Fe XXV emission and Fe XXVI absorption lines. Such a detailed structure has not been reported in other low-mass X-ray binaries to date, prior to the XRISM era. Our analysis shows that the line complexes arise from two highly ionized plasmas with ionization rate ~ 1000 erg-cm/s with distinct turbulent velocities: one broad (~2513 km/s) from hot gas at the inner accretion disk and one narrow (~153 km/s) scattered by nearby photoionized gas. These results offer new insight into the reprocessing of continuum in stratified media, either in the accretion disk or winds, or both, for XRBs in the soft state. The data are well described by models with spin, mass of the black hole, and accretion disk inclination 0.63-0.70, 5.7-10.1 Solar masses, and 19-24 degrees. The fitted spectral model parameters suggest that the source is in the soft spectral state. The source is situated in a crowded field near the Galactic center, resulting in a large hydrogen column density.</description>

      <title>GRB 241105A: A test case for GRB classification and rapid r-process nucleosynthesis channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) offer a powerful window to probe the progenitor systems responsible for the formation of heavy elements through the rapid neutron capture (r-) process, thanks to their exceptional luminosity, which allows them to be observed across vast cosmic distances. GRB 241105A, observed at a redshift of z = 2.681, features a short initial spike (1.5 s) and a prolonged weak emission lasting about 64 s, positioning it as a candidate for a compact binary merger and potentially marking it as the most distant merger-driven GRB observed to date. However, the emerging ambiguity in GRB classification necessitates further investigation into the burst's true nature. Prompt emission analyses, such as hardness ratio, spectral lag, and minimum variability timescales, yield mixed classifications, while machine learning-based clustering places GRB 241105A near both long-duration mergers and collapsar GRBs. We conducted observations using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to search for a potential supernova counterpart. Although no conclusive evidence was found for a supernova, the host galaxy's properties derived from the JWST observations suggest active star formation with low metallicity, and a sub-kpc offset of the afterglow from the host, which appears broadly consistent with a collapsar origin. Nevertheless, a compact binary merger origin cannot be ruled out, as the burst may plausibly arise from a fast progenitor channel. This would have important implications for heavy element enrichment in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>A Novel Pipeline for the Identification of New Gamma-Ray Blazars from the 4FGL-Xiang Catalog Based on Multi-wavelength Flux Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21503v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The identification and classification of Fermi blazars are core topics in high-energy astrophysics. To enable precise spatial cross-identification, we constructed two high-precision catalogs: the updated 4FGL-Xiang-DR2 (DR2) and a supplementary version of the fifth edition of Roma-BZCAT (\texttt{5BZCAT\_err}). We then developed and applied a novel four-step analytical pipeline combining cross-matching with the statistical analysis of multi-band flux distributions to identify new Fermi blazars. The analytical pipeline has yielded several key results in the systematic comparison of BZBs and BZQs. We found that among single statistical metrics, kurtosis is the most powerful discriminator (MAD~$&gt;$~1.64). At the overall distribution level, the 1.4~GHz, 843~MHz, 5~GHz, 0.1--2.4~keV, and 0.3--10~keV bands show significant divergence (JSD~$&gt;$~0.3). Building on these findings, our proposed ``Box-Cox$+$TND'' model successfully fits the observed flux distributions between BZBs and BZQs. Applying this entire pipeline, we successfully identified 17 new blazars. The validity of these associations is strongly supported by our multi-wavelength flux model, which confirms that 15 of the 17 candidates are statistically consistent with the known blazar population, falling within the $2\sigma$ confidence interval. Although the two remaining sources exhibit some statistical deviation in the gamma-ray band, their strong consistency in other wavebands, coupled with high spatial association probabilities, leads us to conclude that their associations are also reliable and should not be readily excluded.</description>

      <title>Does the high-energy AMS-02 positron flux originate from the dark matter density spikes around nearby black holes?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent measurements made by the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) have detected accurate positron flux for energy range 1-1000 GeV. The energy spectrum can be best described by two source terms: the low-energy background diffusion term and an unknown high-energy source term. In this article, we discuss the possibility of the emission of positrons originating from dark matter annihilation in two nearby black hole X-ray binaries A0620-00 and XTE J1118+480. We show that the dark matter density spikes around these two black holes can best produce the observed AMS-02 high-energy positron flux due to dark matter annihilation with rest mass $m_{\rm DM} \approx 8000$ GeV via the $W^+W^-$ annihilation channel. This initiates a new proposal to account for the unknown high-energy source term in the AMS-02 positron spectrum.</description>

      <title>Radiation GRMHD Models of Accretion onto Stellar-Mass Black Holes: II. Super-Eddington Accretion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of super-Eddington black hole accretion simulations that solve the GRMHD equations coupled with angle-discretized radiation transport. The simulations span a range of accretion rates, two black hole spins, and two magnetic field topologies, and include resolution studies as well as comparisons with non-radiative models. Super-Eddington accretion flows consistently develop geometrically thick disks supported by radiation pressure, regardless of magnetic field configuration. Radiation generated in the inner disk drives substantial outflows, forming conical funnel regions that limit photon escape and result in very low radiation efficiency. The accretion flows are highly turbulent with thermal energy transport dominated by radiation advection rather than diffusion. Angular momentum is primarily carried outward by Maxwell stress, with turbulent Reynolds stress playing a subdominant role. Both strong and weak jets are produced. Strong jets arise from sufficient net vertical magnetic flux and rapid black hole spin and can effectively evacuate the funnel, enabling radiation to escape through strong geometric beaming. In contrast, weak jets fail to clear the funnel, which becomes obscured by radiation-driven outflows and leads to distinct observational signatures. Spiral structures are observed in the plunging region, behaving like density waves. These super-Eddington models are applicable to a variety of astronomical systems, including ultraluminous X-ray sources, little red dots, and black hole transients.</description>

      <title>Artificial Precision Timing Array: bridging the decihertz gravitational-wave sensitivity gap with clock satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave astronomy has developed enormously over the last decade with the first detections and continuous development across broad frequency bands. However, the decihertz range has largely been left out of this development. Gravitational waves in this band are emitted by some of the most enigmatic sources, including intermediate-mass binary black hole mergers, early inspiraling compact binaries$\unicode{x2014}$whose late evolution and merger are seen by Earth-based detectors$\unicode{x2014}$, and possibly primordial gravitational waves. To tap this exciting band, we propose the construction of a detector based on pulsar timing principles, the Artificial Precision Timing Array (APTA). We envision APTA as a solar system array of artificial ``pulsars''$\unicode{x2014}$precision-time-reference-carrying satellites that emit periodic electromagnetic signals towards Earth or other satellite constellation centrum. In this fundamental study, we estimate the clock precision needed for APTA to be able to detect gravitational waves. Our results suggest that 6 satellites and a clock relative uncertainty of $10^{-18}$ at 1 s of averaging, which is currently attainable with atomic clocks, would be sufficient for APTA to reach pristine sensitivity in the decihertz band and be sensitive to $10^3\unicode{x2013}10^4$ $\mathrm{M}_\odot$ black hole mergers and the early inspiral of heavy LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA sources. Future time reference, oscillator, and clock technologies realistically expected in the next decade(s) would enable the detection of an increasingly diverse set of sources and allow APTA to reach a better sensitivity than other detector concepts proposed for the decihertz band. This work opens up a new area of research into designing and constructing gravitational-wave detectors relying on principles used successfully in pulsar timing.</description>

      <title>Tidal Resonance in Binary Neutron Star Inspirals: A High-Precision Study in Numerical Relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the tidal resonance of the fundamental ($f$-)mode in spinning neutron stars, robustly tracing the onset of the excitation to its saturation, using numerical relativity for the first time. We performed long-term ($\approx15$~orbits) fully relativistic simulations of a merger of two highly and retrogradely spinning neutron stars. The resonance window of the $f$-mode is extended by self-interaction, and the nonlinear resonance continues up to the final plunging phase. We observe that the quasi-circular orbit is maintained throughout since the dissipation of orbit motion due to the resonance is coherent with that due to gravitational waves. The $f$-mode resonance causes a variation in the stellar spin of $\gtrsim6.3\%$ in the linear regime and much more as $\sim33\%$ during the later nonlinear regime. At the merger, a phase shift of $\lesssim40$~radians is rendered in the gravitational waveform as a consequence of the angular momentum and energy transfers into the neutron star oscillations.</description>

      <title>Is your stochastic signal really detectable?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Separating a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) from noise is a challenging statistical task. One approach to establishing a detection criterion for the SGWB is using Bayesian evidence. If the evidence ratio (Bayes factor) between models with and without the signal exceeds a certain threshold, the signal is considered detected. We present a formalism to compute the averaged Bayes factor, incorporating instrumental-noise and SGWB uncertainties. As an example, we consider the case of power-law-shaped SGWB in LISA and generate the corresponding Bayesian sensitivity curve. Unlike existing methods in the literature, which typically neglect uncertainties in both the signal and noise, our approach provides a reliable and realistic alternative. This flexible framework opens avenues for more robust stochastic gravitational wave background detection across gravitational-wave experiments.</description>

Abstract: The lack of a dynamical framework within doubly special relativity theories has impeded the development of a corresponding phenomenology of modified interactions. In this work we show that in a model based on the classical basis of $\kappa$-Poincar\'e and total momentum conservation, one has a well-defined cross section of the photon-photon annihilation process, once a prescription for the channel treatment is set. The modification of the interaction can lead to observable effects in the opacity of the Universe to very high-energy gamma rays when the gamma-ray energy approaches the energy scale of the deformation. The magnitude and observability of this deformation are examined as functions of the gamma-ray energy and source distance.</description>

      <title>Exploring the role of accretion disk geometry in shaping black hole shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21148v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study black hole imaging in the context of geometrically thick accretion disks in Schwarzschild spacetime. By decomposing the emitting region into a set of one-dimensional luminous segments, each characterized by its inclination angle and inner radius, we construct transfer functions that capture key image features-namely, the direct image, lensing ring, and photon ring. This approach allows a unified treatment of disk geometry and viewing angle. We explore three regimes: optically thin, optically thick, and partially optically thick disks. For optically thin flows, increasing the disk thickness (characterized by the half-opening angle $\psi_0$) broadens the lensing ring, gradually bridging the photon ring and the direct image. The photon ring remains narrow, but its position robustly defines the innermost edge of the lensing structure. In the optically thick case, image features are primarily determined by the first intersection of traced light rays with the disk, and we provide analytical criteria for the presence of lensing and photon rings based on the critical deflection angles. For partially optically thick disks, we adopt a simplified radiative transport model and find a critical absorption coefficient $\chi \sim (6M\psi_0)^{-1}$ beyond which the image rapidly transitions from an optically thin- to thick-disk appearance. These results help clarify the respective roles of the photon and lensing rings across different disk configurations, and may offer a useful framework for interpreting future high-resolution black hole observations.</description>
