      <title>A Learnable Wavelet Transformer for Long-Short Equity Trading and Risk-Adjusted Return Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning profitable intraday trading policies from financial time series is challenging due to heavy noise, non-stationarity, and strong cross-sectional dependence among related assets. We propose \emph{WaveLSFormer}, a learnable wavelet-based long-short Transformer that jointly performs multi-scale decomposition and return-oriented decision learning. Specifically, a learnable wavelet front-end generates low-/high-frequency components via an end-to-end trained filter bank, guided by spectral regularizers that encourage stable and well-separated frequency bands. To fuse multi-scale information, we introduce a low-guided high-frequency injection (LGHI) module that refines low-frequency representations with high-frequency cues while controlling training stability. The model outputs a portfolio of long/short positions that is rescaled to satisfy a fixed risk budget, and is optimized directly with a trading objective and risk-aware regularization. Extensive experiments on five years of hourly data across six industry groups, evaluated over ten random seeds, demonstrate that WaveLSFormer consistently outperforms MLP, LSTM and Transformer backbones, with and without fixed discrete wavelet front-ends. On average in all industries, WaveLSFormer achieves a cumulative overall strategy return of $0.607 \pm 0.045$ and a Sharpe ratio of $2.157 \pm 0.166$, substantially improving both profitability and risk-adjusted returns over the strongest baselines.</description>

      <title>Brownian ReLU(Br-ReLU): A New Activation Function for a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models are effective for sequential data modeling, yet commonly used activation functions such as ReLU, LeakyReLU, and PReLU often exhibit gradient instability when applied to noisy, non-stationary financial time series. This study introduces BrownianReLU, a stochastic activation function induced by Brownian motion that enhances gradient propagation and learning stability in Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Using Monte Carlo simulation, BrownianReLU provides a smooth, adaptive response for negative inputs, mitigating the dying ReLU problem. The proposed activation is evaluated on financial time series from Apple, GCB, and the S&amp;P 500, as well as LendingClub loan data for classification. Results show consistently lower Mean Squared Error and higher $R^2$ values, indicating improved predictive accuracy and generalization. Although ROC-AUC metric is limited in classification tasks, activation choice significantly affects the trade-off between accuracy and sensitivity, with Brownian ReLU and the selected activation functions yielding practically meaningful performance.</description>

      <title>An Enhanced Focal Loss Function to Mitigate Class Imbalance in Auto Insurance Fraud Detection with Explainable AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02283v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detecting fraudulent auto-insurance claims remains a challenging classification problem, largely due to the extreme imbalance between legitimate and fraudulent cases. Standard learning algorithms tend to overfit to the majority class, resulting in poor detection of economically significant minority events. This paper proposes a structured three-stage training framework that integrates a convex surrogate of focal loss for stable initialization, a controlled non-convex intermediate loss to improve feature discrimination, and the standard focal loss to refine minority-class sensitivity. We derive conditions under which the surrogate retains convexity in the prediction space and show how this facilitates more reliable optimization when combined with deep sequential models. Using a proprietary auto-insurance dataset, the proposed method improves minority-class F1-scores and AUC relative to conventional focal-loss training and resampling baselines. The approach also provides interpretable feature-attribution patterns through SHAP analysis, offering transparency for actuarial and fraud-analytics applications.</description>
