      <title>The generalized Darboux matrices with the same poles and their applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Darboux transformation plays a key role in constructing explicit closed-form solutions of completely integrable systems. This paper provides an algebraic construction of generalized Darboux matrices with the same poles for the $2\times2$ Lax pair, in which the coefficient matrices are polynomials of spectral parameter. The first-order monic Darboux matrix is constructed explicitly and its classification theorem is presented. Then by using the solutions of the corresponding adjoint Lax pair, the $n$-order monic Darboux matrix and its inverse, both sharing the same unique pole, are derived explicitly. Further, a theorem is proposed to describe the invariance of Darboux matrix regarding pole distributions in Darboux matrix and its inverse. Finally, a unified theorem is offered to construct formal Darboux transformation in general form. All Darboux matrices expressible as the product of $n$ first-order monic Darboux matrices can be constructed in this way. The nonlocal focusing NLS equation, the focusing NLS equation and the Kaup-Boussinesq equation are taken as examples to illustrate the application of these Darboux transformations.</description>

      <title>Approximability of Poisson structures for the 4-vertex model, and the higher-spin XXX chain, and Yang-Baxter algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We implement the quantum inverse scattering method for the 4-vertex model. In comparison to previous works of the author which examined the 6-vertex, and 20-vertex, models, the 4-vertex model exhibits different characteristics, ranging from L-operators expressed in terms of projectors and Pauli matrices to algebraic and combinatorial properties, including Poisson structure and boxed plane partitions. With far fewer computations with an L-operator provided for the 4-vertex model by Bogoliubov in 2007, in comparison to those for L-operators of the 6, and 20, vertex models, from lower order expansions of the transfer matrix we derive a system of relations from the structure of operators that can be leveraged for studying characteristics of the higher-spin XXX chain in the weak finite volume limit. In comparison to quantum inverse scattering methods for the 6, and 20, vertex models which can be used to further study integrability, and exact solvability, an adaptation of such an approach for the 4-vertex model can be used to approximate, asymptotically in the weak finite volume limit, sixteen brackets which generate the Poisson structure. From explicit relations for operators of the 4-vertex transfer matrix, we conclude by discussing corresponding aspects of the Yang-Baxter algebra, which is closely related to the operators obtained from products of L-operators for approximating the transfer, and quantum monodromy, matrices. The structure of computations from L-operators of the 4-vertex model directly transfers to L-operators of the higher-spin XXX chain, revealing a similar structure of another Yang-Baxter algebra of interest.</description>

      <title>Legendre transformations of a class of generalized Frobenius manifolds and the associated integrable hierarchies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For two generalized Frobenius manifolds related by a Legendre-type transformation, we show that the associated integrable hierarchies of hydrodynamic type, which are called the Legendre-extended Principal Hierarchies, are related by a certain linear reciprocal transformation; we also show, under the semisimplicity condition, that the topological deformations of these Legendre-extended Principal Hierarchies are related by the same linear reciprocal transformation.</description>

      <title>On finite-temperature Fredholm determinants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider finite-temperature deformation of the sine kernel Fredholm determinants acting on the closed contours. These types of expressions usually appear as static two-point correlation functions in the models of free fermions and can be equivalently presented in terms of Toeplitz determinants. The corresponding symbol, or the phase shift, is related to the temperature weight. We present an elementary way to obtain large-distance asymptotic behavior even when the phase shift has a non-zero winding number. It is done by deforming the original kernel to the so-called effective form factors kernel that has a completely solvable matrix Riemann-Hilbert problem. This allows us to find explicitly the resolvent and address the subleading corrections. We recover Szego, Hartwig and Fisher, and Borodin-Okounkov asymptotic formulas.</description>

      <title>Integrability of Generalised Skew-Symmetric Replicator Equations via Graph Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that there is a one-to-one mapping between oriented directed graphs and zero-sum replicator dynamics (Lotka-Volterra equations) and that furthermore these dynamics are Hamiltonian in an appropriately defined nonlinear Poisson bracket. In this paper, we investigate the problem of determining whether these dynamics are Liouville-Arnold integrable, building on prior work graph in graph decloning by Evripidou et al. [J. Phys. A., 55:325201, 2022] and graph embedding by Paik and Griffin [Phys. Rev. E. 107(5): L052202, 2024]. Using the embedding procedure from Paik and Griffin, we show (with certain caveats) that when a graph producing integrable dynamics is embedded in another graph producing integrable dynamics, the resulting graph structure also produces integrable dynamics. We also construct a new family of graph structures that produces integrable dynamics that does not arise either from embeddings or decloning. We use these results, along with numerical methods, to classify the dynamics generated by almost all oriented directed graphs on six vertices, with three hold-out graphs that generate integrable dynamics and are not part of a natural taxonomy arising from known families and graph operations. These hold-out graphs suggest more structure is available to be found. Moreover, the work suggests that oriented directed graphs leading to integrable dynamics may be classifiable in an analogous way to the classification of finite simple groups, creating the possibility that there is a deep connection between integrable dynamics and combinatorial structures in graphs.</description>

      <title>A representation-theoretical approach to higher-dimensional Lie-Hamilton systems: The symplectic Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sp}(4,\mathbb{R})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new procedure for the construction of higher-dimensional Lie-Hamilton systems is proposed. This method is based on techniques belonging to the representation theory of Lie algebras and their realization by vector fields. The notion of intrinsic Lie-Hamilton system is defined, and a sufficiency criterion for this property given. Novel four-dimensional Lie-Hamilton systems arising from the fundamental representation of the symplectic Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sp}(4,\mathbb{R})$ are obtained and proved to be intrinsic. Two distinguished subalgebras, the two-photon Lie algebra $\mathfrak{h}_{6}$ and the Lorentz Lie algebra $\mathfrak{so}(1,3)$, are also considered in detail. As applications, coupled time-dependent systems which generalize the Bateman oscillator and the one-dimensional Caldirola-Kanai models are constructed, as well as systems depending on a time-dependent electromagnetic field and generalized coupled oscillators. A superposition rule for these systems, exhibiting interesting symmetry properties, is obtained using the coalgebra method.</description>

      <title>Lie-Hamilton systems on Riemannian and Lorentzian spaces from conformal transformations and some of their applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a generalization of two classes of Lie-Hamilton systems on the Euclidean plane to two-dimensional curved spaces, leading to novel Lie-Hamilton systems on Riemannian spaces (flat $2$-torus, product of hyperbolic lines, sphere and hyperbolic plane), pseudo-Riemannian spaces (anti-de Sitter, de Sitter, and Minkowski spacetimes), as well as to semi-Riemannian spaces (Newtonian or non-relativistic spacetimes). The vector fields, Hamiltonian functions, symplectic form and constants of the motion of the Euclidean classes are recovered by a contraction process. The construction is based on the structure of certain subalgebras of the so-called conformal algebras of the two-dimensional Cayley-Klein spaces. These curved Lie-Hamilton classes allow us to generalize naturally the Riccati, Kummer-Schwarz and Ermakov equations on the Euclidean plane to curved spaces, covering both the Riemannian and Lorentzian possibilities, and where the curvature can be considered as an integrable deformation parameter of the initial Euclidean system.</description>
