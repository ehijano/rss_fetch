      <title>The Proton Charge Radius from Dimuon Photoproduction off the Proton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the feasibility of measuring the proton charge radius through dimuon photoproduction off a proton target. Our findings indicate that the Bethe-Heitler mechanism, which dominates at small momentum transfers, allows for an extraction of the proton electromagnetic form factors in the extremely low $Q^2$ region below $10^{-3}$ GeV$^2$ in the spacelike region, when the incident photon beam energy exceeds several hundred MeV. The optimal kinematical region and a sensitivity study of the proton charge radius from dimuon photoproduction are presented. Such a measurement is expected to provide an alternative to the elastic muon-proton scattering measurements such as MUSE at PSI and AMBER at CERN.</description>

      <title>The MESA physics program</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01027v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the recent past, a comprehensive experimental program has been worked out at the Mainz Energy-Recovery Superconducting Accelerator, MESA, at the Institute of Nuclear Physics in Mainz. MESA is a high-intensity, low-energy electron accelerator presently under construction and will thereby provide great opportunities to perform a new generation of high-precision scattering experiments. The versatile MAGIX experiment will use MESA's innovative energy recovery technique, with a science focus on the study of hadron structure and few-body systems, dark sector searches, and investigations into reactions pertinent to nuclear astrophysics. An external beam line will supply spin-polarized electrons to the P2 experiment, enabling the performance of sensitive tests of the Standard Model through parity-violating electron scattering. The DarkMESA beam dump experiment, situated behind P2, is dedicated to the search for light dark matter particles.</description>

      <title>Experimental studies of the three nucleon system dynamics in the proton induced deuteron breakup at 108 MeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The differential cross sections for the $^2$H(p,pp)n reaction have been measured for 84 angular configurations of the outgoing protons in the range of polar angles from 13 to 33 degrees with a proton beam of 108 MeV. Data have been collected in the Cyclotron Center Bronowice (CCB) at the Institute of Nuclear Physics PAS in Cracow, using the BINA detector setup. Analysis leading to determination of the breakup cross section values is described. Absolute normalization is obtained by normalization to the simultaneously measured $^2$H(p,d)p scattering events.Experimental results are compared to the state-of-the-art theoretical calculations. Global analysis shows significant influence of the Coulomb interaction and small effects of three nucleon force in the studied phase space region.</description>

      <title>Single-Neutron Adding on $^{34}$S</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: Single-neutron adding data was collected in order to determine the distribution of the single-neutron strength of the $0f_{7/2}$, $1p_{3/2}$, $1p_{1/2}$ and $0f_{5/2}$ orbitals outside of $Z=16, N=18$, $^{34}$S.
  Methods: The $^{34}$S($d$,$p$)$^{35}$S reaction has been measured at 8 MeV/u to investigate cross sections to excited states in $^{35}$S. Outgoing proton yields and momenta were analyzed by the Super-Enge Split-Pole Spectrograph in conjunction with the CeBrA demonstrator located at the John D. Fox Laboratory at Florida State University. Angular distributions were compared with Distorted Wave Born Approximation calculations in order to extract single-neutron spectroscopic overlaps.
  Results: Spectroscopic overlaps and strengths were determined for states in $^{35}$S up through 6 MeV in excitation energy. Each orbital was observed to have fragmented strength where a single level carried the majority. The single-neutron centroids of the $0f_{7/2}$, $1p_{3/2}$, $1p_{1/2}$ and $0f_{5/2}$ orbitals were determined to be $2360^{+90}_{-40}$ keV, $3280^{+80}_{-50}$ keV, $4780^{+60}_{-40}$ keV, and $\gtrsim7500$ keV, respectively.
  Conclusion: A previous discrepancy in the literature with respect to distribution of the neutron $1p_{1/2}$ strength was resolved. The integration of the normalized spectroscopic strengths, up to 5.1 MeV in excitation energy, revealed fully-vacant occupancies for the $0f_{7/2}$, $1p_{3/2}$, and $1p_{1/2}$ orbitals, as expected. The spacing in the single-neutron energies highlighted a reduction in the traditional $N=28$ shell-gap, relative to both the $1p$ spin-orbit energy difference ($N=32$) and the lower limit on the $N=34$ shell spacing.</description>

      <title>Evolution and fluctuations of chiral chemical potential in heavy ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The possible appearance of the effects of local parity breaking in the QCD medium formed in heavy ion collisions due to violation of chiral symmetry can be quantified by corresponding chiral chemical potential $\mu_5$. The experimental observables sensitive to the effects of local parity violation in strong interaction include search for polarisation splitting of the $\rho_0$ and $\omega_0$ mesons via angular dependence of spectral functions in their decay to leptons. In this paper we study the space-time evolution and fluctuations of $\mu_5$ using relativistic hydrodynamics and estimate their effect on the light vector meson polarization splitting in Pb-Pb collisions at LHC energy.</description>

      <title>Most general neutron decay correlations: Standard Model recoil and radiative corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To continue from our previous work Phys.Rev.D 109(2024),073007, we derive the full Standard Model prediction of the most general free neutron differential decay rate with all massive particles (neutron, proton and electron) polarized, including the $\mathcal{O}(1/m_N)$ recoil corrections and $\mathcal{O}(\alpha/\pi)$ radiative corrections. For the latter we adopt the newly-developed pseudo-neutrino formalism which is compatible to realistic experimental setups, in which neutrinos and photons are not detected. We also provide readily-executable Mathematica notebooks to evaluate these corrections.</description>
