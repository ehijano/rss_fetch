      <title>Weak Superfluidity in Twisted Optical Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A controlled twist between different underlying lattices allows one to interpolate, under a unified framework, across ordered and (quasi-)disordered matter while drastically changing quantum transport properties. Here, we use quantum Monte Carlo simulations to determine the unique phase diagrams of strongly-correlated ultracold bosons in twisted optical potentials. We show that at commensurate twisting angles, spectral gaps govern the formation of insulating patterns, separated by thin superfluid domains. The latter form weak superfluids, which are very sensitive to thermal fluctuations, but can be stabilized under appropriate parameter control. In contrast, slightly changing the twisting angle to a incommensurate value destroys most spectral gaps, leaving behind a prominent Bose glass phase. Our results are directly applicable to current generation experiments that quantum simulate moir\'e physics.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometry of bosonic Bogoliubov quasiparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological and geometrical features arising in bosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) systems have mainly been studied by utilizing a generalized symplectic version of the Berry curvature and related Chern numbers. Here, we propose a symplectic quantum geometric tensor (SQGT), whose imaginary part leads to the previously studied symplectic Berry curvature, while the real part gives rise to a symplectic quantum metric, providing a natural distance measure in the space of bosonic Bogoliubov modes. We propose how to measure all components of the SQGT by extracting excitation rates in response to periodic modulations of the systems' parameters. Moreover, we connect the symplectic Berry curvature to a generalized symplectic anomalous velocity term for Bogoliubov Bloch wave packets. We test our results for a bosonic Bogoliubov-Haldane model.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Instabilities of Strongly Interacting Ultracold Fermions in an Optical Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent quench experiments on ultra cold fermions in optical cavities provide a clean platform for studying how long-range interactions between fermions structure their dynamics. Motivated by these experiments, we provide a theoretical analysis of the dynamical instabilities that lead to the formation of superradiance as the hybrid system is driven across the self-organization transition. We compute the rate at which order forms and quantify the fluctuations of the pre-quench state which seed the instability. Our results quantitatively match existing experiments on free fermions and make predictions for quench experiments involving near unitary fermi gases coupled to an optical cavity. Our work suggests that the non-local nature of the photon-mediated interactions between fermions generates ordering dynamics that are qualitatively different than those observed in short-range interacting systems.</description>

      <title>Bose-Einstein condensation of polaritons at room temperature in a GaAs/AlGaAs structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the canonical properties of Bose-Einstein condensation of polaritons, seen previously in many low-temperature experiments, at room temperature in a GaAs/AlGaAs structure. These effects include a nonlinear energy shift of the polaritons, showing that they are not non-interacting photons, and dramatic line narrowing due to coherence, giving coherent emission with spectral width of 0.24 meV at room temperature with no external stabilization. This opens up the possibility of room temperature nonlinear optical devices based on polariton condensation.</description>

      <title>Perspective: Interactions mediated by atoms, photons, electrons, and excitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactions between quasiparticles mediated by a surrounding environment are ubiquitous and lead to a range of important effects from collective modes of low temperature quantum gases, superconductivity, to the interaction between elementary particles at high energies. This perspective article is motivated by experimental progress in the fields of quantum degenerate atomic gases, cavity QED, and two-dimensional (2D) semi-conductors, which enable a systematic exploration of mediated interactions in new settings and regimes. We first describe how to microscopically calculate the quasiparticle interaction using perturbation theory, diagrammatics, and the path integral, highlighting the key role played by the quantum statistics of the quasiparticles. Recent theoretical and experimental insights into quasiparticle and mediated interactions in general obtained from atomic gases are then discussed, after which we focus on hybrid light-atom systems where a remarkable long range photon mediated interaction can be realised. Next, we describe new and puzzling results regarding the interaction between quasiparticles in 2D semiconductors. We then discuss how mediated interactions open up ways to realise new quantum phases in atomic and hybrid atom-photon systems as well as 2D semiconductors, and the perspective ends by posing some open questions and outlook.</description>

      <title>Quantum analog to flapping of flags: interface instability for co-flow binary superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the interface dynamics in immiscible binary superfluids using its holographic description, which naturally consists of an inviscid superfluid component and a viscous normal fluid component. We give the first theoretical realization of interface instability for two superfluid components moving with identical velocity, providing a quantum analog to the flapping of flags that is common in daily life. This behavior is in sharp contrast to the one from Gross-Pitaevskii equation for which no such co-flow instability develops in an isolated uniform system because of Galilean invariance. The real time evolution triggered by the dynamical instability exhibits intricate nonlinear patterns leading to quantum turbulence reminiscent of the quantum Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. Moreover, we show that such interface dynamics is essentially different from the Landau instability for which the frictionless flow becomes thermodynamically unstable above a critical superfluid velocity. Our study uncovers the rich interface dynamics of quantum fluids and the emergence of complex flow phenomena.</description>

      <title>Synthetic spin-orbit coupling for the multi-spin models in optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The essential role of synthetic spin-orbit coupling in discovering new topological matter phases with cold atoms is widely acknowledged. However, the engineering of spin-orbit coupling remains unclear for arbitrary-spin models due to the complexity of spin matrices. In this work, we develop a more general but relatively straightforward method to achieve spin-orbit coupling for multi-spin models. Our approach hinges on controlling the coupling between distinct pseudo-spins through two intermediary states, resulting in tunneling with spin flips that have direction-dependent strength. The engineered spin-orbit coupling can facilitate topological phase transitions with Chern numbers over 1, a unique characteristic of multi-spin models compared to spin-1/2 models. By utilizing existing cold atom techniques, our proposed method provides an ideal platform for investigating topological properties related to large Chern numbers.</description>

      <title>Emergent Universal Drag Law in a Model of Superflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the fundamentally different dissipation mechanisms, many laws and phenomena of classical turbulence equivalently manifest in quantum turbulence. The Reynolds law of dynamical similarity states that two objects of same geometry across different length scales are hydrodynamically equivalent under the same Reynolds number, leading to a universal drag coefficient law. In this work we confirm the existence of a universal drag law in a superfluid wake, facilitated by the nucleation of quantized vortices. We numerically study superfluid flow across a range of Reynolds numbers for the paradigmatic classical hard-wall and the Gaussian obstacle, popular in experimental quantum hydrodynamics. In addition, we provide a feasible method for measuring superfluid drag forces in an experimental environment using control volumes.</description>

      <title>Quantum vortices in fermionic superfluids: from ultracold atoms to neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superfluid dilute neutron matter and ultracold gas, close to the unitary regime, exhibit several similarities. Therefore, to a certain extent, fermionic ultracold gases may serve as emulators of dilute neutron matter, which forms the inner crust of neutron stars and is not directly accessed experimentally. Quantum vortices are one of the most significant properties of neutron superfluid, essential for comprehending neutron stars' dynamics. The structure and dynamics of quantum vortices as a function of pairing correlations' strength are being investigated experimentally and theoretically in ultracold gases. Certain aspects of these studies are relevant to neutron stars. We provide an overview of the characteristics of quantum vortices in s-wave-type fermionic and electrically neutral superfluids. The main focus is on the dynamics of fermionic vortices and their intrinsic structure.</description>

      <title>Measurement of Many-Body Quantum Correlations in Superconducting Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in superconducting circuit technology have made the fabrication of large, customizable circuits routine. This has led to their application to areas beyond quantum information and, in particular, to their use as quantum simulators. A key challenge in this effort has been the identification of the quantum states realized by these circuits. Here, we propose a probe circuit capable of reading out many-body correlations in an analog quantum simulator. Our measurement scheme, designed for many-photon states, exploits the non-linearity of the Josephson junction to measure two-point (and potentially higher-order) correlation functions of the superconducting phase operator. We demonstrate the capabilities of this design in the context of an LC-ladder with a quantum impurity. The proposed probe allows for the measurement of inherently quantum correlations, such as squeezing, and has the potential to significantly expand the scope of analog quantum simulations using superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>Measurement of exciton fraction of microcavity exciton-polaritons using transfer-matrix modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a careful calibration of the exciton fraction of polaritons in high-$Q$ ($\sim 300,000$), long-lifetime ($\sim 300$ ps), GaAs/AlGaAs microcavities.This is a crucial parameter for many-body theories which include the polariton-polariton interactions.It is much harder to establish this number in high-$Q$ structures compared to low-$Q$ structures, because the upper polariton is nearly invisible in high-$Q$ cavities.We present a combination of photoluminescence, photoluminescence excitation, and reflectivity measurements to highly constrain the fit model, and compare the results of this model to the results from low-$Q$ structures.We present a fitted curve of exciton fraction as a function of the lower polariton energy for multiple samples which have been used in prior experiments.</description>

      <title>Origin of the hidden energy scale and the $f$-ratio in geometrically frustrated magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sufficiently clean geometrically frustrated (GF) magnets are the largest class of candidate materials that may host quantum spin liquids (QSLs). Some of them have been shown to exhibit spin-glass freezing, potentially precluding QSLs, at the "hidden energy scale", which is significantly lower than the microscopic energy scale of spin interactions. Here, we investigate the origin of the hidden energy scale and its relationship to the $f$-ratio, the figure of merit for the degree of frustration in GF magnetic materials. The available experimental and numerical data provide evidence that GF magnets display, universally, two distinct temperature scales in the specific heat, the lowest of which is of the order of the hidden energy scale $T^*$. We argue that this scale is determined by non-magnetic excitations, similar to spin exchanges in chains of spins. The collective entropy of such excitations matches the entropy of the ground states of the Ising model on the same lattice, which provides a way to verify the proposed scenario in experiment. We further confirm this scenario of the hidden energy scale by numerical simulations of spins on the kagome lattice. As $T^*$ is a property of the clean GF medium, it leads to a constraint on the $f$-ratio.</description>

      <title>Amplitude Amplification and Estimation using quantum kicked rotor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum kicked rotor had been widely used for studying quantum chaos and the physics of Anderson localization. It is shown that QKR can be used to design a quantum algorithm to perform unstructured search. This is illustrated through amplitude amplification, a generalization of Grover's search algorithm, using QKR system. Further, QKR is employed for amplitude estimation when the amplitude of the marked states is unknown. It is also shown that dynamical localization in QKR can be exploited to enhance the performance of the amplitude amplification algorithm by reducing the average runtime. The sensitivity of the success probability of unstructured search to detuning from resonance and the effects of noisy kick strengths are analyzed and the robustness of the QKR based algorithm is shown. The experimental feasibility of every component of the algorithm is discussed.</description>

      <title>Quantifying non-Hermiticity using single- and many-particle quantum properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian paradigm of quantum systems displays salient features drastically different from Hermitian counterparts. In this work, we focus on one such aspect, the difference of evolving quantum ensembles under $H_{\mathrm{nh}}$ (right ensemble) versus its Hermitian conjugate, $H_{\mathrm{nh}}^{\dagger}$ (left ensemble). We propose a formalism that quantifies the (dis-)similarity of these right and left ensembles, for single- as well as many-particle quantum properties. Such a comparison gives us a scope to measure the extent to which non-Hermiticity gets translated from the Hamiltonian into physically observable properties. We test the formalism in two cases: First, we construct a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian using a set of imperfect Bell states, showing that the non-Hermiticity of the Hamiltonian does not automatically comply with the non-Hermiticity at the level of observables. Second, we study the interacting Hatano--Nelson model with asymmetric hopping as a paradigmatic quantum many-body Hamiltonian. Interestingly, we identify situations where the measures of non-Hermiticity computed for the Hamiltonian, for single-, and for many-particle quantum properties behave distinctly from each other. Thus, different notions of non-Hermiticity can become useful in different physical scenarios. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the measures can mark the model's Parity--Time (PT) symmetry-breaking transition. Our findings can be instrumental in unveiling new exotic quantum phases of non-Hermitian quantum many-body systems as well as in preparing resourceful states for quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-stabilizer states are a fundamental resource for universal quantum computation. However,despite broad significance in quantum computing, the emergence of "many-body" non-stabilizerness in interacting quantum systems remains poorly understood due to its analytical intractability. Here we show that Rydberg atom arrays provide a natural reservoir of non-stabilizerness that extends beyond single qubits and arises from quantum correlations engendered by the Rydberg blockade. We demonstrate that this non-stabilizerness can be experimentally accessed in two complementary ways, either by performing quench dynamics or via adiabatic ground state preparation. Using the analytical framework based on matrix product states, we explain the origin of Rydberg nonstabilizerness via a quantum circuit decomposition of the wave function.</description>

      <title>Generation of many-body entanglement by collective coupling of atom pairs to cavity photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generation of many-body entangled states in atomic samples should be fast, as this process always involves a subtle interplay between desired quantum effects and unwanted decoherence. Here we identify a controllable and scalable catalyst that allows metrologically useful entangled states to be generated at a high rate. This is achieved by immersing a collection of bosonic atoms, trapped in a double-well potential, in an optical cavity. In the dispersive regime, cavity photons collectively couple pairs of atoms in their ground state to a molecular state, effectively generating, photon-number dependent atom-atom interactions. These effective interactions entangle atoms at a rate that strongly scales with both the number of photons and the number of atoms. As a consequence, the characteristic time scale of entanglement formation can be much shorter than for bare atom-atom interactions, effectively eliminating the decoherence due to photon losses. Here, the control of the entanglement generation rate does not require the use of Feshbach resonances, where magnetic field fluctuations can contribute to decoherence. Our protocol may find applications in future quantum sensors or other systems where controllable and scalable many-body entanglement is desired.</description>

Abstract: A central requirement for the faithful implementation of large-scale lattice gauge theories (LGTs) on quantum simulators is the protection of the underlying gauge symmetry. Recent advancements in the experimental realizations of large-scale LGTs have been impressive, albeit mostly restricted to Abelian gauge groups. Guided by this requirement for gauge protection, we propose an experimentally feasible approach to implement large-scale non-Abelian $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ and $\mathrm{U}(N)$ LGTs with dynamical matter in $d+1$D, enabled by two-body spin-exchange interactions realizing local emergent gauge-symmetry stabilizer terms. We present two concrete proposals for $2+1$D $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and $\mathrm{U}(2)$ LGTs, including dynamical bosonic matter and induced plaquette terms, that can be readily implemented in current ultracold-molecule and next-generation ultracold-atom platforms. We provide numerical benchmarks showcasing experimentally accessible dynamics, and demonstrate the stability of the underlying non-Abelian gauge invariance. We develop a method to obtain the effective gauge-invariant model featuring the relevant magnetic plaquette and minimal gauge-matter coupling terms. Our approach paves the way towards near-term realizations of large-scale non-Abelian quantum link models in analog quantum simulators.</description>

Abstract: Using the Bethe ansatz (BA), we rigorously obtain non-equilibrium dynamics of an impurity with a large initial momentum $Q$ in the one-dimensional (1D) interacting bosonic medium. We show that magnon and exciton-like states obtained from the BA equations drastically determine the oscillation nature of the quantum flutter with the periodicity given by $\tau_{\rm QF} = 2\pi/(|\varepsilon_{\rm c}(0)|- |\varepsilon_{\rm s}(0)|)$. Where the charge and spin dressed energies $\varepsilon_{\rm c,s}(0)$ are precisely given by the thermodynamical BA equations. While we further find a persistent revival dynamics of the impurity with a larger periodicity $\tau_{L} = L/\left(v_{\rm c}(Q-k^*)-v_{\rm s}(k^*)\right)$ than $\tau_{\rm QF}$, manifesting a quantum reflection induced by the periodic boundary conditions of a finite length $L$, here $v_{\rm c,s}$ are the sound velocities of charge and spin excitations, respectively, and $k^*$ is a characteristic momentum of the impurity to the Fermi point. Finally, we study the application of such a magnon impurity as a quantum resource for measuring the gravitational force.</description>

      <title>Topological Unwinding in an Exciton-Polariton Condensate Array</title>

Abstract: The phase distribution in a Bose-Einstein condensate can realize various topological states classified by distinct winding numbers. While states with different winding numbers are topologically protected in the linear Schr\"odinger equation, when nonlinearities are introduced, violations of the topological protection can occur, leading to unwinding. Exciton-polariton condensates constitute a nonlinear open-dissipative system that is well suited to studying such physics. Here we show that a one-dimensional array of exciton-polariton condensates displays a spontaneous phase unwinding from a $\pi$- to zero-state. We clarify that this collective mode transition is caused by the combined effect of nonlinearity and topological defects in the condensates. While the mode-switching phenomenon observed in our previous experiment was interpreted as the single-particle mode competition, we offer an alternative explanation in terms the collective phase unwinding and find its evidence by reanalyzing the experimental data. Our results open a route towards active control of the mode switching by manipulating the topological defects in prospective quantum polaritonic devices.</description>

      <title>Scale invariance of a spherical unitary Fermi gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A unitary Fermi gas in an isotropic harmonic trap is predicted to show scale and conformal symmetry that have important consequences in its thermodynamic and dynamical properties. By experimentally realizing a unitary Fermi gas in an isotropic harmonic trap, we demonstrate its universal expansion dynamics along each direction and at different temperatures. We show that as a consequence of SO(2,1) symmetry, the measured release energy is equal to that of the trapping energy. We further observe the breathing mode with an oscillation frequency twice the trapping frequency and a small damping rate, providing the evidence of SO(2,1) symmetry. In addition, away from resonance when scale invariance is broken, we determine the effective exponent $\gamma$ that relates the chemical potential and average density along the BEC-BCS crossover, which qualitatively agrees with the mean field predictions. This work opens the possibility of studying non-equilibrium dynamics in a conformal invariant system in the future.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Optimization for Robust State Preparation in Quantum Many-Body Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: New generations of ultracold-atom experiments are continually raising the demand for efficient solutions to optimal control problems. Here, we apply Bayesian optimization to improve a state-preparation protocol recently implemented in an ultracold-atom system to realize a two-particle fractional quantum Hall state. Compared to manual ramp design, we demonstrate the superior performance of our optimization approach in a numerical simulation - resulting in a protocol that is 10x faster at the same fidelity, even when taking into account experimentally realistic levels of disorder in the system. We extensively analyze and discuss questions of robustness and the relationship between numerical simulation and experimental realization, and how to make the best use of the surrogate model trained during optimization. We find that numerical simulation can be expected to substantially reduce the number of experiments that need to be performed with even the most basic transfer learning techniques. The proposed protocol and workflow will pave the way toward the realization of more complex many-body quantum states in experiments.</description>

Abstract: Using exact solutions of the three-body problem, the spectrum of non efimovian three-body resonances for two identical particles interacting with another one is derived in the regime of large but finite scattering length. The universality of the problem is depicted by using a contact model in the generalized effective range approximation, parameterized by two three-body parameters and the scattering length.</description>

Abstract: We present here various techniques to work with clean and disordered quantum Ising chains, for the benefit of students and non-experts. Starting from the Jordan-Wigner transformation, which maps spin-1/2 systems into fermionic ones, we review some of the basic approaches to deal with the superconducting correlations that naturally emerge in this context. In particular, we analyse the form of the ground state and excitations of the model, relating them to the symmetry-breaking physics, and illustrate aspects connected to calculating dynamical quantities, thermal averages, correlation functions and entanglement entropy. A few problems provide simple applications of the techniques.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-Preserving Quadratic Lindbladian and Dissipation Driven Topological Transitions in Gaussian States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.04345v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamical evolution of an open quantum system can be governed by the Lindblad equation of the density matrix. In this paper, we propose to characterize the density matrix topology by the topological invariant of its modular Hamiltonian. Since the topological classification of such Hamiltonians depends on their symmetry classes, a primary issue we address is determining the requirement for the Lindbladian operators, under which the modular Hamiltonian can preserve its symmetry class during the dynamical evolution. We solve this problem for the fermionic Gaussian state and for the modular Hamiltonian being a quadratic operator of a set of fermionic operators. When these conditions are satisfied, along with a nontrivial topological classification of the symmetry class of the modular Hamiltonian, a topological transition can occur as time evolves. We present two examples of dissipation-driven topological transitions where the modular Hamiltonian lies in the AIII class with U(1) symmetry and the DIII class without U(1) symmetry. By a finite size scaling, we show that this density matrix topology transition occurs at a finite time. We also present the physical signature of this transition.</description>

      <title>Superfluid extension of the self-consistent time-dependent band theory for neutron star matter: Anti-entrainment versus superfluid effects in the slab phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03327v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background: The inner crust of neutron stars consists of a Coulomb lattice of neutron-rich nuclei, immersed in a sea of superfluid neutrons with background relativistic electron gas. A proper quantum mechanical treatment for such a system under a periodic potential is the band theory of solids. The effect of band structure on the effective mass of dripped neutrons, the so-called \textit{entrainment effect}, is currently in a debatable situation, and it has been highly desired to develop a nuclear band theory taking into account neutron superfluidity in a fully self-consistent manner.
  Purpose: The main purpose of the present work is twofold: 1) to develop a formalism of the time-dependent self-consistent band theory, taking full account of nuclear superfluidity, based on time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) extended for superfluid systems, and 2) to quantify the effects of band structure and superfluidity on crustal properties, applying the formalism to the slab phase of nuclear matter in the $\beta$ equilibrium.
  Results: Static calculations have been performed for a range of baryon (nucleon) number density ($n_b=0.04-0.07$ fm$^{-3}$) under the $\beta$-equilibrium condition with and without superfluidity, for various inter-slab spacings. From a dynamic response to an external potential, we extract the collective mass of a slab and that of protons immersed in neutron superfluid. From the results, we find that the collective mass of a slab is substantially reduced by 57.5--82.5\% for $n_b=0.04-0.07$ fm$^{-3}$, which corresponds to an enhancement of conduction neutron number density and, thus, to a reduction of the neutron effective mass, which we call the anti-entrainment effect. We discuss novel phenomena associated with superfluidity, quasiparticle resonances in the inner crust, which are absent in normal systems.

      <title>Adaptive Trotterization for time-dependent Hamiltonian quantum dynamics using piecewise conservation laws</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Digital quantum simulation relies on Trotterization to discretize time evolution into elementary quantum gates. On current quantum processors with notable gate imperfections, there is a critical tradeoff between improved accuracy for finer timesteps, and increased error rate on account of the larger circuit depth. We present an adaptive Trotterization algorithm to cope with time-dependent Hamiltonians, where we propose a concept of piecewise "conserved" quantities to estimate errors in the time evolution between two (nearby) points in time; these allow us to bound the errors accumulated over the full simulation period. They reduce to standard conservation laws in the case of time-independent Hamiltonians, for which we first developed an adaptive Trotterization scheme [PRX Quantum 4, 030319]. We validate the algorithm for a time-dependent quantum spin chain, demonstrating that it can outperform the conventional Trotter algorithm with a fixed step size at a controlled error.</description>

Abstract: We propose a minimal setup for a quantum heat pump, consisting of two tunnel-coupled quantum dots, each hosting a single level and each being coupled to a different fermionic reservoir. The working principle relies on both non-Markovian system-bath coupling and driving induced resonant coupling. We describe the system using a reaction-coordinate mapping in combination with Floquet-Born-Markov theory and characterize its performance.</description>

      <title>Exceptional nexus in Bose-Einstein condensates with collective dissipation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In multistate non-Hermitian systems, higher-order exceptional points and exotic phenomena with no analogues in two-level systems arise. A paradigm is the exceptional nexus (EX), a third-order EP as the cusp singularity of exceptional arcs (EAs), that has a hybrid topological nature. Using atomic Bose-Einstein condensates to implement a dissipative three-state system, we experimentally realize an EX within a two-parameter space, despite the absence of symmetry. The engineered dissipation exhibits density dependence due to the collective atomic response to resonant light. Based on extensive analysis of the system's decay dynamics, we demonstrate the formation of an EX from the coalescence of two EAs with distinct geometries. These structures arise from the different roles played by dissipation in the strong coupling limit and quantum Zeno regime. Our work paves the way for exploring higher-order exceptional physics in the many-body setting of ultracold atoms.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of a Generalized Dicke Model for Spin-1 Atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Dicke model is a staple of theoretical cavity Quantum Electrodynamics (cavity QED), describing the interaction between an ensemble of atoms and a single radiation mode of an optical cavity. It has been studied both quantum mechanically and semiclassically for two-level atoms, and demonstrates a rich variety of dynamics such as phase transitions, phase multistability, and chaos. In this work we explore an open, spin-1 Dicke model with independent co- and counter-rotating coupling terms as well as a quadratic Zeeman shift enabling control over the atomic energy-level structure. We investigate the stability of operator and moment equations under two approximations and show the system undergoes phase transitions. To compliment these results, we relax the aforementioned approximations and investigate the system semiclassically. We show evidence of phase transitions to steady-state and oscillatory superradiance in this semiclassical model, as well as the emergence of chaotic dynamics. The varied and complex behaviours admitted by the model highlights the need to more rigorously map its dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02248v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fractonic matter can undergo unconventional phase transitions driven by the condensation of particles that move along subdimensional manifolds. We propose that this type of quantum critical point can be realized in a bilayer of crossed Rydberg chains. This system exhibits a transition between a disordered phase and a charge-density-wave phase with subextensive ground state degeneracy. We show that this transition is described by a stack of critical Ising conformal field theories that become decoupled in the low-energy limit due to emergent subsystem symmetries. We also analyze the transition using a Majorana mean-field approach for an effective lattice model, which confirms the picture of a fixed point of decoupled critical chains. We discuss the unusual scaling properties and derive anisotropic correlators that provide signatures of subdimensional criticality in this realistic setup.</description>
