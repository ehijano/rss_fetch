      <title>Embedding Economic Incentives in Social Networks Shape the Diffusion of Digital Technological Innovation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The digital innovation accompanied by explicit economic incentives have fundamentally changed the process of innovation diffusion. As a representative of digital innovation, NFTs provide a decentralized and secure way to authenticate and trade digital assets, offering the potential for new revenue streams in the digital space. However, current researches about NFTs mainly focus on their transaction networks and community culture, leaving the interplay among diffusion dynamics, economic dynamics, and social constraints on Twitter. By collecting and analyzing NFTs-related tweet dataset, the motivations of retweeters, the information mechanisms behind emojis, and the networked-based diffusion dynamics is systematically investigated. Results indicate that Retweeting is fueled by Freemint and trading information, with the higher economic incentives as a major motivation and some potential organizational tendencies. The diffusion of NFT is primarily driven by a 'Ringed-layered' information mechanism involving individual promoters and speculators. Both the frequency and presentation of content contribute positively to the growth of the retweet network. This study contributes to the innovation diffusion theory with economic incentives embedded.</description>

      <title>Modeling social interaction dynamics using temporal graph networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating intelligent systems, such as robots, into dynamic group settings poses challenges due to the mutual influence of human behaviors and internal states. A robust representation of social interaction dynamics is essential for effective human-robot collaboration. Existing approaches often narrow their focus to facial expressions or speech, overlooking the broader context. We propose employing an adapted Temporal Graph Networks to comprehensively represent social interaction dynamics while enabling its practical implementation. Our method incorporates temporal multi-modal behavioral data including gaze interaction, voice activity and environmental context. This representation of social interaction dynamics is trained as a link prediction problem using annotated gaze interaction data. The F1-score outperformed the baseline model by 37.0%. This improvement is consistent for a secondary task of next speaker prediction which achieves an improvement of 29.0%. Our contributions are two-fold, including a model to representing social interaction dynamics which can be used for many downstream human-robot interaction tasks like human state inference and next speaker prediction. More importantly, this is achieved using a more concise yet efficient message passing method, significantly reducing it from 768 to 14 elements, while outperforming the baseline model.</description>

      <title>Social Learning in Community Structured Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional social learning frameworks consider environments with a homogeneous state, where each agent receives observations conditioned on that true state of nature. In this work, we relax this assumption and study the distributed hypothesis testing problem in a heterogeneous environment, where each agent can receive observations conditioned on their own personalized state of nature (or truth). We particularly focus on community structured networks, where each community admits their own true hypothesis. This scenario is common in various contexts, such as when sensors are spatially distributed, or when individuals in a social network have differing views or opinions. We show that the adaptive social learning strategy is a preferred choice for nonstationary environments, and allows each cluster to discover its own truth.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Networks Representation and Learning: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Network data has become widespread, larger, and more complex over the years. Traditional network data is dyadic, capturing the relations among pairs of entities. With the need to model interactions among more than two entities, significant research has focused on higher-order networks and ways to represent, analyze, and learn from them. There are two main directions to studying higher-order networks. One direction has focused on capturing higher-order patterns in traditional (dyadic) graphs by changing the basic unit of study from nodes to small frequently observed subgraphs, called motifs. As most existing network data comes in the form of pairwise dyadic relationships, studying higher-order structures within such graphs may uncover new insights. The second direction aims to directly model higher-order interactions using new and more complex representations such as simplicial complexes or hypergraphs. Some of these models have long been proposed, but improvements in computational power and the advent of new computational techniques have increased their popularity. Our goal in this paper is to provide a succinct yet comprehensive summary of the advanced higher-order network analysis techniques. We provide a systematic review of its foundations and algorithms, along with use cases and applications of higher-order networks in various scientific domains.</description>
