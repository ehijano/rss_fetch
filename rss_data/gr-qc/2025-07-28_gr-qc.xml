      <title>Detecting dark objects in the Solar System with Gravitational Wave observatories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark objects streaming into the solar system can be probed using gravitational wave (GW) experiments through the perturbations that they would induce on the detector test masses. In this work, we study the detectability of the resulting gravitational signal for a number of current and future GW observatories. Dark matter in the form of clumps or primordial black holes with masses in the range $10^7$-$10^{11}\,\rm{g}$ can be detected with the proposed DECIGO experiment.</description>

      <title>There and back again: outspiralling motion in non-Kerr compact objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Keplerian dynamics, a test body orbiting a point particle in circular motion has a monotonically increasing frequency, with decreasing radius. If a dissipative channel is introduced, such as gravitational wave (GW) emission, (say) under the quadrupole approximation, the corresponding GW strain has an ever increasing frequency with time. A similar statement holds for equatorial motion of a test particle on the Kerr manifold, except such inspiral is cut off at the ISCO, wherein stable circular orbits cease to exist and a plunge is expected. We analyse circular timelike orbits in generic spinning spacetimes and study the conditions in which exotic motion can occur, due to the presence of non-Kerr features. In particular, we derive conditions under which an inspiral towards a compact object is naturally followed by an outspiral motion, and give concrete examples, as well as the corresponding GW phenomenology. This analysis serves both as a theoretical exploration of non-Kerrness as well as an example of a concrete smoking gun of exotic spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Slow-Fast Evolution of Scalar Fields in Higher-Order Cosmological Gravity: Dynamics Inspired by the Pais--Uhlenbeck Oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the cosmological dynamics of scalar fields governed by higher-order gravity, with particular emphasis on models inspired by the Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator--a prototypical fourth-order system known for its connection to ghost-free formulations. By recasting the field equations into a slow-fast dynamical system, we analyze phase space evolution across exponential and power-law coupling regimes. Our approach integrates numerical simulations and geometric methods to visualize trajectories, stream flows, and asymptotic behavior under varying potential parameters. The underlying system admits singular surfaces and non-smooth transitions, revealing intricate dynamical structures. We examine the stability of de Sitter solutions, the crossing of the phantom divide, and the emergence of cyclic behavior through multiple-scale analysis. The inclusion of radiation and dust fluids enables the creation of realistic cosmological scenarios, including a transient matter-dominated era and a late-time accelerated expansion. Our results highlight the viability of Pais-Uhlenbeck scalar models in accounting for inflationary dynamics and dark energy, offering diagnostic tools for characterizing attractors and bifurcation phenomena in higher-derivative cosmology.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Peep Contributions to Background Signal Confusion Noise for LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-body gravitational interactions will occasionally lead to a stellar-mass compact object entering a very highly eccentric orbit around a massive black hole at the center of a galaxy. Gravitational radiation damping will subsequently result in an extreme mass ratio inspiral. Much of the inspiral time of these events is spent with the compact object on a long-period orbit, with a brief burst of gravitational wave emission at periapsis firmly in the mHz band. Burst orbits have been previously modeled as parabolic, with a focus on extreme examples that could be detectable by space-based gravitational wave detectors. This work focuses on the recurring bursts called "peeps". Peeps are not likely to be individually resolvable; however, it is also important to consider them as possible sources of signal confusion noise because they do generate a signal within the LISA band with every pericenter passage. To account for peeps, we must utilize estimates for EMRI capture parameters along with tracking the massive black hole population out to a redshift of 3 using the Illustris Project. Then, this population is combined with an EMRI formation rate to estimate the number of EMRI events per unit volume for LISA. In this study, we model three different assumptions for the gravitational wave background produced by these highly eccentric peeps. We find that with our two most likely backgrounds, the signal may result in a slight rise of the LISA noise floor (SNR $\sim 0.3-2.4$); however, in the most abundant case, the background generated by these sources would be detectable on its own and likely obscure many potentially detectable sources (SNR $\sim77$).</description>

      <title>Universality on thermodynamic relation with corrections in higher-dimensional de Sitter black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, the methodology proposed by Goon and Penco for investigating the universality on thermodynamic relations with corrections in de Sitter black holes is extended. A universal thermodynamic extremality relation, under consideration of the mass of the spacetime $M$ with various state parameters, proposed by Goon and Penco is investigated in higher dimensional spacetime, the established universal conclusions are not impacted by the convergence of energy from the coexistence region of two horizons to the point $N$ or $C$. Furthermore, by incorporating the shift of the angular momentum into our analysis, a more universal relation is derived, specifically applicable to rotating configurations. Notably, a novel conjecture is formulated that establishes a universal relationship framework connecting shifted thermodynamic quantities across arbitrary black hole backgrounds. These findings are expected to offer profound insights into the fundamental principles of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Study of Accelerated Expansion of Universe in the framework of $f (R, T )$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis explores the late-time cosmic acceleration within the framework of $f(R,T)$ gravity, a general relativity modification that incorporates the Ricci scalar $R$ and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor $T$. Motivated by observational evidence for the universe's accelerated expansion and the limitations of Einstein's theory in explaining dark energy, we study exact cosmological solutions using various parametrizations of the deceleration parameter. The analysis includes isotropic and anisotropic models such as Bianchi type I universes with string fluid, bulk viscous matter, and magnetized strange quark matter. Several forms of time-varying deceleration parameters are employed to understand the dynamical behavior of the universe. We also examine finite-time singularities like the Big Rip and discuss their occurrence in both anisotropic and FLRW backgrounds. In addition, the thesis investigates higher-order curvature corrections and geometric modifications, including wormhole solutions, within the $f(R,T)$ formalism. Energy conditions are analyzed to assess the physical plausibility of these models. The overall work aims to provide a coherent and viable description of the universe's evolution under modified gravity theories.</description>

      <title>A linear response relation in general relativity with applications to dense matter relativistic stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new formalism in general relativity with a linear response relation between perturbed Einstein tensor and the stress-energy tensor is presented. Basic concepts are borrowed from statistical physics and theory of stochastic processes by extending them for a spacetime structure. We show qualitatively new results of the first applications which lay foundations for a sub-hydro mesoscopic theory in dense matter relativistic stars. This will enable one to probe structure and phenomena at intermediate scales in relativistic stars and exotic fluids that they are made up of. The overall aim is to build foundations for studying dynamical equilibrium and non-equilibrium properties of astrophysical bodies based on stochastic correlations of perturbations of spacetime and matter fields. This will add to the present literature on asteroseismology a new insight in a significant way.It is also expected that this will lead to direct or indirect observational consequences of meso scale physics under extreme conditions present in the exotic objects.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic stability of superflows in General Relativity and Newtonian gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Landau's criterion for superfluidity is a special case of a broader principle: A moving fluid cannot be stopped by frictional forces if its state of motion is a local minimum of the grand potential. We employ this general thermodynamic criterion to derive a set of inequalities that any superfluid mixture (with an arbitrary number of order parameters) must satisfy for a certain state of motion to be long-lived and unimpeded by friction. These macroscopic constraints complement Landau's original criterion, in that they hold at all temperatures, and remain valid even for gapless superfluids. Unfortunately, they are only necessary conditions for the existence of a frictionless hydrodynamic motion, since they presuppose the validity of a fluid description. However, they do provide sufficient conditions for stability against stochastic hydrodynamic fluctuations. We first formulate our analysis within the framework of General Relativity, and then we take the Newtonian limit.</description>

      <title>Newtonian Fractional-Dimension Gravity and the Mass-Dimension Field Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We resume our analysis of Newtonian Fractional-Dimension Gravity (NFDG), an alternative gravitational model which does not require the Dark Matter (DM) paradigm. We add three more galaxies (NGC 6946, NGC 3198, NGC 2841) to the catalog of those studied with NFDG methods. Once again, NFDG can successfully reproduce the observed rotation curves by using a variable fractional dimension $D\left (R\right )$, as was done for nine other galaxies previously studied with these methods.
  In addition, we introduce a mass-dimension field equation for our model, which is capable of deriving the fractional mass-dimension $D_{m}\left( R \right)$ from first principles, as opposed to the previous $D\left (R\right )$ which was obtained simply by matching the experimental rotational velocity data for each galaxy. While the NFDG predictions computed with this new $D_{m}\left(R\right)$ dimension are not as accurate as those based on the original $D\left (R\right )$, they nevertheless confirm the validity of our fractional-dimension approach. Three previously studied galaxies (NGC 7814, NGC 6503, NGC 3741) were analyzed again with these new methods and their structure was confirmed to be free from any dark matter components.</description>

      <title>On the Reinterpretation of Dark Energy as the Elasticity of Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate that by treating space as a three dimensional elastic membrane, one can interpret the energy density stored in it as Dark Energy. In particular, we will model space as an infinitely large fundamental 3 brane and show that its vacuum stress energy tensor has the same mathematical form which one expects from the stress energy tensor describing a Lorentz invariant vacuum energy density (Dark Energy). We identify the dark-energy density with the tension of the fundamental 3 brane and thereby establish a direct correspondence between the cosmological constant and brane tension. Finally, we present a brief argument as to why the Cosmological Constant should be treated as a fundamental constant of nature, based on some light ontological discussion regarding the origin of the tension term in the broader framework of String Theory. In a forthcoming work, we will articulate a dynamical mechanism, which will be grounded in Q-theory, Hawking-Wu flux neutralization and broken super-symmetry, demonstrating the precise cancellation of vacuum energy in a manner such that the fundamental brane (spatial) tension remains the unique source of the Cosmological Constant.</description>

      <title>Corrected first law of thermodynamics for dynamical regular black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we establish the corrected first law of thermodynamics for dynamical regular black holes on both the event horizon and apparent horizon. We find that the temperature of dynamical regular black holes derived from the traditional first law differs from that obtained through other approaches. This indicates that, similar to static cases, the first law of thermodynamics requires correction. We then derive the corrected first law of thermodynamics from the Einstein field equations. Our analysis reveals that the corrected factor originates from the fact that the $ T^v_v $ component of the energy-momentum tensor depends on the black hole mass. This dependence implies that the mass of a regular black hole can no longer be directly identified as the internal energy, leading to the corrections of the first law of thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Thermal Behavior of Generalized Black-Bounce Black Hole Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we tested the thermal behavior of a class of regular black hole solutions defined as generalized black-bounce spacetimes. We introduce several novel configurations governed by different mass functions and geometric deformations, illustrated by parameters controlling regularity and horizon structure. Using the Hamilton Jacobi tunneling method, we compute the Hawking temperature associated with each model and analyze its dependence on the underlying parameters. We find that all proposed geometries are free of curvature singularities and exhibit positive, well defined quasi-local masses in the Hernandez Misner Sharp formalism. Also, we demonstrate that these models may possess multiple horizons, including extremal and asymmetric cases, while typically violating classical energy conditions in the vicinity of the bounce. Our results show and illustrate the structure and thermodynamic stability of these regular solutions.</description>

Abstract: In our previous work (Phys. Rev. Research 7, 033079), we derived the metric tensor for cylindrically shaped pulses with uniform energy density. Building upon that framework, we derive the complete set of geodesics with zero angular velocity. We show that perturbations in particle trajectories may be observed in gamma ray bursts. Also, deviations in the motion of moving particles are significantly larger than those previously found for particles that are initially at rest.</description>

      <title>LensingFlow: An Automated Workflow for Gravitational Wave Lensing Analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present LensingFlow. This is an implementation of an automated workflow to search for evidence of gravitational lensing in a large series of gravitational wave events. This workflow conducts searches for evidence in all generally considered lensing regimes. The implementation of this workflow is built atop the Asimov automation framework and CBCFlow metadata management software and the resulting product therefore encompasses both the automated running and status checking of jobs in the workflow as well as the automated production and storage of relevant metadata from these jobs to allow for later reproduction. This workflow encompasses a number of existing lensing pipelines and has been designed to accommodate any additional future pipelines to provide both a current and future basis on which to conduct large scale lensing analyses of gravitational wave signal catalogues. The workflow also implements a prioritisation management system for jobs submitted to the schedulers in common usage in computing clusters ensuring both the completion of the workflow across the entire catalogue of events as well as the priority completion of the most significant candidates. As a first proof-of-concept demonstration, we deploy LensingFlow on a mock data challenge comprising 10 signals in which signatures of each lensing regime are represented. LensingFlow successfully ran and identified the candidates from this data through its automated checks of results from consituent analyses.</description>

      <title>Confronting Inflation and Reheating with Observations: Improved Predictions Beyond Slow-Roll</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the latest observational data, we constrain the inflationary dynamics and the subsequent reheating epoch. Predictions for both phases can be significantly improved by employing numerically computed results compared to the slow-roll approximations. These results enable a more accurate reassessment of the observational viability of inflationary models, provide tighter constraints on the reheating history, and help lift the degeneracies in the predictions of inflation and reheating dynamics. Given current observational bounds, this enables a more accurate understanding of the early universe physics.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Schr\"odinger-Poisson (SP) equations predict fuzzy dark matter (FDM) solitons. Given the FDM mass $\sim10^{-20}\rm~{eV}/c^2$, the FDM soliton in the Milky Way is massive $\sim 10^7~M_{\odot}$ but diffuse $\sim 10{\rm~pc}$. Therefore, this FDM soliton can serve as a gravitational lens for gravitational waves (GWs) with frequency $\sim10^{-8}{\rm~Hz}$. In this paper, we investigate its gravitational lensing effects by numerical simulation of the propagation of GWs through it. We find that the maximum magnification factor of GWs is very small $\sim10^{-4}$, but the corresponding magnification zone is huge $\sim6{\rm~pc}$ for FDM with mass equal to $8^{-21}\rm~{eV}/c^2$. Consequently, this small magnification factor in that large magnification zone means a small antisotropy of $\sim10^{-4}$ over a large solid angle in the GW background, even though this antisotropy is out of the sensitivity of the pulsar timing arrays today.</description>

      <title>Dynamic shadow of a black hole with a self-interacting massive complex scalar hair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We research dynamic shadows of a black hole with a self-interacting massive complex scalar hair. The complex scalar field $\psi$ evolves with time $t$, whose magnitude on apparent horizon $|\psi_{h}|$ starts from zero, undergoes a sharp rise followed by rapid oscillations, and eventually converges to a constant value. The variation of the photon sphere radius $r_{ps}$ is similar to that of the magnitude $|\psi_{h}|$. The emergence of the complex scalar hair $\psi$ causes the apparent horizon radius $r_{h}$ to start increasing sharply, and smoothly approaches a stable value eventually. The shadow radius $R_{sh}$ of the black hole with an accretion disk increases with $t_{o}$ the time at the observer's position. In the absence of an accretion disk, the shadow radius $R_{sh}$ is larger and also increases as $t_{o}$ increases. Furthermore, we slice the dynamical spacetime into spacelike hypersurfaces for all time points $t$. For the case with an accretion disk, the variation of $R_{sh}$ is similar to that of the apparent horizon $r_{h}$, because the inner edge of the accretion disk extends to the apparent horizon. In the absence of an accretion disk, the variation of $R_{sh}$ is similar to that of the photon sphere $r_{ps}$, because the black hole shadow boundary is determined by the photon sphere. Since the variation of $r_{ps}$ is induced by $\psi$, it can be stated that the variation in the size of the shadow is likewise caused by the change of $\psi$. Regardless of the presence or absence of the accretion disk, the emergence of the complex scalar hair $\psi$ causes the radius $R_{sh}$ of the shadow to start changing. Moreover, we investigate the time delay $\Delta t$ of lights propagating from light sources to observer. These findings not only enrich the theoretical models of dynamic black hole shadows but also provide a foundation for testing black hole spacetime dynamics.</description>

      <title>Geometric reflective boundary conditions for asymptotically Anti-de Sitter spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article solves the initial boundary value problem for the vacuum Einstein equations with a negative cosmological constant in dimension 4, giving rise to asymptotically Anti-de Sitter spaces. We introduce a new family of geometric reflective boundary conditions, which can be regarded as the homogeneous Robin boundary conditions, involving both the conformal class and the stress-energy tensor of the timelike conformal boundary. This family includes as a special case the homogeneous Neumann boundary condition, consisting of setting the boundary stress-energy tensor to zero. It also agrees, in a limit case, with the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition, where one fixes a locally conformally flat conformal class on the boundary, already covered in Friedrich's pioneering work of 1995.
  The proof of local existence and uniqueness for this family of boundary conditions relies notably on Friedrich's framework and his extended conformal Einstein equations. These are rewritten in a tensorial formalism, rather than a spinorial one, as it facilitates the comparison with the Fefferman-Graham expansion of asymptotically Anti-de Sitter metrics. Similarly to Friedrich's proof, our geometric boundary conditions are eventually inferred from gauge-dependent boundary conditions by means of an auxiliary system on the conformal boundary.
  In addition, our analysis also comprises new necessary and sufficient conditions for the unphysical fields associated to the initial data to be smooth up to the conformal boundary. Finally, the paper contains examples of asymptotically Anti-de Sitter spaces, with a focus on their conformal boundary data. This provides valuable insight into the possible shapes of boundary stress-energy tensors.</description>

      <title>On the generation of primordial matter by spatial curvature in the early universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, it is shown that a nonvanishing spatial curvature can generate primordial matter in the post-inflation era. This matter does not depend on the curvature parameter and is described by a stiff equation of state. It can have the properties of spin matter, consisting of particles with a spin quantum number (spin) s = 1/2. Such a matter can be plausibly identified with quark matter at the early stage of the evolution of the universe.</description>

      <title>GW231123: Binary Black Hole Merger or Cosmic String?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration recently reported an exceptional gravitational-wave event, GW231123. This gravitational-wave signal was assumed to be generated from the merger of a binary black hole system, with source frame masses of $137^{+22}_{-17}~\textup{M}_\odot$ and $103^{+20}_{-52}~ \textup{M}_\odot$ (90\% credible intervals). As seen by the two LIGO detectors, the signal has only $\sim 5$ cycles, between 30 and 80 Hz, over $\sim 10$ ms. It is of critical importance to confirm the origin of this signal. Here we present the results of a Bayesian model comparison to test whether the gravitational-wave signal was actually generated by a binary black hole merger, or emitted from cusps or kinks on a cosmic string. We find significant evidence for a binary black hole merger origin of the signal.</description>

      <title>Ultralight boson constraints from gravitational wave observations of spinning binary black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the presence of an ultralight scalar or vector boson, a spinning black hole will be spun down through the superradiant instability. We use spin measurements from gravitational wave observations of binary black holes, in particular the heavy binary black hole merger event GW231123, along with the lower-mass GW190517 event, to constrain the existence of ultralight bosons. We disfavor scalars with masses in the range of $[0.55, 11]\times 10^{-13}$ eV and vectors in the range of $[0.11, 18]\times 10^{-13}$ eV, making only a conservative assumption that the black hole lifetimes are greater than $10^5$ years. The lower ends of these ranges, where the exclusion confidence is the highest, were not previously excluded by spin measurements from electromagnetic or gravitational wave observations. We map these constraints to axion and dark photon models with interactions.</description>

      <title>Heat Capacity and the Violation of Scaling Laws in Gravitational System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the scaling laws in gravitational system from the perspective of free energy landscape. It has been found that for some special black holes, their critical exponents are beyond mean field theory, and more surprisingly violate the scaling laws. We find that the main reason for the violation of the scaling laws is that the heat capacity at constant volume for these black holes is 0, so the critical exponent $\alpha$ is often treated as 0 and can not be derived from the scaling hypothesis while another three critical exponents can. We also find that the strange critical exponents means there is a symmetry violation in the order parameter.</description>

      <title>Dark energy constraints in light of theoretical priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to derive model-independent observational bounds on dark energy/modified gravity theories, a typical approach is to constrain parametrised models intended to capture the space of dark energy theories. Here we investigate in detail the effect that the nature of these parametrisations can have, finding significant effects on the resulting cosmological dark energy constraints. In order to observationally distinguish well-motivated and physical parametrisations from unphysical ones, it is crucial to understand the theoretical priors that physical parametrisations place on the phenomenology of dark energy. To this end we discuss a range of theoretical priors that can be imposed on general dark energy parametrisations, and their effect on the constraints on the phenomenology of dynamical dark energy. More specifically, we investigate both the phenomenological $\{\mu,\Sigma\}$ parametrisation as well as effective field theory (EFT) inspired approaches to model dark energy interactions. We compare the constraints obtained in both approaches for different phenomenological and theory-informed time-dependences for the underlying functional degrees of freedom, discuss the effects of priors derived from gravitational wave physics, and investigate the interplay between constraints on parameters constraining only the background evolution vs. parameters controlling linear perturbations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute holographic timelike entanglement entropy for quantum BTZ black holes in a Karch-Randall braneworld scenario. These black holes are exact solutions of massive 3d gravity on the brane and are conjectured to be dual to thermal states in 2d defect CFTs, living at the interface of the brane and the boundary of the bulk $AdS_4$. Our analysis reveals an interesting relation between the tEE and the central charge pertaining to the dual CFT, which receives nontrivial corrections due to quantum backreaction effects on the Karch-Randall brane, which is explored non-perturbatively.</description>

      <title>Constraints on extra charges in dyonic Kerr-Newman-Kasuya-Taub-NUT black hole from the observations of quasi-periodic oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the influence of the dimensionless electric charge ($Q/M$), magnetic charge ($P/M$), and Taub-NUT parameter ($n/M$) of a dyonic Kerr-Newman-Kasuya-Taub-NUT black hole on quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) observed in X-ray binaries. Using the relativistic precession model, we calculate the three fundamental frequencies arising from particle motion in the accretion disk around the black hole. These theoretical predictions are then confronted with observational QPO data from five X-ray binaries (GRO J1655-40, XTE J1859$+$226, XTE J1550-564, GRS 1915$+$105, and H1743-322), and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique is used to constrain the black hole parameters. Our analysis reveals no significant evidence for nonzero values of $Q/M$ and $P/M$ across all sources, thereby allowing us to place several stringent upper limits on electric charge ($Q/M$) and magnetic charge ($P/M$) of the black hole in these systems. Similarly, no compelling indication of a nonzero Taub-NUT parameter is found in QPOs from GRO J1655-40, XTE J1859$+$226, XTE J1550-564, and H1743-322. In contrast, the posterior distribution derived from GRS 1915$+$105 data suggests a nonzero Taub-NUT parameter, i.e., gravitomagnetic monopole moment. This result indicates a potential deviation from the Kerr metric in this astrophysical black hole.</description>

      <title>Binary Neutron Star Mergers: Multi-Messenger Systematics and Prospects with Next-Generation Facilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-messenger astronomy was galvanized by the detection of gravitational waves (GWs) from the binary neutron star (BNS) merger GW170817 and electromagnetic (EM) emission from the subsequent kilonova and short gamma ray burst. Maximizing multi-messenger constraints on these systems requires combining models of the progenitors and products of BNS mergers within a single framework in anticipation of future GW and EM detectors. We demonstrate how combining models of different aspects of the BNS progenitor-merger-remnant system into a full multi-messenger modeling pipeline reveals insight into modeling challenges that will need to be addressed in the coming decade of multi-messenger astronomy. Motivated by GW170817, this combined model relates the progenitor astrophysics of a BNS population with their GW observability and localizability, kilonova light curves, gamma-ray burst afterglow flux, and kilonova remnant evolution. We find joint correlations between the GW and EM observables that depend on a complicated interplay between modeling assumptions and theoretical uncertainties. Next generation detectors will generically provide multi-messenger constraints on BNSs with median GW network signal-to-noise ratio $\approx 10$, median of the 90$^{\rm th}$ percentile sky area $\approx 10$ sq. deg., and kilonova $i$-band apparent magnitudes ranging from $\approx 33$ to $23$. We find no more than 4\% of the BNSs are simultaneously detectable by a network of two Cosmic Explorers and one Einstein Telescope and by the Roman and Rubin telescopes for 55 and 180 sec. exposures in a $K$-like band and $i$ and $g$ bands, respectively. We discuss key modeling assumptions that will be transmitted as multi-messenger systematics in the analysis of future datasets, such as uncertain astrophysical processes of binary populations and the nuclear equation of state for tests of nuclear physics and dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new mass generation mechanism for linearized gravity in three spacetime dimensions, which consists of a lower-dimensional Chern-Simons-like term added to the invariant action. The propagators of the gauge fixed massive action show a massive pole and a good massless limit. Moreover, we show that, as the Topological Massive Gravity model of Deser, Jackiw and Templeton, this theory displays one propagating massive DoF, which can be traced back to the transverse part of the spatial Ricci tensor. Finally, the action of this linearized massive gravity is characterized by an algebraic structure formed by a set of Ward operators, which uniquely determine the theory.</description>

      <title>Fiducial observers and the thermal atmosphere in the black hole quantum throat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a construction of fiducial observers in the throat region of near-extremal black holes within the framework of JT quantum gravity, leading to a notion of local observers in a highly quantum regime of the gravitational field. The construction is based on an earlier proposal for light-ray anchoring to the asymptotic boundary and is uniquely fixed at the semiclassical level by demanding that the notion of time translations for an observer at the asymptotic boundary of JT gravity should be extended into the bulk as the flow of a conformal isometry. Since conformal isometries are a necessary condition for geometric modular flow, our construction is amenable as a candidate geometric gravitational dressing that may be interpreted via the modular crossed product, potentially connecting our choice of dressing with recent developments on the literature on local observables in quantum gravity. Taking this definition beyond the semiclassical regime, we compute quantum gravitational wormhole contributions to the black hole thermal atmosphere, directly producing a finite thermal entropy and leading to a quantum description of the stretched horizon in this model.</description>

Abstract: The effective action for quantum gravity coupled to matter contains corrections arising from the functional measure. We analyse the effect of such corrections for anisotropic self-gravitating compact objects described by means of the gravitational decoupling method applied to isotropic solutions of the Einstein field equations. In particular, we consider the Tolman IV solution of general relativity and show that quantum gravity effects can modify the effective energy density as well as the effective tangential and radial pressures. For a suitable choice of the mimicking constant, upper bounds on the quantum corrections can be driven by the surface redshift of the anisotropic compact stellar system obtained with the gravitational decoupling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04608v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In physical science, the concept of \emph{emergence} is often used to describe phenomena that occur at macroscopic scales but not at microscopic scales. The latter is usually referred to as a \emph{fundamental property} and the former as an \emph{emergent property}. In this paper, noncommutative geometry, often viewed as an offshoot of string theory, is the primary fundamental theory that gives rise to macroscopic wormholes and their properties, thereby becoming an emergent phenomenon. As a consequence of these considerations, we will reexamine the boundary conditions that characterize a Morris-Thorne wormhole. The result is a significant modification of the wormhole structure.</description>

      <title>Quantum steering for different types of Bell-like states in gravitational background</title>

Abstract: In a relativistic framework, it is generally accepted that quantum steering of maximally entangled states provide greater advantages in practical applications compared to non-maximally entangled states. In this paper, we investigate quantum steering for four different types of Bell-like states of fermionic modes near the event horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole. In some parameter spaces, the peak of steering asymmetry corresponds to a transition from two-way to one-way steerability for Bell-like states under the influence of the Hawking effect. It is intriguing to find that the fermionic steerability of the maximally entangled states experiences sudden death with the Hawking temperature, while the fermionic steerability of the non-maximally entangled states maintains indefinite persistence at infinite Hawking temperature. In contrast to prior research, this finding suggests that quantum steering of non-maximally entangled states is more advantageous than that of maximally entangled states for processing quantum tasks in the gravitational background. This surprising result overturns the traditional idea of ``the advantage of maximally entangled steering in the relativistic framework" and provides a new perspective for understanding the Hawking effect of the black hole.</description>

      <title>Signatures of cubic gravity in the strong regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of Einsteinian cubic gravity in the strong gravitational regime. In the first part, we explore analytical solutions for a static, spherically symmetric metric, establishing the existence of maximally symmetric de Sitter solutions, as well as asymptotically de Sitter solutions, with an effective cosmological constant. We also study, analytically and numerically, how the horizon properties are affected by cubic gravity. Our results reveal that a positive coupling constant reduces the horizon size, while a negative one increases it. In the second part, we analyze potential observational signatures of cubic terms, focusing on their effects on the bending of light. Specifically, we investigate the angular difference, related to the deflection angle but valid near the source, along with the behavior of the photon sphere. Our findings show that the strongest effects of the cubic terms occur in the strong gravity regime, and there exists a direct relationship between the value of the coupling constant and the photon sphere position, opening up the possibility to constrain cubic gravity with black hole shadows.</description>

      <title>Exploring Hubble Tension Alleviation through Neutrino-Coupled Perturbed $f(R)$ Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work examines the Hubble constant (\(H_0\)) tension within the frameworks of perturbed \(f(R)\) gravity and perturbed \(f(R)\) gravity coupled with neutrinos, using lastest observational data. The datasets incorporate the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), Cosmic Chronometers (CC), lensing, and Pantheon supernovae. We compare the ability of these models to bridge the discrepancy between Planck 2018 (\(H_0 = 67.4 \pm 0.5 \ \text{km/s/Mpc}\)) and the local R22 measurement (\(H_0 = 73.5 \pm 1.04 \ \text{km/s/Mpc}\)). In perturbed \(f(R)\) gravity, the derived \(H_0\) values align closely with Planck, leaving a substantial tension with R22. The inclusion of neutrino interactions introduces additional parameters that shift \(H_0\) toward higher values, reducing the tension with local measurements. Notably, the coupled model achieves a smaller residual tension compared to the standalone perturbed \(f(R)\) model, indicating that neutrino physics plays a significant role in modifying the late-time expansion dynamics. While both models provide insights into addressing the Hubble tension, the coupled \(f(R)\) gravity with neutrinos offers a more consistent alignment across the datasets.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Local Black Hole Horizons: Recent Advances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11825v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the early literature on black holes focused on event horizons, subsequently it was realized that their teleological nature makes them unsuitable for many physical applications both in classical and quantum gravity. Therefore, over the past two decades, event horizons have been steadily replaced by quasi-local horizons which do not suffer from teleology. In numerical simulations event horizons can be located as an `after thought' only after the entire space-time has been constructed. By contrast, quasi-local horizons naturally emerge in the course of these simulations, providing powerful gauge-invariant tools to extract physics from the numerical outputs. They also lead to interesting results in mathematical GR, providing unforeseen insights. For example, for event horizons we only have a qualitative result that their area cannot decrease, while for quasi-local horizons the increase in the area during a dynamical phase is quantitatively related to local physical processes at the horizon. In binary black hole mergers, there are interesting correlations between observables associated with quasi-local horizons and those defined at future null infinity. Finally, the quantum Hawking process is naturally described as formation and evaporation of a quasi-local horizon. This review focuses on the dynamical aspects of quasi-local horizons in classical general relativity, emphasizing recent results and ongoing research.</description>

      <title>Assessment of universal relations among second-order moments of relativistic stars via reformulated perturbation equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We assess the universal relations among second-order moments of relativistic stars, namely the moment of inertia, tidal deformability, and spin-induced quadrupole moment, via reformulated perturbation equations. After constructing the spherical background configuration by solving two ordinary differential equations as usual, these three moments are obtained by solving four additional ordinary differential equations. They are solved numerically from the stellar center to the surface, and we do not need to derive homogeneous solutions for obtaining the quadrupole moment. This small number of ordinary differential equations to be solved enables us to identify the primary variable for each second-order moment. Investigating the profile of these variables in the star, we speculate that their nonmonotonic behavior, enhanced typically for soft equations of state and/or high compactnesses, introduces the variety to the relations among these second-order moments unless the black-hole limit is approached. Because realistic relativistic stars are widely believed to be characterized by stiff equations of state, they enjoy the universal relation to a great extent.</description>

      <title>A novel cosmic framework of interdependent dark matter and Holographic Dark Energy within the Bianchi type-V universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the anisotropic and homogeneous Bianchi type-V Universe with holographic dark energy (HDE) and interacting dark matter (DM). The solution for the field equations have been obtained for a certain form of the deceleration parameter. As for $\Lambda$CDM, we show that the coincidence problem disappears for a specific choice of the dark matter-holographic dark energy interaction. In this study, the observational data combination of OHD and JLA (Yu et al., Astrophys. J. 856 (2018) 3), where $q_0$ = $-0.52$ and $H_0$ = $69.2$, have been taken into consideration. We also found that the anisotropy of the expansion achieves isotropy after some finite time. We have also explained the physical and geometrical aspects of the model. The physical acceptability and stability of the model have been examined.</description>

      <title>superB/NRPy: Scalable, Task-Based Numerical Relativity for 3G Gravitational Wave Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern gravitational-wave science demands increasingly accurate and computationally intensive numerical relativity (NR) simulations. The Python-based, open-source NRPy framework generates optimized C/C++ code for NR, including the complete NR code BlackHoles@Home (BH@H), which leverages curvilinear coordinates well-suited to many astrophysical scenarios. Historically, BH@H was limited to single-node OpenMP CPU parallelism. To address this, we introduce superB, an open-source extension to NRPy that enables automatic generation of scalable, task-based, distributed-memory Charm++ code from existing BH@H modules. The generated code partitions the structured grids used by NRPy/BH@H, managing communication between them. Its correctness is validated through bit-identical results with the standard OpenMP version on a single node and via a head-on binary black hole simulation in cylindrical-like coordinates, accurately reproducing quasi-normal modes (up to $\ell=8$). The superB/NRPy-generated code demonstrates excellent strong scaling, achieving an $\approx 45$x speedup on 64 nodes (7168 cores) compared to the original single-node OpenMP code for a large 3D vacuum test. This scalable infrastructure benefits demanding simulations and lays the groundwork for future multi-patch grid support, targeting long inspirals, extreme parameter studies, and rapid follow-ups. This infrastructure readily integrates with other NRPy/BH@H-based projects, enabling performant scaling for the general relativistic hydrodynamics code GRoovy, and facilitating future coupling with GPU acceleration via the NRPy-CUDA project.</description>

      <title>Emergent Lorentzian dispersion relations from a Euclidean scalar-tensor theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Can one be fooled into thinking that space and time are fundamentally described by a Lorentzian manifold? In this article, we describe a scenario in which a theory constructed on a (Euclidean signature) Riemannian manifold can lead to degrees of freedom with Lorentzian dispersion relations, due to a nontrivial configuration of a scalar field. In particular, we perform a perturbative analysis of a renormalizable shift-symmetric scalar-tensor theory and find that it can, in principle, admit a massless tensor degree of freedom with a Lorentzian dispersion relation. While the remaining degrees of freedom in the gravity sector will, in general, satisfy Euclidean dispersion relations, we argue that they can be brought under control by elliptic equations with an appropriate choice of boundary conditions.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the notion of moving Cartan geometries described by quotients of Lie groups and Lie algebras with spacetime dependant structure constants and construct associated deformed topological gauge action functionals for Lorentzian (including dS and AdS) and Lorentz$\times$Weyl moving geometries. The actions feature a generalization of the Nieh-Yan topological term for a varying coupling constant. We compute the equations of motion of the gauge $+$ matter actions and show that they dictate at each spacetime point the geometry, leading to both a dynamical source of dark energy and a dynamical gravitational coupling, described by combinations of scalars built from spacetime curvature, torsion and the matter content of the theory. The action becomes asymptotically topological when the gauge action contribution to dark energy vanishes.</description>

      <title>Universality on thermodynamic relation with corrections in Einstein-Bel-Robinson gravity Black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The generalized thermodynamic extremum relation, as proposed by Goon and Penco, establishes a novel theoretical framework for the study of spacetime thermodynamics. However, extant investigations generally assume that the black hole state parameter is solely a first-order function of the perturbation parameter when exploring the Goon-Penco relation in diverse spacetime contexts. An analytic expression for the perturbation parameter as a function of the black hole entropy can be expressed by treating the black hole mass as constant. The present study addresses this limitation and provides insight into the universal Goon-Penco relation when multiple thermodynamic state parameters behave as higher order functions of the perturbation parameters. Notably, we have not only established a universal relational formula in the case of multiple state variables, but more importantly, we have put forward an innovative conjecture that reveals the existence of a universal relation between displaced thermodynamic quantities in spacetime in the context of an arbitrary black hole. These theoretical breakthroughs are expected to open up new exploration directions for quantum gravity research.</description>

Abstract: The local primordial density fluctuations caused by quantum vacuum fluctuations during inflation grow into stars and galaxies in the late universe and, if they are large enough, also produce primordial black holes. We study the formation of the primordial black holes in $k$-essence inflation models with a potential characterized by an inflection point. The background and perturbation equations are integrated numerically for two specific models. Using the critical collapse and peaks formalism, we calculate the abundance of primordial black holes today.</description>

      <title>Geodesic completeness, curvature singularities and infinite tidal forces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report some new findings regarding the subtle relations among geodesic completeness, curvature singularities and tidal forces. It is well known that any particle may be torn up near a singularity at the center of a black hole due to the divergent tidal force. However, we find that singularity is not the only cause of tidal force divergence. Even on the surface of the Earth, the tidal force experienced by a particle could be arbitrarily large if the particle moves arbitrarily close to the speed of light in a nonradial direction. Usually, a curvature singularity implies geodesic incompleteness since in many cases the metric cannot be defined at the location of the singularity. Counterexamples have been found in recent years, suggesting that geodesics could pass through curvature singularities. By taking into account the fact that any real particle is an extended body, we calculate the tidal force acting on the particle in a static and spherically symmetric spacetime. We explicitly show that an infinite tidal force always occurs near such a singularity. Therefore, no particle can actually reach the curvature singularity even if the metric is well defined at that point. We also show that the tidal acceleration along a null geodesic at the coordinate origin is divergent. For a wormhole solution that has a curvature singularity at the throat but possesses a regular metric, we show that the tidal force on any particle passing through the throat is divergent.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the non-commutative geometry inspired Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole solution obtained by smearing the point sources with a Gaussian distribution. We show that while the form of the metric function and the physical properties derived from that remain valid, not all the components of Einstein equations are satisfied. We construct an improved energy-momentum tensor that consistently satisfies Einstein equations and show that it leads to a different prediction for the region where the strong energy condition is violated. For certain choice of parameters, our proposal predicts the violation of the energy condition outside the Cauchy horizon, which might be important for observational signatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07335v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finite-temperature one-loop renormalization of the Standard Model, coupled with dynamic metric, is conducted in this study. The entire analysis is coherently carried out by using the refined background field method, applied in the spirit of the Coleman-Weinberg technique. The general form of the propagator, introduced in our previous work to facilitate Feynman diagram computation in a general curved background, proves useful in the presence of time-dependent temperature. Its utilization allows for the renormalization analysis of a FLRW background to essentially reduce to that of a constant finite-T flat spacetime. For infrared physics, the actual curved background should be considered. The implications of our findings for cosmology, particularly the cosmological constant problem and Hubble tension, are discussed.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that a $\sim 2 \sigma$ discrepancy with the Planck-$\Lambda$CDM cosmology in DESI Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) data in the redshift range $0.4 &lt; z &lt; 0.6$ with effective redshift $z_{\textrm{eff}} = 0.51$ translates into an unexpectedly large $\Omega_m$ value, $\Omega_m = 0.67^{+0.18}_{-0.17}$. We independently confirm that this anomaly drives the preference for $w_0 &gt; -1$ in DESI data \textit{alone} confronted to the $w_0 w_a$CDM model. Given that LRG data at $z_{\textrm{eff}} = 0.51$ is at odds with Type Ia supernovae in overlapping redshifts, we expect that this anomaly will decrease in statistical significance with future DESI data releases leaving an increasing $\Omega_m$ trend with effective redshift at higher redshifts. We estimate the current significance of the latter in DESI data at $\sim 1.8 \sigma$ and comment on how it dovetails with independent observations. It is imperative to understand what makes DESI LRG data at $z_{\textrm{eff}} = 0.51$ an outlier when it comes to $\Omega_m$ determinations.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Higher Spin Symmetries II: Noether Realization in Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we construct a non-perturbative action of the higher spin symmetry algebra on the gravitational phase space. We introduce a symmetry algebroid $\mathcal{T}$ which allows us to include radiation in an algebraic framework. We show that $\mathcal{T}$ admits a non-linear realization on the asymptotic phase space generated by a Noether charge defined non-perturbatively for all spins. Besides, this Noether charge is conserved in the absence of radiation. Moreover, at non radiative cuts, the algebroid can be restricted to the wedge symmetry algebra studied in ArXiv:2409.12178. The key ingredient for our construction is to consider field and time dependent symmetry parameters constrained to evolve according to equations of motion dual to (a truncation of) the asymptotic Einstein's equations. This result then guarantees that the underlying symmetry algebra is also represented canonically.</description>

      <title>Generalised second law beyond the semiclassical regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01903v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the generalised second law (GSL), with an appropriate modification, holds in perturbative gravity to all orders beyond the semiclassical limit and without a UV cutoff imposed on the fields. Our proof uses algebraic techniques and builds on the recent work of Faulkner and Speranza, which combined Wall's proof of the GSL with the identification of generalised entropy as the von Neumann entropy of a boost-invariant crossed product algebra. The key additional step in our approach is to further impose invariance under null translations. Doing so requires one to describe horizon exterior regions in a relational manner, so we introduce `dynamical cuts': quantum reference frames which give the location of a cut of the horizon. We use idealised dynamical cuts, but expect that our methods can be generalised to more realistic models. The modified GSL that we prove says that the difference in generalised entropies of the regions outside two dynamical cuts is bounded below by the free energy of the degrees of freedom giving the location of the later cut. If one takes a semiclassical limit, imposes a UV cutoff, and requires the cuts to obey certain energy conditions, then our result reduces to the standard GSL.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18318v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the cross-correlation data from the first three observing runs of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration, we search for a gravitational-wave background (GWB) from primordial black holes, arising from the superposition of compact binary coalescence events. We consider both early and late binary formation mechanisms and perform Bayesian parameter inference. From the non-detection of the GWB, we provide constraints on the fraction of primordial black holes contributing to the present dark matter energy density.</description>

      <title>Probing Leptogenesis at LISA: A Fisher analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09884v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In JCAP 11 (2024) 051, we discussed how different regimes (flavoured) of leptogenesis can be probed through a ``tomographic'' approach using primordial gravitational waves. By examining the theory's parameter space, we identified regions where right-handed neutrino mass-dependent non-standard cosmological expansion leaves characteristic imprints on propagating gravitational waves. Our analysis focused on inflationary blue-tilted gravitational waves, modeled by a power-law tensor power spectrum with a constant spectral index. The resulting double-peak spectrum -- where peak and dip frequencies are sensitive to leptogenesis parameters -- provided marked signatures of different leptogenesis regimes. In this follow-up article, we conduct a statistical analysis of two-flavour leptogenesis signals, particularly those producing a peak (more generally, a broken power-law signal) within the LISA frequency band. Using a Fisher matrix analysis, we delineate the regions of parameter space that LISA can probe with minimal uncertainty, accounting for galactic and extragalactic foregrounds along with LISA's instrumental noise.</description>

      <title>Assessing cosmological evidence for non-minimal coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07679v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent observational evidence of deviations from the $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model points towards the presence of evolving dark energy. The simplest possibility consists of a cosmological scalar field $\varphi$, dubbed quintessence, driving the accelerated expansion. We assess the evidence for the existence of such a scalar field. We find that, if the accelerated expansion is driven by quintessence, the data favour a potential energy $V(\varphi)$ that is concave, i.e., $m^2=d^2V/d\varphi^2&lt;0$. Furthermore, and more significantly, the data strongly favour a scalar field that is non-minimally coupled to gravity (Bayes factor $\log(B) = 7.34 \pm 0.6$), leading to time variations in the gravitational constant on cosmological scales, and the existence of fifth forces on smaller scales. The fact that we do not observe such fifth forces implies that either new physics must come into play on non-cosmological scales or that quintessence is an unlikely explanation for the observed cosmic acceleration.</description>

      <title>Vector induced Gravitational Waves sourced by Primordial Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a generic formalism for the study of tensor perturbations induced at second order by first-order vector metric perturbations, dubbing these induced tensor modes $\textit{vector-induced gravitational waves}$ (VIGWs). Notably, considering an inflation-inspired power-law type magnetic field power spectrum of the form $P_B(k)\propto k^{n_\mathrm{B}}$ (where $n_{\rm B}$ is the magnetic spectral index), we show that the VIGW signal is enhanced for stiff post-inflationary EoS, with the maximum enhancement happening for $w=1$. We explicitly demonstrate this contribution is dominant over the first-order magnetically-sourced GWs. The VIGW spectrum exhibits a maximum at around the scale crossing the cosmological horizon at the end of reheating, $k_\mathrm{reh}$, with its present day peak amplitude scaling as $\Omega_{\rm GW}(k_{\rm reh},\eta_0)\propto \Delta N_{\rm reh}\times(H_{\rm inf}/M_{\rm Pl})^{8}$, where $H_{\rm inf}$ is the Hubble parameter at the end of inflation and $\Delta N_{\rm reh}$ the duration of the post-inflationary era in $e$-folds. For $w=1$ (kination) and $n_{\rm B}&gt;-3/2$, one further obtains a nearly $n_{\rm B}$-independent frequency scaling of the GW spectrum of the form $\Omega_{\rm GW}(f,\eta_0)\propto \left(\frac{f}{f_{\rm reh}}\right)^{-2.8}$ for $f&gt;f_\mathrm{reh}\equiv k_\mathrm{reh}/(2\pi)$. Finally, we highlight that the VIGW signal can be well within the detection bands of several next-generation interferometric GW missions at small scales. Indicatively, for $H_{\rm inf} \sim O(10^{7})\:\mathrm{GeV}$ and $O(10^{14})\:\mathrm{GeV}$, and $\Delta N_{\rm reh} \sim 15$ and $10$, the VIGW signal is expected to be detectable by LISA and ET respectively.</description>

      <title>Robustness of Magnetic Field Amplification in Neutron Star Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of a binary neutron stars merger is governed by physics under the most extreme conditions, including strong spacetime curvature, ultra-high matter densities, luminous neutrino emission and the rapid amplification of the initial neutron star magnetic fields. Here we systematically explore how sensitive the magnetic field evolution is to the total mass of the merging binary, to the mass ratio of its components, the stellar spins and to the equation of state. For this purpose, we analyze 16 state-of-the-art GRMHD simulations that employ a subgrid-scale model to account for the unresolved small-scale turbulence. We find that strong and rapid amplification of the magnetic field to volume-averaged values of $\sim 10^{16}$~G in the high-density regions is a very robust outcome of a neutron star merger and this result is only marginally impacted by either mass, mass ratio, spin or equation of state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08467v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a two-parameter phenomenological extension of the $\Lambda$CDM model in which the equation of state parameter of the ``dust'' fluid becomes different from zero for redshifts below a transition value $z_t$. Using data from DESI DR2 BAO, DESY5 Sn~Ia and CMB distance priors ($R,l_A,\omega_b$) data, we compare our model with the standard CPL parameterization $w_0-w_a$ for dynamical dark energy. Using the Deviance Information Criteria (DIC), we find that the two models are essentially indistinguishable ($\Delta$DIC $&lt;$ 2) and preferred over $\Lambda$CDM with a significance $\geq 3 \sigma$. We discuss how this parameterization finds a natural interpretation in the context of cosmological backreaction and derive a prediction for the evolution of the growth factor, discussing its impact on low redshift $f\sigma_8$ measurements.</description>

      <title>A Black Hole Airy Tail</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10657v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity, which is dual to a random matrix ensemble, the annealed entropy differs from the quenched entropy at low temperatures and goes negative. However, computing the quenched entropy in JT gravity requires a replica limit that is poorly understood. To circumvent this, we define an intermediate quantity called the semi-quenched entropy, which has the positivity properties of the quenched entropy, while requiring a much simpler replica trick. We compute this in JT gravity in different regimes using i) a bulk calculation involving wormholes corresponding to the Airy limit of the dual matrix integral and ii) a boundary calculation involving one-eigenvalue instanton saddles proposed by Hern\'andez-Cuenca, demonstrating consistency between these two calculations in their common regime of validity. We also clarify why similar one-eigenvalue instanton saddles cannot be used to compute the quenched entropy due to a breakdown of the saddle-point approximation for the one-eigenvalue instanton in the replica limit.</description>
