      <title>Navigating permanent underdetermination in dark energy and inflationary cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify troubling cases of so-called `permanent underdetermination' in both dark energy and inflationary cosmology. We bring to bear (a) a taxonomy of possible responses to underdetermination, and (b) an understanding of both dark energy and inflationary cosmology from an effective field point of view. We argue that, under certain conditions, there are available viable responses which can alleviate at least some of the concerns about underdetermination in the dark energy and inflationary sectors. However, outside of these specific scenarios, the epistemic threat of permanent underdetermination will persist.</description>

      <title>Antiquity, Dark Ages and Renaissance of Light-Front Higher Spin Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These notes contain -- apart from some physics -- scattered reminiscences of everyday life at the Institute for Theoretical Physics in G\"oteborg in the early eighties. The text has been in the making for many years. Some of it was written inspired by the Lars Brink 70-fest at The Solvay Institute in Brussels in 2014, but was never finished or published. Parts of the old text has now been replaced by a review of the quite unexpected recent renaissance for light-front higher spin theory. Lars sadly did not live to experience more than the very beginnings of this quite remarkable development. The text was finalized in the spring of 2023.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Freedom in Parton Language: the Birth of Perturbative QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I review the contributions of Giorgio Parisi to perturbative QCD. Concentrated in a decade, they mark the transition of the theory of strong interactions from a set of loosely connected ideas based on models, to a quantum field theory that is now an integral part of the standard model of fundamental interactions. Parisi's contributions have established at a very early stage ideas, methods and tools that are now standard, and in several cases anticipated results that only became prominent in the XXIst century.</description>

      <title>On the "Universality" of the Form of Maxwell's Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many papers have been published over the years that either conjecture or even (claim to) prove the universality of the form of Maxwell's equations. We present yet another derivation of Maxwell's equations and discuss the conclusions suggested by Maxwell universality, namely the logical inevitability of the Lorentz transformations and the mathematical inconsistency of Newtonian physics.</description>
