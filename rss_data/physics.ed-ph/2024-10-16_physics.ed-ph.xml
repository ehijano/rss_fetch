      <title>Activity Report on the Eighth African School of Fundamental Physics and Applications (ASP2024)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The African School of Fundamental Physics and Applications, also known as the African School of Physics (ASP), was initiated in 2010, as a three-week biennial event, to offer additional training in fundamental and applied physics to African students with a minimum of three-year university education. Since its inception, ASP has grown to be much more than a school. ASP has become a series of activities and events to support academic development of African students, teachers and faculties. We report on the eighth African School of Physics, ASP2024, organized in Morocco, on April 15--19 and July 7--21, 2024. ASP2024 included programs for university students, high school teachers and high school pupils.</description>

      <title>Challenges in addressing student difficulties with basics and change of basis for two-state quantum systems using a multiple-choice question sequence in online and in-person classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Research-validated multiple-choice questions comprise an easy-to-implement instructional tool for scaffolding student learning and providing formative assessment of students' knowledge. We present findings from the implementation of a research-validated multiple-choice question sequence on the basics of two-state quantum systems, including inner products, outer products, translation between Dirac notation and matrix representation in a particular basis, and change of basis. This study was conducted in an advanced undergraduate quantum mechanics course, in both online and in-person learning environments, across three years. For each cohort, students had their learning assessed after traditional lecture-based instruction in relevant concepts before engaging with the multiple-choice question sequence. Their performance was evaluated again afterwards with a similar assessment and compared to their earlier performance. We analyze, compare, and discuss the trends observed in the three implementations.</description>
