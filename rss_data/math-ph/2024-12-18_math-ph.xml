      <title>Hadwiger Models: Low-Temperature Behavior in a Natural Extension of the Ising Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All isometrically invariant Markov (strictly local) fields on binary assignments are induced by energy functions that can be represented as linear combinations of area, perimeter, and Euler characteristic. This class of model includes the Ising model, both ferro- and antiferro-magnetic, with and without a field, as well as the "triplet" Ising model We determine the low-temperature behavior for this class of model, and construct a phase diagram of that behavior. In particular, we identify regions with three geometric phases, regions with a single unique phase, and coexistence lines between them.</description>

      <title>W-algebras, Gaussian Free Fields and $\mathfrak{g}$-Dotsenko-Fateev integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the intrinsic connection between Gaussian Free Fields and the Heisenberg Vertex Operator Algebra, we study some aspects of the correspondence between probability theory and $W$-algebras. This is first achieved by providing a probabilistic representation of the $W$-algebra associated to any simple and complex Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$ by means of Gaussian Free Fields.
  This probabilistic representation has in turn strong implications for free-field correlation functions. Namely we show that this correspondence can be used to translate algebraic statements into actual constraints for free-field correlation functions in the form of Ward identities. This leads to new integrability results concerning Dotsenko-Fateev integrals associated to a simple and complex Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$, such as the derivation of a Fuchsian differential equation satisfied by deformations of $B_2$-Dotsenko-Fateev and Selberg integrals that arise from the Mukhin-Varchenko conjecture.
  Along the proof of this statement we also provide new results concerning representation theory of $W$-algebras such as the description of some singular vectors for the $\mathcal W B_2$ algebra.</description>

      <title>On Haantjes tensors for second-order superintegrable systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vanishing of the Haantjes tensor is an important property that has been linked, for instance, to the existence of separation coordinates and the integrability of systems of hydrodynamic type. We discuss the vanishing of the Haantjes tensor for operator fields that admit a large number of so-called conservation laws. In particular, we investigate Haantjes-zero Killing tensor fields that are associated with second-order superintegrable systems.</description>

      <title>Derivation of the Chern-Simons-Schr\"odinger equation from the dynamics of an almost-bosonic-anyon gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the time evolution of an initial product state in a system of almost-bosonic-extended-anyons in the large-particle limit. We show that the dynamics of this system can be well approximated, in finite time, by a product state evolving under the effective Chern-Simons-Schr\"odinger equation. Furthermore, we provide a convergence rate for the approximation in terms of the radius $R = (\log N)^{\frac{1}{2}+\varepsilon}$ of the extended anyons. These results establish a rigorous connection between the microscopic dynamics of almost-bosonic-anyon gases and the emergent macroscopic behavior described by the Chern-Simons-Schr\"odinger equation.</description>

      <title>1d Ising model with $1/r^{1.99}$ interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the 1d Ising model with long-range interactions decaying as $1/r^{1+s}$. The critical model corresponds to a family of 1d conformal field theories (CFTs) whose data depends nontrivially on $s$ in the range $1/2\leq s\leq 1$. The model is known to be described by a generalized free field with quartic interaction, which is weakly coupled near $s=1/2$ but strongly coupled near the short-range crossover at $s=1$. We propose a dual description which becomes weakly coupled at $s=1$. At $s=1$, our model becomes an exactly solvable conformal boundary condition for the 2d free scalar. We perform a number of consistency checks of our proposal and calculate the perturbative CFT data around $s=1$ analytically using both 1) our proposed field theory and 2) the analytic conformal bootstrap. Our results show complete agreement between the two methods.</description>

      <title>Gauge invariance and generalised $\eta$ regularisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalise the $\eta$ regularisation scheme in order to develop a framework for systematically studying regularisation of loops in quantum field theory. This allows us to "solve" a set of gauge consistency conditions for families of gauge invariant regularisation schemes. We recover several known examples such as dimensional and denominator regularisations, as well as some more general solutions. We also study anomalies in chiral theories in order to carefully describe how our formalism should be properly implemented.</description>

      <title>The $S_n$-equivariant Euler characteristic of $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{1, n}(\mathbb{P}^r, d)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the $S_n$-equivariant topological Euler characteristic of the Kontsevich moduli space $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{1, n}(\mathbb{P}^r, d)$. Letting $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{1, n}^{\mathrm{nrt}}(\mathbb{P}^r, d) \subset \overline{\mathcal{M}}_{1, n}(\P^r, d)$ denote the subspace of maps from curves without rational tails, we solve for the motive of $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{1, n}(\mathbb{P}^r, d)$ in terms of $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{1, n}^{\mathrm{nrt}}(\mathbb{P}^r, d)$ and plethysm with a genus-zero contribution determined by Getzler and Pandharipande. Fixing a generic $\mathbb{C}^\star$-action on $\mathbb{P}^r$, we derive a closed formula for the Euler characteristic of $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{1, n}^{\mathrm{nrt}}(\mathbb{P}^r, d)^{\mathbb{C}^\star}$ as an $S_n$-equivariant virtual mixed Hodge structure, which leads to our main formula for the Euler characteristic of $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{1,n}(\mathbb{P}^r, d)$. Our approach connects the geometry of torus actions on Kontsevich moduli spaces with symmetric functions in Coxeter types $A$ and $B$, as well as the enumeration of graph colourings with prescribed symmetry. We also prove a structural result about the $S_n$-equivariant Euler characteristic of $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g, n}(\mathbb{P}^r, d)$ in arbitrary genus.</description>

      <title>AdS $N$-body problem at large spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the problem of multi-twist operators in general CFTs, we study the leading-twist states of the $N$-body problem in AdS at large spin $J$. We find that for the majority of states the effective quantum-mechanical problem becomes semiclassical with $\hbar=1/J$. The classical system at $J=\infty$ has $N-2$ degrees of freedom, and the classical phase space is identified with the positive Grassmanian $\mathrm{Gr}_{+}(2,N)$. The quantum problem is recovered via a Berezin-Toeplitz quantization of a classical Hamiltonian, which we describe explicitly. For $N=3$ the classical system has one degree of freedom and a detailed structure of the spectrum can be obtained from Bohr-Sommerfeld conditions. For all $N$, we show that the lowest excited states are approximated by a harmonic oscillator and find explicit expressions for their energies.</description>

      <title>Points on Rational Normal Curves and the ABCT Variety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ABCT variety is defined as the closure of the image of $G(2,n)$ under the Veronese map. We realize the ABCT variety $V(3,n)$ as the determinantal variety of a vector bundle morphism. We use this to give a recursive formula for the fundamental class of $V(3,n)$. As an application, we show that special Schubert coefficients of this class are given by Eulerian numbers, matching a formula by Cachazo-He-Yuan. On the way to this, we prove that the variety of configuration of points on a common divisor on a smooth variety is reduced and irreducible, generalizing a result of Caminata-Moon-Schaffler.</description>

      <title>Unitarity constrains the quantum information metrics for particle interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unitarity provides mathematical and physical constraints on quantum information systems. e.g., in entanglement swapping, unitarity requires that the same entanglement generation occurs for either an act of measurement or particle interaction. The article's presentation allows particle physicists to readily begin calculating quantum information metrics for any particle interaction. The language of non-relativistic quantum mechanics is presented to derive the density matrix for hard scattering. Unitarity allows for finding the latter's cross section without using the scattering amplitude or the Lippmann-Schwinger equation plus Green's function. For the inelastic scattering of an electron from a proton, the language of relativistic quantum mechanics is used to derive the momentum entropy or Sackur-Tetrode equation. The latter entropy derives from a Shannon entropy and another entropy that evokes the uncertainty principle.</description>

      <title>Principal bundles in the category of $\mathbb{Z}_2^n$-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and examine the notion of principal $\mathbb{Z}_2^n$-bundles, i.e., principal bundles in the category of $\mathbb{Z}_2^n$-manifolds. The latter are higher graded extensions of supermanifolds in which a $\mathbb{Z}_2^n$-grading replaces $\mathbb{Z}_2$-grading. These extensions have opened up new areas of research of great interest in both physics and mathematics. In principle, the geometry of $\mathbb{Z}_2^n$-manifolds is essentially different than that of supermanifolds, as for $n&gt;1$ we have formal variables of even parity, so local smooth functions are formal power series. On the other hand, a full version of differential calculus is still valid. We show in this paper that the fundamental properties of classical principal bundles can be generalised to the setting of this `higher graded' geometry, with properly defined frame bundles of $\mathbb{Z}_2^n$-vector bundles as canonical examples. However, formulating these concepts and proving these results relies on many technical upshots established in earlier papers. A comprehensive introduction to $\mathbb{Z}_2^n$-manifolds is therefore included together with basic examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a topological paradigm in alterfold topological quantum field theory to explore various concepts, including modular invariants, $\alpha$-induction and connections in Morita contexts within a modular fusion category of non-zero global dimension over an arbitrary field. Using our topological perspective, we provide streamlined quick proofs and broad generalizations of a wide range of results. These include all theoretical findings by B\"{o}ckenhauer, Evans, and Kawahigashi on $\alpha$-induction. Additionally, we introduce the concept of double $\alpha$-induction for pairs of Morita contexts and define its higher-genus $Z$-transformation, which remains invariant under the action of the mapping class group. Finally, we establish a novel integral identity for modular invariance across multiple Morita contexts, unifying several known identities as special cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For small perturbations of Minkowski space, we show that the square of the Lorentzian Dirac operator $P= -D^2$ has real spectrum apart from possible poles in a horizontal strip. Furthermore, for $\varepsilon&gt;0$ we relate the poles of the spectral zeta function density of $P-i\varepsilon$ to local invariants, in particular to the Lorentzian scalar curvature. The proof involves microlocal propagation and radial estimates in a resolved scattering calculus as well as high energy estimates in a further resolved classical-semiclassical calculus.</description>

Abstract: We present generalizations and modifications of Eldan's Stochastic Localization process, extending it to incorporate non-Gaussian tilts, making it useful for a broader class of measures. As an application, we introduce new processes that enable the decomposition and analysis of non-quadratic potentials on the Boolean hypercube, with a specific focus on quartic polynomials. Using this framework, we derive new spectral gap estimates for tensor Ising models under Glauber dynamics, resulting in rapid mixing.</description>

      <title>Shifted Poisson structures on higher Chevalley-Eilenberg algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a graphical calculus to determine the $n$-shifted Poisson structures on finitely generated semi-free commutative differential graded algebras. When applied to the Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra of an ordinary Lie algebra, we recover Safronov's result that the $(n=1)$- and $(n=2)$-shifted Poisson structures in this case are given by quasi-Lie bialgebra structures and, respectively, invariant symmetric tensors. We generalize these results to the Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra of a Lie $2$-algebra and obtain $n\in\{1,2,3,4\}$ shifted Poisson structures in this case, which we interpret as semi-classical data of `higher quantum groups'.</description>

      <title>Large gap asymptotics of the hard edge tacnode process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A special type of geometric situation in ensembles of non-intersecting paths occurs when the non-intersecting trajectories are required to be nonnegative so that the limit shape becomes tangential to the hard-edge $0$. The local fluctuation is governed by the universal hard edge tacnode process, which also arises from some tiling problems. It is the aim of this work to explore the integrable structure and asymptotics for the gap probability of the hard edge thinned/unthinned tacnode process over $(0,s)$. We establish an integral representation of the gap probability in terms of the Hamiltonian associated with a system of differential equations. With the aids of some remarkable differential identities for the Hamiltonian, we are able to derive the associated large gap asymptotics, up to and including the constant term in the thinned case. Some applications of our results are discussed as well.</description>

      <title>Isoperimetric inequality for nonlocal bi-axial discrete perimeter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present manuscript we address and solve for the first time a nonlocal discrete isoperimetric problem. We consider indeed a generalization of the classical perimeter, what we call a nonlocal bi-axial discrete perimeter, where, not only the external boundary of a polyomino $\mathcal{P}$ contributes to the perimeter, but all internal and external components of $\mathcal{P}$. Furthermore, we find and characterize its minimizers in the class of polyominoes with fixed area $n$. Moreover, we explain how the solution of the nonlocal discrete isoperimetric problem is related to the rigorous study of the metastable behavior of a long-range bi-axial Ising model.</description>

      <title>All non-Gaussian states are advantageous for channel discrimination: Robustness of non-convex continuous variable quantum resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum resource theories provide a mathematical framework for quantifying the advantage given by quantum phenomena in various tasks. The generalized robustness is one such quantifier, and enjoys an operational interpretation in the setting of channel discrimination. It is a well studied resource monotone in finite-dimensional or convex resource theories, however as of yet it has not been studied in the setting of infinite-dimensional resource theories with a non-convex set of free states. In this work, we define the generalized robustness for an arbitrary resource theory, without restricting to convex sets or to finite dimensions. We show it has two operational interpretations: firstly, it provides an upper bound on the maximal advantage in a multi-copy channel discrimination task. Secondly, in many relevant theories, it quantifies the worst-case advantage in single-copy channel discrimination when considering a decomposition of the free states into convex subsets. Finally, we apply our results to the resource theory of non-Gaussianity, thus showing that all non-Gaussian states can provide an advantage in some channel discrimination task, even those that are simply mixtures of Gaussian states. To illustrate our findings, we provide exact formulas for the robustness of non-Gaussianity of Fock states, along with an analysis of the robustness for a family of non-Gaussian states within the convex hull of Gaussian states.</description>

      <title>Optimal convergence speed in the classical limits of relativistic Cucker-Smale models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study quantitative estimates for the flocking and uniform-time classical limit to the relativistic Cucker-Smale (in short RCS) model introduced in \cite{Ha-Kim-Ruggeri-ARMA-2020}. Different from previous works, we do not neglect the relativistic effect on the presence of the pressure in momentum equation. For the RCS model, we provide a quantitative estimate on the uniform-time classical limit with an optimal convergence rate which is the same as in finite-time classical limit under a relaxed initial condition. We also allow corresponding initial data for the RCS and Cucker-Smale (CS) model to be different in the classical limit. This removes earlier constraints employed in the previous classical limit. As a direct application of this optimal convergence rate in the classical limit of the RCS model, we derive an optimal convergence rate for the corresponding uniform-time classical limit for the kinetic RCS model.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the directed landscape from the KPZ fixed point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the directed landscape is the unique coupling of the KPZ fixed point from all initial conditions at all times satisfying three natural properties: independent increments, monotonicity, and shift commutativity. Equivalently, we show that the directed landscape is the unique directed metric on $\mathbb R^2$ with independent increments and KPZ fixed point marginals. This gives a framework for proving convergence to the directed landscape given convergence to the KPZ fixed point. We apply this framework to prove convergence to the directed landscape for a range of models, some without exact solvability: asymmetric exclusion processes with potentially non-nearest neighbour interactions, exotic couplings of ASEP, the random walk and Brownian web distance, and directed polymer models. All of our convergence theorems are new except for colored ASEP and the KPZ equation, where we provide alternative proofs.</description>

      <title>Regularity lost: the fundamental limitations and constraint qualifications in the problems of elastoplasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the existence and non-existence of a function-valued strain solution in various models of elastoplasticity from the perspective of the constraint-based ``dual'' formulations. We describe abstract frameworks for linear elasticity, elasticity-perfect plasticity and elasticity-hardening plasticity in terms of adjoint linear operators and convert them to equivalent formulations in terms of differential inclusions (the sweeping process in particular). Within such frameworks we consider several manually solvable examples of discrete and continuous models. Despite their simplicity, the examples show how for discrete models with perfect plasticity it is possible to find the evolution of stress and strain (elongation), yet continuum models within the same framework may not possess a function-valued strain. Although some examples with such phenomenon are already known, we demonstrate that it may appear due to displacement loading. The central idea of the paper is to explain the loss of strain regularity in the dual formulation by the lack of additivity of the normal cones and the failure of Slater's constraint qualification.
  In contrast to perfect plasticity, models with hardening are known to be well-solvable for strains. We show that more advanced constraint qualifications can help to distinguish between those cases and, in the case of hardening, ensure the additivity of the normal cones, which means the existence of a function-valued strain rate.</description>

      <title>A note on hidden classes in spinor classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Lounesto classification is a well-established scheme for categorizing spinors based on their physical content, which are determined by their associated bilinear forms. It consists of six disjoint classes encompassing the known spinors within the context of the standard model of high-energy physics. However, advancements in theories beyond the standard model have opened the door to potential new spinorial adjoint structures, leading to new unforeseen classess. These developments indicate the potential for extending the standard Lounesto classification. In this paper, we explore all possible subclasses that could extend the Lounesto scheme. We highlight the most relevant subclasses by imposing constraints to their corresponding dual structures, thus broadening our understanding of spinor and its applications in theoretical physics.</description>

Abstract: The spectral zeta function of the quantum Rabi Hamiltonian is considered. It is shown that the spectral zeta function converges to the Riemann zeta function as the coupling constant goes to infinity. Moreover the path measure associated with the ground state of the quantum Rabi Hamiltonian is constructed on a discontinuous path space, and several applications are shown.</description>

Abstract: A quantum integrable spin chain model associated with the $G_2$ exceptional Lie algebra is studied. By using the fusion technique, the closed recursive relations among the fused transfer matrices are obtained. These identities allow us to derive the exact energy spectrum and Bethe ansatz equations of the system based on polynomial analysis. The present method provides a unified treatment to investigate the Bethe ansatz solutions for both periodic and non-diagonal open boundary conditions associated with exceptional Lie algebras.</description>

Abstract: In this work we derive several important equations in water waves and liquid crystals by deriving them as geodesic equations of right-invariant metrics on two infinite-dimensional groups. The equations we obtain this way are the Hopf (inviscid Burgers) equation, the Camassa-Holm equation, the Hunter-Saxton equation and the Korteweg-De Vries equation. We then study the symmetry groups of the equations themselves and show that one can improve the behaviour of the Hopf equation by metric and topological corrections. The symmetry groups of these equations can aid the benchmarking and testing of numerical methods.</description>

Abstract: A class of overlooked trigonometric-like functions is explored in this article, along with the relevant applications in applications. We show indeed that Taylor series, resembling that of an ordinary cosine, are representative of wider classes of functions, naturally suited for prolems ranging from molecular to Laser Physics. The article goes through the original motivations of the proposal and studies the relevant properties within the context of an Umbral interpretation. Their use in applications is discussed within the framework of Free Electron Laser theory, Lennard- Jones potentials and Kramers-Kronig causality identities</description>

Abstract: Any semigroup $\mathcal{S}$ of stochastic matrices induces a semigroup majorization relation $\prec^{\mathcal{S}}$ on the set $\Delta_{n-1}$ of probability $n$-vectors. Pick $X,Y$ at random in $\Delta_{n-1}$: what is the probability that $X$ and $Y$ are comparable under $\prec^{\mathcal{S}}$? We review recent asymptotic ($n\to\infty$) results and conjectures in the case of majorization relation (when $\mathcal{S}$ is the set of doubly stochastic matrices), discuss natural generalisations, and prove a new asymptotic result in the case of majorization, and new exact finite-$n$ formulae in the case of UT-majorization relation, i.e. when $\mathcal{S}$ is the set of upper-triangular stochastic matrices.</description>

Abstract: We consider the $n$-correlation of eigenvalues of random unitary matrices in the alternative form that is not the tidy determinant common in random matrix theory, but rather the expression derived from averages of ratios of characteristic polynomials in a method that can be mimicked in number theoretical calculations of the correlations of zeros of $L$-functions. This alternative form for eigenvalues of matrices from $U(N)$ was proposed by Conrey and Snaith and derived by them when the test function has support in (-2,2), derived by Chandee and Lee for support (-4,4) and here we calculate the expression when the support is (-6,6).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2110.01538v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a prototype for Wilsonian analysis of asymptotics of supersymmetric partition functions of non-abelian gauge theories. Localization allows expressing such partition functions as an integral over a BPS moduli space. When the limit of interest introduces a scale hierarchy in the problem, asymptotics of the partition function is obtained in the Wilsonian approach by $i)$ decomposing (in some suitable scheme) the BPS moduli space into various patches according to the set of light fields (lighter than the scheme dependent cut-off $\Lambda$) they support, $ii)$ localizing the partition function of the effective field theory on each patch (with cut-offs set by the scheme), and $iii)$ summing up the contributions of all patches to obtain the final asymptotic result (which is scheme-independent and accurate as $\Lambda\to\infty$). Our prototype concerns the Cardy-like asymptotics of the 4d superconformal index, which has been of interest recently for its application to black hole microstate counting in AdS$_5$/CFT$_4$. As a byproduct of our analysis we obtain the most general asymptotic expression for the index of gauge theories in the Cardy-like limit, encompassing and extending all previous results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.12085v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Toda Conformal Field Theories (CFTs) form a family of two-dimensional CFTs indexed by semisimple and complex Lie algebras. One of their remarkable features is that they are natural generalizations of Liouville CFT that enjoy an enhanced level of symmetry, prescribed by $W$-algebras. They likewise admit a probabilistic formulation in terms of Gaussian Multiplicative Chaos.
  Based on this probabilistic framework, this second article in a two-part series is dedicated to providing a first step towards integrability of these theories. In this perspective we prove the Fateev-Litvinov formula for a family of three-point correlation functions associated to the $\mathfrak{sl}_3$ Toda CFT. This result is the analog of the celebrated DOZZ formula in Liouville CFT. Our method of proof features techniques inspired by the physics literature together with probabilistic ones that naturally arise within the setting of Toda theories.</description>

      <title>Embedding formalism for ${\mathcal N}$-extended AdS superspace in four dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.04135v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The supertwistor and bi-supertwistor formulations for ${\mathcal N}$-extended anti-de Sitter (AdS) superspace in four dimensions, ${\rm AdS}^{4|4\mathcal N}$, were derived two years ago in arXiv:2108.03907. In the present paper, we introduce a novel realisation of the ${\mathcal N}$-extended AdS supergroup $\mathsf{OSp}(\mathcal{N}|4;\mathbb{R})$ and apply it to develop a coset construction for ${\rm AdS}^{4|4\mathcal N}$ and the corresponding differential geometry. This realisation naturally leads to an atlas on ${\rm AdS}^{4|4\mathcal N}$ (that is a generalisation of the stereographic projection for a sphere) that consists of two charts with chiral transition functions for ${\mathcal N}&gt;0$. A manifestly $\mathsf{OSp}(\mathcal{N}|4;\mathbb{R})$ invariant model for a superparticle in ${\rm AdS}^{4|4\mathcal N}$ is proposed. Additionally, by employing a conformal superspace approach, we describe the most general conformally flat $\mathcal N$-extended supergeometry. This construction is then specialised to the case of ${\rm AdS}^{4|4\mathcal N}$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05488v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the Eigenstate Thermalisation Hypothesis for Wigner matrices uniformly in the entire spectrum, in particular near the spectral edges, with a bound on the fluctuation that is optimal for any observable. This complements earlier works of Cipolloni et. al. (Comm. Math. Phys. 388, 2021; Forum Math., Sigma 10, 2022) and Benigni et. al. (Comm. Math. Phys. 391, 2022; arXiv: 2303.11142) that were restricted either to the bulk of the spectrum or to special observables. As a main ingredient, we prove a new multi-resolvent local law that optimally accounts for the edge scaling.</description>

      <title>Defect groups of class $\mathcal{S}$ theories from the Coulomb branch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16224v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the global forms of class $\mathcal{S}[A_{N-1}]$ 4d $\mathcal{N} = 2$ theories by deriving their defect groups (charges of line operators up to screening by local operators) from Coulomb branch data. Specifically, we employ an explicit construction of the BPS quiver for the case of full regular punctures to show that the defect group is $(\mathbb{Z}_N)^{2g}$, where $g$ is the genus of the associated Riemann surface. This determines a sector of surface operators in the 5d symmetry TFT. We show how these can also be identified from dimensional reduction of M-theory. We discuss connections to the theory of cluster algebras.</description>

      <title>On $p$-adic spectral zeta functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12775v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spectral zeta functions have been found many application in several branches of modern physics, including the quantum field theory, the string theory and the cosmology. In this paper, we shall consider the spectral zeta functions and their functional determinants in the $p$-adic field. Our approach for the constructions of $p$-adic spectral zeta functions is to apply the $p$-adic Mellin transforms with respect to locally analytic functions $f$, where $f$ interpolates the spectrum for the Hamiltonian of a quantum model.</description>

      <title>Tiny fluctuations of the averaging process around its degenerate steady state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze nonequilibrium fluctuations of the averaging process on $\mathbb T_\varepsilon^d$, a continuous degenerate Gibbs sampler running over the edges of the discrete $d$-dimensional torus. We show that, if we start from a smooth deterministic non-flat interface, recenter, blow-up by a non-standard CLT-scaling factor $\theta_\varepsilon=\varepsilon^{-(d/2+1)}$, and rescale diffusively, Gaussian fluctuations emerge in the limit $\varepsilon\to 0$. These fluctuations are purely dynamical, zero at times $t=0$ and $t=\infty$, and non-trivial for $t\in (0,\infty)$. We fully determine the correlation matrix of the limiting noise, non-diagonal as soon as $d\ge 2$. The main technical challenge in this stochastic homogenization procedure lies in a LLN for a weighted space-time average of squared discrete gradients. We accomplish this through a Poincar\'e inequality with respect to the underlying randomness of the edge updates, a tool from Malliavin calculus in Poisson space. This inequality, combined with sharp gradients' second moment estimates, yields quantitative variance bounds without prior knowledge of the limiting mean. Our method avoids higher (e.g., fourth) moment bounds, which seem inaccessible with the present techniques.</description>

      <title>Solutions of tetrahedron equation from quantum cluster algebra associated with symmetric butterfly quiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08814v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a new solution to the tetrahedron equation by further pursuing the quantum cluster algebra approach in our previous works. The key ingredients include a symmetric butterfly quiver attached to the wiring diagrams for the longest element of type $A$ Weyl groups and the implementation of quantum $Y$-variables through the $q$-Weyl algebra. The solution consists of four products of quantum dilogarithms, incorporating a total of seven parameters. By exploring both the coordinate and momentum representations, along with their modular double counterparts, our solution encompasses various known three-dimensional (3D) $R$-matrices. These include those obtained by Kapranov-Voevodsky ('94) utilizing the quantized coordinate ring, Bazhanov-Mangazeev-Sergeev ('10) from a quantum geometry perspective, Kuniba-Matsuike-Yoneyama ('23) linked with the quantized six-vertex model, and Inoue-Kuniba-Terashima ('23) associated with the Fock-Goncharov quiver. The 3D $R$-matrix presented in this paper offers a unified perspective on these existing solutions, coalescing them within the framework of quantum cluster algebra.</description>

      <title>Gromov-Witten Invariants and Mirror Symmetery For Non-Fano Varieties Via Tropical Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Under mirror symmetry a non-Fano variety $X$ corresponds to an instanton corrected Hori-Vafa potential $W$. The classical period of $W$ equals the regularized quantum period of $X$, which is a generating function for descendant Gromov-Witten invariants. These periods define closed mirror maps relating complex with symplectic parameters and open mirror maps relating coordinates on the mirror curves.
  We interpret the corrections to $W$ by broken lines in a scattering diagram, so that $W$ is the primitive theta function $\vartheta_1$. We show that, after wall crossing to infinity and application of the closed mirror map, $W=\vartheta_1$ is equal to the open mirror map. By tropical correspondence, $\vartheta_1$ is a generating function for $2$-marked logarithmic Gromov-Witten invariants, which are algebraic analogues of counts of Maslov index $2$ disks. This generalizes the predictions of mirror symmetry to the non-Fano case.</description>

      <title>Anomalous diffusion and factor ordering in (1+1)-dimensional Lorentzian quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00594v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using properties of diffusion according to a quantum heat kernel constructed as an expectation over classical heat kernels on $S^1$, we probe the non-manifold-like nature of quantized space in a model of (1+1)-dimensional quantum gravity. By computing the mean squared displacement of a diffusing particle, we find that diffusion is anomalous, behaving similarly to that on a porous substrate, network, or fractal over short distances. The walk dimension of the path for a particle diffusing in quantized space is calculated to have an infimum of 4, rising to arbitrarily large values depending on a parameter labeling the choice of factor ordering in the quantum Hamiltonian for our model and figuring in the asymptotic behavior of the wavefunction used to construct the quantum heat kernel. Additionally, we derive an expansion for return probability of a diffusing particle, whose modifications from the classical power-series form depend on the factor-ordering parameter.</description>

      <title>Berwald $m$-Kropina Spaces of Arbitrary Signature: Metrizability and Ricci-Flatness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The (pseudo-)Riemann-metrizability and Ricci-flatness of Finsler spaces with $m$-Kropina metric $F = \alpha^{1+m}\beta^{-m}$ of Berwald type are investigated. We prove that the affine connection on $F$ can locally be understood as the Levi-Civita connection of some (pseudo-)Riemannian metric if and only if the Ricci tensor of the canonical affine connection is symmetric. We also obtain a third equivalent characterization in terms of the covariant derivative of the 1-form $\beta$. We use these results to classify all locally metrizable $m$-Kropina spaces whose 1-forms have a constant causal character. In the special case where the first de Rahm cohomology group of the underlying manifold is trivial (which is true of simply connected manifolds, for instance), we show that global metrizability is equivalent to local metrizability and hence, in that case, our necessary and sufficient conditions also characterize global metrizability. In addition, we further obtain explicitly all Ricci-flat, locally metrizable $m$-Kropina metrics in $(3+1)$D whose 1-forms have a constant causal character. In fact, the only possibilities are essentially the following two: either $\alpha$ is flat and $\beta$ is $\alpha$-parallel, or $\alpha$ is a pp-wave and $\beta$ is $\alpha$-parallel.</description>

      <title>Large deviations of quenched and annealed random walk under the effect of disorder in strongly mixing environment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06581v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we establish the existence of large deviation principles of random walk in strongly mixing environments. The quenched and annealed rate functions have the same zero set whose shape is either a singleton point or a line segment, with an illustrative example communicated and given by F. Rassoul-Agha. Whenever the level of disorder is controlled, the two rate functions agree on compact sets at the boundary and in the interior both under strongly mixing conditions. Along the line we also indicate that under slightly more refined monotonicity conditions, there is a phase transition of the difference of two rate functions.</description>

      <title>Pure state entanglement and von Neumann algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop the theory of local operations and classical communication (LOCC) for bipartite quantum systems represented by commuting von Neumann algebras. Our central result is the extension of Nielsen's Theorem, stating that the LOCC ordering of bipartite pure states is equivalent to the majorization of their restrictions, to arbitrary factors. As a consequence, we find that in bipartite system modeled by commuting factors in Haag duality, a) all states have infinite single-shot entanglement if and only if the local factors are not of type I, b) type III factors are characterized by LOCC transitions of arbitrary precision between any two pure states, and c) the latter holds even without classical communication for type III$_{1}$ factors. In the case of semifinite factors, the usual construction of pure state entanglement monotones carries over. Together with recent work on embezzlement of entanglement, this gives a one-to-one correspondence between the classification of factors into types and subtypes and operational entanglement properties. In the appendix, we provide a self-contained treatment of majorization on semifinite von Neumann algebras and $\sigma$-finite measure spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the generalised hodograph method to regular non-diagonalisable integrable systems of hydrodynamic type, in light of the relation between such systems and F-manifolds with compatible connection. We discuss in detail the completeness of the symmetries of the system. Unlike the diagonalisable case, this does not follow from the natural integrability conditions but requires additional assumptions ensuring the applicability of a Darboux's theorem on Pfaffian systems. Under these assumptions, Tsarev's theory for diagonal systems is fully extended to regular non-diagonal systems.</description>

      <title>The anti-de Sitter supergeometry revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03172v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a supergravity framework, the $\cal N$-extended anti-de Sitter (AdS) superspace in four spacetime dimensions, $\text{AdS}^{4|4\cal N} $, is a maximally symmetric background that is described by a curved superspace geometry with structure group $\mathsf{SL}(2, \mathbb{C}) \times \mathsf{U}({\cal N})$. On the other hand, within the group-theoretic setting, $\text{AdS}^{4|4{\cal N}} $ is realised as the coset superspace $\mathsf{OSp}({\cal N}|4;\mathbb{R}) /\big[ \mathsf{SL}(2, \mathbb{C}) \times \mathsf{O}({\cal N}) \big]$, with its structure group being $\mathsf{SL}(2, \mathbb{C}) \times \mathsf{O}({\cal N})$. Here we explain how the two frameworks are related. We give two explicit realisations of $\text{AdS}^{4|4{\cal N}} $ as a conformally flat superspace, thus extending the ${\cal N}=1$ and ${\cal N}=2$ results available in the literature. As applications, we describe: (i) a two-parameter deformation of the $\text{AdS}^{4|4{\cal N}} $ interval and the corresponding superparticle model; (ii) some implications of conformal flatness for superconformal higher-spin multiplets and an effective action generating the $\mathcal{N}=2$ super-Weyl anomaly; and (iii) $\kappa$-symmetry of the massless AdS superparticle.</description>

      <title>Calculating Spectra by Sequential High-Pass Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We expand on the method of sequential filtering for calculating spectra of inhomogeneous fields. Sadek &amp; Aluie [Phys. Rev. Fluids, 3, 124610 (2018)] showed that the kernel has to have at least $p$ vanishing moments to extract a power-law spectrum $k^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha&lt;p+2$ by low-pass filtering. Here, we show that sequential high-pass filtering allows for extracting steeper spectra with $\alpha&lt;2p+3$ using the same $p$-th order kernel. For example, any spectrum of a field that is shallower than $k^{-5}$ can be extracted by sequential high-pass filtering using any 1st order kernel such as a Gaussian or top-hat. Finally, we demonstrate how second-order structure functions fail to capture spectral peaks because they cannot detect scaling that is too shallow.</description>
