      <title>Om-Theory of Macroscopic Electromagnetism: Greener Vibes for Isotropy-Broken Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The applicability ranges of macroscopic and microscopic electromagnetisms are opposite. While microscopic electromagnetism deals with point sources, singular fields, and discrete atomistic materials, macroscopic electromagnetism concerns smooth average distributions of sources, fields, and homogenized effective metamaterials. Greens function method - GFM - involves finding fields of point sources and applying superposition principle to find fields of distributed sources. When utilized to solve microscopic problems GFM is perfectly within the applicability range. Extension of GFM to simple macroscopic problems is convenient, but not fully logically sound, since point sources and singular fields are technically not a subject of macroscopic electromagnetism. This explains the difficulty of both finding the Greens functions and applying superposition principle in complex isotropy-broken media, which are very different from microscopic environments. In this manuscript, we lay out a path to solution of macroscopic Maxwells equations for distributed sources bypassing GFM, by introducing inverse approach and a method based on Om-potential which we describe here. To the researchers of electromagnetism this provides access to powerful analytical tools and a broad new space of solutions for Maxwells equations.</description>

      <title>Engineering harmonic emission through spatial modulation in a Kitaev chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate High-harmonic generation (HHG) in a dimerized Kitaev chain. The dimerization in the model is introduced through a site-dependent modulating potential, determined by a parameter $\lambda \in [-1:1]$. This parameter also determines the strength of the hopping amplitudes and tunes the system's topology. Depending upon the parameter $\lambda$, the HHG emission spectrum can be classified into three segments. The first segment exhibits two plateau structures, with the dominant one resulting from transitions to the chiral partner state, consistent with quasiparticle behavior in the topological superconducting phase. The second segment displays multiple plateaus, where intermediate states enable various transition pathways to higher conduction bands. Finally, the third segment presents broader plateaus, indicative of active interband transitions. In the $\lambda\leq0$ regime, we observe the mid-gap states (MGSs) hybridize with the bulk, suppressing the earlier observed harmonic enhancements. This highlights the key role of the intermediate states, particularly when MGSs are isolated. These results demonstrate that harmonic emission profiles can be selectively controlled through the modulating parameter $\lambda$, offering new prospects for tailoring HHG in topological systems.</description>

      <title>Identification of the high-pressure phases of alpha-SnWO4 combining x-ray diffraction and crystal structure prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have characterized the high-pressure behavior of alpha-SnWO4. The compound has been studied up to 30 GPa using a diamond-anvil cell and synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction. We report evidence of two structural phase transitions in the pressure range covered in our study, and we propose a crystal structure for the two high-pressure phases. The first one, observed around 12.9 GPa, has been obtained combining indexation using DICVOL and density-functional theory calculations. The second high-pressure phase, observed around 17.5 GPa, has been determined by using the CALYPSO code, the prediction of which was supported by a Le Bail fit to the experimental X-ray diffraction patterns. The proposed structural sequence involves two successive collapses of the unit-cell volume and an increase in the coordination number of Sn and W atoms. The room-temperature equations of state, the principal axes of compression and their compressibility, the elastic constants, and the elastic moduli are reported for {\alpha}-SnWO4 and for the two high-pressure phases.</description>
