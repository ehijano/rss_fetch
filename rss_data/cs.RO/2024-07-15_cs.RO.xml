      <title>Data-driven Model Reduction for Soft Robots via Lagrangian Operator Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven model reduction methods provide a nonintrusive way of constructing computationally efficient surrogates of high-fidelity models for real-time control of soft robots. This work leverages the Lagrangian nature of the model equations to derive structure-preserving linear reduced-order models via Lagrangian Operator Inference and compares their performance with prominent linear model reduction techniques through an anguilliform swimming soft robot model example with 231,336 degrees of freedom. The case studies demonstrate that preserving the underlying Lagrangian structure leads to learned models with higher predictive accuracy and robustness to unseen inputs.</description>

      <title>GCS*: Forward Heuristic Search on Implicit Graphs of Convex Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider large-scale, implicit-search-based solutions to the Shortest Path Problems on Graphs of Convex Sets (GCS). We propose GCS*, a forward heuristic search algorithm that generalizes A* search to the GCS setting, where a continuous-valued decision is made at each graph vertex, and constraints across graph edges couple these decisions, influencing costs and feasibility. Such mixed discrete-continuous planning is needed in many domains, including motion planning around obstacles and planning through contact. This setting provides a unique challenge for best-first search algorithms: the cost and feasibility of a path depend on continuous-valued points chosen along the entire path. We show that by pruning paths that are cost-dominated over their entire terminal vertex, GCS* can search efficiently while still guaranteeing cost optimality and completeness. To find satisficing solutions quickly, we also present a complete but suboptimal variation, pruning instead reachability-dominated paths. We implement these checks using polyhedral-containment or sampling-based methods. The sampling-based implementation is probabilistically complete and asymptotically cost optimal, and performs effectively even with minimal samples in practice. We demonstrate GCS* on planar pushing tasks where the combinatorial explosion of contact modes renders prior methods intractable and show it performs favorably compared to the state-of-the-art.

      <title>Tightly-Coupled LiDAR-IMU-Wheel Odometry with an Online Neural Kinematic Model Learning via Factor Graph Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08907v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Environments lacking geometric features (e.g., tunnels and long straight corridors) are challenging for LiDAR-based odometry algorithms because LiDAR point clouds degenerate in such environments. For wheeled robots, a wheel kinematic model (i.e., wheel odometry) can improve the reliability of the odometry estimation. However, the kinematic model suffers from complex motions (e.g., wheel slippage, lateral movement) in the case of skid-steering robots particularly because this robot model rotates by skidding its wheels. Furthermore, these errors change nonlinearly when the wheel slippage is large (e.g., drifting) and are subject to terrain-dependent parameters. To simultaneously tackle point cloud degeneration and the kinematic model errors, we developed a LiDAR-IMU-wheel odometry algorithm incorporating online training of a neural network that learns the kinematic model of wheeled robots with nonlinearity. We propose to train the neural network online on a factor graph along with robot states, allowing the learning-based kinematic model to adapt to the current terrain condition. The proposed method jointly solves online training of the neural network and LiDARIMUwheel odometry on a unified factor graph to retain the consistency of all those constraints. Through experiments, we first verified that the proposed network adapted to a changing environment, resulting in an accurate odometry estimation across different environments.We then confirmed that the proposed odometry estimation algorithm was robust against point cloud degeneration and nonlinearity (e.g., large wheel slippage by drifting) of the kinematic model.</description>

      <title>OVExp: Open Vocabulary Exploration for Object-Oriented Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Object-oriented embodied navigation aims to locate specific objects, defined by category or depicted in images. Existing methods often struggle to generalize to open vocabulary goals without extensive training data. While recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a promising solution by extending object recognition beyond predefined categories, efficient goal-oriented exploration becomes more challenging in an open vocabulary setting. We introduce OVExp, a learning-based framework that integrates VLMs for Open-Vocabulary Exploration. OVExp constructs scene representations by encoding observations with VLMs and projecting them onto top-down maps for goal-conditioned exploration. Goals are encoded in the same VLM feature space, and a lightweight transformer-based decoder predicts target locations while maintaining versatile representation abilities. To address the impracticality of fusing dense pixel embeddings with full 3D scene reconstruction for training, we propose constructing maps using low-cost semantic categories and transforming them into CLIP's embedding space via the text encoder. The simple but effective design of OVExp significantly reduces computational costs and demonstrates strong generalization abilities to various navigation settings. Experiments on established benchmarks show OVExp outperforms previous zero-shot methods, can generalize to diverse scenes, and handle different goal modalities.</description>

      <title>Sensorimotor Attention and Language-based Regressions in Shared Latent Variables for Integrating Robot Motion Learning and LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, studies have been actively conducted on combining large language models (LLM) and robotics; however, most have not considered end-to-end feedback in the robot-motion generation phase. The prediction of deep neural networks must contain errors, it is required to update the trained model to correspond to the real environment to generate robot motion adaptively. This study proposes an integration method that connects the robot-motion learning model and LLM using shared latent variables. When generating robot motion, the proposed method updates shared parameters based on prediction errors from both sensorimotor attention points and task language instructions given to the robot. This allows the model to search for latent parameters appropriate for the robot task efficiently. Through simulator experiments on multiple robot tasks, we demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed method from two perspectives: position generalization and language instruction generalization abilities.</description>

      <title>Navi2Gaze: Leveraging Foundation Models for Navigation and Target Gazing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Task-aware navigation continues to be a challenging area of research, especially in scenarios involving open vocabulary. Previous studies primarily focus on finding suitable locations for task completion, often overlooking the importance of the robot's pose. However, the robot's orientation is crucial for successfully completing tasks because of how objects are arranged (e.g., to open a refrigerator door). Humans intuitively navigate to objects with the right orientation using semantics and common sense. For instance, when opening a refrigerator, we naturally stand in front of it rather than to the side. Recent advances suggest that Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can provide robots with similar common sense. Therefore, we develop a VLM-driven method called Navigation-to-Gaze (Navi2Gaze) for efficient navigation and object gazing based on task descriptions. This method uses the VLM to score and select the best pose from numerous candidates automatically. In evaluations on multiple photorealistic simulation benchmarks, Navi2Gaze significantly outperforms existing approaches and precisely determines the optimal orientation relative to target objects.</description>

      <title>Fast and Accurate Multi-Agent Trajectory Prediction For Crowded Unknown Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of multi-agent trajectory prediction in crowded unknown environments. A novel energy function optimization-based framework is proposed to generate prediction trajectories. Firstly, a new energy function is designed for easier optimization. Secondly, an online optimization pipeline for calculating parameters and agents' velocities is developed. In this pipeline, we first design an efficient group division method based on Frechet distance to classify agents online. Then the strategy on decoupling the optimization of velocities and critical parameters in the energy function is developed, where the the slap swarm algorithm and gradient descent algorithms are integrated to solve the optimization problems more efficiently. Thirdly, we propose a similarity-based resample evaluation algorithm to predict agents' optimal goals, defined as the target-moving headings of agents, which effectively extracts hidden information in observed states and avoids learning agents' destinations via the training dataset in advance. Experiments and comparison studies verify the advantages of the proposed method in terms of prediction accuracy and speed.</description>

Abstract: Unmanned vehicles usually rely on Global Positioning System (GPS) and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors to achieve high-precision localization results for navigation purpose. However, this combination with their associated costs and infrastructure demands, poses challenges for widespread adoption in mass-market applications. In this paper, we aim to use only a monocular camera to achieve comparable onboard localization performance by tracking deep-learning visual features on a LiDAR-enhanced visual prior map. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm can provide centimeter-level global positioning results with scale, which is effortlessly integrated and favorable for low-cost robot system deployment in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Indoor Exploration Leveraging a Mixed-Size UAV Team with Heterogeneous Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heterogeneous teams of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can enhance the exploration capabilities of aerial robots by exploiting different strengths and abilities of varying UAVs. This paper presents a novel method for exploring unknown indoor spaces with a team of UAVs of different sizes and sensory equipment. We propose a frontier-based exploration with two task allocation strategies: a greedy strategy that assigns Points of Interest (POIs) based on Euclidean distance and UAV priority and an optimization strategy that solves a minimum-cost flow problem. The proposed method utilizes the SphereMap algorithm to assess the accessibility of the POIs and generate paths that account for obstacle distances, including collision avoidance maneuvers among UAVs. The proposed approach was validated through simulation testing and real-world experiments that evaluated the method's performance on board the UAVs.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Indoor Localization Approach Using WiFi RSSI Fingerprinting with SLAM-Enabled Robotic Platform and Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indoor localization plays a vital role in the era of the IoT and robotics, with WiFi technology being a prominent choice due to its ubiquity. We present a method for creating WiFi fingerprinting datasets to enhance indoor localization systems and address the gap in WiFi fingerprinting dataset creation. We used the Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) algorithm and employed a robotic platform to construct precise maps and localize robots in indoor environments. We developed software applications to facilitate data acquisition, fingerprinting dataset collection, and accurate ground truth map building. Subsequently, we aligned the spatial information generated via the SLAM with the WiFi scans to create a comprehensive WiFi fingerprinting dataset. The created dataset was used to train a deep neural network (DNN) for indoor localization, which can prove the usefulness of grid density. We conducted experimental validation within our office environment to demonstrate the proposed method's effectiveness, including a heatmap from the dataset showcasing the spatial distribution of WiFi signal strengths for the testing access points placed within the environment. Notably, our method offers distinct advantages over existing approaches as it eliminates the need for a predefined map of the environment, requires no preparatory steps, lessens human intervention, creates a denser fingerprinting dataset, and reduces the WiFi fingerprinting dataset creation time. Our method achieves 26% more accurate localization than the other methods and can create a six times denser fingerprinting dataset in one-third of the time compared to the traditional method. In summary, using WiFi RSSI Fingerprinting data surveyed by the SLAM-Enabled Robotic Platform, we can adapt our trained DNN model to indoor localization in any dynamic environment and enhance its scalability and applicability in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>MIXED-SENSE: A Mixed Reality Sensor Emulation Framework for Test and Evaluation of UAVs Against False Data Injection Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a high-fidelity Mixed Reality sensor emulation framework for testing and evaluating the resilience of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) against false data injection (FDI) attacks. The proposed approach can be utilized to assess the impact of FDI attacks, benchmark attack detector performance, and validate the effectiveness of mitigation/reconfiguration strategies in single-UAV and UAV swarm operations. Our Mixed Reality framework leverages high-fidelity simulations of Gazebo and a Motion Capture system to emulate proprioceptive (e.g., GNSS) and exteroceptive (e.g., camera) sensor measurements in real-time. We propose an empirical approach to faithfully recreate signal characteristics such as latency and noise in these measurements. Finally, we illustrate the efficacy of our proposed framework through a Mixed Reality experiment consisting of an emulated GNSS attack on an actual UAV, which (i) demonstrates the impact of false data injection attacks on GNSS measurements and (ii) validates a mitigation strategy utilizing a distributed camera network developed in our previous work.

      <title>Benchmarking Large Neighborhood Search for Multi-Agent Path Finding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) aims to arrange collision-free goal-reaching paths for a group of agents. Anytime MAPF solvers based on large neighborhood search (LNS) have gained prominence recently due to their flexibility and scalability. Neighborhood selection strategy is crucial to the success of MAPF-LNS and a flurry of methods have been proposed. However, several pitfalls exist and hinder a comprehensive evaluation of these new methods, which mainly include: 1) Lower than actual or incorrect baseline performance; 2) Lack of a unified evaluation setting and criterion; 3) Lack of a codebase or executable model for supervised learning methods. To overcome these challenges, we conduct a fair comparison across prominent methods on the same benchmark and hyperparameter search settings. Additionally, we propose a simple neighborhood selection strategy which marks a clear advancement in terms of runtime efficiency in large maps with large number of agents. Our benchmarking evaluation promotes new challenges for existing learning based methods and presents opportunities for future research when machine learning is integrated with MAPF-LNS. Code and data are available at https://github.com/ChristinaTan0704/mapf-lns-benchmark.</description>

      <title>GazeRace: Revolutionizing Remote Piloting with Eye-Gaze Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the GazeRace method for drone navigation, employing a computer vision interface facilitated by eye-tracking technology. This interface is designed to be compatible with a single camera and uses a convolutional neural network to convert eye movements into control commands for the drone. Experimental validation demonstrates that users equipped with the eye-tracking interface achieve comparable performance to a traditional remote control interface when completing a drone racing task.
  Ten participants completed flight tests in which they navigated a drone through a racing track in a Gazebo simulation environment. Users reduced drone trajectory length by 18% (73.44 m vs. 89.29 m) using the eye-tracking interface to navigate racing gates effectively. The time taken to complete the route using the eye-tracking method (average of 70.01 seconds) was only 3.5% slower than using the remote control method (also average of 70.01 seconds), indicating the good efficiency of the interface. It is also worth mentioning that four of the participants completed the race with an average time that was 25.9% faster than the other participants. In addition, users evaluated highly the performance (M = 34.0, SD = 14.2) and low frustration (M = 30.5, SD = 9.2) with the eye-tracking interface compared to performance (M = 63.0, SD = 10.1) and frustration (M = 49.0, SD = 11.7) with the baseline remote controller. The hedonic quality (M = 1.65, SD = 0.45) was also evaluated high by the users in the UEQ questionnaire.</description>

      <title>TRAVERSE: Traffic-Responsive Autonomous Vehicle Experience &amp; Rare-event Simulation for Enhanced safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data for training learning-enabled self-driving cars in the physical world are typically collected in a safe, normal environment. Such data distribution often engenders a strong bias towards safe driving, making self-driving cars unprepared when encountering adversarial scenarios like unexpected accidents. Due to a dearth of such adverse data that is unrealistic for drivers to collect, autonomous vehicles can perform poorly when experiencing such rare events. This work addresses much-needed research by having participants drive a VR vehicle simulator going through simulated traffic with various types of accidental scenarios. It aims to understand human responses and behaviors in simulated accidents, contributing to our understanding of driving dynamics and safety. The simulation framework adopts a robust traffic simulation and is rendered using the Unity Game Engine. Furthermore, the simulation framework is built with portable, light-weight immersive driving simulator hardware, lowering the resource barrier for studies in autonomous driving research.

      <title>Learning Coordinated Maneuver in Adversarial Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to solve the coordination of a team of robots traversing a route in the presence of adversaries with random positions. Our goal is to minimize the overall cost of the team, which is determined by (i) the accumulated risk when robots stay in adversary-impacted zones and (ii) the mission completion time. During traversal, robots can reduce their speed and act as a `guard' (the slower, the better), which will decrease the risks certain adversary incurs. This leads to a trade-off between the robots' guarding behaviors and their travel speeds. The formulated problem is highly non-convex and cannot be efficiently solved by existing algorithms. Our approach includes a theoretical analysis of the robots' behaviors for the single-adversary case. As the scale of the problem expands, solving the optimal solution using optimization approaches is challenging, therefore, we employ reinforcement learning techniques by developing new encoding and policy-generating methods. Simulations demonstrate that our learning methods can efficiently produce team coordination behaviors. We discuss the reasoning behind these behaviors and explain why they reduce the overall team cost.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Prediction Ensemble: Improving Out-of-Distribution Generalization of Motion Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning-based trajectory prediction models for autonomous driving often struggle with generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios, sometimes performing worse than simple rule-based models. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework, Adaptive Prediction Ensemble (APE), which integrates deep learning and rule-based prediction experts. A learned routing function, trained concurrently with the deep learning model, dynamically selects the most reliable prediction based on the input scenario. Our experiments on large-scale datasets, including Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) and Argoverse, demonstrate improvement in zero-shot generalization across datasets. We show that our method outperforms individual prediction models and other variants, particularly in long-horizon prediction and scenarios with a high proportion of OOD data. This work highlights the potential of hybrid approaches for robust and generalizable motion prediction in autonomous driving.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Computing Approach for Multi-robot Coverage Path Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper tackles the multi-vehicle Coverage Path Planning (CPP) problem, crucial for applications like search and rescue or environmental monitoring. Due to its NP-hard nature, finding optimal solutions becomes infeasible with larger problem sizes. This motivates the development of heuristic approaches that enhance efficiency even marginally. We propose a novel approach for exploring paths in a 2D grid, specifically designed for easy integration with the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA), a powerful quantum heuristic. Our contribution includes: 1) An objective function tailored to solve the multi-vehicle CPP using QAOA. 2) Theoretical proofs guaranteeing the validity of the proposed approach. 3) Efficient construction of QAOA operators for practical implementation. 4) Resource estimation to assess the feasibility of QAOA execution. 5) Performance comparison against established algorithms like the Depth First Search. This work paves the way for leveraging quantum computing in optimizing multi-vehicle path planning, potentially leading to real-world advancements in various applications.</description>

      <title>DegustaBot: Zero-Shot Visual Preference Estimation for Personalized Multi-Object Rearrangement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: De gustibus non est disputandum ("there is no accounting for others' tastes") is a common Latin maxim describing how many solutions in life are determined by people's personal preferences. Many household tasks, in particular, can only be considered fully successful when they account for personal preferences such as the visual aesthetic of the scene. For example, setting a table could be optimized by arranging utensils according to traditional rules of Western table setting decorum, without considering the color, shape, or material of each object, but this may not be a completely satisfying solution for a given person. Toward this end, we present DegustaBot, an algorithm for visual preference learning that solves household multi-object rearrangement tasks according to personal preference. To do this, we use internet-scale pre-trained vision-and-language foundation models (VLMs) with novel zero-shot visual prompting techniques. To evaluate our method, we collect a large dataset of naturalistic personal preferences in a simulated table-setting task, and conduct a user study in order to develop two novel metrics for determining success based on personal preference. This is a challenging problem and we find that 50% of our model's predictions are likely to be found acceptable by at least 20% of people.</description>

      <title>KGpose: Keypoint-Graph Driven End-to-End Multi-Object 6D Pose Estimation via Point-Wise Pose Voting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This letter presents KGpose, a novel end-to-end framework for 6D pose estimation of multiple objects. Our approach combines keypoint-based method with learnable pose regression through `keypoint-graph', which is a graph representation of the keypoints. KGpose first estimates 3D keypoints for each object using an attentional multi-modal feature fusion of RGB and point cloud features. These keypoints are estimated from each point of point cloud and converted into a graph representation. The network directly regresses 6D pose parameters for each point through a sequence of keypoint-graph embedding and local graph embedding which are designed with graph convolutions, followed by rotation and translation heads. The final pose for each object is selected from the candidates of point-wise predictions. The method achieves competitive results on the benchmark dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of our model. KGpose enables multi-object pose estimation without requiring an extra localization step, offering a unified and efficient solution for understanding geometric contexts in complex scenes for robotic applications.</description>

      <title>Deep Attention Driven Reinforcement Learning (DAD-RL) for Autonomous Vehicle Decision-Making in Dynamic Environment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous Vehicle (AV) decision making in urban environments is inherently challenging due to the dynamic interactions with surrounding vehicles. For safe planning, AV must understand the weightage of various spatiotemporal interactions in a scene. Contemporary works use colossal transformer architectures to encode interactions mainly for trajectory prediction, resulting in increased computational complexity. To address this issue without compromising spatiotemporal understanding and performance, we propose the simple Deep Attention Driven Reinforcement Learning (DADRL) framework, which dynamically assigns and incorporates the significance of surrounding vehicles into the ego's RL driven decision making process. We introduce an AV centric spatiotemporal attention encoding (STAE) mechanism for learning the dynamic interactions with different surrounding vehicles. To understand map and route context, we employ a context encoder to extract features from context maps. The spatiotemporal representations combined with contextual encoding provide a comprehensive state representation. The resulting model is trained using the Soft Actor Critic (SAC) algorithm. We evaluate the proposed framework on the SMARTS urban benchmarking scenarios without traffic signals to demonstrate that DADRL outperforms recent state of the art methods. Furthermore, an ablation study underscores the importance of the context-encoder and spatio temporal attention encoder in achieving superior performance.</description>

      <title>Communication-Aware Reinforcement Learning for Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) plays a pivotal role in enhancing traffic efficiency and safety in Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). Reinforcement Learning (RL) has proven effective in optimizing complex decision-making processes in CACC, leading to improved system performance and adaptability. Among RL approaches, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has shown remarkable potential by enabling coordinated actions among multiple CAVs through Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE). However, MARL often faces scalability issues, particularly when CACC vehicles suddenly join or leave the platoon, resulting in performance degradation. To address these challenges, we propose Communication-Aware Reinforcement Learning (CA-RL). CA-RL includes a communication-aware module that extracts and compresses vehicle communication information through forward and backward information transmission modules. This enables efficient cyclic information propagation within the CACC traffic flow, ensuring policy consistency and mitigating the scalability problems of MARL in CACC. Experimental results demonstrate that CA-RL significantly outperforms baseline methods in various traffic scenarios, achieving superior scalability, robustness, and overall system performance while maintaining reliable performance despite changes in the number of participating vehicles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The construction industry has been traditionally slow in adopting digital technologies. However, these are becoming increasingly necessary due to a plentitude of challenges, such as a shortage of skilled labor and decreasing productivity levels compared to other industries. Autonomous robotic systems can alleviate this problem, but the software development process for these systems is heavily driven by data, a resource usually challenging to find in the construction domain due to the lack of public availability. In our work, we therefore provide a dataset of 14,805 RGB images with segmentation labels for reinforced concrete construction and make it publicly available. We conduct a detailed analysis of our dataset and discuss how to deal with labeling inconsistencies. Furthermore, we establish baselines for the YOLOv8L-seg, DeepLabV3, and U-Net segmentation models and investigate the influence of data availability and label inconsistencies on the performance of these models. Our study showed that the models are precise in their predictions but would benefit from more data to increase the number of recalled instances. Label inconsistencies had a negligible effect on model performance, and we, therefore, advocate for a crowd-sourced dataset to boost the development of autonomous robotic systems in the construction industry.</description>

Abstract: Sinusoidal undulation has long been considered the most successful swimming pattern for fish and bionic aquatic robots [1]. However, a swimming pattern generated by the hair clip mechanism (HCM, part iii, Figure 1A) [2]~[5] may challenge this knowledge. HCM is an in-plane prestressed bi-stable mechanism that stores elastic energy and releases the stored energy quickly via its snap-through buckling. When used for fish robots, the HCM functions as the fish body and creates unique swimming patterns that we term HCM undulation. With the same energy consumption [3], HCM fish outperforms the traditionally designed soft fish with a two-fold increase in cruising speed. We reproduce this phenomenon in a single-link simulation with Aquarium [6]. HCM undulation generates an average propulsion of 16.7 N/m, 2-3 times larger than the reference undulation (6.78 N/m), sine pattern (5.34 N/m/s), and cambering sine pattern (6.36 N/m), and achieves an efficiency close to the sine pattern. These results can aid in developing fish robots and faster swimming patterns.</description>

Abstract: Learning from demonstration is a powerful method for teaching robots new skills, and having more demonstration data often improves policy learning. However, the high cost of collecting demonstration data is a significant bottleneck. Videos, as a rich data source, contain knowledge of behaviors, physics, and semantics, but extracting control-specific information from them is challenging due to the lack of action labels. In this work, we introduce a novel framework, Any-point Trajectory Modeling (ATM), that utilizes video demonstrations by pre-training a trajectory model to predict future trajectories of arbitrary points within a video frame. Once trained, these trajectories provide detailed control guidance, enabling the learning of robust visuomotor policies with minimal action-labeled data. Across over 130 language-conditioned tasks we evaluated in both simulation and the real world, ATM outperforms strong video pre-training baselines by 80% on average. Furthermore, we show effective transfer learning of manipulation skills from human videos and videos from a different robot morphology. Visualizations and code are available at: \url{https://xingyu-lin.github.io/atm}.</description>

      <title>High-Speed Motion Planning for Aerial Swarms in Unknown and Cluttered Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coordinated flight of multiple drones allows to achieve tasks faster such as search and rescue and infrastructure inspection. Thus, pushing the state-of-the-art of aerial swarms in navigation speed and robustness is of tremendous benefit. In particular, being able to account for unexplored/unknown environments when planning trajectories allows for safer flight. In this work, we propose the first high-speed, decentralized, and synchronous motion planning framework (HDSM) for an aerial swarm that explicitly takes into account the unknown/undiscovered parts of the environment. The proposed approach generates an optimized trajectory for each planning agent that avoids obstacles and other planning agents while moving and exploring the environment. The only global information that each agent has is the target location. The generated trajectory is high-speed, safe from unexplored spaces, and brings the agent closer to its goal. The proposed method outperforms four recent state-of-the-art methods in success rate (100% success in reaching the target location), flight speed (97% faster), and flight time (50% lower). Finally, the method is validated on a set of Crazyflie nano-drones as a proof of concept.</description>

      <title>GraspXL: Generating Grasping Motions for Diverse Objects at Scale</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human hands possess the dexterity to interact with diverse objects such as grasping specific parts of the objects and/or approaching them from desired directions. More importantly, humans can grasp objects of any shape without object-specific skills. Recent works synthesize grasping motions following single objectives such as a desired approach heading direction or a grasping area. Moreover, they usually rely on expensive 3D hand-object data during training and inference, which limits their capability to synthesize grasping motions for unseen objects at scale. In this paper, we unify the generation of hand-object grasping motions across multiple motion objectives, diverse object shapes and dexterous hand morphologies in a policy learning framework GraspXL. The objectives are composed of the graspable area, heading direction during approach, wrist rotation, and hand position. Without requiring any 3D hand-object interaction data, our policy trained with 58 objects can robustly synthesize diverse grasping motions for more than 500k unseen objects with a success rate of 82.2%. At the same time, the policy adheres to objectives, which enables the generation of diverse grasps per object. Moreover, we show that our framework can be deployed to different dexterous hands and work with reconstructed or generated objects. We quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate our method to show the efficacy of our approach. Our model, code, and the large-scale generated motions are available at https://eth-ait.github.io/graspxl/.</description>

      <title>TOP-Nav: Legged Navigation Integrating Terrain, Obstacle and Proprioception Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15256v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Legged navigation is typically examined within open-world, off-road, and challenging environments. In these scenarios, estimating external disturbances requires a complex synthesis of multi-modal information. This underlines a major limitation in existing works that primarily focus on avoiding obstacles. In this work, we propose TOP-Nav, a novel legged navigation framework that integrates a comprehensive path planner with Terrain awareness, Obstacle avoidance and close-loop Proprioception. TOP-Nav underscores the synergies between vision and proprioception in both path and motion planning. Within the path planner, we present and integrate a terrain estimator that enables the robot to select waypoints on terrains with higher traversability while effectively avoiding obstacles. In the motion planning level, we not only implement a locomotion controller to track the navigation commands, but also construct a proprioception advisor to provide motion evaluations for the path planner. Based on the close-loop motion feedback, we make online corrections for the vision-based terrain and obstacle estimations. Consequently, TOP-Nav achieves open-world navigation that the robot can handle terrains or disturbances beyond the distribution of prior knowledge and overcomes constraints imposed by visual conditions. Building upon extensive experiments conducted in both simulation and real-world environments, TOP-Nav demonstrates superior performance in open-world navigation compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>RoboUniView: Visual-Language Model with Unified View Representation for Robotic Manipulaiton</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Utilizing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for robotic manipulation represents a novel paradigm, aiming to enhance the model's ability to generalize to new objects and instructions. However, due to variations in camera specifications and mounting positions, existing methods exhibit significant performance disparities across different robotic platforms. To address this challenge, we propose RoboUniView in this paper, an innovative approach that decouples visual feature extraction from action learning. We first learn a unified view representation from multi-perspective views by pre-training on readily accessible data, and then derive actions from this unified view representation to control robotic manipulation. This unified view representation more accurately mirrors the physical world and is not constrained by the robotic platform's camera parameters. Thanks to this methodology, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the demanding CALVIN benchmark, enhancing the success rate in the $D \to D$ setting from 93.0% to 96.2%, and in the $ABC \to D$ setting from 92.2% to 94.2%. Moreover, our model exhibits outstanding adaptability and flexibility: it maintains high performance under unseen camera parameters, can utilize multiple datasets with varying camera parameters, and is capable of joint cross-task learning across datasets. Code is provided for re-implementation. https://github.com/liufanfanlff/RoboUniview</description>

Abstract: We present a framework for intuitive robot programming by non-experts, leveraging natural language prompts and contextual information from the Robot Operating System (ROS). Our system integrates large language models (LLMs), enabling non-experts to articulate task requirements to the system through a chat interface. Key features of the framework include: integration of ROS with an AI agent connected to a plethora of open-source and commercial LLMs, automatic extraction of a behavior from the LLM output and execution of ROS actions/services, support for three behavior modes (sequence, behavior tree, state machine), imitation learning for adding new robot actions to the library of possible actions, and LLM reflection via human and environment feedback. Extensive experiments validate the framework, showcasing robustness, scalability, and versatility in diverse scenarios, including long-horizon tasks, tabletop rearrangements, and remote supervisory control. To facilitate the adoption of our framework and support the reproduction of our results, we have made our code open-source.

      <description>arXiv:2407.07775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An elusive goal in navigation research is to build an intelligent agent that can understand multimodal instructions including natural language and image, and perform useful navigation. To achieve this, we study a widely useful category of navigation tasks we call Multimodal Instruction Navigation with demonstration Tours (MINT), in which the environment prior is provided through a previously recorded demonstration video. Recent advances in Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown a promising path in achieving this goal as it demonstrates capabilities in perceiving and reasoning about multimodal inputs. However, VLMs are typically trained to predict textual output and it is an open research question about how to best utilize them in navigation. To solve MINT, we present Mobility VLA, a hierarchical Vision-Language-Action (VLA) navigation policy that combines the environment understanding and common sense reasoning power of long-context VLMs and a robust low-level navigation policy based on topological graphs. The high-level policy consists of a long-context VLM that takes the demonstration tour video and the multimodal user instruction as input to find the goal frame in the tour video. Next, a low-level policy uses the goal frame and an offline constructed topological graph to generate robot actions at every timestep. We evaluated Mobility VLA in a 836m^2 real world environment and show that Mobility VLA has a high end-to-end success rates on previously unsolved multimodal instructions such as "Where should I return this?" while holding a plastic bin. A video demonstrating Mobility VLA can be found here: https://youtu.be/-Tof__Q8_5s</description>

Abstract: The accumulation of litter is increasing in many places and is consequently becoming a problem that must be dealt with. In this paper, we present a manipulator robotic system to collect litter in outdoor environments. This system has three functionalities. Firstly, it uses colour images to detect and recognise litter comprising different materials. Secondly, depth data are combined with pixels of waste objects to compute a 3D location and segment three-dimensional point clouds of the litter items in the scene. The grasp in 3 Degrees of Freedom (DoFs) is then estimated for a robot arm with a gripper for the segmented cloud of each instance of waste. Finally, two tactile-based algorithms are implemented and then employed in order to provide the gripper with a sense of touch. This work uses two low-cost visual-based tactile sensors at the fingertips. One of them addresses the detection of contact (which is obtained from tactile images) between the gripper and solid waste, while another has been designed to detect slippage in order to prevent the objects grasped from falling. Our proposal was successfully tested by carrying out extensive experimentation with different objects varying in size, texture, geometry and materials in different outdoor environments (a tiled pavement, a surface of stone/soil, and grass). Our system achieved an average score of 94% for the detection and Collection Success Rate (CSR) as regards its overall performance, and of 80% for the collection of items of litter at the first attempt.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Lyapunov Function Search Under Uncertainty</title>

Abstract: This paper develops methods for proving Lyapunov stability of dynamical systems subject to disturbances with an unknown distribution. We assume only a finite set of disturbance samples is available and that the true online disturbance realization may be drawn from a different distribution than the given samples. We formulate an optimization problem to search for a sum-of-squares (SOS) Lyapunov function and introduce a distributionally robust version of the Lyapunov function derivative constraint. We show that this constraint may be reformulated as several SOS constraints, ensuring that the search for a Lyapunov function remains in the class of SOS polynomial optimization problems. For general systems, we provide a distributionally robust chance-constrained formulation for neural network Lyapunov function search. Simulations demonstrate the validity and efficiency of either formulation on non-linear uncertain dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>MS-TCRNet: Multi-Stage Temporal Convolutional Recurrent Networks for Action Segmentation Using Sensor-Augmented Kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07814</link>

Abstract: Action segmentation is a challenging task in high-level process analysis, typically performed on video or kinematic data obtained from various sensors. This work presents two contributions related to action segmentation on kinematic data. Firstly, we introduce two versions of Multi-Stage Temporal Convolutional Recurrent Networks (MS-TCRNet), specifically designed for kinematic data. The architectures consist of a prediction generator with intra-stage regularization and Bidirectional LSTM or GRU-based refinement stages. Secondly, we propose two new data augmentation techniques, World Frame Rotation and Hand Inversion, which utilize the strong geometric structure of kinematic data to improve algorithm performance and robustness. We evaluate our models on three datasets of surgical suturing tasks: the Variable Tissue Simulation (VTS) Dataset and the newly introduced Bowel Repair Simulation (BRS) Dataset, both of which are open surgery simulation datasets collected by us, as well as the JHU-ISI Gesture and Skill Assessment Working Set (JIGSAWS), a well-known benchmark in robotic surgery. Our methods achieved state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>Boundary State Generation for Testing and Improvement of Autonomous Driving Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10590</link>

Abstract: Recent advances in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and sensor technologies are enabling autonomous driving systems (ADSs) with an ever-increasing level of autonomy. However, assessing their dependability remains a critical concern. State-of-the-art ADS testing approaches modify the controllable attributes of a simulated driving environment until the ADS misbehaves. In such approaches, environment instances in which the ADS is successful are discarded, despite the possibility that they could contain hidden driving conditions in which the ADS may misbehave.
  In this paper, we present GENBO (GENerator of BOundary state pairs), a novel test generator for ADS testing. GENBO mutates the driving conditions of the ego vehicle (position, velocity and orientation), collected in a failure-free environment instance, and efficiently generates challenging driving conditions at the behavior boundary (i.e., where the model starts to misbehave) in the same environment instance. We use such boundary conditions to augment the initial training dataset and retrain the DNN model under test. Our evaluation results show that the retrained model has, on average, up to 3x higher success rate on a separate set of evaluation tracks with respect to the original DNN model.</description>

      <title>D2S: Representing sparse descriptors and 3D coordinates for camera relocalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15250v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art visual localization methods mostly rely on complex procedures to match local descriptors and 3D point clouds. However, these procedures can incur significant costs in terms of inference, storage, and updates over time. In this study, we propose a direct learning-based approach that utilizes a simple network named D2S to represent complex local descriptors and their scene coordinates. Our method is characterized by its simplicity and cost-effectiveness. It solely leverages a single RGB image for localization during the testing phase and only requires a lightweight model to encode a complex sparse scene. The proposed D2S employs a combination of a simple loss function and graph attention to selectively focus on robust descriptors while disregarding areas such as clouds, trees, and several dynamic objects. This selective attention enables D2S to effectively perform a binary-semantic classification for sparse descriptors. Additionally, we propose a simple outdoor dataset to evaluate the capabilities of visual localization methods in scene-specific generalization and self-updating from unlabeled observations. Our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art CNN-based methods in scene coordinate regression in indoor and outdoor environments. It demonstrates the ability to generalize beyond training data, including scenarios involving transitions from day to night and adapting to domain shifts, even in the absence of the labeled data sources. The source code, trained models, dataset, and demo videos are available at the following link: https://thpjp.github.io/d2s.</description>

      <title>CLIPping the Limits: Finding the Sweet Spot for Relevant Images in Automated Driving Systems Perception Testing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Perception systems, especially cameras, are the eyes of automated driving systems. Ensuring that they function reliably and robustly is therefore an important building block in the automation of vehicles. There are various approaches to test the perception of automated driving systems. Ultimately, however, it always comes down to the investigation of the behavior of perception systems under specific input data. Camera images are a crucial part of the input data. Image data sets are therefore collected for the testing of automated driving systems, but it is non-trivial to find specific images in these data sets. Thanks to recent developments in neural networks, there are now methods for sorting the images in a data set according to their similarity to a prompt in natural language. In order to further automate the provision of search results, we make a contribution by automating the threshold definition in these sorted results and returning only the images relevant to the prompt as a result. Our focus is on preventing false positives and false negatives equally. It is also important that our method is robust and in the case that our assumptions are not fulfilled, we provide a fallback solution.</description>

Abstract: Embodied Artificial Intelligence (Embodied AI) is crucial for achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and serves as a foundation for various applications that bridge cyberspace and the physical world. Recently, the emergence of Multi-modal Large Models (MLMs) and World Models (WMs) have attracted significant attention due to their remarkable perception, interaction, and reasoning capabilities, making them a promising architecture for the brain of embodied agents. However, there is no comprehensive survey for Embodied AI in the era of MLMs. In this survey, we give a comprehensive exploration of the latest advancements in Embodied AI. Our analysis firstly navigates through the forefront of representative works of embodied robots and simulators, to fully understand the research focuses and their limitations. Then, we analyze four main research targets: 1) embodied perception, 2) embodied interaction, 3) embodied agent, and 4) sim-to-real adaptation, covering the state-of-the-art methods, essential paradigms, and comprehensive datasets. Additionally, we explore the complexities of MLMs in virtual and real embodied agents, highlighting their significance in facilitating interactions in dynamic digital and physical environments. Finally, we summarize the challenges and limitations of embodied AI and discuss their potential future directions. We hope this survey will serve as a foundational reference for the research community and inspire continued innovation.
