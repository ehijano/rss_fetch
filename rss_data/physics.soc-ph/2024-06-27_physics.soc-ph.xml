      <title>Anatomizing Societal Recovery at the Microscale: Heterogeneity in Household Lifestyle Activities Rebounding after Disasters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17993v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a granular analysis of societal recovery from disasters at the individual level, focusing on the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Ida. Societal recovery is defined as the restoration of the societal functioning of the affected community to its normal/steady-state level. It evaluates the recovery of impacted residents based on fluctuations in their lifestyle patterns in visits to points of interest. The analysis focuses on: (1) the extent of heterogeneity in lifestyle recovery of residents in the same spatial area; and (2) the extent to which variations in lifestyle recovery and its heterogeneity among users can be explained based on hazard impact extent and social vulnerability. As lifestyle recovery progresses, heterogeneity diminishes, indicating that lower lifestyle recovery rates correlate with higher heterogeneity within a spatial area. This relationship between lifestyle recovery and heterogeneity can lead to the misestimation of recovery timelines, potentially resulting in the inefficient allocation of resources and disproportionate attention to already recovering communities. Key contributions of the study are fourfold: First, it characterizes societal recovery at the finest scale by examining fluctuations in individual lifestyles, revealing heterogeneity even among neighbors. Second, it proposes using individual lifestyle as an indicator of societal functioning to measure, more human centrically, disaster impacts and recovery speeds. Third, it introduces a method for quantifying lifestyle recovery that enables near-real-time monitoring, departing from traditional survey-based methods. Fourth, it provides empirical insights into the relationship between disaster impacts and societal recovery, showing that the severity of disaster impacts and resident income levels and percentage of minority populations influence recovery durations.</description>

      <title>Emergence of social hierarchies in a society with two competitive classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agent-based models describing social interactions among individuals can help to better understand emerging macroscopic patterns in societies. One of the topics which is worth tackling is the formation of different kinds of hierarchies that emerge in social spaces such as cities. Here we propose a Bonabeau-like model by adding a second class of agents. The fundamental particularity of our model is that only a pairwise interaction between agents of the opposite class is allowed. Agent fitness can thus only change by competition among the two classes, while the total fitness in the society remains constant. The main result is that for a broad range of values of the model parameters, the fitness of the agents of each class show a decay in time except for one or very few agents which capture almost all the fitness in the society. Numerical simulations also reveal a singular shift from egalitarian to hierarchical society for each class. This behaviour depends on the control parameter $\eta$, playing the role of the inverse of the temperature of the system. Results are invariant with regard to the system size, contingent solely on the quantity of agents within each class. Finally, a couple of scaling laws are provided thus showing a data collapse from different model parameters and they follow a shape which can be related to the presence of a phase transition in the model.</description>

      <title>A Moonshot for AI Oracles in the Sciences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nobel laureate Philip Anderson and Elihu Abrahams once stated that, "even if machines did contribute to normal science, we see no mechanism by which they could create a Kuhnian revolution and thereby establish a new physical law." In this Perspective, we draw upon insights from the philosophies of science and artificial intelligence (AI) to propose necessary conditions of precisely such a mechanism for generating revolutionary mathematical theories. Recent advancements in AI suggest that satisfying the proposed necessary conditions by machines may be plausible; thus, our proposed necessary conditions also define a moonshot challenge. We also propose a heuristic definition of the intelligibility of mathematical theories to accelerate the development of machine theorists.</description>

      <title>Triple Helix synergy and patent dynamics. Cross country compartison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use a computationally efficient technique of Logistic Continuous Wavelet transform (CWT) to analyze patent data for Switzerland, Germany, USA, and Brszil for the period 1980-2000. We found that patent growth dynamics follows the dynamics of innovation system synergy in the framework of Triple Helix model of innovations where observed non-linear actors' interactions are provided by biased information exchange between heterogenious actors. Suggested approach reveals the latent trend structure in patent and innovation dynamics and may help policymakers identify the potential drivers of patent and innovation activity and form informed policy for boosting innovation development. The paper also privides a foundation for future research in differnt fields studying complex systems of interacting heterogenious agents.</description>

      <title>Persuasion, Betrayal and Regret in Election Campaigns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Elections play a fundamental role in democratic societies, however they are often characterized by unexpected results. Here we discuss an election campaign model inspired by the compartmental epidemiology, and we show that the model captures the main characteristics of an election campaign: persuasion, betrayal and regret. All of these three factors can be used together or independently to influence the campaign, and to determine the winner. We include results for both the deterministic and the stochastic versions of the model, and we show that the decision to not vote significantly increases the fluctuations in the model, amplifying the chance of controversial results, in agreement with the well known "paradox of not voting".</description>

      <title>Great year, bad Sharpe? A note on the joint distribution of performance and risk-adjusted return</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.08829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Returns distributions are heavy-tailed across asset classes. In this note, I examine the implications of this well-known stylized fact for the joint statistics of performance (absolute return) and Sharpe ratio (risk-adjusted return). Using both synthetic and real data, I show that, all other things being equal, the investments with the best in-sample performance are never associated with the best in-sample Sharpe ratios (and vice versa). This counter-intuitive effect is unrelated to the risk-return tradeoff familiar from portfolio theory: it is, rather, a consequence of asymptotic correlations between the sample mean and sample standard deviation of heavy-tailed variables. In addition to its large sample noise, this non-monotonic association of the Sharpe ratio with performance puts into question its status as the gold standard metric of investment quality.</description>
