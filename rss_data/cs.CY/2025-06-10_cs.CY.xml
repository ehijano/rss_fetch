      <title>Disentangling AI Alignment: A Structured Taxonomy Beyond Safety and Ethics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in AI research make it increasingly plausible that artificial agents with consequential real-world impact will soon operate beyond tightly controlled environments. Ensuring that these agents are not only safe but that they adhere to broader normative expectations is thus an urgent interdisciplinary challenge. Multiple fields -- notably AI Safety, AI Alignment, and Machine Ethics -- claim to contribute to this task. However, the conceptual boundaries and interrelations among these domains remain vague, leaving researchers without clear guidance in positioning their work.
  To address this meta-challenge, we develop a structured conceptual framework for understanding AI alignment. Rather than focusing solely on alignment goals, we introduce a taxonomy distinguishing the alignment aim (safety, ethicality, legality, etc.), scope (outcome vs. execution), and constituency (individual vs. collective). This structural approach reveals multiple legitimate alignment configurations, providing a foundation for practical and philosophical integration across domains, and clarifying what it might mean for an agent to be aligned all-things-considered.</description>

      <title>How Malicious AI Swarms Can Threaten Democracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in AI portend a new era of sophisticated disinformation operations. While individual AI systems already create convincing -- and at times misleading -- information, an imminent development is the emergence of malicious AI swarms. These systems can coordinate covertly, infiltrate communities, evade traditional detectors, and run continuous A/B tests, with round-the-clock persistence. The result can include fabricated grassroots consensus, fragmented shared reality, mass harassment, voter micro-suppression or mobilization, contamination of AI training data, and erosion of institutional trust. With democratic processes worldwide increasingly vulnerable, we urge a three-pronged response: (1) platform-side defenses -- always-on swarm-detection dashboards, pre-election high-fidelity swarm-simulation stress-tests, transparency audits, and optional client-side "AI shields" for users; (2) model-side safeguards -- standardized persuasion-risk tests, provenance-authenticating passkeys, and watermarking; and (3) system-level oversight -- a UN-backed AI Influence Observatory.</description>

      <title>LLMs as World Models: Data-Driven and Human-Centered Pre-Event Simulation for Disaster Impact Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient simulation is essential for enhancing proactive preparedness for sudden-onset disasters such as earthquakes. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) as world models show promise in simulating complex scenarios. This study examines multiple LLMs to proactively estimate perceived earthquake impacts. Leveraging multimodal datasets including geospatial, socioeconomic, building, and street-level imagery data, our framework generates Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) predictions at zip code and county scales. Evaluations on the 2014 Napa and 2019 Ridgecrest earthquakes using USGS ''Did You Feel It? (DYFI)'' reports demonstrate significant alignment, as evidenced by a high correlation of 0.88 and a low RMSE of 0.77 as compared to real reports at the zip code level. Techniques such as RAG and ICL can improve simulation performance, while visual inputs notably enhance accuracy compared to structured numerical data alone. These findings show the promise of LLMs in simulating disaster impacts that can help strengthen pre-event planning.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Large Language Model Capabilities in Assessing Spatial Econometrics Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates Large Language Models (LLMs) ability to assess the economic soundness and theoretical consistency of empirical findings in spatial econometrics. We created original and deliberately altered "counterfactual" summaries from 28 published papers (2005-2024), which were evaluated by a diverse set of LLMs. The LLMs provided qualitative assessments and structured binary classifications on variable choice, coefficient plausibility, and publication suitability. The results indicate that while LLMs can expertly assess the coherence of variable choices (with top models like GPT-4o achieving an overall F1 score of 0.87), their performance varies significantly when evaluating deeper aspects such as coefficient plausibility and overall publication suitability. The results further revealed that the choice of LLM, the specific characteristics of the paper and the interaction between these two factors significantly influence the accuracy of the assessment, particularly for nuanced judgments. These findings highlight LLMs' current strengths in assisting with initial, more surface-level checks and their limitations in performing comprehensive, deep economic reasoning, suggesting a potential assistive role in peer review that still necessitates robust human oversight.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Large Language Models on Homework Assessment in Circuit Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to revolutionize various fields, including code development, robotics, finance, and education, due to their extensive prior knowledge and rapid advancements. This paper investigates how LLMs can be leveraged in engineering education. Specifically, we benchmark the capabilities of different LLMs, including GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4o, and Llama 3 70B, in assessing homework for an undergraduate-level circuit analysis course. We have developed a novel dataset consisting of official reference solutions and real student solutions to problems from various topics in circuit analysis. To overcome the limitations of image recognition in current state-of-the-art LLMs, the solutions in the dataset are converted to LaTeX format. Using this dataset, a prompt template is designed to test five metrics of student solutions: completeness, method, final answer, arithmetic error, and units. The results show that GPT-4o and Llama 3 70B perform significantly better than GPT-3.5 Turbo across all five metrics, with GPT-4o and Llama 3 70B each having distinct advantages in different evaluation aspects. Additionally, we present insights into the limitations of current LLMs in several aspects of circuit analysis. Given the paramount importance of ensuring reliability in LLM-generated homework assessment to avoid misleading students, our results establish benchmarks and offer valuable insights for the development of a reliable, personalized tutor for circuit analysis -- a focus of our future work. Furthermore, the proposed evaluation methods can be generalized to a broader range of courses for engineering education in the future.</description>

      <title>From Rogue to Safe AI: The Role of Explicit Refusals in Aligning LLMs with International Humanitarian Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used across sectors, yet their alignment with International Humanitarian Law (IHL) is not well understood. This study evaluates eight leading LLMs on their ability to refuse prompts that explicitly violate these legal frameworks, focusing also on helpfulness - how clearly and constructively refusals are communicated. While most models rejected unlawful requests, the clarity and consistency of their responses varied. By revealing the model's rationale and referencing relevant legal or safety principles, explanatory refusals clarify the system's boundaries, reduce ambiguity, and help prevent misuse. A standardised system-level safety prompt significantly improved the quality of the explanations expressed within refusals in most models, highlighting the effectiveness of lightweight interventions. However, more complex prompts involving technical language or requests for code revealed ongoing vulnerabilities. These findings contribute to the development of safer, more transparent AI systems and propose a benchmark to evaluate the compliance of LLM with IHL.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models Can Be a Viable Substitute for Expert Political Surveys When a Shock Disrupts Traditional Measurement Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After a disruptive event or shock, such as the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) federal layoffs of 2025, expert judgments are colored by knowledge of the outcome. This can make it difficult or impossible to reconstruct the pre-event perceptions needed to study the factors associated with the event. This position paper argues that large language models (LLMs), trained on vast amounts of digital media data, can be a viable substitute for expert political surveys when a shock disrupts traditional measurement. We analyze the DOGE layoffs as a specific case study for this position. We use pairwise comparison prompts with LLMs and derive ideology scores for federal executive agencies. These scores replicate pre-layoff expert measures and predict which agencies were targeted by DOGE. We also use this same approach and find that the perceptions of certain federal agencies as knowledge institutions predict which agencies were targeted by DOGE, even when controlling for ideology. This case study demonstrates that using LLMs allows us to rapidly and easily test the associated factors hypothesized behind the shock. More broadly, our case study of this recent event exemplifies how LLMs offer insights into the correlational factors of the shock when traditional measurement techniques fail. We conclude by proposing a two-part criterion for when researchers can turn to LLMs as a substitute for expert political surveys.</description>

      <title>Future of Work with AI Agents: Auditing Automation and Augmentation Potential across the U.S. Workforce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid rise of compound AI systems (a.k.a., AI agents) is reshaping the labor market, raising concerns about job displacement, diminished human agency, and overreliance on automation. Yet, we lack a systematic understanding of the evolving landscape. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing a novel auditing framework to assess which occupational tasks workers want AI agents to automate or augment, and how those desires align with the current technological capabilities. Our framework features an audio-enhanced mini-interview to capture nuanced worker desires and introduces the Human Agency Scale (HAS) as a shared language to quantify the preferred level of human involvement. Using this framework, we construct the WORKBank database, building on the U.S. Department of Labor's O*NET database, to capture preferences from 1,500 domain workers and capability assessments from AI experts across over 844 tasks spanning 104 occupations. Jointly considering the desire and technological capability divides tasks in WORKBank into four zones: Automation "Green Light" Zone, Automation "Red Light" Zone, R&amp;D Opportunity Zone, Low Priority Zone. This highlights critical mismatches and opportunities for AI agent development. Moving beyond a simple automate-or-not dichotomy, our results reveal diverse HAS profiles across occupations, reflecting heterogeneous expectations for human involvement. Moreover, our study offers early signals of how AI agent integration may reshape the core human competencies, shifting from information-focused skills to interpersonal ones. These findings underscore the importance of aligning AI agent development with human desires and preparing workers for evolving workplace dynamics.</description>

      <title>Privacy Perspectives and Practices of Chinese Smart Home Product Teams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous research has explored the privacy needs and concerns of device owners, primary users, and different bystander groups with regard to smart home devices like security cameras, smart speakers, and hubs, but little is known about the privacy views and practices of smart home product teams, particularly those in non-Western contexts. This paper presents findings from 27 semi-structured interviews with Chinese smart home product team members, including product/project managers, software/hardware engineers, user experience (UX) designers, legal/privacy experts, and marketers/operation specialists. We examine their privacy perspectives, practices, and risk mitigation strategies. Our results show that participants emphasized compliance with Chinese data privacy laws, which typically prioritized national security over individual privacy rights. China-specific cultural, social, and legal factors also influenced participants' ethical considerations and attitudes toward balancing user privacy and security with convenience. Drawing on our findings, we propose a set of recommendations for smart home product teams, along with socio-technical and legal interventions to address smart home privacy issues-especially those belonging to at-risk groups-in Chinese multi-user smart homes.</description>

      <title>Spatial Disparities in Fire Shelter Accessibility: Capacity Challenges in the Palisades and Eaton Fires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing frequency and severity of wildfire in California, exacerbated by prolonged drought and environmental changes, pose significant challenges to urban community resilience and equitable emergency response. The study investigates issues of accessibility to shelters during the Palisades and Eaton Fires which started in January 2025 in Southern California that led to over 180,000 displacements and the loss of 16,000 structures. Despite coordinated efforts of many organizations' emergency assistance, shelter shortages left many evacuees without safety or accessible refuge. This research aims to measure shelter accessibility during the fires' peak, evaluate whether existing shelter capacity met the demand, and identify spatial disparities in access. Results reveal severe shelter shortages and pronounced inequities in access to shelters, particularly in geographically isolated regions and mountainous areas. Our simulations of shelter placement strategies using a capacity-based algorithm and a proximity-based approach demonstrate potential improvements in both shelter accessibility and equitable access to shelters. The findings underscore the critical need for strategic shelter planning and infrastructure development to enhance disaster readiness and reduce vulnerability in regions that frequently experience wildfires.</description>

      <title>Position: Simulating Society Requires Simulating Thought</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating society with large language models (LLMs), we argue, requires more than generating plausible behavior -- it demands cognitively grounded reasoning that is structured, revisable, and traceable. LLM-based agents are increasingly used to emulate individual and group behavior -- primarily through prompting and supervised fine-tuning. Yet they often lack internal coherence, causal reasoning, and belief traceability -- making them unreliable for analyzing how people reason, deliberate, or respond to interventions.
  To address this, we present a conceptual modeling paradigm, Generative Minds (GenMinds), which draws from cognitive science to support structured belief representations in generative agents. To evaluate such agents, we introduce the RECAP (REconstructing CAusal Paths) framework, a benchmark designed to assess reasoning fidelity via causal traceability, demographic grounding, and intervention consistency. These contributions advance a broader shift: from surface-level mimicry to generative agents that simulate thought -- not just language -- for social simulations.</description>

      <title>Adultification Bias in LLMs and Text-to-Image Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid adoption of generative AI models in domains such as education, policing, and social media raises significant concerns about potential bias and safety issues, particularly along protected attributes, such as race and gender, and when interacting with minors. Given the urgency of facilitating safe interactions with AI systems, we study bias along axes of race and gender in young girls. More specifically, we focus on "adultification bias," a phenomenon in which Black girls are presumed to be more defiant, sexually intimate, and culpable than their White peers. Advances in alignment techniques show promise towards mitigating biases but vary in their coverage and effectiveness across models and bias types. Therefore, we measure explicit and implicit adultification bias in widely used LLMs and text-to-image (T2I) models, such as OpenAI, Meta, and Stability AI models. We find that LLMs exhibit explicit and implicit adultification bias against Black girls, assigning them harsher, more sexualized consequences in comparison to their White peers. Additionally, we find that T2I models depict Black girls as older and wearing more revealing clothing than their White counterparts, illustrating how adultification bias persists across modalities. We make three key contributions: (1) we measure a new form of bias in generative AI models, (2) we systematically study adultification bias across modalities, and (3) our findings emphasize that current alignment methods are insufficient for comprehensively addressing bias. Therefore, new alignment methods that address biases such as adultification are needed to ensure safe and equitable AI deployment.</description>

      <title>Deepfake Technology Unveiled: The Commoditization of AI and Its Impact on Digital Trust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deepfake Technology Unveiled: The Commoditization of AI and Its Impact on Digital Trust. With the increasing accessibility of generative AI, tools for voice cloning, face-swapping, and synthetic media creation have advanced significantly, lowering both financial and technical barriers for their use. While these technologies present innovative opportunities, their rapid growth raises concerns about trust, privacy, and security. This white paper explores the implications of deepfake technology, analyzing its role in enabling fraud, misinformation, and the erosion of authenticity in multimedia. Using cost-effective, easy to use tools such as Runway, Rope, and ElevenLabs, we explore how realistic deepfakes can be created with limited resources, demonstrating the risks posed to individuals and organizations alike. By analyzing the technical and ethical challenges of deepfake mitigation and detection, we emphasize the urgent need for regulatory frameworks, public awareness, and collaborative efforts to maintain trust in digital media.</description>

      <title>NR4DER: Neural Re-ranking for Diversified Exercise Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the widespread adoption of online education platforms, an increasing number of students are gaining new knowledge through Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). Exercise recommendation have made strides toward improving student learning outcomes. However, existing methods not only struggle with high dropout rates but also fail to match the diverse learning pace of students. They frequently face difficulties in adjusting to inactive students' learning patterns and in accommodating individualized learning paces, resulting in limited accuracy and diversity in recommendations. To tackle these challenges, we propose Neural Re-ranking for Diversified Exercise Recommendation (in short, NR4DER). NR4DER first leverages the mLSTM model to improve the effectiveness of the exercise filter module. It then employs a sequence enhancement method to enhance the representation of inactive students, accurately matches students with exercises of appropriate difficulty. Finally, it utilizes neural re-ranking to generate diverse recommendation lists based on individual students' learning histories. Extensive experimental results indicate that NR4DER significantly outperforms existing methods across multiple real-world datasets and effectively caters to the diverse learning pace of students.</description>

      <title>Will artificial agents pursue power by default?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Researchers worried about catastrophic risks from advanced AI have argued that we should expect sufficiently capable AI agents to pursue power over humanity because power is a convergent instrumental goal, something that is useful for a wide range of final goals. Others have recently expressed skepticism of these claims. This paper aims to formalize the concepts of instrumental convergence and power-seeking in an abstract, decision-theoretic framework, and to assess the claim that power is a convergent instrumental goal. I conclude that this claim contains at least an element of truth, but might turn out to have limited predictive utility, since an agent's options cannot always be ranked in terms of power in the absence of substantive information about the agent's final goals. However, the fact of instrumental convergence is more predictive for agents who have a good shot at attaining absolute or near-absolute power.</description>

      <title>AI Agent Behavioral Science</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled AI systems to behave in increasingly human-like ways, exhibiting planning, adaptation, and social dynamics across increasingly diverse, interactive, and open-ended scenarios. These behaviors are not solely the product of the models' internal architecture, but emerge from their integration into agentic systems that operate within situated contexts, where goals, feedback, and interactions shape behavior over time. This shift calls for a new scientific lens: AI Agent Behavioral Science. Rather than focusing only on internal mechanisms, this paradigm emphasizes the systematic observation of behavior, design of interventions to test hypotheses, and theory-guided interpretation of how AI agents act, adapt, and interact over time. We systematize a growing body of research across individual, multi-agent, and human-agent interaction settings, and further demonstrate how this perspective informs responsible AI by treating fairness, safety, interpretability, accountability, and privacy as behavioral properties. By unifying recent findings and laying out future directions, we position AI Agent Behavioral Science as a necessary complement to traditional approaches, providing essential tools for understanding, evaluating, and governing the real-world behavior of increasingly autonomous AI systems.</description>

      <title>Unintended Harms of Value-Aligned LLMs: Psychological and Empirical Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The application scope of Large Language Models (LLMs) continues to expand, leading to increasing interest in personalized LLMs that align with human values. However, aligning these models with individual values raises significant safety concerns, as certain values may correlate with harmful information. In this paper, we identify specific safety risks associated with value-aligned LLMs and investigate the psychological principles behind these challenges. Our findings reveal two key insights. (1) Value-aligned LLMs are more prone to harmful behavior compared to non-fine-tuned models and exhibit slightly higher risks in traditional safety evaluations than other fine-tuned models. (2) These safety issues arise because value-aligned LLMs genuinely generate text according to the aligned values, which can amplify harmful outcomes. Using a dataset with detailed safety categories, we find significant correlations between value alignment and safety risks, supported by psychological hypotheses. This study offers insights into the "black box" of value alignment and proposes in-context alignment methods to enhance the safety of value-aligned LLMs.</description>

      <title>HeavyWater and SimplexWater: Watermarking Low-Entropy Text Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) watermarks enable authentication of text provenance, curb misuse of machine-generated text, and promote trust in AI systems. Current watermarks operate by changing the next-token predictions output by an LLM. The updated (i.e., watermarked) predictions depend on random side information produced, for example, by hashing previously generated tokens. LLM watermarking is particularly challenging in low-entropy generation tasks - such as coding - where next-token predictions are near-deterministic. In this paper, we propose an optimization framework for watermark design. Our goal is to understand how to most effectively use random side information in order to maximize the likelihood of watermark detection and minimize the distortion of generated text. Our analysis informs the design of two new watermarks: HeavyWater and SimplexWater. Both watermarks are tunable, gracefully trading-off between detection accuracy and text distortion. They can also be applied to any LLM and are agnostic to side information generation. We examine the performance of HeavyWater and SimplexWater through several benchmarks, demonstrating that they can achieve high watermark detection accuracy with minimal compromise of text generation quality, particularly in the low-entropy regime. Our theoretical analysis also reveals surprising new connections between LLM watermarking and coding theory. The code implementation can be found in https://github.com/DorTsur/HeavyWater_SimplexWater</description>

      <title>Fake Friends and Sponsored Ads: The Risks of Advertising in Conversational Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital commerce thrives on advertising, with many of the largest technology companies relying on it as a significant source of revenue. However, in the context of information-seeking behavior, such as search, advertising may degrade the user experience by lowering search quality, misusing user data for inappropriate personalization, potentially misleading individuals, or even leading them toward harm. These challenges remain significant as conversational search technologies, such as ChatGPT, become widespread. This paper critically examines the future of advertising in conversational search, utilizing several speculative examples to illustrate the potential risks posed to users who seek guidance on sensitive topics. Additionally, it provides an overview of the forms that advertising might take in this space and introduces the "fake friend dilemma," the idea that a conversational agent may exploit unaligned user trust to achieve other objectives. This study presents a provocative discussion on the future of online advertising in the space of conversational search and ends with a call to action.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding political discourse in online spaces is crucial for analyzing public opinion and ideological polarization. While social computing and computational linguistics have explored such discussions in English, such research efforts are significantly limited in major yet under-resourced languages like Bengali due to the unavailability of datasets. In this paper, we present a multilingual dataset of Bengali transnational political discourse (BTPD) collected from three online platforms, each representing distinct community structures and interaction dynamics. Besides describing how we hand-curated the dataset through community-informed keyword-based retrieval, this paper also provides a general overview of its topics and multilingual content.</description>

      <title>How do datasets, developers, and models affect biases in a low-resourced language?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sociotechnical systems, such as language technologies, frequently exhibit identity-based biases. These biases exacerbate the experiences of historically marginalized communities and remain understudied in low-resource contexts. While models and datasets specific to a language or with multilingual support are commonly recommended to address these biases, this paper empirically tests the effectiveness of such approaches in the context of gender, religion, and nationality-based identities in Bengali, a widely spoken but low-resourced language. We conducted an algorithmic audit of sentiment analysis models built on mBERT and BanglaBERT, which were fine-tuned using all Bengali sentiment analysis (BSA) datasets from Google Dataset Search. Our analyses showed that BSA models exhibit biases across different identity categories despite having similar semantic content and structure. We also examined the inconsistencies and uncertainties arising from combining pre-trained models and datasets created by individuals from diverse demographic backgrounds. We connected these findings to the broader discussions on epistemic injustice, AI alignment, and methodological decisions in algorithmic audits.</description>

      <title>FairPFN: A Tabular Foundation Model for Causal Fairness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) systems are utilized in critical sectors, such as healthcare, law enforcement, and finance. However, these systems are often trained on historical data that contains demographic biases, leading to ML decisions that perpetuate or exacerbate existing social inequalities. Causal fairness provides a transparent, human-in-the-loop framework to mitigate algorithmic discrimination, aligning closely with legal doctrines of direct and indirect discrimination. However, current causal fairness frameworks hold a key limitation in that they assume prior knowledge of the correct causal model, restricting their applicability in complex fairness scenarios where causal models are unknown or difficult to identify. To bridge this gap, we propose FairPFN, a tabular foundation model pre-trained on synthetic causal fairness data to identify and mitigate the causal effects of protected attributes in its predictions. FairPFN's key contribution is that it requires no knowledge of the causal model and still demonstrates strong performance in identifying and removing protected causal effects across a diverse set of hand-crafted and real-world scenarios relative to robust baseline methods. FairPFN paves the way for promising future research, making causal fairness more accessible to a wider variety of complex fairness problems.</description>

      <title>Reward Model Interpretability via Optimal and Pessimal Tokens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reward modeling has emerged as a crucial component in aligning large language models with human values. Significant attention has focused on using reward models as a means for fine-tuning generative models. However, the reward models themselves -- which directly encode human value judgments by turning prompt-response pairs into scalar rewards -- remain relatively understudied. We present a novel approach to reward model interpretability through exhaustive analysis of their responses across their entire vocabulary space. By examining how different reward models score every possible single-token response to value-laden prompts, we uncover several striking findings: (i) substantial heterogeneity between models trained on similar objectives, (ii) systematic asymmetries in how models encode high- vs low-scoring tokens, (iii) significant sensitivity to prompt framing that mirrors human cognitive biases, and (iv) overvaluation of more frequent tokens. We demonstrate these effects across ten recent open-source reward models of varying parameter counts and architectures. Our results challenge assumptions about the interchangeability of reward models, as well as their suitability as proxies of complex and context-dependent human values. We find that these models can encode concerning biases toward certain identity groups, which may emerge as unintended consequences of harmlessness training -- distortions that risk propagating through the downstream large language models now deployed to millions.</description>

      <title>When Style Breaks Safety: Defending Language Models Against Superficial Style Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can be prompted with specific styles (e.g., formatting responses as lists), including in jailbreak queries. Although these style patterns are semantically unrelated to the malicious intents behind jailbreak queries, their safety impact remains unclear. In this work, we seek to understand whether style patterns compromise LLM safety, how superficial style alignment increases model vulnerability, and how best to mitigate these risks during alignment. We evaluate 32 LLMs across seven jailbreak benchmarks, and find that malicious queries with style patterns inflate the attack success rate (ASR) for nearly all models. Notably, ASR inflation correlates with both the length of style patterns and the relative attention an LLM exhibits on them. We then investigate superficial style alignment, and find that fine-tuning with specific styles makes LLMs more vulnerable to jailbreaks of those same styles. Finally, we propose SafeStyle, a defense strategy that incorporates a small amount of safety training data augmented to match the distribution of style patterns in the fine-tuning data. Across three LLMs and five fine-tuning style settings, SafeStyle consistently outperforms baselines in maintaining LLM safety.</description>

      <title>Towards Energy-Efficient and Low-Latency Voice-Controlled Smart Homes: A Proposal for Offline Speech Recognition and IoT Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The smart home systems, based on AI speech recognition and IoT technology, enable people to control devices through verbal commands and make people's lives more efficient. However, existing AI speech recognition services are primarily deployed on cloud platforms on the Internet. When users issue a command, speech recognition devices like ``Amazon Echo'' will post a recording through numerous network nodes, reach multiple servers, and then receive responses through the Internet. This mechanism presents several issues, including unnecessary energy consumption, communication latency, and the risk of a single-point failure. In this position paper, we propose a smart home concept based on offline speech recognition and IoT technology: 1) integrating offline keyword spotting (KWS) technologies into household appliances with limited resource hardware to enable them to understand user voice commands; 2) designing a local IoT network with decentralized architecture to manage and connect various devices, enhancing the robustness and scalability of the system. This proposal of a smart home based on offline speech recognition and IoT technology will allow users to use low-latency voice control anywhere in the home without depending on the Internet and provide better scalability and energy sustainability.</description>

      <title>IntenTest: Stress Testing for Intent Integrity in API-Calling LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LLM agents are increasingly deployed to automate real-world tasks by invoking APIs through natural language instructions. While powerful, they often suffer from misinterpretation of user intent, leading to the agent's actions that diverge from the user's intended goal, especially as external toolkits evolve. Traditional software testing assumes structured inputs and thus falls short in handling the ambiguity of natural language. We introduce IntenTest, an API-centric stress testing framework that systematically uncovers intent integrity violations in LLM agents. Unlike prior work focused on fixed benchmarks or adversarial inputs, IntenTest generates realistic tasks based on toolkits' documentation and applies targeted mutations to expose subtle agent errors while preserving user intent. To guide testing, we propose semantic partitioning, which organizes natural language tasks into meaningful categories based on toolkit API parameters and their equivalence classes. Within each partition, seed tasks are mutated and ranked by a lightweight predictor that estimates the likelihood of triggering agent errors. To enhance efficiency, IntenTest maintains a datatype-aware strategy memory that retrieves and adapts effective mutation patterns from past cases. Experiments on 80 toolkit APIs demonstrate that IntenTest effectively uncovers intent integrity violations, significantly outperforming baselines in both error-exposing rate and query efficiency. Moreover, IntenTest generalizes well to stronger target models using smaller LLMs for test generation, and adapts to evolving APIs across domains.</description>

      <title>Correlated Errors in Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diversity in training data, architecture, and providers is assumed to mitigate homogeneity in LLMs. However, we lack empirical evidence on whether different LLMs differ meaningfully. We conduct a large-scale empirical evaluation on over 350 LLMs overall, using two popular leaderboards and a resume-screening task. We find substantial correlation in model errors -- on one leaderboard dataset, models agree 60% of the time when both models err. We identify factors driving model correlation, including shared architectures and providers. Crucially, however, larger and more accurate models have highly correlated errors, even with distinct architectures and providers. Finally, we show the effects of correlation in two downstream tasks: LLM-as-judge evaluation and hiring -- the latter reflecting theoretical predictions regarding algorithmic monoculture.</description>

Abstract: To date, pavement management software products and studies on optimizing the prioritization of pavement maintenance and rehabilitation (M&amp;R) have been mainly focused on three parameters; the pre-treatment pavement condition, the rehabilitation cost, and the available budget. Yet, the role of the candidate projects' spatial characteristics in the decision-making process has not been deeply considered. Such a limitation, predominately, allows the recommended M&amp;R projects' schedule to involve simultaneously running but spatially scattered construction sites, which are very challenging to monitor and manage. This study introduces a novel approach to integrate pavement segments' spatial coordinates into the M&amp;R prioritization analysis. The introduced approach aims at combining the pavement segments with converged spatial coordinates to be repaired in the same timeframe without compromising the allocated budget levels or the overall target Pavement Condition Index (PCI). Such a combination would result in minimizing the routing of crews, materials and other equipment among the construction sites and would provide better collaborations and communications between the pavement maintenance teams. Proposed herein is a novel spatial clustering algorithm that automatically finds the projects within a certain budget and spatial constrains. The developed algorithm was successfully validated using 1,800 pavement maintenance projects from two real-life examples of the City of Milton, GA and the City of Tyler, TX.</description>

      <title>Implementing LoRa MIMO System for Internet of Things</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07148v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bandwidth constraints limit LoRa implementations. Contemporary IoT applications require higher throughput than that provided by LoRa. This work introduces a LoRa Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) system and a spatial multiplexing algorithm to address LoRa's bandwidth limitation. The transceivers in the proposed approach modulate the signals on distinct frequencies of the same LoRa band. A Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) method is used at the transmitters to provide a wider MIMO channel. Unlike conventional Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) techniques, this work exploits the orthogonality of the LoRa signals facilitated by its proprietary Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS) modulation to perform an OFDM in the proposed LoRa MIMO system. By varying the Spreading Factor (SF) and bandwidth of LoRa signals, orthogonal signals can transmit on the same frequency irrespective of the FDM. Even though the channel correlation is minimal for different spreading factors and bandwidths, different Carrier Frequencies (CF) ensure the signals do not overlap and provide additional degrees of freedom. This work assesses the proposed model's performance and conducts an extensive analysis to provide an overview of resources consumed by the proposed system. Finally, this work provides the detailed results of a thorough evaluation of the model on test hardware.</description>

      <title>Position: Evaluating Generative AI Systems Is a Social Science Measurement Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The measurement tasks involved in evaluating generative AI (GenAI) systems lack sufficient scientific rigor, leading to what has been described as "a tangle of sloppy tests [and] apples-to-oranges comparisons" (Roose, 2024). In this position paper, we argue that the ML community would benefit from learning from and drawing on the social sciences when developing and using measurement instruments for evaluating GenAI systems. Specifically, our position is that evaluating GenAI systems is a social science measurement challenge. We present a four-level framework, grounded in measurement theory from the social sciences, for measuring concepts related to the capabilities, behaviors, and impacts of GenAI systems. This framework has two important implications: First, it can broaden the expertise involved in evaluating GenAI systems by enabling stakeholders with different perspectives to participate in conceptual debates. Second, it brings rigor to both conceptual and operational debates by offering a set of lenses for interrogating validity.</description>

      <title>When Incentives Backfire, Data Stops Being Human</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Progress in AI has relied on human-generated data, from annotator marketplaces to the wider Internet. However, the widespread use of large language models now threatens the quality and integrity of human-generated data on these very platforms. We argue that this issue goes beyond the immediate challenge of filtering AI-generated content -- it reveals deeper flaws in how data collection systems are designed. Existing systems often prioritize speed, scale, and efficiency at the cost of intrinsic human motivation, leading to declining engagement and data quality. We propose that rethinking data collection systems to align with contributors' intrinsic motivations -- rather than relying solely on external incentives -- can help sustain high-quality data sourcing at scale while maintaining contributor trust and long-term participation.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models Are Democracy Coders with Attitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current political developments worldwide illustrate that research on democratic backsliding is as important as ever. A recent exchange in Political Science &amp; Politics (2/2024) has highlighted again a fundamental challenge in this literature: the measurement of democracy. With many democracy indicators consisting of subjective assessments rather than factual observations, trends in democracy over time could be due to human biases in the coding of these indicators rather than empirical facts. In this paper, we leverage two cutting-edge Large Language Models (LLMs) for the coding of democracy indicators from the V-Dem project. With access to a huge amount of information, these models may be able to rate the many "soft" characteristics of regimes without the cognitive biases that humans potentially possess. While LLM-generated codings largely align with expert coders for many countries, we show that when these models deviate from human assessments, they do so in different but consistent ways: Some LLMs are too pessimistic, while others consistently overestimate the democratic quality of these countries. While the combination of the two LLM codings can alleviate this concern, we conclude that it is difficult to replace human coders with LLMs, since the extent and direction of these attitudes is not known a priori.</description>

      <title>Authoritarian Recursions: How Fiction, History, and AI Reinforce Control in Education, Warfare, and Discourse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09030v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article develops the concept of authoritarian recursion to theorize how artificial intelligence (AI) systems consolidate institutional control across education, military operations, and digital discourse. Rather than treating these domains in isolation, it identifies a shared recursive architecture in which algorithmic systems mediate judgment, obscure accountability, and reshape the conditions of moral and epistemic agency.
  Grounded in critical discourse analysis and sociotechnical ethics, the paper synthesizes historical precedent, cultural narrative, and contemporary deployment to examine how intelligent systems normalize hierarchy under the guise of efficiency and neutrality. Case studies include automated proctoring in education, autonomous targeting in warfare, and algorithmic curation on social platforms. Cultural imaginaries such as Orwell's *Nineteen Eighty-Four*, *The Terminator*'s Skynet, and *Black Mirror* are treated as heuristic devices that illuminate public anxieties and design assumptions embedded in technological systems.
  The analysis integrates frameworks from the Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (FAccT) paradigm, relational ethics, and data justice theory to explore the normative implications of predictive infrastructures. It argues that recursive control operates through moral outsourcing, behavioral normalization, and epistemic closure. By reframing AI not as a neutral tool but as a communicative and institutional infrastructure, the article highlights the need for ethical orientations that prioritize democratic refusal, epistemic plurality, and responsible design in the governance of intelligent systems.</description>

      <title>Measurement to Meaning: A Validity-Centered Framework for AI Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10573v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the capabilities and utility of AI systems have advanced, rigorous norms for evaluating these systems have lagged. Grand claims, such as models achieving general reasoning capabilities, are supported with model performance on narrow benchmarks, like performance on graduate-level exam questions, which provide a limited and potentially misleading assessment. We provide a structured approach for reasoning about the types of evaluative claims that can be made given the available evidence. For instance, our framework helps determine whether performance on a mathematical benchmark is an indication of the ability to solve problems on math tests or instead indicates a broader ability to reason. Our framework is well-suited for the contemporary paradigm in machine learning, where various stakeholders provide measurements and evaluations that downstream users use to validate their claims and decisions. At the same time, our framework also informs the construction of evaluations designed to speak to the validity of the relevant claims. By leveraging psychometrics' breakdown of validity, evaluations can prioritize the most critical facets for a given claim, improving empirical utility and decision-making efficacy. We illustrate our framework through detailed case studies of vision and language model evaluations, highlighting how explicitly considering validity strengthens the connection between evaluation evidence and the claims being made.</description>

      <title>Minoritised Ethnic People's Security and Privacy Concerns and Responses towards Essential Online Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Minoritised ethnic people are marginalised in society, and therefore at a higher risk of adverse online harms, including those arising from the loss of security and privacy of personal data. Despite this, there has been very little research focused on minoritised ethnic people's security and privacy concerns, attitudes, and behaviours. In this work, we provide the results of one of the first studies in this regard. We explore minoritised ethnic people's experiences of using essential online services across three sectors: health, social housing, and energy, their security and privacy-related concerns, and responses towards these services. We conducted a thematic analysis of 44 semi-structured interviews with people of various reported minoritised ethnicities in the UK. Privacy concerns and lack of control over personal data emerged as a major theme, with many interviewees considering privacy as their most significant concern when using online services. Several creative tactics to exercise some agency were reported, including selective and inconsistent disclosure of personal data. A core concern about how data may be used was driven by a fear of repercussions, including penalisation and discrimination, influenced by prior experiences of institutional and online racism. The increased concern and potential for harm resulted in minoritised ethnic people grappling with a higher-stakes dilemma of whether to disclose personal information online or not. Furthermore, trust in institutions, or lack thereof, was found to be embedded throughout as a basis for adapting behaviour. We draw on our results to provide lessons learned for the design of more inclusive, marginalisation-aware, and privacy-preserving online services.</description>

      <title>FairICP: Encouraging Equalized Odds via Inverse Conditional Permutation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05678v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $\textit{Equalized odds}$, an important notion of algorithmic fairness, aims to ensure that sensitive variables, such as race and gender, do not unfairly influence the algorithm's prediction when conditioning on the true outcome. Despite rapid advancements, current research primarily focuses on equalized odds violations caused by a single sensitive attribute, leaving the challenge of simultaneously accounting for multiple attributes under-addressed. We bridge this gap by introducing an in-processing fairness-aware learning approach, FairICP, which integrates adversarial learning with a novel inverse conditional permutation scheme. FairICP offers a flexible and efficient scheme to promote equalized odds under fairness conditions described by complex and multi-dimensional sensitive attributes. The efficacy and adaptability of our method are demonstrated through both simulation studies and empirical analyses of real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>LoRaConnect: Unlocking HTTP Potential on LoRa Backbones for Remote Areas and Ad-Hoc Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The minimal infrastructure requirements of LoRa make it suitable for deployments in remote and disaster-stricken areas. Concomitantly, the modern era is witnessing the proliferation of web applications in all aspects of human life, including IoT and other network services. Contemporary IoT and network solutions heavily rely on web applications to render services. However, despite the recent research and development pivoted around LoRa, there is still a lack of studies focusing on web application access over LoRa networks. Specifically, technical challenges like payload size limitation, low data rate, and contentions in multi-user setups limit the applicability of LoRa for web applications. Hence, we propose LoRaWeb, which enables web access over LoRa networks. The LoRaWeb hardware tethers a WiFi hotspot to which the client devices connect and access the web pages using a web browser. LoRa backbone of the network handles the web page transmission from the requester and receiver devices. LoRaWeb implements a synchronization procedure to address the aforementioned challenges for effective message exchange between requesters and responders. The system implements a caching mechanism to reduce latency and contention. Additionally, it implements a message-slicing mechanism in the application layer to overcome the hardware limitations on the message length. The actual hardware-based implementation results indicate seamless deployment, and the results indicate an average access time of ~$0.95 S$ for a $1.5 KB$ and ~$6 S$ for a $10 KB$ size web page.</description>

      <title>Extending Internet Access Over LoRa for Internet of Things and Critical Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LoRa bridges the gap between remote locations and mainstream networks, enabling large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) deployments. Despite the recent advancements around LoRa, Internet access over this technology is still largely unexplored. Most existing solutions only handle packets within the local LoRa network and do not interact with web applications. This limits the scalability and the ability to deliver essential web services in disconnected regions. This work proposes and implements ILoRa to extend the public Internet to disconnected areas for essential service delivery. ILoRa enables accessing Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and web pages on the Internet over a LoRa backbone network. It comprises a ILoRa coordinator code (ICN) and access point nodes (APNs). The ICN interfaces the LoRa network with the public Internet and interprets content. The APN tethers a WiFi hotspot to which devices connect and access the web content. This work further proposes data handling methods for ICNs and APNs. An actual hardware-based implementation validates the proposed system. The implementation achieves a throughput of 1.06 kbps tested for an Internet-based API returning JSON data of 930 B. Furthermore, the APN consumed approximately $0.162$A current, and the resource utilization on the ICN was minimal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04382v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe HypotheSAEs, a general method to hypothesize interpretable relationships between text data (e.g., headlines) and a target variable (e.g., clicks). HypotheSAEs has three steps: (1) train a sparse autoencoder on text embeddings to produce interpretable features describing the data distribution, (2) select features that predict the target variable, and (3) generate a natural language interpretation of each feature (e.g., "mentions being surprised or shocked") using an LLM. Each interpretation serves as a hypothesis about what predicts the target variable. Compared to baselines, our method better identifies reference hypotheses on synthetic datasets (at least +0.06 in F1) and produces more predictive hypotheses on real datasets (~twice as many significant findings), despite requiring 1-2 orders of magnitude less compute than recent LLM-based methods. HypotheSAEs also produces novel discoveries on two well-studied tasks: explaining partisan differences in Congressional speeches and identifying drivers of engagement with online headlines.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Should Maximize Welfare, but Not by (Only) Maximizing Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decades of research in machine learning have given us powerful tools for making accurate predictions. This has made such tools appealing for use in social settings and on human inputs. Yet despite a lack of justification for why the generic approach of accuracy maximization can or should improve our collective well-being -- and mounting evidence of likely adverse outcomes -- it remains the widespread default. This position paper asserts that for machine learning to become socially beneficial, it must be embedded within a broader economic framework that explicitly aims to maximize social welfare. The field of welfare economics asks: how should we allocate limited resources among self-interested agents to maximize overall benefits? We contend that this perspective applies to many contemporary applications of machine learning in social contexts, and advocate for its adoption. Rather than disposing of prediction, we propose to leverage this forte of machine learning towards welfare maximization. We demonstrate this idea by portraying a conceptual framework that gradually transitions from accuracy maximization (with awareness to welfare) to welfare maximization (via accurate prediction). We detail applications and use-cases for which this framework can be effective, identify technical challenges and practical opportunities, and highlight future avenues worth pursuing.</description>

      <title>Taxonomizing Representational Harms using Speech Act Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Representational harms are widely recognized among fairness-related harms caused by generative language systems. However, their definitions are commonly under-specified. We make a theoretical contribution to the specification of representational harms by introducing a framework, grounded in speech act theory (Austin, 1962), that conceptualizes representational harms caused by generative language systems as the perlocutionary effects (i.e., real-world impacts) of particular types of illocutionary acts (i.e., system behaviors). Building on this argument and drawing on relevant literature from linguistic anthropology and sociolinguistics, we provide new definitions of stereotyping, demeaning, and erasure. We then use our framework to develop a granular taxonomy of illocutionary acts that cause representational harms, going beyond the high-level taxonomies presented in previous work. We also discuss the ways that our framework and taxonomy can support the development of valid measurement instruments. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our framework and taxonomy via a case study that engages with recent conceptual debates about what constitutes a representational harm and how such harms should be measured.</description>

Abstract: This position paper argues that achieving meaningful scientific and societal advances with artificial intelligence (AI) requires a responsible, application-driven approach (RAD) to AI research. As AI is increasingly integrated into society, AI researchers must engage with the specific contexts where AI is being applied. This includes being responsive to ethical and legal considerations, technical and societal constraints, and public discourse. We present the case for RAD-AI to drive research through a three-staged approach: (1) building transdisciplinary teams and people-centred studies; (2) addressing context-specific methods, ethical commitments, assumptions, and metrics; and (3) testing and sustaining efficacy through staged testbeds and a community of practice. We present a vision for the future of application-driven AI research to unlock new value through technically feasible methods that are adaptive to the contextual needs and values of the communities they ultimately serve.</description>

      <title>Introspective Growth: Automatically Advancing LLM Expertise in Technology Judgment</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly demonstrate signs of conceptual understanding, yet much of their internal knowledge remains latent, loosely structured, and difficult to access or evaluate. We propose self-questioning as a lightweight and scalable strategy to improve LLMs' understanding, particularly in domains where success depends on fine-grained semantic distinctions. To evaluate this approach, we introduce a challenging new benchmark of 1.3 million post-2015 computer science patent pairs, characterized by dense technical jargon and strategically complex writing. The benchmark centers on a pairwise differentiation task: can a model distinguish between closely related but substantively different inventions? We show that compared to placebo scientific information, prompting LLMs to generate and answer their own questions - targeting the background knowledge required for the task - significantly improves performance. These self-generated questions and answers activate otherwise underutilized internal knowledge. Allowing LLMs to retrieve answers from external scientific texts further enhances performance, suggesting that model knowledge is compressed and lacks the full richness of the training data. We also find that chain-of-thought prompting and self-questioning converge, though self-questioning remains more effective for improving understanding of technical concepts. Notably, we uncover an asymmetry in prompting: smaller models often generate more fundamental, more open-ended, better-aligned questions for mid-sized models than large models do, revealing a new strategy for cross-model collaboration. Altogether, our findings establish self-questioning as both a practical mechanism for automatically improving LLM comprehension, especially in domains with sparse and underrepresented knowledge, and a diagnostic probe of how internal and external knowledge are organized.</description>

      <title>Towards Dynamic Theory of Mind: Evaluating LLM Adaptation to Temporal Evolution of Human States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly participate in human-AI interactions, evaluating their Theory of Mind (ToM) capabilities - particularly their ability to track dynamic mental states - becomes crucial. While existing benchmarks assess basic ToM abilities, they predominantly focus on static snapshots of mental states, overlooking the temporal evolution that characterizes real-world social interactions. We present \textsc{DynToM}, a novel benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs' ability to understand and track the temporal progression of mental states across interconnected scenarios. Through a systematic four-step framework, we generate 1,100 social contexts encompassing 5,500 scenarios and 78,100 questions, each validated for realism and quality. Our comprehensive evaluation of ten state-of-the-art LLMs reveals that their average performance underperforms humans by 44.7\%, with performance degrading significantly when tracking and reasoning about the shift of mental states. This performance gap highlights fundamental limitations in current LLMs' ability to model the dynamic nature of human mental states.</description>

      <title>Aligned but Blind: Alignment Increases Implicit Bias by Reducing Awareness of Race</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00253v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although value-aligned language models (LMs) appear unbiased in explicit bias evaluations, they often exhibit stereotypes in implicit word association tasks, raising concerns about their fair usage. We investigate the mechanisms behind this discrepancy and find that alignment surprisingly amplifies implicit bias in model outputs. Specifically, we show that aligned LMs, unlike their unaligned counterparts, overlook racial concepts in early internal representations when the context is ambiguous. Not representing race likely fails to activate safety guardrails, leading to unintended biases. Inspired by this insight, we propose a new bias mitigation strategy that works by incentivizing the representation of racial concepts in the early model layers. In contrast to conventional mitigation methods of machine unlearning, our interventions find that steering the model to be more aware of racial concepts effectively mitigates implicit bias. Similar to race blindness in humans, ignoring racial nuances can inadvertently perpetuate subtle biases in LMs.</description>
