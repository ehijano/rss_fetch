      <title>Volume inequalities for flow polytopes of full directed acyclic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a finite directed acyclic graph, the space of non-negative unit flows is a lattice polytope called the flow polytope of the graph. We consider the volumes of flow polytopes for directed acyclic graphs on $n+1$ vertices with a fixed degree sequence, with a focus on graphs having in- and out-degree two on every internal vertex. When the out-degree of the source is three and the number of vertices is fixed, we prove that there is an interchange operation on the edge set of these graphs that induces a partial order on the graphs isomorphic to a Boolean algebra. Further, we prove that as we move up through this partial order, the volumes of the corresponding flow polytopes weakly decrease. Finally, we show that each such graph is strongly planar and we provide an alternative interpretation of our results in the context of linear extensions for posets that are bipartite non-crossing trees.</description>

      <title>A combinatorial problem related to the classical probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the classical probability model, let $f(n)$ be the maximum number of pairwise independent events for the sample space with $n$ sample points. The determination of $f(n)$ is equivalent to the problem of determining the maximum cardinality of specific intersecting families on the set $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ . We show that $f(n)\leq n+1$, and $f(n)=n+1$ if there exists a Hadamard matrix of order $n$.</description>

      <title>Meta-theorems for Graph Polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper I survey the sources of inspiration for my own and co-authored work in trying to develop a general theory of graph polynomials. I concentrate on meta-theorems, i.e., theorem which depend only on the form infinite classes of graph polynomials are defined in some formalism, and not on the actual meaning of the particular definitions.</description>

      <title>Intersecting families with covering number $3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A covering number of a family is the size of the smallest set that intersects all sets from the family. In 1978 Frankl determined for $n\ge n_0(k)$ the largest intersecting family of $k$-element subsets of $[n]$ with covering number $3$. In this paper, we essentially settle this problem, showing that the same family is extremal for any $k\ge 100$ and $n&gt;2k$.</description>

      <title>Digraphs in which every $t$ vertices have exactly $\lambda$ common out-neighbors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We say that a digraph is a $(t,\lambda)$-liking digraph if every $t$ vertices have exactly $\lambda$ common out-neighbors. In 1975, Plesn\'{i}k [Graphs with a homogeneity, 1975. {\it Glasnik Mathematicki} 10:9-23] proved that any $(t,1)$-liking digraph is the complete digraph on $t+1$ vertices for each $t\geq 3$. Choi {\it et al}. [A digraph version of the Friendship Theorem, 2023. arXiv preprint arXiv:2305.04058] (to appear in {\it Discrete mathematics}) showed that a $(2,1)$-liking digraph is a fancy wheel digraph or a $k$-diregular digraph for some positive integer $k$. In this paper, we extend these results by completely characterizing the $(t,\lambda)$-liking digraphs with $t \geq \lambda+2$ and giving some equivalent conditions for a $(t,\lambda)$-liking digraph being a complete digraph on $t+\lambda$ vertices.</description>

      <title>Some sharp lower bounds for the bipartite Tur\'{a}n number of theta graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We expand Conlon's random algebraic construction to show that for any odd number $k \geq 3$ exists a natural number $c_k$ (the same as Conlon's) such that $\operatorname{ex}(n^a,n,\theta_{k,c_k}) = \Omega_{k,a}((n^{1 + a})^{\frac{k + 1}{2k}})$, with $a \in [\frac{k - 1}{k + 1}, 1)$. Where given a graph $H$, we denote by $\operatorname{ex}(n,m,H)$ the maximum number of edges an $H-$free bipartite graph can have when the cardinalities of its parts are $n$ and $m$. Also, we denote with $\theta_{k,l}$ the graph where two vertices are connected through $l$ disjoint paths of length $k$.</description>

      <title>Old and new powerful tools for the normal ordering problem and non-commutative binomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive formal general formulas for non-commutative exponentiation and the exponential function, while also revisiting an unrecognized, and yet powerful theorem. These tools are subsequently applied to derive counterparts for the exponential identity $e^{A+B} = e^A e^B$ and the binomial theorem $(A+B)^n = \sum \binom{n}{k} A^k B^{n-k}$ when the commutator $[B, A]$ is either an arbitrary quadratic polynomial or a monomial in $A$ or $B$. Analogous formulas are found when the commutator is bivariate. Furthermore, we introduce a novel operator bridging between the normal and antinormal forms.</description>

      <title>Saturation in Random Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $K^r_n$ be the complete $r$-uniform hypergraph on $n$ vertices, that is, the hypergraph whose vertex set is $[n]:=\{1,2,...,n\}$ and whose edge set is $\binom{[n]}{r}$. We form $G^r(n,p)$ by retaining each edge of $K^r_n$ independently with probability $p$.
  An $r$-uniform hypergraph $H\subseteq G$ is $F$-saturated if $H$ does not contain any copy of $F$, but any missing edge of $H$ in $G$ creates a copy of $F$. Furthermore, we say that $H$ is weakly $F$-saturated in $G$ if $H$ does not contain any copy of $F$, but the missing edges of $H$ in $G$ can be added back one-by-one, in some order, such that every edge creates a new copy of $F$. The smallest number of edges in an $F$-saturated hypergraph in $G$ is denoted by $sat(G,F)$, and in a weakly $F$-saturated hypergraph in $G$ by $wsat(G,F)$.
  In 2017, Kor\'andi and Sudakov initiated the study of saturation in random graphs, showing that for constant $p$, with high probability $sat(G(n,p),K_s)=(1+o(1))n\log_{\frac{1}{1-p}}n$, and $wsat(G(n,p),K_s)=wsat(K_n,K_s)$. Generalising their results, in this paper, we solve the suturation problem for random hypergraphs for every $2\le r &lt; s$ and constant $p$.</description>

      <title>Explicit Expressions for the First 20 Moments of the Area Under Dyck and Motzkin Paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting from AJ Bu's recent article that computed explicit expressions for the GENERATING functions of sums of powers of areas under Dyck and Motzkin paths, we deduce from them explicit expressions for the actual sequences. This enables taking the limits of the scaled moments and confirming, in an entirely elementary way, that they tend to those of the area under Brownian Excursion (up to any specified moment).</description>

      <title>Inducibility of rainbow graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fix $k\ge 11$ and a rainbow $k$-clique $R$. We prove that the inducibility of $R$ is $k!/(k^k-k)$. An extremal construction is a balanced recursive blow-up of $R$. This answers a question posed by Huang, that is a generalization of an old problem of Erd\H os and S\'os. It remains open to determine the minimum $k$ for which our result is true. More generally, we prove that there is an absolute constant $C&gt;0$ such that every $k$-vertex connected rainbow graph with minimum degree at least $C\log k$ has inducibility $k!/(k^k-k)$.</description>

      <title>Weakly Negative Circles Versus Best Clustering in Signed Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clustering a signed graph means partitioning the vertices into sets ("clusters") so that every positive edge, and no negative edge, is within a cluster. Clustering is not always possible; the obstruction is circles with exactly one negative edge ("weakly negative circles"). The correlation clustering problem is to cluster with the minimum number of edges that violate the clustering rule, called $Q$. A lower bound is $w$, the maximum number of edge-disjoint weakly negative circles. If every two such circles are edge disjoint, then $Q=w$. We characterize signed graphs of this kind.</description>

      <title>Unified bounds for the independence number of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hoffman ratio bound, Lov\'{a}sz theta function and Schrijver theta function are classical upper bounds for the independence number of graphs, which are useful in graph theory, extremal combinatorics and information theory. By using generalized inverses and eigenvalues of graph matrices, we give bounds for independence sets and the independence number of graphs. Our bounds unify the Lov\'{a}sz theta function, Schrijver theta function and Hoffman-type bounds, and we obtain the necessary and sufficient conditions of graphs attaining these bounds. Our work leads to some simple structural and spectral conditions for determining a maximum independent set, the independence number, the Shannon capacity and the Lov\'{a}sz theta function of a graph.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A chorded cycle is a cycle with at least one chord, and a doubly chorded cycle is a cycle with at least two chords. Gould asked in [Graphs Comb. 38 (2022) 189] the question: What spectral conditions imply a graph contains a chorded cycle? For a graph with fixed size, extremal spectral conditions are given to ensure that a graph contains a chorded cycle and a doubly chorded cycle, respectively, via spectral radius.</description>

      <title>On k-(total) limited packing in graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A set $B\subseteq V(G)$ is called a $k$-total limited packing set in a graph $G$ if $|B\cap N(v)|\leq k$ for any vertex $v\in V(G)$. The $k$-total limited packing number $L_{k,t}(G)$ is the maximum cardinality of a $k$-total limited packing set in $G$. Here, we give some results on the $k$-total limited packing number of graphs emphasizing trees, especially when $k=2$. We also study the $2$-(total) limited packing number of some product graphs.
  A $k$-limited packing partition ($k$LPP) of graph $G$ is a partition of $V(G)$ into $k$-limited packing sets. The minimum cardinality of a $k$LPP is called the $k$LPP number of $G$ and is denoted by $\chi_{\times k}(G)$, and we obtain some results for this parameter.</description>

      <title>On the enumeration of permutations avoiding chains of patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2019, B\'ona and Smith introduced the notion of strong pattern avoidance, saying that a permutation $\pi$ strongly avoids a pattern $\sigma$ if $\pi$ and $\pi^2$ both avoid $\sigma$. Recently, Archer and Geary generalized the idea of strong pattern avoidance to chain avoidance, in which a permutation $\pi$ avoids a chain of patterns $(\tau^{(1)}:\tau^{(2)}:\cdots:\tau^{(k)})$ if the $i$-th power of the permutation avoids the pattern $\tau^{(i)}$ for $1\leq i\leq k$. In this paper, we give explicit formulae for the number of sets of permutations avoiding certain chains of patterns. Our results give affirmative answers to two conjectures proposed by Archer and Geary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of matroid-reachability-based packing of arborescences was solved by Kir\'aly. Here we solve the corresponding decomposition problem that turns out to be more complicated. The result is obtained from the solution of the more general problem of matroid-reachability-based $(\ell,\ell')$-limited packing of arborescences where we are given a lower bound $\ell$ and an upper bound $\ell'$ on the total number of arborescences in the packing. The problem is considered for branchings and in directed hypergraphs as well.</description>

      <title>Difference ascent sequences and related combinatorial structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ascent sequences were introduced by Bousquet-M\'elou, Claesson, Dukes and Kitaev, which are in bijection with unlabeled $(2+2)$-free posets, Fishburn matrices, permutations avoiding a bivincular pattern of length $3$, and Stoimenow matchings. Analogous results for weak ascent sequences have been obtained by B\'enyi, Claesson and Dukes. Recently, Dukes and Sagan introduced a more general class of sequences which are called $d$-ascent sequences. They showed that some maps from the weak case can be extended to bijections for general $d$ while the extensions of others continue to be injective. The main objective of this paper is to restore these injections to bijections. To be specific, we introduce a class of permutations which we call them $d$-permutations and a class of factorial posets which we call them $d$-posets, both of which are showed to be in bijection with $d$-ascent sequences. Moreover, we also give a direct bijection between a class of matrices with a certain column restriction and Fishburn matrices. Our results give answers to several questions posed by Dukes and Sagan.</description>

      <title>Even and odd compositions with restricted parts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A result of Legendre asserts that the difference between the numbers of (length) even and odd partitions of $n$ into distinct parts is $0$, $1$, or $-1$; this also follows from Euler's pentagonal number theorem. We establish an analogous result for compositions and obtain some generalizations that are related to various entries in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences.</description>

      <title>Galoisian structure of large steps walks in the quadrant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The enumeration of walks in the quarter plane confined in the first quadrant has attracted a lot of attention over the past fifteenth years. The generating functions associated to small steps models satisfy a functional equation in two catalytic variables. For such models, Bousquet-M\'elou and Mishna defined a group called the group of the walk which turned out to be central in the classification of small steps models. In particular, its action on the catalytic variables yields a set of change of variables compatible with the structure of the functional equation. This particular set called the orbit has been generalized to models with arbitrary large steps by Bostan, Bousquet-M\'elou and Melczer. However, the orbit had till now no underlying group.
  In this article, we endow the orbit with the action of a Galois group, which extends the group of the walk to models with large steps. Within this Galoisian framework, we generalized the notions of invariants and decoupling. This enable us to develop a general strategy to prove the algebraicity of models with small backward steps. Our constructions lead to the first proofs of algebraicity of weighted models with large steps, proving in particular a conjecture of Bostan, Bousquet-M\'elou and Melczer, and allowing us to find new algebraic models with large steps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we construct families of bit sequences using combinatorial methods. Each sequence is derived by con- verting a collection of numbers encoding certain combinatorial nu- merics from objects exhibiting symmetry in various dimensions. Using the algorithms first described in [1] we show that the NIST testing suite described in publication 800-22 does not detect these symmetries hidden within these sequences.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a computational study of cutting plane algorithms for multi-stage stochastic mixed-integer programming models with the following cuts: (i) Benders', (ii) Integer L-shaped, and (iii) Lagrangian cuts. We first show that Integer L-shaped cuts correspond to one of the optimal solutions of the Lagrangian dual problem, and, therefore, belong to the class of Lagrangian cuts. To efficiently generate these cuts, we present an enhancement strategy to reduce time-consuming exact evaluations of integer subproblems by alternating between cuts derived from the relaxed and exact computation. Exact evaluations are only employed when Benders' cut from the relaxation fails to cut off the incumbent solution. Our preliminary computational results show the merit of this approach on multiple classes of real-world problems.</description>

      <title>An FPT Algorithm for the Exact Matching Problem and NP-hardness of Related Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exact matching problem is a constrained variant of the maximum matching problem: given a graph with each edge having a weight $0$ or $1$ and an integer $k$, the goal is to find a perfect matching of weight exactly $k$. Mulmuley, Vazirani, and Vazirani (1987) proposed a randomized polynomial-time algorithm for this problem, and it is still open whether it can be derandomized. Very recently, El Maalouly, Steiner, and Wulf (2023) showed that for bipartite graphs there exists a deterministic FPT algorithm parameterized by the (bipartite) independence number. In this paper, by extending a part of their work, we propose a deterministic FPT algorithm in general parameterized by the minimum size of an odd cycle transversal in addition to the (bipartite) independence number. We also consider a relaxed problem called the correct parity matching problem, and show that a slight generalization of an equivalent problem is NP-hard.</description>

Abstract: Two-weight linear codes are linear codes in which any nonzero codeword can have only two possible distinct weights. Those in the Hamming metric have proven to be very interesting for their connections with authentication codes, association schemes, strongly regular graphs, and secret sharing schemes. In this paper, we characterize two-weight codes in the rank metric, answering a recent question posed by Pratihar and Randrianarisoa.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that for $d\ge 2,\, k\ge 2$, if the Hausdorff dimension of a compact set $E\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ is greater than $\frac{d^2}{2d-1}$, then, for any given $r &gt; 0$, there exist $(x^1, \dots, x^{k+1})\in E^{k+1}$, $(y^1, \dots, y^{k+1})\in E^{k+1}$, a rotation $\theta \in \mathrm{O}_d(\mathbb{R})$, and a vector $a \in \mathbb{R}^d$ such that $rx^j = \theta y^j - a$ for $1 \leq j \leq k+1$. Such a result on existence of similar $k$-simplices in thin sets had previously been established under a more stringent dimensional threshold in Greenleaf, Iosevich and Mkrtchyan \cite{GIM21}. The argument we are use to prove the main result here was previously employed in Bhowmik and Rakhmonov \cite{BR23} to establish a finite field version. We also show the existence of multi-similarities of arbitrary multiplicity in $\R^d$, show how to extend these results from similarities to arbitrary proper continuous maps, as well as explore a general group-theoretic formulation of this problem in vector spaces over finite fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new and direct approach to study the solvability of systems of equations generated by bilinear forms. More precisely, let $B (\cdot,
  \cdot)$ be a non-degenerate bilinear form and $E$ be a set in $\mathbb{F}_q^2$. We prove that if $|E|\gg q^{5/3}$ then the number of triples $(B(x, y), B(y, z), B(z, x))$ with $x, y, z\in E$ is at least $cq^3$ for some positive constant $c$. This significantly improves a result due to the fifth listed author (2009).</description>

      <title>Counting Subnetworks Under Gene Duplication in Genetic Regulatory Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gene duplication is a fundamental evolutionary mechanism that contributes to biological complexity and diversity (Fortna et al., 2004). Traditionally, research has focused on the duplication of gene sequences (Zhang, 1914). However, evidence suggests that the duplication of regulatory elements may also play a significant role in the evolution of genomic functions (Teichmann and Babu, 2004; Hallin and Landry, 2019). In this work, the evolution of regulatory relationships belonging to gene-specific-substructures in a GRN are modeled. In the model, a network grows from an initial configuration by repeatedly choosing a random gene to duplicate. The likelihood that the regulatory relationships associated with the selected gene are retained through duplication is determined by a vector of probabilities. Occurrences of gene-family-specific substructures are counted under the gene duplication model. In this thesis, gene-family-specific substructures are referred to as subnetwork motifs. These subnetwork motifs are motivated by network motifs which are patterns of interconnections that recur more often in a specialized network than in a random network (Milo et al., 2002). Subnetwork motifs differ from network motifs in the way that subnetwork motifs are instances of gene-family-specific substructures while network motifs are isomorphic substructures. These subnetwork motifs are counted under Full and Partial Duplication, which differ in the way in which regulation relationships are inherited. Full duplication occurs when all regulatory links are inherited at each duplication step, and Partial Duplication occurs when regulation inheritance varies at each duplication step. Moments for the number of occurrences of subnetwork motifs are determined in each model. The results presented offer a method for discovering subnetwork motifs that are significant in a GRN under gene duplication.</description>

      <title>Efficient computation of Katz centrality for very dense networks via "negative parameter Katz"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Katz centrality (and its limiting case, eigenvector centrality) is a frequently used tool to measure the importance of a node in a network, and to rank the nodes accordingly. One reason for its popularity is that Katz centrality can be computed very efficiently when the network is sparse, i.e., having only $O(n)$ edges between its $n$ nodes. While sparsity is common in practice, in some applications one faces the opposite situation of a very dense network, where only $O(n)$ potential edges are missing with respect to a complete graph. We explain why and how, even for very dense networks, it is possible to efficiently compute the ranking stemming from Katz centrality for unweighted graphs, possibly directed and possibly with loops, by working on the complement graph. Our approach also provides an interpretation, regardless of sparsity, of "Katz centrality with negative parameter" as usual Katz centrality on the complement graph. For weighted graphs, we provide instead an approximation method that is based on removing sufficiently many edges from the network (or from its complement), and we give sufficient conditions for this approximation to provide the correct ranking. We include numerical experiments to illustrate the advantages of the proposed approach.</description>

Abstract: We prove that throughout the satisfiable phase, the logarithm of the number of satisfying assignments of a random 2-SAT formula satisfies a central limit theorem. This implies that the log of the number of satisfying assignments exhibits fluctuations of order $\sqrt n$, with $n$ the number of variables. The formula for the variance can be evaluated effectively. By contrast, for numerous other random constraint satisfaction problems the typical fluctuations of the logarithm of the number of solutions are {\em bounded} throughout all or most of the satisfiable regime.</description>

      <title>The spectral genus of an isolated hypersurface singularity and a conjecture relating to the Milnor number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notion of spectral genus $\widetilde{p}_{g}$ of a deformation of a germ of an isolated hypersurface singularity $(\mathbb{C}^{n+1}, 0) \to (\mathbb{C}, 0)$, defined as a sum of small exponents of monodromy eigenvalues. The number of these is equal to the geometric genus $p_{g}$, and hence $\widetilde{p}_g$ can be considered as a secondary invariant to it. We then explore a secondary version of the Durfee conjecture on $p_{g}$, regarding the relationship between $\widetilde{p}_{g}$ the Milnor number $\mu$, to the effect that $$\frac{\mu}{(n+2)!} &gt; \widetilde{p}_g.$$ We provide evidence by confirming the conjecture in several cases, including homogeneous singularities and singularities with large Newton polyhedra, and quasi-homogeneous or irreducible curve singularities.
  Our conjecture is shown to relate closely to the asymptotic behavior of the holomorphic analytic torsion of the sheaf of holomorphic functions on a degeneration of projective varieties, potentially indicating deeper geometric and analytic connections.</description>

Abstract: The goal of this paper is to introduce a construction of a vector bundle on a tropical variety. When the base is a tropical toric variety these tropicalize toric vector bundles, and are described by the data of a valuated matroid and some flats in the lattice of flats of the underlying matroid. The fibers are tropical linear spaces. We define global sections for tropical toric vector bundles, stability, and Jordan-H\"older and Harder-Narasimhan filtrations. Many of these require additional modularity assumptions on the defining matroid.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent developments have produced new ways to encode the data of a torus equivariant vector bundle over a toric variety using certain representable matroid(s) labeled by polyhedral data. In this paper we show that this data makes sense for non-representable matroids as well. We call the resulting combinatorial objects toric matorid bundles. We define equivariant $K$-theory and characteristic classes of these bundles. As a particular case, we show that any matroid comes with tautological toric matroid bundles over the permutahedral toric variety and the corresponding equivariant K-classes and Chern classes agree with those in the recent work of Berger-Eur-Spink-Tseng on matroid invariants. Moreover, in analogy with toric vector bundles, we define sheaf of sections and Euler characteristic as well as positivity notions such as global generation, ampleness and nefness for toric matroid bundles. Finally, we study the splitting of toric matroid bundles and, in particular, an analogue of Grothendieck's theorem on splitting of vector bundles on the projective line.</description>

Abstract: We consider the harmonic series $S(k)=\sum^{(k)} m^{-1}$ over the integers having $k$ occurrences of a given block of $b$-ary digits, of length $p$, and relate them to certain measures on the interval $[0,1)$. We show that these measures converge weakly to $b^p$ times the Lebesgue measure, a fact which allows a new proof of the theorem of Allouche, Hu, and Morin which says $\lim S(k)=b^p\log(b)$. A quantitative error estimate will be given. Combinatorial aspects involve generating series which fall under the scope of the Goulden-Jackson cluster generating function formalism and the work of Guibas-Odlyzko on string overlaps.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ be vectors in $\mathbf{R}^n$ with nonnegative coordinates. Permuting the coordinates, we can assume that $a_1 \geq \cdots \geq a_n$ and $b_1 \geq \cdots \geq b_n$. The vector $\mathbf{a}$ majorizes the vector $\mathbf{b}$, denoted $\mathbf{b} \preceq \mathbf{a}$, if $\sum_{i=1}^n b_i = \sum_{i=1}^n a_i$ and $\sum_{i=1}^k b_i \leq \sum_{i=1}^k a_i$ for all $k \in \{1,\ldots,n-1\}$. This paper proves theorems of Hardy-Littlewood-P\'olya and Rado that $\mathbf{b} \preceq \mathbf{a}$ if and only if $P\mathbf{a} = \mathbf{b}$ for some doubly stochastic matrix $P$ if and only if $\mathbf{b}$ is in the $S_n$-permutohedron generated by $\mathbf{a}$.</description>

      <title>A Murnaghan-Nakayama rule for Grothendieck polynomials of Grassmannian type</title>

      <description>arXiv:2110.06112v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Grothendieck polynomials appearing in the K-theory of Grassmannians, which are analogs of Schur polynomials. This paper aims to establish a version of the Murnaghan-Nakayama rule for Grothendieck polynomials of the Grassmannian type. This rule allows us to express the product of a Grothendieck polynomial with a power sum symmetric polynomial into a linear combination of other Grothendieck polynomials.</description>

      <title>Acyclic reorientation lattices and their lattice quotients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.12387v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the acyclic reorientation poset of a directed acyclic graph $D$ is a lattice if and only if the transitive reduction of any induced subgraph of $D$ is a forest. We then show that the acyclic reorientation lattice is always congruence normal, semidistributive (thus congruence uniform) if and only if $D$ is filled, and distributive if and only if $D$ is a forest. When the acyclic reorientation lattice is semidistributive, we introduce the ropes of $D$ that encode the join irreducibles acyclic reorientations and exploit this combinatorial model in three directions. First, we describe the canonical join and meet representations of acyclic reorientations in terms of non-crossing rope diagrams. Second, we describe the congruences of the acyclic reorientation lattice in terms of lower ideals of a natural subrope order. Third, we use Minkowski sums of shard polytopes of ropes to construct a quotientope for any congruence of the acyclic reorientation lattice.</description>

      <title>Constructing edge-disjoint Steiner trees in Cartesian product networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.12933v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cartesian product networks are always regarded as a tool for ``combining'' two given networks with established properties to obtain a new one that inherits properties from both. For a graph $F=(V,E)$ and a set $S\subseteq V(F)$ of at least two vertices, \emph{an $S$-Steiner tree} or \emph{a Steiner tree connecting $S$} (or simply, \emph{an $S$-tree}) is a subgraph $T=(V',E')$ of $F$ that is a tree with $S\subseteq V'$. For $S\subseteq V(F)$ and $|S|\geq 2$, the {\it generalized local edge-connectivity} $\lambda(S)$ is the maximum number of edge-disjoint Steiner trees connecting $S$ in $F$. For an integer $k$ with $2\leq k\leq n$, the {\it generalized $k$-edge-connectivity} $\lambda_k(F)$ of a graph $F$ is defined as $\lambda_k(F)=\min\{\lambda(S)\,|\,S\subseteq V(F) \ and \ |S|=k\}$.In this paper, we give sharp upper and lower bounds for $\lambda_k(G\Box H)$, where $\Box$ is the Cartesian product operation, and $G,H$ are two graphs.</description>

      <title>Induced subgraphs and tree decompositions XV. Even-hole-free graphs with bounded clique number have logarithmic treewidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that for every integer $t\geq 1$ there exists an integer $c_t\geq 1$ such that every $n$-vertex even-hole-free graph with no clique of size $t$ has treewidth at most $c_t\log{n}$. This resolves a conjecture of Sintiari and Trotignon, who also proved that the logarithmic bound is asymptotically best possible. It follows that several \textsf{NP}-hard problems such as \textsc{Stable Set}, \textsc{Vertex Cover}, \textsc{Dominating Set} and \textsc{Coloring} admit polynomial-time algorithms on this class of graphs. As a consequence, for every positive integer $r$, $r$-{\sc Coloring} can be solved in polynomial time on even-hole-free graphs without any assumptions on clique size.
  As part of the proof, we show that there is an integer $d$ such that every even-hole-free graph has a balanced separator which is contained in the (closed) neighborhood of at most $d$ vertices. This is of independent interest; for instance, it implies the existence of efficient approximation algorithms for certain \textsf{NP}-hard problems while restricted to the class of all even-hole-free graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A family of sets is $r$-wise agreeing if for any $r$ sets from the family there is an element $x$ that is either contained in all or contained in none of the $r$ sets. The study of such families is motivated by questions in discrete optimization. In this paper, we determine the size of the largest non-trivial $r$-wise agreeing family. This can be seen as a generalization of the classical Brace-Daykin theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A linearly ordered (LO) $k$-colouring of a hypergraph assigns to each vertex a colour from the set $\{0,1,\ldots,k-1\}$ in such a way that each hyperedge has a unique maximum element. Barto, Batistelli, and Berg conjectured that it is NP-hard to find an LO $k$-colouring of an LO 2-colourable 3-uniform hypergraph for any constant $k\geq 2$ [STACS'21] but even the case $k=3$ is still open. Nakajima and \v{Z}ivn\'{y} gave polynomial-time algorithms for finding, given an LO 2-colourable 3-uniform hypergraph, an LO colouring with $O^*(\sqrt{n})$ colours [ICALP'22] and an LO colouring with $O^*(\sqrt[3]{n})$ colours [ACM ToCT'23]. Very recently, Louis, Newman, and Ray gave an SDP-based algorithm with $O^*(\sqrt[5]{n})$ colours. We present two simple polynomial-time algorithms that find an LO colouring with $O(\log_2(n))$ colours, which is an exponential improvement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a variant of domination, called Roman domination, where we must assign to each vertex one of the labels 0, 1, or 2 and require that every vertex with label 0 has a neighbour with label 2. We study the problem of finding a low-cost Roman dominating function on Lebesgue-measurable graphings, that is, on infinite graphs whose vertices are the points of a probability space. We provide a framework to tackle optimisation problems in the measurable combinatorial setting. In particular, we fully answer the Roman domination problem on irrational cycle graphs, a specific type of graphing on the space $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ where an irrational number ${\alpha}$ is given and two vertices are adjacent if and only if their distance is ${\alpha}$.</description>

Abstract: Andrews and Merca [J. Combin. Theory Ser. A 203 (2024), Art. 105849] recently obtained two interesting results on the sum of the parts with the same parity in the partitions of $n$ (the modulo $2$ case), the proof of which relies on generating functions. Motivated by Andrews and Merca's results, we define six statistics related to the partitions of $n$ and show that the two triples of the six statistics are equidistributed. From this equidistributed result, we derive modulo $m$ extensions of Andrews and Merca's results for all integers $m\ge 2$. The proof of the main result is based on a general bijection on the set of partitions of $n$.</description>

Abstract: A group $G$ is complete group if it satisfies $Z(G)=e$ and $Aut(G)=Inn(G)$. In this paper, on the one hand, we study the basic properties of generalized Cayley graphs and characterize two classes isomorphic generalized generalized Cayley graphs of complete groups.
  On the other hand, we give the sufficient and necessary conditions of complete group to be $GCI$ group and restricted $GCI$ group. As an application, we complete the classification of restricted $GCI$-groups for symmetric groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.10748v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $r\geq 1$ be a positive integer, $A$ a real positive definite symmetric $r\times r$ matrix, $B$ a vector of length $r$, and $C$ a scalar. Nahm's problem is to describe all such $A,B$ and $C$ with rational entries for which a specific $r$-fold $q$-hypergeometric series (denoted by $f_{A,B,C}(q)$) involving the parameters $A,B,C$ is modular. When the rank $r=2$, Zagier provided eleven sets of examples of $(A,B,C)$ for which $f_{A,B,C}(q)$ is likely to be modular. We present a number of Rogers--Ramanujan type identities involving double sums, which give modular representations for Zagier's rank two examples. Together with several known cases in the literature, we verified ten of Zagier's examples and give conjectural identities for the remaining example.</description>

      <title>Complexity Framework for Forbidden Subgraphs II: Edge Subdivision and the "H"-graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.14214v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a fixed set ${\cal H}$ of graphs, a graph $G$ is ${\cal H}$-subgraph-free if $G$ does not contain any $H \in {\cal H}$ as a (not necessarily induced) subgraph. A recently proposed framework gives a complete classification on ${\cal H}$-subgraph-free graphs (for finite sets ${\cal H}$) for problems that are solvable in polynomial time on graph classes of bounded treewidth, NP-complete on subcubic graphs, and whose NP-hardness is preserved under edge subdivision. While a lot of problems satisfy these conditions, there are also many problems that do not satisfy all three conditions and for which the complexity in ${\cal H}$-subgraph-free graphs is unknown. We study problems for which only the first two conditions of the framework hold (they are solvable in polynomial time on classes of bounded treewidth and NP-complete on subcubic graphs, but NP-hardness is not preserved under edge subdivision). In particular, we make inroads into the classification of the complexity of four such problems: Hamilton Cycle, $k$-Induced Disjoint Paths, $C_5$-Colouring and Star $3$-Colouring. Although we do not complete the classifications, we show that the boundary between polynomial time and NP-complete differs among our problems and also from problems that do satisfy all three conditions of the framework, in particular when we forbid certain subdivisions of the ``H''-graph (the graph that looks like the letter ``H''). Hence, we exhibit a rich complexity landscape among problems for ${\cal H}$-subgraph-free graph classes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.06159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Calabi-Yau manifolds can be obtained as hypersurfaces in toric varieties built from reflexive polytopes. We generate reflexive polytopes in various dimensions using a genetic algorithm. As a proof of principle, we demonstrate that our algorithm reproduces the full set of reflexive polytopes in two and three dimensions, and in four dimensions with a small number of vertices and points. Motivated by this result, we construct five-dimensional reflexive polytopes with the lowest number of vertices and points. By calculating the normal form of the polytopes, we establish that many of these are not in existing datasets and therefore give rise to new Calabi-Yau four-folds. In some instances, the Hodge numbers we compute are new as well.</description>

      <title>The landscape of compressibility measures for two-dimensional data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02629v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we extend to two-dimensional data two recently introduced one-dimensional compressibility measures: the $\gamma$ measure defined in terms of the smallest {string attractor}, and the $\delta$ measure defined in terms of the number of distinct substrings of the input string. Concretely, we introduce the two-dimensional measures $\gamma_{2D}$ and $\delta_{2D}$, as natural generalizations of $\gamma$ and $\delta$, and we initiate the study of their properties. Among other things, we prove that $\delta_{2D}$ is monotone and can be computed in linear time, and we show that, although it is still true that $\delta_{2D} \leq \gamma_{2D}$, the gap between the two measures can be $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ for families of $n\times n$ matrices and therefore asymptotically larger than the gap between $\gamma$ and $\delta$. To complete the scenario of two-dimensional compressibility measures, we introduce the measure $b_{2D}$ which generalizes to two dimensions the notion of optimal parsing. We prove that, somewhat surprisingly, the relationship between $b_{2D}$ and $\gamma_{2D}$ is significantly different than in the one-dimensional case. As an application of our results we provide the first analysis of the space usage of the two-dimensional block tree introduced in [Brisaboa et al., Two-dimensional block trees, The computer Journal, 2023]. Our analysis shows that the space usage can be bounded in terms of both $\gamma_{2D}$ and $\delta_{2D}$ providing a theoretical justification for the use of this data structure. Finally, using insights from our analysis, we design the first linear time and space algorithm for constructing the two-dimensional block tree for arbitrary matrices. Our algorithm is asymptotically faster than the best known solution which is probabilistic and only works for binary matrices.</description>

We study the weak Lefschetz property of $A(G)$. We classify some classes of graphs with relatively few edges, including paths and cycles, such that its associated artinian ring has the weak Lefschetz property.</description>

Abstract: We propose a generalization of Haiman's conjecture on the diagonal coinvariant rings of real reflection groups to the context of irreducible quaternionic reflection groups (also known as symplectic reflection groups). For a reflection group $W$ acting on a quaternionic vector space $V$, by regarding $V$ as a complex vector space we consider the scheme-theoretic fiber over zero of the quotient map $\pi:V \to V/W$. For $W$ an irreducible reflection group of (quaternionic) rank at least $6$, we show that the ring of functions on this fiber admits a $(g+1)^n$-dimensional quotient arising from an irreducible representation of a symplectic reflection algebra, where $g=2N/n$ with $N$ the number of reflections in $W$ and $n=\mathrm{dim}_\mathbf{H}(V)$, and we conjecture that this holds in general. We observe that in fact the degree of the zero fiber is precisely $g+1$ for the rank one groups (corresponding to the Kleinian singularities). In an appendix, we give a proof that three variants of the Coxeter number, including $g$, are integers.</description>
