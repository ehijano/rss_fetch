      <title>Linear and smooth oriented equivalence of orthogonal representations of finite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $n\le 5$ be an integer, and let $\Gamma$ be a finite group. We prove that if $\rho , \rho': \Gamma \to O(n)$ are two representations that are conjugate by an orientation-preserving diffeomorphism, then they are conjugate by an element of $SO(n)$. In the process, we prove that if $G \subset O(4)$ is a finite group, then exactly one of the following is true: the elements of $G$ have a common invariant $1$-dimensional subspace in $\mathbb{R}^4$; some element of $G$ has no invariant $1$-dimensional subspace; or $G$ is conjugate to a specific group $K \subset O(4)$ of order $16$.</description>

      <title>Groups with infinite linearly ordered products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a formalism for considering infinite, linearly ordered products in groups. Using this, we define infinite compositions in certain groups of formal power series and show that such series can sometimes be represented as infinite, linearly ordered, semidirect products of ordered Abelian groups.</description>

      <title>Free submonoids of hyperbolic monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that infinite cancellative finitely generated hyperbolic monoids never contain $\mathbb N\times\mathbb N$ as a submonoid but that they contain an element of infinite order and, if they are elementary, then they also contain a free monoid of rank at least 2. As a corollary we obtain that the latter have exponential growth. We prove these results by analysing the monoid of self-embeddings of hyperbolic digraphs and proving fixed-point theorems for them.</description>

      <title>Spherical $p$-group complexes arising from finite groups of Lie type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the $p$-group complex of a finite group $G$ is homotopy equivalent to a wedge of spheres of dimension at most $n$ if $G$ contains a self-centralising normal subgroup $H$ which is isomorphic to a group of Lie type and Lie rank $n$ in characteristic $p$. If in addition every order-$p$ element of $G$ induces an inner or field automorphism on $H$, the $p$-group complex of $G$ is $G$-homotopy equivalent to a spherical complex obtained from the Tits building of $H$.
  We also prove that the reduced Euler characteristic of the $p$-group complex of a finite group $G$ is non-zero if $G$ has trivial $p$-core and $H$ is a self-centralising normal subgroup of $G$ which is a group of Lie type (in any characteristic), except possibly when $p=2$ and $H=A_n(4^a)$ ($n\geq 2$) or $E_6(4^a)$. In particular, we conclude that the Euler characteristic of the $p$-group complex of an almost simple group does not vanish for $p\geq 7$.</description>

      <title>Test for amenability for extensions of infinite residually finite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a countable group that admits a minimal equicontinuous action on the Cantor set (for example, a residually finite group). We show that the family of almost automorphic actions of $G$ on the Cantor set, is a test for amenability for $G$. More precisely, we show that if $G$ is non-amenable, then for every minimal equicontinuous system $(Y, G)$, such that $Y$ is a Cantor set, there exists a Toeplitz subshift with no invariant probability measures, whose maximal equicontinuous factor is $(Y,G)$. Consequently, we obtain that $G$ is amenable if and only if every Toeplitz $G$-subshift has at least one invariant probability measure.</description>

      <title>A symplectic Hilbert-Smith conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove new cases of the Hilbert-Smith conjecture for actions by natural homeomorphisms in symplectic topology. Specifically, we prove that the group of $p$-adic integers $\mathbb Z_p$ does not admit non-trivial continuous actions by Hamiltonian homeomorphisms, the $C^0$ limits of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms, on symplectically aspherical symplectic manifolds. For a class of symplectic manifolds, including all standard symplectic tori, we deduce that a locally compact group acting faithfully by homeomorphisms in the $C^0$ closure of time-one maps of symplectic isotopies must be a Lie group. Our methods of proof differ from prior approaches to the question and involve barcodes and power operations in Floer cohomology. They also apply to other natural metrics in symplectic topology, notably Hofer's metric. An appendix by Leonid Polterovich uses this to deduce obstructions on Hamiltonian actions by semi-simple $p$-adic analytic groups.</description>

      <title>Homogeneous quandles with commutative inner automorphism groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we give a characterization for homogeneous quandles with commutative inner automorphism groups. In particular, it is shown that such a quandle is expressed as an abelian extension of a trivial quandle. Our construction is a generalization of the recent work by Furuki and Tamaru, which gives the construction of disconnected flat quandles.</description>

      <title>Artin-Schreier quandles of involutions in absolute Galois groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new invariant of fields that refines their real spectrum and is related to their absolute Galois group: the Artin-Schreier quandle. For formally real number fields, it is freely generated in its variety by a Cantor space of indeterminates. For Laurent series fields, we compute it in terms of the Artin-Schreier quandle of the coefficient field. This result and other examples show that, in general, there are relations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Cremona groups are the groups of all birational equivalences of projective spaces and, equivalently, the automorphism groups of the rational function fields. We construct highly connected spaces on which these groups act in a way that allows us to deduce that their abelianisations, and more generally, the homologies of these groups, stabilise as the dimension increases.</description>

      <title>The power operation in the Galois cohomology of a reductive group over a number field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a connected reductive group $G$ over a local or global field $K$, we define a *diamond* (or *power*) operation $$(\xi, n)\mapsto \xi^{\Diamond n}\, \colon\ H^1(K,G)\times {\mathbb Z}\to H^1(K,G)$$ of raising to power $n$ in the Galois cohomology pointed set (this operation is new when $K$ is a number field). We show that this operation has many functorial properties. When $G$ is a torus, the ponted set $H^1(K,G)$ has a natural group structure, and our new operation coincides with the usual power operation $(\xi,n)\mapsto \xi^n$.
  For a cohomology class $\xi$ in $H^1(K,G)$, we define the period ${\rm per}(\xi)$ to be the greatest common divisor of $n\ge 1$ such that $\xi^{\Diamond n}=1$, and the index ${\rm ind}(\xi)$ to be the greatest common divisor of the degrees $[L:K]$ of finite separable extensions $L/K$ splitting $\xi$. We show that ${\rm per}(\xi)$ divides ${\rm ind}(\xi)$, but they need not be equal. However, ${\rm per}(\xi)$ and ${\rm ind}(\xi)$ have the same set of prime factors.</description>

      <title>Towards a Stallings-type theorem for finite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent development in graph theory is to study local separators, vertex sets that need not separate graphs globally but just locally. We use this idea to conjecture an extension of Stallings' theorem to finite nilpotent groups. We provide an example demonstrating that the assumption of nilpotency is necessary, and prove a stronger form of this conjecture for low connectivities, as follows.
  A finite nilpotent group that has a Cayley graph with a local separator of size at most two is cyclic, dihedral or a direct product of a cyclic group with the group of order two.</description>

      <title>Groups, conjugation and powers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.08998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of the power quandle of a group, an algebraic structure that forgets the multiplication but keeps the conjugation and the power maps. Compared with plain quandles, power quandles are much better invariants of groups. We show that they determine the central quotient of any group and the center of any finite group. Any group can be canonically approximated by the associated group of its power quandle, which we show to be a central extension, with a universal property, and a computable kernel. This allows us to present any group as a quotient of a group with a power-conjugation presentation by an abelian subgroup that is determined by the power quandle and low-dimensional homological invariants.</description>

      <title>Minimal doubling for small subsets in compact Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14062v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a sharp bound for the minimal doubling of a small measurable subset of a compact connected Lie group. Namely, let $G$ be a compact connected Lie group of dimension $d_G$, we show that for for all measurable subsets $A$, we have
$$\mu_G(A^2) \geq \left(2^{d_G-d_H} - C\mu_G(A)^{\frac{2}{d_G-d_H}}\right)\mu_G(A)$$
where $d_H$ is the maximal dimension of a proper closed subgroup $H$ and $C &gt; 0$ is a dimensional constant. This settles a conjecture of Breuillard and Green, and recovers and improves - with completely different methods - a recent result of Jing--Tran--Zhang corresponding to the case $G=SO_3(\mathbb{R})$. As is often the case, the above doubling inequality stems from a special case of general product-set estimates. We prove that for all $\epsilon &gt;0$ and for any pair of sufficiently small measurable subsets $A,B$ a Brunn--Minkowski-type inequality holds:
  $$ \mu_G(AB)^{\frac{1}{d_G-d_H}} \geq (1-\epsilon)\left( \mu_G(A)^{\frac{1}{d_G-d_H}} + \mu_G(B)^{\frac{1}{d_G-d_H}}\right).$$
  Going beyond the scope of the Breuillard--Green conjecture, we prove a stability result asserting that the only subsets with close to minimal doubling are essentially neighbourhoods of proper subgroups i.e. of the form
$$H_{\delta}:=\{g \in G: d(g,H)&lt;\delta\}$$
where $H$ denotes a proper closed subgroup of maximal dimension, $d$ denotes a bi-invariant distance on $G$ and $\delta &gt;0$.
  Our approach relies on a combination of two toolsets: optimal transports and its recent applications to the Brunn--Minkowski inequality, and the structure theory of compact approximate subgroups.</description>

      <title>On the Descriptive Complexity of Groups without Abelian Normal Subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.13725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the descriptive complexity theory of finite groups by examining the power of the second Ehrenfeucht-Fra\"iss\'e bijective pebble game in Hella's (Ann. Pure Appl. Log., 1989) heirarchy. This is a Spoiler-Duplicator game in which Spoiler can place up to two pebbles each round. While it trivially solves graph isomorphism, it may be nontrivial for finite groups, and other ternary relational structures. We first provide a novel generalization of Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) coloring, which we call 2-ary WL. We then show that the 2-ary WL is equivalent to the second Ehrenfeucht-Fra\"iss\'e bijective pebble game in Hella's heirarchy.
  Our main result is that, in the pebble game characterization, only $O(1)$ pebbles and $O(1)$ rounds are sufficient to identify all groups without Abelian normal subgroups (a class of groups for which isomorphism testing is known to be in $\mathsf{P}$; Babai, Codenotti, &amp; Qiao, ICALP 2012). In particular, we show that within the first few rounds, Spoiler can force Duplicator to select an isomorphism between two such groups at each subsequent round. By Hella's results (\emph{ibid.}), this is equivalent to saying that these groups are identified by formulas in first-order logic with generalized 2-ary quantifiers, using only $O(1)$ variables and $O(1)$ quantifier depth.</description>

      <title>The Word Problem for Finitary Automaton Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.10670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A finitary automaton group is a group generated by an invertible, deterministic finite-state letter-to-letter transducer whose only cycles are self-loops at an identity state. We show that, for this presentation of finite groups, the uniform word problem is coNP-complete. Here, the input consists of a finitary automaton together with a finite state sequence and the question is whether the sequence acts trivially on all input words. Additionally, we also show that the respective compressed word problem, where the state sequence is given as a straight-line program, is PSpace-complete. In both cases, we give a direct reduction from the satisfiability problem for (quantified) boolean formulae and we further show that the problems remain complete for their respective classes if we restrict the input alphabet of the automata to a binary one.</description>

      <title>On the geometry of the free factor graph for ${\rm{Aut}}(F_N)$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03535v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Phi$ be a pseudo-Anosov diffeomorphism of a compact (possibly non-orientable) surface $\Sigma$ with one boundary component. We show that if $b \in \pi_1(\Sigma)$ is the boundary word, $\phi \in {\rm{Aut}}(\pi_1(\Sigma))$ is a representative of $\Phi$ fixing $b$, and ${\rm{ad}}_b$ denotes conjugation by $b$, then the orbits of $\langle \phi, {\rm{ad}}_b \rangle\cong\mathbb{Z}^2$ in the graph of free factors of $\pi_1(\Sigma)$ are quasi-isometrically embedded. It follows that for $N \geq 2$ the free factor graph for ${\rm{Aut}}(F_N)$ is not hyperbolic, in contrast to the ${\rm{Out}}(F_N)$ case.</description>
