      <title>New insights into the solutions of a class of anisotropic nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equations on the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the following anisotropic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on the plane,
  \[ \begin{cases}
  {\rm i}\partial_t \Phi+\partial_{xx} \Phi -D_y^{2s} \Phi +|\Phi|^{p-2}\Phi=0,&amp;\quad (t,x,y)\in\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}^2,
  \Phi(x,y,0)=\Phi_0(x,y),&amp;\quad (x,y)\in\mathbb{R}^2,
  \end{cases}
  \]
  where $D_y^{2s}=\left(-\partial_{yy}\right)^s$ denotes the fractional Laplacian with $0&lt;s&lt;1$ and $2&lt;p&lt;\frac{2(1+s)}{1-s}$. We first study the existence of normalized solutions to this equation in the subcritical, critical, and supercritical cases. To this aim, regularity results and a Pohozaev type identity are necessary. Then, we determine the conditions under which the solutions blow up. Furthermore, we demonstrate the existence of boosted traveling waves when $s\geq1/2$ and their decay at infinity. Additionally, for the delicate case $s=1/2$, we provide a non-existence result of boosted traveling waves and we establish that there is no scattering for small data. Finally, we also study normalized boosted travelling waves in the mass subcritical case. Due to the nature of the equation, we do not impose any radial symmetry on the initial data or on the solutions.</description>

      <title>Normal traces and applications to continuity equations on bounded domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study several properties of the normal Lebesgue trace of vector fields introduced by the second and third author in [18] in the context of the energy conservation for the Euler equations in Onsager-critical classes. Among several properties, we prove that the normal Lebesgue trace satisfies the Gauss-Green identity and, by providing explicit counterexamples, that it is a notion sitting strictly between the distributional one for measure-divergence vector fields and the strong one for $BV$ functions. These results are then applied to the study of the uniqueness of weak solutions for continuity equations on bounded domains, allowing to remove the assumption in [15] of global $BV$ regularity up to the boundary, at least around the portion of the boundary where the characteristics exit the domain or are tangent. The proof relies on an explicit renormalization formula completely characterized by the boundary datum and the positive part of the normal Lebesgue trace. In the case when the characteristics enter the domain, a counterexample shows that achieving the normal trace in the Lebesgue sense is not enough to prevent non-uniqueness, and thus a $BV$ assumption seems to be necessary for the uniqueness of weak solutions.</description>

      <title>Riemann problem for a nonsymmetric Keyfitz-Kranzer and pressureless gas systems with a time-dependent Coulomb-like friction term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Riemann solutions for two systems: the nonsymmetric Keyfitz-Kranzer system and the pressureless system, both of which have a time-dependent Coulomb-like friction term. Our analysis identified two types of Riemann solutions: contact discontinuities and delta-shock solutions. We obtain generalized Rankine-Hugoniot conditions, which is the support for constructing the delta-shock solution for the nonsymmetric Keyfitz-Kranzer system with a time-dependent Coulomb-like friction term. Furthermore, we demonstrate that as the pressure tends to zero, the Riemann solutions of the nonsymmetric Keyfitz-Kranzer system converge to those of the pressureless system, with both systems incorporating a time-dependent Coulomb-like friction term.</description>

      <title>Polynomial convergence rate for quasiperiodic homogenization of Hamilton-Jacobi equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate a polynomial convergence rate for quasi-periodic homogenization of Hamilton--Jacobi equations in one-dimensional with $n$-frequency potentials. The proof relies on a connection between optimal control theory, regularity of the effective Hamiltonian, and new quantitative ergodic estimates based on Diophantine approximations.</description>

      <title>Liouville-type theorem for steady helically symmetric MHD system in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that any bounded smooth helically symmetric solution $(\Bu, \Bh)$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ must be constant vectors. This is an extension of previous result \cite[Theorem 1.1]{HWXAHE} from Navier-Stokes system to MHD system. The proof relies on establishing a Saint-Venant type estimate to characterize the growth of Dirichlet integral of nontrivial solutions.</description>

      <title>On the restriction of various Laplace operators on submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When considering Navier-Stokes equations on Riemannian manifolds one frequently encounters situations where the manifold is embedded in the ambient Euclidean space. In this context it is interesting to investigate what is the precise relationship of the diffusion operator in the ambient space to the diffusion operator on the manifold. The present paper gives a precise characterization of this situation for general surfaces in three dimensional space.</description>

      <title>The Landis conjecture via Liouville comparison principle and criticality theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give partial affirmative answers to Landis conjecture in all dimensions for two different types of linear, second order, elliptic operators in a domain $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^N$. In particular, we provide a sharp decay criterion that ensures when a solution of a nonnegative Schr\"odinger equation in $\mathbb{R}^N$ with a potential $V\leq 1$ is trivial. Moreover, we address the analogue of Landis conjecture for quasilinear problems. Our approach relies on the application of Liouville comparison principles and criticality theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our aim is to do a come back on Schiffer's and Pompeiu's conjectures with shape optimization tools, maximum principles and Serrin's symmetry method. We propose a way to get affirmative answers in some cases. We propose also sufficient conditions thanks to Riemannian approach of infinite dimension that could be useful for numerical simulations of the shape of domains related to these conjectures.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Coarsening Dynamics for the Cahn--Hilliard and Burgers--Cahn--Hilliard Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider coarsening dynamics associated with a Burgers--Cahn--Hilliard system modeling a two-phase flow in one space dimension. Our emphasis is on the effect that coupling between the phase and fluid dynamics has on coarsening rates, and on the mechanisms driving this effect. We start with a detailed examination of coarsening dynamics for the uncoupled Cahn--Hilliard equation, comparing numerically generated rates with two analytic methods, and then we consider how these dynamics are affected by appropriate coupling with a viscous Burgers equation. In order to keep the analysis as self-contained as possible, we establish the global well-posedness of the system under consideration.</description>

      <title>Interior Harnack inequality and H\"older estimates for linearized Monge-Amp\`ere equations in divergence form with drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study interior estimates for solutions to linearized Monge-Amp\`ere equations in divergence form with drift terms and the right-hand side containing the divergence of a bounded vector field. Equations of this type appear in the study of semigeostrophic equations in meteorology and the solvability of singular Abreu equations in the calculus of variations with a convexity constraint. We prove an interior Harnack inequality and H\"older estimates for solutions to equations of this type in two dimensions, and under an integrability assumption on the Hessian matrix of the Monge-Amp\`ere potential in higher dimensions. Our results extend those of Le (Analysis of Monge-Amp\`ere equations, Graduate Studies in Mathematics, vol.240, American Mathematical Society, 2024) to equations with drift terms.</description>

      <title>Wolff potentials and nonlocal equations of Lane-Emden type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider nonlocal equations of the type \[ (-\Delta_{p})^{s}u = \mu \quad \text{in }\Omega, \] where $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^{n}$ is either a bounded domain or the whole $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, $\mu$ is a Radon measure on $\Omega$, $0&lt;s&lt;1$ and $1&lt;p&lt;n/s$. Especially, we extend the existence, regularity and Wolff potential estimates for SOLA (Solutions Obtained as Limits of Approximations), established by Kuusi, Mingione, and Sire (Comm. Math. Phys. 337:1317--1368, 2015), to the strongly singular case $1&lt;p\le2-s/n$. Moreover, using Wolff potentials and Orlicz capacities, we present both a sufficient and a necessary conditions for the existence of SOLA to nonlocal equations of the type \[ (-\Delta_{p})^{s}u = P(u) + \mu \quad \text{in }\Omega, \] where $P(\cdot)$ is either a power function or an exponential function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assuming the nonlinear Fermi Golden Rule (FGR) and no resonance at the threshold of the continuous spectrum of the linearization and assuming furthermore as hypotheses the results proved numerically by Chang et al. \cite{Chang} for the exponent $p\in (3,5)$, we prove that the ground states of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLS) with pure power nonlinearity of exponent $p$ in the line are asymptotically stable for a certain set of values of the exponent $p$ where the FGR occurs by means of a discrete mode 3rd or 4th order power interaction with the continuous mode. The argument is similar to our recent result valid for $p$ near 3 contained in \cite{CM24D1}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a Lions-type concentration-compactness principle and its variant at infinity for Musielak-Orlicz-Sobolev spaces associated with a double phase operator with variable exponents. Based on these principles, we demonstrate the existence and concentration of solutions for a class of critical double phase equations of Schr\"odinger type in $\mathbb{R}^N$ involving variable exponents with various types of potentials. Our growth condition is more appropriately suited compared to the existing works.</description>

      <title>Enhanced dissipation and stability of Poiseuille flow for two-dimensional Boussinesq system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the nonlinear stability problem for the two-dimensional Boussinesq system around the Poiseuille flow in a finite channel. The system has the characteristic of Navier-slip boundary condition for the velocity and Dirichlet boundary condition for the temperature, with a small viscosity $\nu$ and small thermal diffusion $\mu,$ respectively. More precisely, we prove that if the initial velocity and initial temperature satisfies$$||u_{0}-(1-y^2,0) ||_{H^{\frac{7}{2}+}}\leq c_0\min\left\lbrace \mu,\nu\right\rbrace ^{\frac{2}{3}}$$ and $$ ||\theta_{0}||_{H^1}+|||D_x|^{\frac{1}{8}}\theta_{0}||_{H^1}\leq c_1\min\left\lbrace \mu,\nu\right\rbrace ^{{\frac{31}{24}}}$$ for some small constants $c_0$ and $c_1$ which are both independent of $\mu,\nu$, then we can reach the conclusion that the velocity remains within $O\left( \min\left\lbrace \mu,\nu\right\rbrace ^{\frac{2}{3}}\right) $ of the Poiseuille flow; the temperature remains $O\left( \min\left\lbrace \mu,\nu\right\rbrace ^{\frac{31}{24}}\right) $ of the constant 0, and approaches to 0 as $t\rightarrow\infty.$</description>

      <title>Qualitative properties of solutions to nonlocal infectious SIR epidemic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies qualitative properties of solutions of nonlocal infectious SIR epidemic models (1.3)-(1.5), with the homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions, Dirichlet boundary conditions and free boundary, respectively. We first use the upper and lower solutions method and the Lyapunov function method to prove the global asymptotically stabilities of the disease-free equilibrium and the unique positive equilibrium of (1.3). Then we use the theory of topological degree in cones to study the positive equilibrium solutions of (1.4), including the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence, and the uniqueness in some special case. At last, for the free boundary problem (1.5), we study the longtime behaviors of solutions and criteria for spreading and vanishing. The highlights are to overcome failures of the Lyapunov functional method and comparison principle, and difficulties in the maximum principle and Hopf boundary lemma of boundary value problems caused by nonlocal terms.</description>

      <title>A study of the reconnection of antiparallel vortices in the infinitely thin case and in the finite thickness case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simplest case is the reconnection of a pair of antiparallel line vortices, e.g., condensation trails of an aircraft. The vortices first undergo long wave deformation (Crow waves), and then reconnect to form coherent structures. Although the behavior of the vortices before and after the reconnection can be clearly observed, what happens during the reconnection still needs to be explained. One of the challenges is related to the fact that the vortices have finite thickness, and therefore, the time and the point of the reconnection cannot be determined. Moreover, the smallest scale of coherent structures that can be observed also depends on the vortex thickness. In this paper, we consider an infinitely thin vortex approximation to study the reconnection process. We show that, in this case, the behavior after the reconnection is quasi-periodic, with the quasi-period being independent of the angle between the vortices at the time of the reconnection. We also show that, in the Fourier transform of the trajectory of the reconnection point, the frequencies that correspond to squares of integers are dominating in a similar way as in the evolution of a polygonal vortex under the localized induction approximation. At the end, we compare the results with a solution of the Navier-Stokes equations for the reconnection of a pair of antiparallel vortices with finite thickness. We use the fluid impulse to determine the reconnection time, the reconnection point, and the quasi-period for this case.</description>

      <title>Global-in-time well-posedness of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations with striated density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We first show local-in-time well-posedness of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations, assuming striated regularity while no other smoothness or smallness conditions on the initial density. With these local-in-time solutions served as blocks, for \textit{less} regular initial data where the vacuum is permitted, the global-in-time well-posedness follows from the energy estimates and the propagated striated regularity of the density function, if the bulk viscosity coefficient is large enough in the two dimensional case. The global-in-time well-posedness holds also true in the three dimensional case, provided with large bulk viscosity coefficient together with small initial energy. This solves the density-patch problem in the exterior domain for the compressible model with $W^{2,p}$-Interfaces. Finally, the singular incompressible limit toward the inhomogenous incompressible model when the bulk viscosity coefficient tends to infinity is obtained.</description>

      <title>An effective advection induced by oscillating microstructure in a diffusion equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the homogenisation of a diffusion equation in a porous medium. The microstructure is time-dependent and oscillating on a small time scale. This oscillation causes a novel advection in the homogenised equations. Allowing for a locally varying geometry, the oscillating microstructure demonstrates the ability to generate arbitrary and locally varying advection velocity fields.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional signal-dependent parabolic-elliptic Keller-Segel system and its means field derivation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the well-posedness of two-dimensional signal-dependent Keller-Segel system and its mean field derivation from a interacting particle system on the whole space are investigated. The signal dependence effect is reflected by the fact that the diffusion coefficient in the particle system depends nonlinearly on the interactions between the individuals. Therefore, the mathematical challenge in studying the well-posedness of this system lies in the possible degeneracy and the aggregation effect when the concentration of signal becomes unbounded. The well-established method on bounded domain, to obtain the appropriate estimates for the signal concentration, is invalid for the whole space case. Motivated by the entropy minimization method and Onofri's inequality, which has been successfully applied for parabolic-parabolic Keller-Segel system, we establish a complete entropy estimate benefited from linear diffusion term, which plays important role in obtaining the Lp estimates for the solution. Furthermore, the upper bound for the concentration of signal is obtained. Based on estimates we obtained for the density of cells, the rigorous mean-field derivation is proved by introducing an intermediate particle system with a mollified interaction potential with logarithmic scaling. By using this mollification, we obtain the convergence of the particle trajectories in expectation, which implies the weak propagation of chaos. Additionally, under a regularity assumption of the cell-density, we derive the strong L1 convergence for the propagation of chaos by using relative entropy method.</description>

      <title>A Faber-Krahn inequality for the Laplacian with drift under Robin boundary condition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a Faber-Krahn inequality for the Laplacian with drift under Robin boundary condition, provided that the $\beta$ parameter in the Robin condition is large enough. The proof relies on a compactness argument, on the convergence of Robin eigenvalues to Dirichlet eigenvalues when $\beta$ goes to infinity, and on a strict Faber-Krahn inequality under Dirichlet boundary condition. We also show the existence and uniqueness of drifts $v$ satisfying some $L^\infty$ constraints and minimizing or maximizing the principal eigenvalue of $-\Delta+v\cdot\nabla$ in a fixed domain and with a fixed parameter $\beta&gt;0$ in the Robin condition.</description>

      <title>Sobolev regularity of the inverse for minimizers of the neo-Hookean energy satisfying condition INV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the existence and regularity of minimizers of the neo-Hookean energy in the closure of classes of deformations without cavitation. The exclusion of cavitation is imposed in the form of the divergence identities, which is equivalent to the well-known condition INV with $\text{Det} = \det$. We show that the neo-Hookean energy admits minimizers in classes of maps that are one-to-one a.e. with positive Jacobians, provided that these maps are the weak limits of sequences of maps that satisfy the divergence identities. In particular, these classes include the weak closure of diffeomorphisms and the weak closure of homeomorphisms satisfying Lusin's N condition. Moreover, if the minimizers satisfy condition INV, then their inverses have Sobolev regularity. This extends a recent result by Dole\v{z}alov\'{a}, Hencl, and Molchanova by showing that the minimizers they obtained enjoy extra regularity properties, and that the existence of minimizers can still be obtained even when their coercivity assumption is relaxed.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Stability of the two-dimensional Couette flow for the Stokes-transport equation in a finite channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Stokes-transport system in a two-dimensional channel with horizontally moving boundaries, which serves as a reduced model for oceanography and sedimentation. The density is transported by the velocity field, satisfying the momentum balance between viscosity, pressure, and gravity effects, described by the Stokes equation at any given time. Due to the presence of moving boundaries, stratified densities with the Couette flow constitute one class of steady states. In this paper, we investigate the asymptotic stability of these steady states. We prove that if the stratified density is close to a constant density and the perturbation belongs to the Gevrey-3 class with compact support away from the boundary, then the velocity will converge to the Couette flow as time approaches infinity. More precisely, we prove that the horizontal perturbed velocity decays as $\frac{1}{\langle t\rangle^3}$ and the vertical perturbed velocity decays as $\frac{1}{\langle t\rangle^4}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the asymptotic stability of the three-dimensional Couette flow in a stratified fluid governed by the Stokes-transport equation. We observe that a similar lift-up effect to the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equation near Couette flow destabilizes the system. We find that the inviscid damping type decay due to the Couette flow together with the damping structure caused by the decreasing background density stabilizes the system. More precisely, we prove that if the initial density is close to a linearly decreasing function in the Gevrey-$\frac{1}{s}$ class with $\frac{1}{2}&lt; s\leq 1$, namely, $\|\varrho_{\mathrm{in}}(X,Y,Z)-(-Y)\|_{\mathcal{G}^{s}}\leq \epsilon$, then the perturbed density remains close to $-Y$. Moreover, the associated velocity field converges to Couette flow $(Y, 0, 0)^{\top}$ with a convergence rate of $\frac{1}{\langle t\rangle^3}$.</description>

      <title>Blow-up solutions of the "bad" Boussinesq equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study blow-up solutions of the ``bad" Boussinesq equation, and prove that a wide range of asymptotic scenarios can happen. For example, for each $T&gt;0$, $x_{0}\in \mathbb{R}$ and $\delta \in (0,1)$, we prove that there exist Schwartz class solutions $u(x,t)$ on $\mathbb{R} \times [0,T)$ such that $|u(x,t)| \leq C \frac{1+x^{2}}{(x-x_{0})^{2}}$ and $u(x_{0},t)\asymp (T-t)^{-\delta}$ as $t\to T$.
  We also prove that for any $q\in \mathbb{N}$, $T&gt;0$, $x_{0}\in \mathbb{R}$, $\delta \in (0,\frac{1}{2})$, there exist Schwartz class solutions $u(x,t)$ on $\mathbb{R} \times [0,T)$ such that (i) $|\partial_{x}^{q_{1}}\partial_{t}^{q_{2}}u(x,t)|\leq C$ for each $q_{1},q_{2}\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $q_{1}+2q_{2}\leq q$, (ii) $|\partial_{x}^{q_{1}}\partial_{t}^{q_{2}}u(x,t)| \leq C \frac{1+|x|}{|x-x_{0}|}$ for each $q_{1},q_{2}\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $q_{1}+2q_{2}= q+1$, (iii) $|\partial_{x}^{q_{1}}\partial_{t}^{q_{2}}u(x_{0},t)| \asymp (T-t)^{-\delta}$ as $t\to T$ for each $q_{1},q_{2}\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $q_{1}+2q_{2}= q+1$.
  In particular, when $q=0$, this result establishes the existence of wave-breaking solutions, i.e. solutions that remain bounded but whose $x$-derivative blows up in finite time.</description>

      <title>Beyond Linear Decomposition: a Nonlinear Eigenspace Decomposition for a Moist Atmosphere with Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A linear decomposition of states underpins many classical systems. This is the case of the Helmholtz decomposition, used to split vector fields into divergence-free and potential components, and of the dry Boussinesq system in atmospheric dynamics, where identifying the slow and fast components of the flow can be viewed as a decomposition. The dry Boussinesq system incorporates two leading ingredients of mid-latitude atmospheric motion: rotation and stratification. In both cases the leading order dynamics are linear so we can rely on an eigendecomposition to decompose states.
  Here we study the extension of dry Boussinesq to incorporate another important ingredient in the atmosphere: moisture and clouds. The key challenge with this system is that nonlinearities are present at leading order due to phase boundaries at cloud edge. Therefore standard tools of linear algebra, relying on eigenvalues and eigenvectors, are not applicable. The question we address in this paper is this: in spite of the nonlinearities, can we find a decomposition for this moist Boussinesq system?
  We identify such a decomposition adapted to the nonlinear balances arising from water phase boundaries. This decomposition combines perspectives from partial differential equations (PDEs), the geometry, and the conserved energy. Moreover it sheds light on two aspects of previous work. First, this decomposition shows that the nonlinear elliptic PDE used for potential vorticity and moisture inversion can be used outside the limiting system where it was first derived. Second, we are able to rigorously justify, and interpret geometrically, an existing numerical method for this elliptic PDE. This decomposition may be important in applications because, like its linear counterparts, it may be used to analyze observational data. Moreover, by contrast with previous decompositions, it may be used even in the presence of clouds.</description>

      <title>Boundary homogenization for partially reactive patches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A wide variety of physical, chemical, and biological processes involve diffusive particles interacting with surfaces containing reactive patches. The theory of boundary homogenization seeks to encapsulate the effective reactivity of such a patchy surface by a single trapping rate parameter. In this paper, we derive the trapping rate for partially reactive patches occupying a small fraction of a surface. We use matched asymptotic analysis, double perturbation expansions, and homogenization theory to derive formulas for the trapping rate in terms of the far-field behavior of solutions to certain partial differential equations (PDEs). We then develop kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) algorithms to rapidly compute these far-field behaviors. These KMC algorithms depend on probabilistic representations of PDE solutions, including using the theory of Brownian local time. We confirm our results by comparing to KMC simulations of the full stochastic system. We further compare our results to prior heuristic approximations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce explicit formulae for the coproducts at play for multi-indices in ODEs and in singular SPDEs. The two coproducts described correspond to versions of the Butcher-Connes-Kreimer and extraction/contraction coproducts with multi-indices. The main idea is to use the fact that these coproducts are the adjoints of dual products for which one has explicit simple formulae. We are able to derive the explicit formulae via an inner product defined from a symmetry factor easily computable for multi-indices.</description>

      <title>Error Analysis of Three-Layer Neural Network Trained with PGD for Deep Ritz Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning is a rapidly advancing field with diverse applications across various domains. One prominent area of research is the utilization of deep learning techniques for solving partial differential equations(PDEs). In this work, we specifically focus on employing a three-layer tanh neural network within the framework of the deep Ritz method(DRM) to solve second-order elliptic equations with three different types of boundary conditions. We perform projected gradient descent(PDG) to train the three-layer network and we establish its global convergence. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to provide a comprehensive error analysis of using overparameterized networks to solve PDE problems, as our analysis simultaneously includes estimates for approximation error, generalization error, and optimization error. We present error bound in terms of the sample size $n$ and our work provides guidance on how to set the network depth, width, step size, and number of iterations for the projected gradient descent algorithm. Importantly, our assumptions in this work are classical and we do not require any additional assumptions on the solution of the equation. This ensures the broad applicability and generality of our results.</description>

Abstract: We study a stochastic scheduling on an unreliable machine with general up-times and general set-up times which is described by a group of partial differential equations with Dirac-delta functions in the boundary and initial conditions. In special case that the random processing rate of job $i,$ the random up-time rate of job $i$ and the random repair rate of job $i$ are constants, we determine the explicit expression of its time-dependent solution and give the asymptotic behavior of its time-dependent solution. Our result implies that $C_0-$semigroup theory is not suitable for this model. In general case, we determine the Laplace transform of its time-dependent solution. Next, we convert the model into an abstract Cauchy problem whose underlying operator is an evolution family. Finally, we leave some open problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spectral theory for operator pencils and operator differential-algebraic equations is studied. Special focus is laid on singular operator pencils and three different concepts of singular operator pencils are introduced. The concepts are analyzed in detail and examples are presented that illustrate the subtle differences. It is investigated how these concepts are related to uniqueness of the underlying algebraic-differential operator equation, showing that, in general, classical results known from the finite dimensional case of matrix pencils and differential-algebraic equations do not prevail. The results are then studied in the setting of structured operator pencils arising in dissipative differential-algebraic equations. Here, unlike in the general infinite-dimensional case, the uniqueness of solutions is closely related to the singularity of the pencil.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that random walks on a family of tilings of d-dimensional Euclidean space, with a canonical choice of conductances, converge to Brownian motion modulo time parameterization. This class of tilings includes Delaunay triangulations (the dual of Voronoi tesselations) and sphere packings. Our regularity assumptions are deterministic and mild. For example, our results apply to Delaunay triangulations with vertices sampled from a d-dimensional Gaussian multiplicative chaos measure. As part of our proof, we establish the uniform convergence of certain finite volume schemes for the Laplace equation, with quantitative bounds on the rate of convergence. In the special case of two dimensions, we give a new, short proof of the main result of Gurel-Gurevich--Jerison--Nachmias (2020).</description>

Abstract: Building on results developed in https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.14902, where It\^{o}-SDEs with possibly degenerate and discontinuous dispersion coefficient and measurable drift were analyzed with respect to a given (sub-)invariant measure, we develop here additional elliptic regularity results for PDEs and consider the same equations with some further regularity assumptions on the coefficients to provide a pointwise analysis for every starting point in Euclidean space, $d\ge 2$. Our main result is (weak) well-posedness, i.e. weak existence and uniqueness in law, which we obtain under our main assumption for any locally bounded drift and arbitrary starting point among all solutions that spend zero time at the points of degeneracy of the dispersion coefficient. The points of degeneracy form a $d$-dimensional Lebesgue measure zero set, but may be hit by the weak solutions. Weak existence for arbitrary starting point is obtained under broader assumptions. In particular, in that case the drift does not need to be locally bounded.</description>

      <title>Inequalities between Dirichlet and Neumann eigenvalues of the magnetic Laplacian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the magnetic Laplacian with the homogeneous magnetic field in two and three dimensions. We prove that the $(k+1)$-th magnetic Neumann eigenvalue of a bounded convex planar domain is not larger than its $k$-th magnetic Dirichlet eigenvalue. In three dimensions, we restrict our attention to convex domains, which are invariant under rotation by an angle of $\pi$ around an axis parallel to the magnetic field. For such domains, we prove that the $(k+2)$-th magnetic Neumann eigenvalue is not larger than the $k$-th magnetic Dirichlet eigenvalue provided that this Dirichlet eigenvalue is simple. The proofs rely on a modification of the strategy due to Levine and Weinberger.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of unknown nonlinear operators in semilinear elliptic models using optimal inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physical models often contain unknown functions and relations. The goal of our work is to answer the question of how one should excite or control a system under consideration in an appropriate way to be able to reconstruct an unknown nonlinear relation. To answer this question, we propose a greedy reconstruction algorithm within an offline-online strategy. We apply this strategy to a two-dimensional semilinear elliptic model. Our identification is based on the application of several space-dependent excitations (also called controls). These specific controls are designed by the algorithm in order to obtain a deeper insight into the underlying physical problem and a more precise reconstruction of the unknown relation. We perform numerical simulations that demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach which is not limited to the current type of equation. Since our algorithm provides not only a way to determine unknown operators by existing data but also protocols for new experiments, it is a holistic concept to tackle the problem of improving physical models.</description>

      <title>Regularization by rough Kraichnan noise for the generalised SQG equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the generalised Surface Quasi-Geostrophic (gSQG) equations in $\mathbb R^2$ with parameter $\beta\in (0,1)$, an active scalar model interpolating between SQG ($\beta=1$) and the 2D Euler equations ($\beta=0$) in vorticity form. Existence of weak $(L^1\cap L^p)$-valued solutions in the deterministic setting is known, but their uniqueness is open. We show that the addition of a rough Stratonovich transport noise of Kraichnan type regularizes the PDE, providing strong existence and pathwise uniqueness of solutions for initial data $\theta_0\in L^1\cap L^p$, for suitable values $p\in[2,\infty]$ related to the regularity degree $\alpha$ of the noise and the singularity degree $\beta$ of the velocity field; in particular, we can cover any $\beta\in (0,1)$ for suitable $\alpha$ and $p$ and we can reach a suitable ("critical") threshold. The result also holds in the presence of external forcing $f\in L^1_t (L^1\cap L^p)$ and solutions are shown to depend continuously on the data of the problem; furthermore, they are well approximated by vanishing viscosity and regular approximations.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of a viscoelastic resistive force theory and applications to swimming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.14160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a simple model for the evolution of an immersed, inextensible filament which incorporates linear viscoelastic effects of the surrounding fluid. The model is a closed-form system of equations along the curve only which includes a `memory' term due to viscoelasticity. For a planar filament, given a forcing in the form of a preferred curvature, we prove well-posedness of the fiber evolution as well as the existence of a unique time-periodic solution in the case of time-periodic forcing. Moreover, we obtain an expression for the swimming speed of the filament in terms of the preferred curvature. The swimming speed depends in a complicated way on the viscoelastic parameters corresponding to the fluid relaxation time and additional polymeric viscosity. We study this expression in detail, accompanied by numerical simulations, and show that this simple model can capture complex effects of viscoelasticity on swimming. In particular, the viscoelastic swimmer is shown to be faster than its Newtonian counterpart in some situations and slower in others. Strikingly, we even find an example where viscoelastic effects may lead to a reversal in swimming direction from the Newtonian setting, although this occurs when the displacement for both the Newtonian and viscoelastic swimmers is practically negligible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.11706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the generalized Boussinesq equation as a model for the water wave problem with surface tension. Initially, we investigate the initial value problem within Sobolev spaces, deriving conditions under which solutions are either global or experience blow-up in time. Subsequently, we extend our analysis to Bessel potential and modulation spaces, determining the asymptotic behavior of solutions. We establish the non-existence of solitary waves for certain parameters using Pohozaev-type identities. Additionally, we numerically generate solitary wave solutions of the generalized Boussinesq equation through the Petviashvili iteration method. To further examine the time evolution of solutions, we propose employing the Fourier pseudo-spectral numerical method. Our investigation extends to the gap interval, where neither global existence nor blow-up results have been theoretically established. We find that our numerical results effectively fill these gaps, supplementing the theoretical findings.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate some existence results for double phase anisotropic variational problems involving critical growth. We first establish a Lions type concentration-compactness principle and its variant at infinity for the solution space, which are our independent interests. By employing these results, we obtain a nontrivial nonnegative solution to problems of generalized concave-convex type. We also obtain infinitely many solutions when the nonlinear term is symmetric. Our results are new even for the $p(\cdot)$-Laplace equations.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the existence, uniqueness and asymptotic behaviour of almost periodic (AP-) and asymptotically almost periodic (AAP-) mild solutions to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on $d$-dimensional non-compact manifold $(\mathcal{M},g)$ which satisfies negative and bounded conditions on Ricci curvature tensor. We use certain exponential dipsersive estimates of the Stokes semigroup to prove Massera-type principles which guarantees the well-posedness of AP- and AAP- mild solutions for the inhomogeneous Stokes equations. Then, by using fixed point arguments and Gronwall's inequality we establish the well-posedness and exponential decay for global-in-time of such solutions of Navier-Stokes equations. Our results extend the ones for Navier-Stokes equations obtained in \cite{Xuan2022}.</description>

      <title>The concept of mapped coercivity for nonlinear operators in Banach spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.16783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a concise proof of existence for nonlinear operator equations in separable Banach spaces. Notably, the operator is not assumed to be monotone. Instead, our main hypotheses consist of a continuity assumption and a generalized coercivity property. Mapped coercivity is a generalization of the usual coercivity property for nonlinear operators. In the case of linear operators, we recover linear coercivity and the traditional inf-sup condition. To illustrate the applicability of this general concept, we apply it to semi-linear elliptic problems and the Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14933v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate some effects of the lack of compactness in the critical Sobolev embedding by proving that a famous conjecture of Brezis and Peletier \cite{BP89} does still hold in the Heisenberg framework: optimal functions for a natural subcritical approximations of the Sobolev quotient concentrate energy at exactly one point which is a critical point of the Robin function (i. e., the diagonal of the regular part of the Green function associated to the involved domain), in clear accordance with the underlying sub-Riemannian geometry. Consequently, a new suitable definition of domains geometrical regular near their characteristic set is introduced. In order to achieve the aforementioned result, we need to combine proper estimates and tools to attack the related CR Yamabe equation with novel feasible ingredients in PDEs and Calculus of Variations which also aim to constitute general independent results in the Heisenberg framework, as for instance a fine asymptotic control of the optimal functions via the Jerison and Lee extremals realizing the equality in the critical Sobolev inequality \cite{JL88}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite its high significance in nonlinear elasticity, the neo-Hookean energy is still not known to admit minimisers in some appropriate admissible class. Using ideas from relaxation theory, we propose a larger minimisation space and a modified functional that coincides with the neo-Hookean energy on the original space. This modified energy is the sum of the neo-Hookean energy and a term penalising the singularities of the inverse deformation. The new functional attains its minimum in the larger space, so the initial question of existence of minimisers of the neo-Hookean energy is thus transformed into a question of regularity of minimisers of this new energy.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic behavior of minimizers for the singularly perturbed Perona-Malik functional in one dimension. In a previous study, we have shown that blow-ups of these minimizers at a suitable scale converge to staircase-like piecewise constant functions.
  Building upon these findings, we delve into finer scales, revealing that both the vertical and horizontal regions of the staircase steps display cubic polynomial behavior after appropriate rescaling.
  Our analysis hinges on identifying the dominant terms of the functional within each regime, elucidating the mechanisms driving the observed asymptotic behavior.</description>

In other words, we dissuss the equation under different nonlinear terms. Finally, we validate our results with numerical simulations.</description>

Abstract: We show that buoyancy driven flows can be steered in an arbitrary time towards any state by applying as control only an external temperature profile in a subset of small measure. More specifically, we prove that the 2D incompressible Boussinesq system on the torus is globally approximately controllable via physically localized heating or cooling. In addition, our controls have an explicitly prescribed structure; even without such structural requirements, large data controllability results for Boussinesq flows driven merely by a physically localized temperature profile were so far unknown. The presented method exploits various connections between the model's underlying transport-, coupling-, and scaling mechanisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate kinetic energy and streamline properties for an irrotational periodic geophysical traveling surface water waves propagating in equatorial oceanic regions. Relying on the methods from complex analysis, we prove the logarithmic convexity and monotonicity of specific flow variables. By means of conformal mappings, we derive some qualitative results for kinetic energy and streamline, such as streamline time-period being independent of any moment and any point on the streamline in steady flow, the concavity and monotonicity of total kinetic energy within the region between two streamlines and the convexity and monotonicity of total kinetic energy over a streamline time-period. Moreover, we present several results about irrotational equatorial wind waves, such as an upper bound of the minimum of streamline time-period, an upper bound of the maximum of area within the region between two streamlines. Taking advantage of the Bernoulli's law and the Schwarz reflection principle, we show that the extremum of the kinetic energy is attained on the free surface for irrotational equatorial wind waves.</description>

Abstract: We study the geometry and partial differential equations arising from the consideration of group-determinants, and representation theory. The simplest and most striking such example is undoubtedly that of the Humbert operator, associated with the cyclic group Z/3Z. This operator appears as a natural extension of the Laplacian in dimension 2. Another originality of our work is to show that the spectral theory of operators associated with Frobenius determinants is closely linked to finite Fourier transform theory.</description>

Abstract: We study some dyadic models for incompressible magnetohydrodynamics and Navier-Stokes equation. The existence of fixed point and stability of the fixed point are established. The scaling law of Kolmogorov's dissipation wavenumber arises from heuristic analysis. In addition, a time-dependent determining wavenumber is shown to exist; moreover, the time average of the determining wavenumber is proved to be bounded above by Kolmogorov's dissipation wavenumber. Additionally, based on the knowledge of the fixed point and stability of the fixed point, numerical simulations are performed to illustrate the energy spectrum in the inertial range below Kolmogorov's dissipation wavenumber.</description>

      <title>Quasi-conical domains with embedded eigenvalues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.08172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.08172v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spectrum of the Dirichlet Laplacian on any quasi-conical open set coincides with the non-negative semi-axis. We show that there is a connected quasi-conical open set such that the respective Dirichlet Laplacian has a positive (embedded) eigenvalue. This open set is constructed as the tower of cubes of growing size connected by windows of vanishing size. Moreover, we show that the sizes of the windows in this construction can be chosen so that the absolutely continuous spectrum of the Dirichlet Laplacian is empty.</description>

      <title>Classification of bubble-sheet ovals in $\mathbb{R}^{4}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.04931v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that any bubble-sheet oval for the mean curvature flow in $\mathbb{R}^4$, up to scaling and rigid motion, either is the $\textrm{O}(2)\times \textrm{O}(2)$-symmetric ancient oval constructed by Hershkovits and the fourth author, or belongs to the one-parameter family of $\mathbb{Z}_2^2\times \textrm{O}(2)$-symmetric ancient ovals constructed by the third and fourth author. In particular, this seems to be the first instance of a classification result for geometric flows that are neither cohomogeneity-one nor selfsimilar.</description>

      <title>Generic mean curvature flows with cylindrical singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.00419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the dynamics of mean curvature flow as it approaches a cylindrical singularity. We reveal the mechanism for the isolatedness of cylindrical singularities in terms of the normal form of the asymptotic expansion of the rescaled mean curvature flow and formulate the notion of nondegeneracy of a cylindrical singularity.
  Our findings show that, generically, such a non-degenerate singularity is robust and isolated. In the presence of more complicated singularity sets such as in the example of a marriage ring, we demonstrate how to make the first-time singularity set a singleton by an arbitrarily small initial perturbation. These discoveries have implications for the level set flows' generic low regularity and the type-I nature of generic rotational MCFs. Additionally, the paper introduces the concept of a ``firecracker'' type singularity and its significance in studying the isolatedness of cylindrical singularities. The research combines techniques and concepts from geometric flows, dynamical systems, and semilinear heat equations.</description>

      <title>Octonionic Calabi-Yau theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.07857v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new class of Riemannian metrics, called octonionic K\"ahler, is introduced and studied on a certain class of 16-dimensional manifolds. It is an octonionic analogue of K\"ahler metrics on complex manifolds and of HKT-metrics of hypercomplex manifolds. Then for this class of metrics an octonionic version of the Monge-Amp\`ere equation is introduced and solved under appropriate assumptions. The latter result is an octonionic version of the Calabi-Yau theorem from K\"ahler geometry.</description>

      <title>Stability of Llarull's theorem in all dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14412v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Llarull's theorem characterizes the round sphere $S^n$ among all spin manifolds whose scalar curvature is bounded from below by $n(n-1)$. In this paper we show that if the scalar curvature is bounded from below by $n(n-1)-\varepsilon$, the underlying manifold is $C^0$-close to a finite number of spheres outside a small bad set. This completely solves Gromov's spherical stability problem.</description>
