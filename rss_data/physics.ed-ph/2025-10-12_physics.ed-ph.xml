      <title>Are science exhibitions for everyone? Accessibility aspects of the CERN Science Gateway exhibitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CERN's new flagship education and outreach centre, Science Gateway, opened its doors to the public in autumn 2023. Through a combination of immersive scenography with interactive exhibits and real scientific objects, its permanent exhibitions address the organisation's particle physics research and how this knowledge applies to other scientific fields and the visitor's everyday life. While in Discover CERN visitors learn about the accelerator and detector technologies at CERN, Our Universe covers the evolution of the Universe and the role that fundamental physics plays in it, as well as open questions in modern physics. Their underlying basic quantum mechanical principles can eventually be explored in Quantum World. Firstly, we will give a short overview of the exhibitions' highlights. Next, we delve into how various aspects of accessibility were incorporated into the exhibition development process to target the broadest audience possible and to inspire the next generation of scientists. We give an account on how this topic was approached and how inclusive exhibits and infrastructure were realised. By combining long-term visitor statistics and preliminary results of a recent visitor survey, we obtain insights about the actual audience and the visitors' perceived accessibility of the exhibitions with respect to their educational backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Exploring Teachers' Perceptions of ChatGPT Through Prompt Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence and especially Large Language Models (LLM), such as ChatGPT has revolutionized the way educators work. The results we get from LLMs depend on how we ask them to help us. The process and the technique behind an effective input is called prompt engineering. The aim of this study is to investigate whether science educators in secondary education improve their attitude toward ChatGPT as a learning assistant after appropriate training in prompt engineering. The results of the pilot study presented in this paper show an improvement in the previously mentioned teachers perceptions.</description>
