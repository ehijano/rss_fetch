      <title>Investigation of Superdirectivity in Planar Holographic Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the superdirectivity characteristics of uniform rectangular arrays (URAs) for holographic multiple-input multiple-output systems. By establishing a mathematical directivity model for the URA, an analytical expression for the maximum directivity is derived. Accordingly, systematic analysis is performed in conjunction with numerical simulations. Results show that the directivity can be significantly enhanced via rational utilization of coupling effects. However, this enhancement yields diminishing returns when antenna spacings transition to deep sub-wavelength scales. This study provides a theoretical basis for the design of superdirective URAs and offers valuable insights for holographic array optimization in 5G/6G communication systems.</description>

      <title>Joint optimization of microphone array geometry, sensor directivity pattern, and beamforming parameters for linear superarrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear superarrays (LSAs) have been proposed to address the limited steering capability of conventional linear differential microphone arrays (LDMAs) by integrating omnidirectional and directional microphones, enabling more flexible beamformer designs. However, existing approaches remain limited because array geometry and element directivity, both critical to beamforming performance, are not jointly optimized. This paper presents a generalized LSA optimization framework that simultaneously optimizes array geometry, element directivity, and the beamforming filter to minimize the approximation error between the designed beampattern and an ideal directivity pattern (IDP) over the full frequency band and all steering directions within the region of interest. The beamformer is derived by approximating the IDP using a Jacobi-Anger series expansion, while the array geometry and element directivity are optimized via a genetic algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed optimized array achieves lower approximation error than conventional LSAs across the target frequency band and steering range. Additionally, its directivity factor and white noise gain demonstrate more stable and improved performance across frequencies and steering angles.</description>

      <title>GeoPep: A geometry-aware masked language model for protein-peptide binding site prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal approaches that integrate protein structure and sequence have achieved remarkable success in protein-protein interface prediction. However, extending these methods to protein-peptide interactions remains challenging due to the inherent conformational flexibility of peptides and the limited availability of structural data that hinder direct training of structure-aware models. To address these limitations, we introduce GeoPep, a novel framework for peptide binding site prediction that leverages transfer learning from ESM3, a multimodal protein foundation model. GeoPep fine-tunes ESM3's rich pre-learned representations from protein-protein binding to address the limited availability of protein-peptide binding data. The fine-tuned model is further integrated with a parameter-efficient neural network architecture capable of learning complex patterns from sparse data. Furthermore, the model is trained using distance-based loss functions that exploit 3D structural information to enhance binding site prediction. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that GeoPep significantly outperforms existing methods in protein-peptide binding site prediction by effectively capturing sparse and heterogeneous binding patterns.</description>

      <title>Blind MIMO Semantic Communication via Parallel Variational Diffusion: A Completely Pilot-Free Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel blind multi-input multi-output (MIMO) semantic communication (SC) framework named Blind-MIMOSC that consists of a deep joint source-channel coding (DJSCC) transmitter and a diffusion-based blind receiver. The DJSCC transmitter aims to compress and map the source data into the transmitted signal by exploiting the structural characteristics of the source data, while the diffusion-based blind receiver employs a parallel variational diffusion (PVD) model to simultaneously recover the channel and the source data from the received signal without using any pilots. The PVD model leverages two pre-trained score networks to characterize the prior information of the channel and the source data, operating in a plug-and-play manner during inference. This design allows only the affected network to be retrained when channel conditions or source datasets change, avoiding the complicated full-network retraining required by end-to-end methods. This work presents the first fully pilot-free solution for joint channel estimation and source recovery in block-fading MIMO systems. Extensive experiments show that Blind-MIMOSC with PVD achieves superior channel and source recovery accuracy compared to state-of-the-art approaches, with drastically reduced channel bandwidth ratio.</description>

      <title>Distributed Precoding for Cell-free Massive MIMO in O-RAN: A Multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is a key technology for next-generation wireless systems. The integration of cell-free massive MIMO within the open radio access network (O-RAN) architecture addresses the growing need for decentralized, scalable, and high-capacity networks that can support different use cases. Precoding is a crucial step in the operation of cell-free massive MIMO, where O-RUs steer their beams towards the intended users while mitigating interference to other users. Current precoding schemes for cell-free massive MIMO are either fully centralized or fully distributed. Centralized schemes are not scalable, whereas distributed schemes may lead to a high inter-O-RU interference. In this paper, we propose a distributed and scalable precoding framework for cell-free massive MIMO that uses limited information exchange among precoding agents to mitigate interference. We formulate an optimization problem for precoding that maximizes the aggregate throughput while guaranteeing the minimum data rate requirements of users. The formulated problem is nonconvex. We propose a multi-timescale framework that combines multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with expert insights from an iterative algorithm to determine the precoding matrices efficiently. We conduct simulations and compare the proposed framework with the centralized precoding and distributed precoding methods for different numbers of O-RUs, users, and transmit antennas. The results show that the proposed framework achieves a higher aggregate throughput than the distributed regularized zero-forcing (D-RZF) scheme and the weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) algorithm. When compared with the centralized regularized zero-forcing (C-RZF) scheme, the proposed framework achieves similar aggregate throughput performance but with a lower signaling overhead.</description>

      <title>RFI Detection and Identification at OVRO Using Pseudonymetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protecting radio astronomy observatories from unintended interference is critical as wireless transmissions increases near protected bands. While database-driven coordination frameworks and radio quiet zones exist, they cannot rapidly identify or suppress specific interfering transmitters, especially at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels. This paper presents the first over-the-air field demonstration of Pseudonymetry at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO), illustrating cooperative spectrum sharing between heterogeneous wireless systems. In our experiment, a narrow-band secondary transmitter embeds a pseudonym watermark into its signal, while the wide-band radio telescope passively extracts the watermark from spectrogram data. Results show that interference can be reliably detected and the interfering device uniquely identified even at low SNR where conventional demodulation is infeasible. These findings validate that passive scientific receivers can participate in a lightweight feedback loop to trigger shutdown of harmful transmissions, demonstrating the potential of Pseudonymetry as a complementary enforcement tool for protecting radio astronomy environments.</description>

      <title>Unlimited Sampling of Multiband Signals: Single-Channel Acquisition and Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of reconstructing multiband signals from modulo-folded, pointwise samples within the Unlimited Sensing Framework (USF). Focusing on a low-complexity, single-channel acquisition setup, we establish recovery guarantees demonstrating that sub-Nyquist sampling is achievable under the USF paradigm. In doing so, we also tighten the previous sampling theorem for bandpass signals. Our recovery algorithm demonstrates up to a 13x dynamic range improvement in hardware experiments with up to 6 spectral bands. These results enable practical high-dynamic-range multiband acquisition in scenarios previously limited by dynamic range and excessive oversampling.</description>

      <title>From OFDM to AFDM: Enabling Adaptive Integrated Sensing and Communication in High-Mobility Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a key feature of next-generation wireless networks, enabling a wide range of emerging applications such as vehicle-to-everything (V2X) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which operate in high-mobility scenarios. Notably, the wireless channels within these applications typically exhibit severe delay and Doppler spreads. The latter causes serious communication performance degradation in the Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) waveform that is widely adopted in current wireless networks. To address this challenge, the recently proposed Doppler-resilient affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) waveform, which uses flexible chirp signals as subcarriers, shows great potential for achieving adaptive ISAC in high-mobility scenarios. This article provides a comprehensive overview of AFDM-ISAC. We begin by presenting the fundamentals of AFDM-ISAC, highlighting its inherent frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW)-like characteristics. Then, we explore its ISAC performance limits by analyzing its diversity order, ambiguity function (AF), and Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB). Finally, we present several effective sensing algorithms and opportunities for AFDM-ISAC, with the aim of sparking new ideas in this emerging field.</description>

      <title>Joint Visible Light and Backscatter Communications for Proximity-Based Indoor Asset Tracking Enabled by Energy-Neutral Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In next-generation wireless systems, providing location-based mobile computing services for energy-neutral devices has become a crucial objective for the provision of sustainable Internet of Things (IoT). Visible light positioning (VLP) has gained great research attention as a complementary method to radio frequency (RF) solutions since it can leverage ubiquitous lighting infrastructure. However, conventional VLP receivers often rely on photodetectors or cameras that are power-hungry, complex, and expensive. To address this challenge, we propose a hybrid indoor asset tracking system that integrates visible light communication (VLC) and backscatter communication (BC) within a simultaneous lightwave information and power transfer (SLIPT) framework. We design a low-complexity and energy-neutral IoT node, namely backscatter device (BD) which harvests energy from light-emitting diode (LED) access points, and then modulates and reflects ambient RF carriers to indicate its location within particular VLC cells. We present a multi-cell VLC deployment with frequency division multiplexing (FDM) method that mitigates interference among LED access points by assigning them distinct frequency pairs based on a four-color map scheduling principle. We develop a lightweight particle filter (PF) tracking algorithm at an edge RF reader, where the fusion of proximity reports and the received backscatter signal strength are employed to track the BD. Experimental results show that this approach achieves the positioning error of 0.318 m at 50th percentile and 0.634 m at 90th percentile, while avoiding the use of complex photodetectors and active RF synthesizing components at the energy-neutral IoT node. By demonstrating robust performance in multiple indoor trajectories, the proposed solution enables scalable, cost-effective, and energy-neutral indoor tracking for pervasive and edge-assisted IoT applications.</description>

      <title>SIM-Assisted End-to-End Co-Frequency Co-Time Full-Duplex System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To further suppress the inherent self-interference (SI) in co-frequency and co-time full-duplex (CCFD) systems, we propose integrating a stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM) into the RF front-end to enhance signal processing in the wave domain. Furthermore, an end-to-end (E2E) learning-based signal processing method is adopted to control the metasurface. Specifically, the real metasurface is abstracted as hidden layers of a network, thereby constructing an electromagnetic neural network (EMNN) to enable driving control of the real communication system. Traditional communication tasks, such as channel coding, modulation, precoding, combining, demodulation, and channel decoding, are synchronously carried out during the electromagnetic (EM) forward propagation through the metasurface. Simulation results show that, benefiting from the additional wave-domain processing capability of the SIM, the SIM-assisted CCFD system achieves significantly reduced bit error rate (BER) compared with conventional CCFD systems. Our study fully demonstrates the potential applications of EMNN and SIM-assisted E2E CCFD systems in next-generation transceiver design.</description>

      <title>Variational Bayesian Estimation of Low Earth Orbits for Satellite Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-earth-orbit (LEO) satellite communication systems that use millimeter-wave frequencies rely on large antenna arrays with hybrid analog-digital architectures for rapid beam steering. LEO satellites are only visible from the ground for short periods of times (a few tens of minutes) due to their high orbital speeds. This paper presents a variational message passing algorithm for joint localization and beam tracking of a LEO satellite from a ground station equipped with a hybrid transceiver architecture. The algorithm relies on estimating the parameters of the orbit, which is modelled as circular. Angles are then obtained from the orbit in a straightforward manner. Simulation results show that the proposed method is highly resilient to missed detections, enables reliable satellite tracking even near the horizon, and effectively alleviates the ambiguities inherent in hybrid architectures.</description>

      <title>Classification of Lower Limb Activities Based on Discrete Wavelet Transform Using On-Body Creeping Wave Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article investigates how the creeping wave propagation around the human thigh could be used to monitor the leg movements. The propagation path around the human thigh gives information regarding leg motions that can be used for the classification of activities. The variation of the transmission coefficient is measured between two on-body polyethylene terephthalate (PET) flexible antennas for six different leg-based activities that exhibit unique time-varying signatures. A discrete wavelet transform (DWT) along with different classifiers, such as support vector machine (SVM), decision trees, naive Bayes, and K-nearest neighbors (KNN), is applied for feature extraction and classification to evaluate the efficiency for classifying different activity signals. Additional algorithms, such as dynamic time warping (DTW) and deep convolutional neural network (DCNN), have also been implemented, and in each case, SVM with DWT outperforms the others. Simulation to evaluate a specific absorption rate (SAR) is carried out as the antenna is positioned on the human thigh leaving no gap. The results show that the SAR is within the threshold as per the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) standard.</description>

      <title>Classification of Induction Motor Fault and Imbalance Based on Vibration Signal Using Single Antenna's Reactive Near Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early fault diagnosis is imperative for the proper functioning of rotating machines. It can reduce economic losses in the industry due to unexpected failures. Existing fault analysis methods are either expensive or demand expertise for the installation of the sensors. This article proposes a novel method for the detection of bearing faults and imbalance in induction motors using an antenna as the sensor, which is noninvasive and cost-efficient. Time-varying S11 is measured using an omnidirectional antenna, and it is seen that the spectrogram of S11 shows unique characteristics for different fault conditions. The experimental setup has analytically evaluated the vibration frequencies due to fault and validated the characteristic fault frequency by applying FFT analysis on the captured S11 data. This article has evaluated the average power content of the detected signals at normal and different fault conditions. A deep learning model is used to classify the faults based on the reflection coefficient ( S11). It is found that classification accuracy of 98.2% is achieved using both magnitude and phase of S11, 96% using the magnitude of S11 and 92.1% using the phase of S11. The classification accuracy for different operating frequencies, antenna location, and time windows are also investigated.</description>

      <title>UNILocPro: Unified Localization Integrating Model-Based Geometry and Channel Charting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a unified localization framework (called UNILocPro) that integrates model-based localization and channel charting (CC) for mixed line-of-sight (LoS)/non-line-of-sight (NLoS) scenarios. Specifically, based on LoS/NLoS identification, an adaptive activation between the model-based and CC-based methods is conducted. Aiming for unsupervised learning, information obtained from the model-based method is utilized to train the CC model, where a pairwise distance loss (involving a new dissimilarity metric design), a triplet loss (if timestamps are available), a LoS-based loss, and an optimal transport (OT)-based loss are jointly employed such that the global geometry can be well preserved. To reduce the training complexity of UNILocPro, we propose a low-complexity implementation (called UNILoc), where the CC model is trained with self-generated labels produced by a single pre-training OT transformation, which avoids iterative Sinkhorn updates involved in the OT-based loss computation. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed unified frameworks achieve significantly improved positioning accuracy compared to both model-based and CC-based methods. Notably, UNILocPro with timestamps attains performance on par with fully-supervised fingerprinting despite operating without labelled training data. It is also shown that the low-complexity UNILoc can substantially reduce training complexity with only marginal performance degradation.</description>

      <title>Estimation of aboveground biomass in a tropical dry forest: An intercomparison of airborne, unmanned, and space laser scanning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to the Paris Climate Change Agreement, all nations are required to submit reports on their greenhouse gas emissions and absorption every two years by 2024. Consequently, forests play a crucial role in reducing carbon emissions, which is essential for meeting these obligations. Recognizing the significance of forest conservation in the global battle against climate change, Article 5 of the Paris Agreement emphasizes the need for high-quality forest data. This study focuses on enhancing methods for mapping aboveground biomass in tropical dry forests. Tropical dry forests are considered one of the least understood tropical forest environments; therefore, there is a need for accurate approaches to estimate carbon pools. We employ a comparative analysis of AGB estimates, utilizing different discrete and full-waveform laser scanning datasets in conjunction with Ordinary Least Squares and Bayesian approaches SVM. Airborne Laser Scanning, Unmanned Laser Scanning, and Space Laser Scanning were used as independent variables for extracting forest metrics. Variable selection, SVM regression tuning, and cross-validation via a machine-learning approach were applied to account for overfitting and underfitting. The results indicate that six key variables primarily related to tree height: Elev.minimum, Elev.L3, lev.MAD.mode, Elev.mode, Elev.MAD.median, and Elev.skewness, are important for AGB estimation using ALSD and ULSD , while Leaf Area Index, canopy coverage and height, terrain elevation, and full-waveform signal energy emerged as the most vital variables. AGB values estimated from ten permanent tropical dry forest plots in Costa Rica Guanacaste province ranged from 26.02 Mg/ha to 175.43 Mg/ha . The SVM regressions demonstrated a 17.89 error across all laser scanning systems, with SLSF W exhibiting the lowest error 17.07 in estimating total biomass per plot.</description>

      <title>pDANSE: Particle-based Data-driven Nonlinear State Estimation from Nonlinear Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of designing a data-driven nonlinear state estimation (DANSE) method that uses (noisy) nonlinear measurements of a process whose underlying state transition model (STM) is unknown. Such a process is referred to as a model-free process. A recurrent neural network (RNN) provides parameters of a Gaussian prior that characterize the state of the model-free process, using all previous measurements at a given time point. In the case of DANSE, the measurement system was linear, leading to a closed-form solution for the state posterior. However, the presence of a nonlinear measurement system renders a closed-form solution infeasible. Instead, the second-order statistics of the state posterior are computed using the nonlinear measurements observed at the time point. We address the nonlinear measurements using a reparameterization trick-based particle sampling approach, and estimate the second-order statistics of the state posterior. The proposed method is referred to as particle-based DANSE (pDANSE). The RNN of pDANSE uses sequential measurements efficiently and avoids the use of computationally intensive sequential Monte-Carlo (SMC) and/or ancestral sampling. We describe the semi-supervised learning method for pDANSE, which transitions to unsupervised learning in the absence of labeled data. Using a stochastic Lorenz-$63$ system as a benchmark process, we experimentally demonstrate the state estimation performance for four nonlinear measurement systems. We explore cubic nonlinearity and a camera-model nonlinearity where unsupervised learning is used; then we explore half-wave rectification nonlinearity and Cartesian-to-spherical nonlinearity where semi-supervised learning is used. The performance of state estimation is shown to be competitive vis-\`a-vis particle filters that have complete knowledge of the STM of the Lorenz-$63$ system.</description>

      <title>Trends and Challenges in Next-Generation GNSS Interference Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global navigation satellite system (GNSS) continues to evolve in order to meet the demands of emerging applications such as autonomous driving and smart environmental monitoring. However, these advancements are accompanied by a rise in interference threats, which can significantly compromise the reliability and safety of GNSS. Such interference problems are typically addressed through signal-processing techniques that rely on physics-based mathematical models. Unfortunately, solutions of this nature can often fail to fully capture the complex forms of interference. To address this, artificial intelligence (AI)-inspired solutions are expected to play a key role in future interference management solutions, thanks to their ability to exploit data in addition to physics-based models. This magazine paper discusses the main challenges and tasks required to secure GNSS and present a research vision on how AI can be leveraged towards achieving more robust GNSS-based positioning.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Investigation of Crosstalk in Bent Microstrip Lines with Partial and Apertured Shielding: Simulations and Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an electromagnetic investigation of the crosstalk between two bent microstrip lines (MLs) separated by a perforated planar shield. As an extension of our previous study, the effects of various discontinuities in either the MLs or the shield along the coupling path are analyzed through numerical simulations and validated by measurements. The underlying electromagnetic mechanisms are also discussed. Furthermore, multimodal wave theory in a rectangular waveguide is applied to predict crosstalk behavior when the shield contains an aperture. This study aims to conceptually elucidate complex crosstalk phenomena that are difficult to model using circuit theory, and successful predictions of crosstalk behavior are presented for different problem cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an in-depth analysis of timing closure challenges and constraints in Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). We examine core timing principles, architectural distinctions, and design methodologies influencing timing behavior in both technologies. A case study comparing the Xilinx Kintex UltraScale+ FPGA (XCKU040) with a 7nm ASIC highlights practical timing analysis and performance trade-offs. Experimental results show ASICs achieve superior timing of 45ps setup and 35ps hold, while modern FPGAs remain competitive with 180ps setup and 120ps hold times, validating their suitability for high-performance designs.</description>

      <title>Functional embeddings enable Aggregation of multi-area SEEG recordings over subjects and sessions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aggregating intracranial recordings across subjects is challenging since electrode count, placement, and covered regions vary widely. Spatial normalization methods like MNI coordinates offer a shared anatomical reference, but often fail to capture true functional similarity, particularly when localization is imprecise; even at matched anatomical coordinates, the targeted brain region and underlying neural dynamics can differ substantially between individuals. We propose a scalable representation-learning framework that (i) learns a subject-agnostic functional identity for each electrode from multi-region local field potentials using a Siamese encoder with contrastive objectives, inducing an embedding geometry that is locality-sensitive to region-specific neural signatures, and (ii) tokenizes these embeddings for a transformer that models inter-regional relationships with a variable number of channels. We evaluate this framework on a 20-subject dataset spanning basal ganglia-thalamic regions collected during flexible rest/movement recording sessions with heterogeneous electrode layouts. The learned functional space supports accurate within-subject discrimination and forms clear, region-consistent clusters; it transfers zero-shot to unseen channels. The transformer, operating on functional tokens without subject-specific heads or supervision, captures cross-region dependencies and enables reconstruction of masked channels, providing a subject-agnostic backbone for downstream decoding. Together, these results indicate a path toward large-scale, cross-subject aggregation and pretraining for intracranial neural data where strict task structure and uniform sensor placement are unavailable.</description>

      <title>Analytical Model of NR-V2X Mode 2 with Re-Evaluation Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive message transmissions, unpredictable aperiodic messages, and high-speed moving vehicles contribute to the complex wireless environment, resulting in inefficient resource collisions in Vehicle to Everything (V2X). In order to achieve better medium access control (MAC) layer performance, 3GPP introduced several new features in NR-V2X. One of the most important is the re-evaluation mechanism. It allows the vehicle to continuously sense resources before message transmission to avoid resource collisions. So far, only a few articles have studied the re-evaluation mechanism of NR-V2X, and they mainly focus on network simulator that do not consider variable traffic, which makes analysis and comparison difficult. In this paper, an analytical model of NR-V2X Mode 2 is established, and a message generator is constructed by using discrete time Markov chain (DTMC) to simulate the traffic pattern recommended by 3GPP advanced V2X services. Our study shows that the re-evaluation mechanism improves the reliability of NR-V2X transmission, but there are still local improvements needed to reduce latency.</description>

      <title>Beamforming in the Reproducing Kernel Domain Based on Spatial Differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel beamforming framework in the reproducing kernel domain, derived from a unified interpretation of directional response as spatial differentiation of the sound field. By representing directional response using polynomial differential operators, the proposed method enables the formulation of arbitrary beam patterns including non-axisymmetric. The derivation of the reproducing kernel associated with the interior fields is mathematically supported by Hobson's theorem, which allows concise analytical expressions. Furthermore, the proposed framework generalizes conventional spherical harmonic domain beamformers by reinterpreting them as spatial differential operators, thereby clarifying their theoretical structure and extensibility. Three numerical simulations conducted in two-dimensional space confirm the validity of the method.</description>

      <title>Nonasymptotic Convergence Rates for Plug-and-Play Methods With MMSE Denoisers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known that the minimum-mean-squared-error (MMSE) denoiser under Gaussian noise can be written as a proximal operator, which suffices for asymptotic convergence of plug-and-play (PnP) methods but does not reveal the structure of the induced regularizer or give convergence rates. We show that the MMSE denoiser corresponds to a regularizer that can be written explicitly as an upper Moreau envelope of the negative log-marginal density, which in turn implies that the regularizer is 1-weakly convex. Using this property, we derive (to the best of our knowledge) the first sublinear convergence guarantee for PnP proximal gradient descent with an MMSE denoiser. We validate the theory with a one-dimensional synthetic study that recovers the implicit regularizer. We also validate the theory with imaging experiments (deblurring and computed tomography), which exhibit the predicted sublinear behavior.</description>

      <title>Inferring trust in recommendation systems from brain, behavioural, and physiological data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As people nowadays increasingly rely on artificial intelligence (AI) to curate information and make decisions, assigning the appropriate amount of trust in automated intelligent systems has become ever more important. However, current measurements of trust in automation still largely rely on self-reports that are subjective and disruptive to the user. Here, we take music recommendation as a model to investigate the neural and cognitive processes underlying trust in automation. We observed that system accuracy was directly related to users' trust and modulated the influence of recommendation cues on music preference. Modelling users' reward encoding process with a reinforcement learning model further revealed that system accuracy, expected reward, and prediction error were related to oscillatory neural activity recorded via EEG and changes in pupil diameter. Our results provide a neurally grounded account of calibrating trust in automation and highlight the promises of a multimodal approach towards developing trustable AI systems.</description>

      <title>ESTformer: Transformer utilising spatiotemporal dependencies for electroencephalogram super-resolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10052v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Towards practical applications of Electroencephalography (EEG), lightweight acquisition devices garner significant attention. However, EEG channel selection methods are commonly data-sensitive and cannot establish a unified sound paradigm for EEG acquisition devices. Through reverse conceptualisation, we formulated EEG applications in an EEG super-resolution (SR) manner, but suffered from high computation costs, extra interpolation bias, and few insights into spatiotemporal dependency modelling. To this end, we propose ESTformer, an EEG SR framework that utilises spatiotemporal dependencies based on the transformer. ESTformer applies positional encoding methods and a multihead self-attention mechanism to the space and time dimensions, which can learn spatial structural correlations and temporal functional variations. ESTformer, with the fixed mask strategy, adopts a mask token to upsample low-resolution (LR) EEG data in the case of disturbance from mathematical interpolation methods. On this basis, we designed various transformer blocks to construct a spatial interpolation module (SIM) and a temporal reconstruction module (TRM). Finally, ESTformer cascades the SIM and TRM to capture and model the spatiotemporal dependencies for EEG SR with fidelity. Extensive experimental results on two EEG datasets show the effectiveness of ESTformer against previous state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating the versatility of the Transformer for EEG SR tasks. The superiority of the SR data was verified in an EEG-based person identification and emotion recognition task, achieving a 2% to 38% improvement compared with the LR data at different sampling scales.</description>

      <title>FAST: Flexible and Adaptive Semantic Transmission for Resource-constrained Multi-user Generative Semantic Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence has spurred innovative approaches to semantic communication, giving rise to a new paradigm known as generative semantic communication (GSC). The integration of flexible cross-modal semantic extraction with generative capability-driven semantic inference substantially enhances semantic compression efficiency, demonstrating significant promise under communication resource constraints. Nonetheless, the stringent dependence on high computational power and the resulting latency continue to present major challenges, thereby limiting the feasibility of large-scale deployment. To address these challenges, we propose a novel GSC framework named FAST, which stands for flexible and adaptive semantic transmission. To accommodate limited computational resources, we propose a sequential semantic extraction method, where a temporal prompt engineering module orchestrates the distillation and transmission of key semantic units. Correspondingly, we introduce a sequential conditional denoising module at the receiver, which adapts the diffusion-based reconstruction to the progressively received input. To enhance overall task performance in multi-user semantic transmission, we propose a semantic-aware resource allocation method that optimizes bandwidth dynamically based on a joint consideration of semantic dependencies, user-level task priorities, and instantaneous channel conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed architecture achieves system precision comparable to conventional GSC systems while significantly reducing transmission latency and improving overall efficiency. These results confirm its enhanced potential for deployment in multi-user GSC scenarios with stringent communication and computational constraints.</description>

      <title>Downlink Performance of Cell-Free Massive MIMO for LEO Satellite Mega-Constellation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite communication (SatCom) has emerged as a promising technology to improve wireless connectivity in global areas. Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO), an architecture proposed for next-generation networks, has yet to be fully explored for LEO satellites. In this paper, we investigate the downlink performance of a CF-mMIMO LEO SatCom network, where multiple satellite access points (SAPs) simultaneously serve the corresponding ground user terminals (UTs). Using tools from stochastic geometry, we model the locations of SAPs and UTs on surfaces of concentric spheres using Poisson point processes (PPPs) and present expressions on transmit and received signals, signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). Then, we derive the coverage probabilities in fading scenarios, considering significant system parameters such as the Nakagami fading parameter, the number of UTs, the number of SAPs, the orbital altitude, and the service range affected by the dome angle. Finally, the analytical model is verified by extensive Monte Carlo simulations. Simulation results indicate that stronger line-of-sight (LoS) effects and a more comprehensive service range of the UT result in a higher coverage probability, despite the presence of multi-user interference (MUI). Moreover, we found that there exist optimal numbers of UTs that maximize system capacity for different orbital altitudes and dome angles, providing valuable insights for system design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17499v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate, continuous out-of-hospital electrocardiogram (ECG) parameter measurement is vital for real-time cardiac health monitoring and telemedicine. On-device computation of single-lead ECG parameters enables timely assessment without reliance on centralized data processing, advancing personalized, ubiquitous cardiac care-yet comprehensive validation across heterogeneous real-world populations remains limited. This study validated the on-device algorithm FeatureDB (https://github.com/PKUDigitalHealth/FeatureDB) using two datasets: HeartVoice-ECG-lite (369 participants with single-lead ECGs annotated by two physicians) and PTB-XL/PTB-XL+ (21,354 patients with 12-lead ECGs and physicians' diagnostic annotations). FeatureDB computed PR, QT, and QTc intervals, with accuracy evaluated against physician annotations via mean absolute error (MAE), correlation analysis, and Bland-Altman analysis. Diagnostic performance for first-degree atrioventricular block (AVBI, PR-based) and long QT syndrome (LQT, QTc-based) was benchmarked against commercial 12-lead systems (12SL, Uni-G) and open-source algorithm Deli, using AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Results showed high concordance with expert annotations (Pearson correlations: 0.836-0.960), MAEs matching inter-observer variability, and minimal bias. AVBI AUC reached 0.787 (12SL: 0.859; Uni-G: 0.812; Deli: 0.501); LQT AUC was 0.684 (12SL: 0.716; Uni-G: 0.605; Deli: 0.569)-comparable to commercial tools and superior to open-source alternatives. FeatureDB delivers physician-level parameter accuracy and commercial-grade abnormality detection via single-lead devices, supporting scalable telemedicine, decentralized cardiac screening, and continuous monitoring in community and outpatient settings.</description>

      <title>Is Limited Participant Diversity Impeding EEG-based Machine Learning?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13497v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The application of machine learning (ML) to electroencephalography (EEG) has great potential to advance both neuroscientific research and clinical applications. However, the generalisability and robustness of EEG-based ML models often hinge on the amount and diversity of training data. It is common practice to split EEG recordings into small segments, thereby increasing the number of samples substantially compared to the number of individual recordings or participants. We conceptualise this as a multi-level data generation process and investigate the scaling behaviour of model performance with respect to the overall sample size and the participant diversity through large-scale empirical studies. We then use the same framework to investigate the effectiveness of different ML strategies designed to address limited data problems: data augmentations and self-supervised learning. Our findings show that model performance scaling can be severely constrained by participant distribution shifts and provide actionable guidance for data collection and ML research. The code for our experiments is publicly available online.</description>

      <title>Faulty RIS-aided Integrated Sensing and Communication: Modeling and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates a practical reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, where a subset of RIS elements fail to function properly and reflect incident signals randomly towards unintended directions, thereby degrading system performance. To date, no study has addressed such impairments caused by faulty RIS elements in ISAC systems. This work aims to fill the gap. First, to quantify the impact of faulty elements on ISAC performance, we derive the misspecified Cram\'er-Rao bound (MCRB) for sensing parameter estimation and signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) for communication quality. Then, to mitigate the performance loss caused by faulty elements, we jointly design the remaining functional RIS phase shifts and transmit beamforming to minimize the MCRB, subject to the communication SINR and transmit power constraints. The resulting optimization problem is highly non-convex due to the intricate structure of the MCRB expression and constant-modulus constraint imposed on RIS. To address this, we reformulate it into a more tractable form and propose a block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm that incorporates majorization-minimization (MM), successive convex approximation (SCA), and penalization techniques. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed approach reduces the MCRB performance loss by 21.25% on average compared to the case where the presence of faulty elements is ignored. Furthermore, the performance gain becomes more evident as the number of faulty elements increases.</description>

      <title>Near-Field SWIPT with gMIMO in the Upper Mid-Band: Opportunities, Challenges, and the Way Forward</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the integration of simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) with gigantic multiple-input multiple-output (gMIMO) technology operating in the upper mid-band frequency range (7-24 GHz). The near-field propagation achieved by gMIMO introduces unique opportunities for energy-efficient, high-capacity communication systems that cater to the demands of 6G wireless networks. Exploiting spherical wave propagation, near-field SWIPT with gMIMO enables precise energy and data delivery, enhancing spectral efficiency through beam focusing and massive spatial multiplexing. This paper discusses theoretical principles, design challenges, and enabling solutions, including advanced channel estimation techniques, precoding strategies, and dynamic array configurations such as sparse and modular arrays. Through analytical insights and a case study, this paper demonstrates the feasibility of achieving optimized energy harvesting and data throughput in dense and dynamic environments. These findings contribute to advancing energy-autonomous Internet-of-Everything (IoE) deployments, smart factory networks, and other energy-autonomous applications aligned with the goals of next-generation wireless technologies.</description>

      <title>Position and Velocity Estimation Accuracy in MIMO-OFDM ISAC Networks: A Fisher Information Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical framework to derive information-theoretic bounds on the estimation accuracy of target position and velocity in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks composed of multiple cooperative and distributed multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) base stations (BSs). Leveraging Fisher information analysis, we derive closed-form expressions for the Cram\'er-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) in both monostatic and bistatic configurations. The framework is then extended to cooperative settings, including networks with multiple coordinated monostatic sensors and multistatic configurations, enabling joint estimation of target position and velocity. We systematically examine how estimation accuracy depends on key system parameters such as the number of BSs, bandwidth, antenna configuration, and network geometry. Numerical results highlight the performance gains enabled by cooperative sensing and provide insights to guide the design of future ISAC systems.</description>

      <title>Design and Analysis of Phase Conjugation-Based Self-Alignment Beamforming for RIS-Assisted Terahertz SWIPT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) is a promising technology for enabling ultra-high-rate and low-latency communications in massive battery-free Internet of Things (IoT) deployments for 6G networks. However, conventional THz systems rely on narrow directional beams that necessitate precise alignment, typically achieved through high-overhead beam scanning procedures, which fundamentally at odds with the energy constraints of battery-free IoT devices. In this paper, we propose a novel self-alignment architecture for THz SWIPT leveraging a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to eliminate complex beam scanning. By integrating phase conjugate circuits at both the base station and user equipment, the RIS facilitates a resonance-based bidirectional retro-reflection mechanism, enabling the system to autonomously converge to an aligned state without manual intervention. We develop an analytical channel transfer model and a power cycle model to characterize the resonance-assisted beam alignment process and power transfer efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that the RIS-enabled system achieves effective spatial power concentration with significant sidelobe suppression, leading to a communication capacity of 127.84 Gbit/s and a received power of 13.62 mW over a 2.2-meter link.</description>

      <title>Adaptive and robust smartphone-based step detection in multiple sclerosis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Many attempts to validate gait pipelines that process sensor data to detect gait events have focused on the detection of initial contacts only in supervised settings using a single sensor. Objective: To evaluate the performance of a gait pipeline in detecting initial/final contacts using a step detection algorithm adaptive to different test settings, smartphone wear locations, and gait impairment levels. Methods: In GaitLab (ISRCTN15993728), healthy controls (HC) and people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS; Expanded Disability Status Scale 0.0-6.5) performed supervised Two-Minute Walk Test [2MWT] (structured in-lab overground and treadmill 2MWT) during two on-site visits carrying six smartphones and unsupervised walking activities (structured and unstructured real-world walking) daily for 10-14 days using a single smartphone. Reference gait data were collected with a motion capture system or Gait Up sensors. The pipeline's performance in detecting initial/final contacts was evaluated through F1 scores and absolute temporal error with respect to reference measurement systems. Results: We studied 35 HC and 93 PwMS. Initial/final contacts were accurately detected across all smartphone wear locations. Median F1 scores for initial/final contacts on in-lab 2MWT were &gt;=99.0%/&gt;=97.6% in HC and &gt;=99.0%/98.2% in PwMS. F1 scores remained high on structured (HC: 100%/100%; PwMS: 99.9%/99.5%) and unstructured real-world walking (HC: 97.8%/97.8%; PwMS: 94.4%/94.0%). Median temporal errors were &lt;=0.08 s. Neither age, sex, disease severity, walking aid use, nor setting (outdoor/indoor) impacted pipeline performance (all p&gt;0.05). Conclusion: This gait pipeline accurately and consistently detects initial and final contacts in PwMS across different smartphone locations and environments, highlighting its potential for real-world gait assessment.</description>

      <title>Absorb and Converge: Provable Convergence Guarantee for Absorbing Discrete Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02318v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discrete state space diffusion models have shown significant advantages in applications involving discrete data, such as text and image generation. It has also been observed that their performance is highly sensitive to the choice of rate matrices, particularly between uniform and absorbing rate matrices. While empirical results suggest that absorbing rate matrices often yield better generation quality compared to uniform rate matrices, existing theoretical works have largely focused on the uniform rate matrices case. Notably, convergence guarantees and error analyses for absorbing diffusion models are still missing. In this work, we provide the first finite-time error bounds and convergence rate analysis for discrete diffusion models using absorbing rate matrices. We begin by deriving an upper bound on the KL divergence of the forward process, introducing a surrogate initialization distribution to address the challenge posed by the absorbing stationary distribution, which is a singleton and causes the KL divergence to be ill-defined. We then establish the first convergence guarantees for both the $\tau$-leaping and uniformization samplers under absorbing rate matrices, demonstrating improved rates over their counterparts using uniform rate matrices. Furthermore, under suitable assumptions, we provide convergence guarantees without early stopping. Our analysis introduces several new technical tools to address challenges unique to absorbing rate matrices. These include a Jensen-type argument for bounding forward process convergence, novel techniques for bounding absorbing score functions, and a non-divergent upper bound on the score near initialization that removes the need of early-stopping.</description>

      <title>PoLAR: Polar-Decomposed Low-Rank Adapter Representation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03133v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that low-rank adaptation of large-scale models suffers from a low stable rank that is well below the linear algebraic rank of the subspace, degrading fine-tuning performance. To mitigate the underutilization of the allocated subspace, we propose PoLAR, a parameterization inspired by the polar decomposition that factorizes the low-rank update into two direction matrices constrained to Stiefel manifolds and an unconstrained scale matrix. Our theory shows that PoLAR yields an exponentially faster convergence rate on a canonical low-rank adaptation problem. Pairing the parameterization with Riemannian optimization leads to consistent gains on three different benchmarks testing general language understanding, commonsense reasoning, and mathematical problem solving with base model sizes ranging from 350M to 27B.</description>

      <title>Graph Semi-Supervised Learning for Point Classification on Data Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12197v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a graph semi-supervised learning framework for classification tasks on data manifolds. Motivated by the manifold hypothesis, we model data as points sampled from a low-dimensional manifold $\mathcal{M} \subset \mathbb{R}^F$. The manifold is approximated in an unsupervised manner using a variational autoencoder (VAE), where the trained encoder maps data to embeddings that represent their coordinates in $\mathbb{R}^F$. A geometric graph is constructed with Gaussian-weighted edges inversely proportional to distances in the embedding space, transforming the point classification problem into a semi-supervised node classification task on the graph. This task is solved using a graph neural network (GNN). Our main contribution is a theoretical analysis of the statistical generalization properties of this data-to-manifold-to-graph pipeline. We show that, under uniform sampling from $\mathcal{M}$, the generalization gap of the semi-supervised task diminishes with increasing graph size, up to the GNN training error. Leveraging a training procedure which resamples a slightly larger graph at regular intervals during training, we then show that the generalization gap can be reduced even further, vanishing asymptotically. Finally, we validate our findings with numerical experiments on image classification benchmarks, demonstrating the empirical effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Discrete Diffusion Models: Novel Analysis and New Sampler Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have recently gained significant prominence in applications involving natural language and graph data. A key factor influencing their effectiveness is the efficiency of discretized samplers. Among these, $\tau$-leaping samplers have become particularly popular due to their theoretical and empirical success. However, existing theoretical analyses of $\tau$-leaping often rely on somewhat restrictive and difficult-to-verify regularity assumptions, and their convergence bounds contain quadratic dependence on the vocabulary size. In this work, we introduce a new analytical approach for discrete diffusion models that removes the need for such assumptions. For the standard $\tau$-leaping method, we establish convergence guarantees in KL divergence that scale linearly with vocabulary size, improving upon prior results with quadratic dependence. Our approach is also more broadly applicable: it provides the first convergence guarantees for other widely used samplers, including the Euler method and Tweedie $\tau$-leaping. Central to our approach is a novel technique based on differential inequalities, offering a more flexible alternative to the traditional Girsanov change-of-measure methods. This technique may also be of independent interest for the analysis of other stochastic processes.</description>

      <title>Non-Convex Over-the-Air Heterogeneous Federated Learning: A Bias-Variance Trade-off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over-the-air (OTA) federated learning (FL) has been well recognized as a scalable paradigm that exploits the waveform superposition of the wireless multiple-access channel to aggregate model updates in a single use. Existing OTA-FL designs largely enforce zero-bias model updates by either assuming \emph{homogeneous} wireless conditions (equal path loss across devices) or forcing zero-bias updates to guarantee convergence. Under \emph{heterogeneous} wireless scenarios, however, such designs are constrained by the weakest device and inflate the update variance. Moreover, prior analyses of biased OTA-FL largely address convex objectives, while most modern AI models are highly non-convex. Motivated by these gaps, we study OTA-FL with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for general smooth non-convex objectives under wireless heterogeneity. We develop novel OTA-FL SGD updates that allow a structured, time-invariant model bias while facilitating reduced variance updates. We derive a finite-time stationarity bound (expected time average squared gradient norm) that explicitly reveals a bias-variance trade-off. To optimize this trade-off, we pose a non-convex joint OTA power-control design and develop an efficient successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm that requires only statistical CSI at the base station. Experiments on a non-convex image classification task validate the approach: the SCA-based design accelerates convergence via an optimized bias and improves generalization over prior OTA-FL baselines.</description>
