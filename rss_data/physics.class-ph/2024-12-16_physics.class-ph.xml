      <title>Series solutions for clamped peridynamic beams using fourth-order eigenfunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an analytical approach to solving nonlocal generalizations of the Euler--Bernoulli beam. Specifically, we consider a version of the governing equation recently derived under the theory of peridynamics. We focus on the clamped--clamped case, employing the natural eigenfunctions of the fourth derivative subject to these boundary conditions. Static solutions under different loading conditions are obtained as series in these eigenfunctions. To demonstrate the utility of our proposed approach, we contrast the series solution in terms of fourth-order eigenfunctions to the previously obtained Fourier sine series solution. Our findings reveal that the series in fourth-order eigenfunctions achieve a given error tolerance (with respect to a reference solution) with ten times fewer terms than the sine series. The high level of accuracy of the fourth-order eigenfunction expansion is due to the fact that its expansion coefficients decay rapidly with the number of terms of the series, one order faster than the Fourier series in our examples.</description>

      <title>Reconsidering Volterra defects: Geometrical relation between edge dislocations and wedge disclinations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive mathematical model for Volterra defects and explores their relations using differential geometry on Riemann--Cartan manifolds. Following the standard Volterra process, we derived the Cartan moving frame, a geometric representation of plastic fields, and the associated Riemannian metric using exterior algebra. Although the analysis naturally defines the geometry of three types of dislocations and the wedge disclination, it fails to classify twist disclinations owing to the persistent torsion component, suggesting the need for modifications to the Volterra process. By leveraging the interchangeability of the Weitzenb\"ock and Levi-Civita connections and applying an analytical solution for plasticity derived from the Biot--Savart law, we provide a rigorous mathematical proof of the long-standing phenomenological relationship between edge dislocations and wedge disclinations. Additionally, we showcase the effectiveness of novel mathematical tools, including Riemannian holonomy for analysing the Frank vector and complex potentials that encapsulate the topological properties of wedge disclinations as jump discontinuities. Furthermore, we derive analytical expressions for the linearized stress fields of wedge disclinations and confirm their consistency with existing results. These findings demonstrate that the present geometrical framework extends and generalizes the classical theory of Volterra defects.</description>

      <title>Coherent radiation of modulated positron bunch formed in crystalline undulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A planar channeling of the positrons of a bunch taking into account medium polarization is considered, which entails it's radiation at both soft and hard photons at a zero angle. Spatially uniphase charged particles organized into a microbunch with a well-defined spatial phase distribution can emit coherent (synergistic or collective) radiation when the wavelength of the emitted radiation is comparable to or longer than the longitudinal size of the microbunch. This phenomenon can only occur in microundulators with account of the polarization. The crystalline undulator (CU) parameters (the spatial period and the amplitude) are chosen to preserve the channeling phenomenon of positrons and the coherence of CU radiation (CUR) from positron microbunches. The gain of spontaneous radiation hinges on the modulation depth of a microbunch. The latter, an important parameter of a bunch, will also be possible to determine as a result of the proposed experiment. A numerical analysis has been conducted for a specific scenario involving CUR generated by a positron bunch modulated during the SASE FEL process at the wavelength corresponding to the SASE FEL.</description>

      <title>Derivation and physical interpretation of the general solutions to the wave equations for electromagnetic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The inhomogeneous wave equations for the scalar, vector, and Hertz potentials are derived starting from retarded charge, current, and polarization densities and then solved in the reciprocal (or k-) space to obtain general solutions, which are formulated as nested integrals of such densities over the source volume, k-space, and time. The solutions thus obtained are inherently free of spatial singularities and do not require introduction by fiat of combinations of advanced and retarded terms as done previously to cure such singularities for the point-charge model. Physical implications of these general solutions are discussed in the context of specific examples involving either the real or reciprocal space forms of the different potentials. The present approach allows for k-space expansions of the potentials for arbitrary distributions of charges and may lead to applications in condensed matter and fluorescence-based imaging.</description>

      <title>Does light slowdown in dielectric media?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observations and theoretical principles suggest that electromagnetic waves, including light, travel more slowly in dielectric media than in vacuum. Maxwell's equations, incorporating material dependent permittivity and permeability, elegantly capture this effect. Previous studies indicate that the observed slower speed is due to interference effects, with the actual electromagnetic fields in the dielectric propagating at the speed of light in vacuum. However, these studies did not provide explicit expressions for the field components moving at this speed. The aim of the present study is to address this gap by analysing the structure of the electromagnetic field components within the dielectric. We examine how these components, each traveling at the speed of light in vacuum, interact to produce a net field that appears to propagate more slowly. Our findings show that the observed slower propagation in dielectric media results from interference between two types of waves: a forward moving incident wave and a set of secondary waves, moving both in the forward and backward directions, and induced by the interaction of the incident wave with the dielectric medium. Both the incident wave and the secondary waves travel at the speed of light in vacuum. Importantly, we observe that the reflected wave caused by the impedance discontinuity at the boundary of the dielectric medium arises from secondary waves moving in the direction opposite to the incident wave.</description>

      <title>Connecting Q to TCF for MEMS and piezoelectric resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09455v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two critical characteristics for any MEMS resonator are the quality factor ($Q$) and the temperature coefficient of frequency ($TCF$). The connection between $Q$ and $TCF$ is demonstrated here with a phenomenological anharmonic oscillator model. Specifically, it is shown that the same nonlinear terms responsible for the $TCF$ set an upper limit on the resonator's $Q$. A concise formula is found to estimate this loss and is shown to be closely related to Woodruff's formula for Akhiezer damping. The use of this formula is illustrated by extending the model to an important class of MEMS; piezoelectric resonators. Finally, the model is applied to published data for an AlN-on-diamond piezoelectric resonator. The focus here is on MEMS resonators, but the method should apply broadly to any resonance with non-zero $TCF$.</description>
