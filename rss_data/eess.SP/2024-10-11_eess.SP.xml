      <title>Dual Stream Graph Transformer Fusion Networks for Enhanced Brain Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the novel Dual Stream Graph-Transformer Fusion (DS-GTF) architecture designed specifically for classifying task-based Magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. In the spatial stream, inputs are initially represented as graphs, which are then passed through graph attention networks (GAT) to extract spatial patterns. Two methods, TopK and Thresholded Adjacency are introduced for initializing the adjacency matrix used in the GAT. In the temporal stream, the Transformer Encoder receives concatenated windowed input MEG data and learns new temporal representations. The learned temporal and spatial representations from both streams are fused before reaching the output layer. Experimental results demonstrate an enhancement in classification performance and a reduction in standard deviation across multiple test subjects compared to other examined models.</description>

      <title>Designing Pre-training Datasets from Unlabeled Data for EEG Classification with Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer neural networks require a large amount of labeled data to train effectively. Such data is often scarce in electroencephalography, as annotations made by medical experts are costly. This is why self-supervised training, using unlabeled data, has to be performed beforehand. In this paper, we present a way to design several labeled datasets from unlabeled electroencephalogram (EEG) data. These can then be used to pre-train transformers to learn representations of EEG signals. We tested this method on an epileptic seizure forecasting task on the Temple University Seizure Detection Corpus using a Multi-channel Vision Transformer. Our results suggest that 1) Models pre-trained using our approach demonstrate significantly faster training times, reducing fine-tuning duration by more than 50% for the specific task, and 2) Pre-trained models exhibit improved accuracy, with an increase from 90.93% to 92.16%, as well as a higher AUC, rising from 0.9648 to 0.9702 when compared to non-pre-trained models.</description>

      <title>EEGUnity: Open-Source Tool in Facilitating Unified EEG Datasets Towards Large-Scale EEG Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing number of dispersed EEG dataset publications and the advancement of large-scale Electroencephalogram (EEG) models have increased the demand for practical tools to manage diverse EEG datasets. However, the inherent complexity of EEG data, characterized by variability in content data, metadata, and data formats, poses challenges for integrating multiple datasets and conducting large-scale EEG model research. To tackle the challenges, this paper introduces EEGUnity, an open-source tool that incorporates modules of 'EEG Parser', 'Correction', 'Batch Processing', and 'Large Language Model Boost'. Leveraging the functionality of such modules, EEGUnity facilitates the efficient management of multiple EEG datasets, such as intelligent data structure inference, data cleaning, and data unification. In addition, the capabilities of EEGUnity ensure high data quality and consistency, providing a reliable foundation for large-scale EEG data research. EEGUnity is evaluated across 25 EEG datasets from different sources, offering several typical batch processing workflows. The results demonstrate the high performance and flexibility of EEGUnity in parsing and data processing. The project code is publicly available at github.com/Baizhige/EEGUnity.</description>

      <title>Towards Explainable Graph Neural Networks for Neurological Evaluation on EEG Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After an acute stroke, accurately estimating stroke severity is crucial for healthcare professionals to effectively manage patient's treatment. Graph theory methods have shown that brain connectivity undergoes frequency-dependent reorganization post-stroke, adapting to new conditions. Traditional methods often rely on handcrafted features that may not capture the complexities of clinical phenomena. In this study, we propose a novel approach using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to predict stroke severity, as measured by the NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS). We analyzed electroencephalography (EEG) recordings from 71 patients at the time of hospitalization. For each patient, we generated five graphs weighted by Lagged Linear Coherence (LLC) between signals from distinct Brodmann Areas, covering $\delta$ (2-4 Hz), $\theta$ (4-8 Hz), $\alpha_1$ (8-10.5 Hz), $\alpha_2$ (10.5-13 Hz), and $\beta_1$ (13-20 Hz) frequency bands. To emphasize key neurological connections and maintain sparsity, we applied a sparsification process based on structural and functional brain network properties. We then trained a graph attention model to predict the NIHSS. By examining its attention coefficients, our model reveals insights into brain reconfiguration, providing clinicians with a valuable tool for diagnosis, personalized treatment, and early intervention in neurorehabilitation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Batteryless IoT devices, powered by energy harvesting, face significant challenges in maintaining operational efficiency and reliability due to intermittent power availability. Traditional checkpointing mechanisms, while essential for preserving computational state, introduce considerable energy and time overheads. This paper introduces Approxify, an automated framework that significantly enhances the sustainability and performance of batteryless IoT networks by reducing energy consumption by approximately 40% through intelligent approximation techniques. \tool balances energy efficiency with computational accuracy, ensuring reliable operation without compromising essential functionalities.

      <title>RFBoost: Understanding and Boosting Deep WiFi Sensing via Physical Data Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning shows promising performance in wireless sensing. However, deep wireless sensing (DWS) heavily relies on large datasets. Unfortunately, building comprehensive datasets for DWS is difficult and costly, because wireless data depends on environmental factors and cannot be labeled offline. Despite recent advances in few-shot/cross-domain learning, DWS is still facing data scarcity issues. In this paper, we investigate a distinct perspective of radio data augmentation (RDA) for WiFi sensing and present a data-space solution. Our key insight is that wireless signals inherently exhibit data diversity, contributing more information to be extracted for DWS. We present RFBoost, a simple and effective RDA framework encompassing novel physical data augmentation techniques. We implement RFBoost as a plug-and-play module integrated with existing deep models and evaluate it on multiple datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that RFBoost achieves remarkable average accuracy improvements of 5.4% on existing models without additional data collection or model modifications, and the best-boosted performance outperforms 11 state-of-the-art baseline models without RDA. RFBoost pioneers the study of RDA, an important yet currently underexplored building block for DWS, which we expect to become a standard DWS component of WiFi sensing and beyond. RFBoost is released at https://github.com/aiot-lab/RFBoost.</description>

      <title>How Much Power Must We Extract From a Receiver Antenna to Effect Communications?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subject to the laws of classical physics - the science that governs the design of today's wireless communication systems - there is no need to extract power from a receiver antenna in order to effect communications. If we dispense with a transmission line and, instead, make the front-end electronics colocated with the antenna, then a high input-impedance preamplifier can measure the open-circuit voltage directly on the antenna port without drawing either current or power. Neither Friis' concept of noise figure, nor Shannon information theory, nor electronics technology dictates that we must extract power from an antenna.</description>

      <title>Generalizable Indoor Human Activity Recognition Method Based on Micro-Doppler Corner Point Cloud and Dynamic Graph Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Through-the-wall radar (TWR) human activity recognition can be achieved by fusing micro-Doppler signature extraction and intelligent decision-making algorithms. However, limited by the insufficient priori of tester in practical indoor scenarios, the trained models on one tester are commonly difficult to inference well on other testers, which causes poor generalization ability. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a generalizable indoor human activity recognition method based on micro-Doppler corner point cloud and dynamic graph learning. In the proposed method, DoG-{\mu}D-CornerDet is used for micro-Doppler corner extraction on two types of radar profiles. Then, a micro-Doppler corner filtering method based on polynomial fitting smoothing is proposed to maximize the feature distance under the constraints of the kinematic model. The extracted corners from the two types of radar profiles are concatenated together into three-dimensional point cloud. Finally, the paper proposes a dynamic graph neural network (DGNN)-based recognition method for data-to-activity label mapping. Visualization, comparison and ablation experiments are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results prove that the proposed method has strong generalization ability on radar data collected from different testers.</description>

      <title>Generalization Ability Analysis of Through-the-Wall Radar Human Activity Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Through-the-Wall radar (TWR) human activity recognition (HAR) is a technology that uses low-frequency ultra-wideband (UWB) signal to detect and analyze indoor human motion. However, the high dependence of existing end-to-end recognition models on the distribution of TWR training data makes it difficult to achieve good generalization across different indoor testers. In this regard, the generalization ability of TWR HAR is analyzed in this paper. In detail, an end-to-end linear neural network method for TWR HAR and its generalization error bound are first discussed. Second, a micro-Doppler corner representation method and the change of the generalization error before and after dimension reduction are presented. The appropriateness of the theoretical generalization errors is proved through numerical simulations and experiments. The results demonstrate that feature dimension reduction is effective in allowing recognition models to generalize across different indoor testers.</description>

      <title>Robustness and Security Enhancement of Radio Frequency Fingerprint Identification in Time-Varying Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio frequency fingerprint identification (RFFI) is becoming increasingly popular, especially in applications with constrained power, such as the Internet of Things (IoT). Due to subtle manufacturing variations, wireless devices have unique radio frequency fingerprints (RFFs). These RFFs can be used with pattern recognition algorithms to classify wireless devices. However, Implementing reliable RFFI in time-varying channels is challenging because RFFs are often distorted by channel effects, reducing the classification accuracy. This paper introduces a new channel-robust RFF, and leverages transfer learning to enhance RFFI in the time-varying channels. Experimental results show that the proposed RFFI system achieved an average classification accuracy improvement of 33.3 % in indoor environments and 34.5 % in outdoor environments. This paper also analyzes the security of the proposed RFFI system to address the security flaw in formalized impersonation attacks. Since RFF collection is being carried out in uncontrolled deployment environments, RFFI systems can be targeted with false RFFs sent by rogue devices. The resulting classifiers may classify the rogue devices as legitimate, effectively replacing their true identities. To defend against impersonation attacks, a novel keyless countermeasure is proposed, which exploits the intrinsic output of the softmax function after classifier training without sacrificing the lightweight nature of RFFI. Experimental results demonstrate an average increase of 0.3 in the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), with a 40.0 % improvement in attack detection rate in indoor and outdoor environments.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Hopping for Bluetooth Backscatter using Commodity Edges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel hopping is essential to BLE backscatter as commodity BLE switches channels frequently during transmission to overcome interferences in busy radio environments. Existing Bluetooth backscatter systems, however, suffer from slow responses to excitation change and poor control of the target channel. To address these issues, this paper presents ChannelDance, a BLE backscatter system that utilizes a low-latency edge server to achieve fast and accurate hopping. Specifically, we show that the backscattered channel relies on the excitation channel and tag toggling frequency. By identifying excitation frequency, the tag can achieve accurate hopping with a dynamically configured clock. Further, we introduce a low-latency architecture, which is centralized, asynchronous, and equipped with high-speed interfaces. This architecture supports the tag to respond to excitation changes fastly. We prototype the ChannelDance tag with FPGA and build the low latency edge server with commodity MCU and off-the-shelf BLE and WiFi radios. Experimental results show that ChannelDance can realize 40 to 40 channel mapping with a median success rate of 93% and achieve 3.5x goodput gain with channel optimization. Moreover, with adaptive hopping, the ChannelDance tag successfully establishes a connection with commodity BLE.</description>

      <title>Unique Word-Based Frame Design for Bistatic Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) aims at enhancing the network functionalities and enabling new applications in the upcoming communications networks. In this paper, we propose two unique word (UW)-based frame designs for bistatic ISAC. The approach consists of replacing the cyclic prefix (CP) with a Zadoff-Chu (ZC)-based sequence. With this approach, the radar receiver does not need to know the data symbols to perform sensing and the data rate is not compromised by the addition of extra pilots. The sensing performance of the UW-based frames is compared with that of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) as well as the pilot-symbol (PS) based radar processing. We derive the Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) considering a band-limited system with raised-cosine filtering. Furthermore, we provide low-complexity fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based radar receivers that perform integer and fine grid multi-target delay-Doppler (DD) estimations. For the integer FFT-based receiver, an upper bound for the outlier probability is derived when the true DD falls outside the integer grid. The results demonstrate that the UW frames exhibit competitive radar performance with PS while having a 16.67% higher data rate for the cases investigated.</description>

      <title>A Visual Cooperative Localization Method for Airborne Magnetic Surveying Based on a Manifold Sensor Fusion Algorithm Using Lie Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in UAV technology have spurred interest in developing multi-UAV aerial surveying systems for use in confined environments where GNSS signals are blocked or jammed. This paper focuses airborne magnetic surveying scenarios. To obtain clean magnetic measurements reflecting the Earth's magnetic field, the magnetic sensor must be isolated from other electronic devices, creating a significant localization challenge. We propose a visual cooperative localization solution. The solution incorporates a visual processing module and an improved manifold-based sensor fusion algorithm, delivering reliable and accurate positioning information. Real flight experiments validate the approach, demonstrating single-axis centimeter-level accuracy and decimeter-level overall 3D positioning accuracy.</description>

      <title>Bending beams for 6G near-field communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future wireless connectivity is envisioned to accommodate functionalities far beyond broadband data transmission over point-to-point direct links, enabling novel scenarios, such as communication behind blockers and around corners, and innovative concepts, such as situational awareness, localization and joint communications and sensing. In this landscape, beams that are able to propagate on bent paths are ideal candidates for dynamic blockage avoidance, interference management in selected regions, and user connectivity on curved trajectories. In this work, we study beam shaping for applications in near-field wireless connectivity. We explain the underlying mechanism of beam bending and we present the design principles for tailoring the curvature of the propagation trajectory. We discuss design aspects for generation of such beams with large arrays and analyze the impact of several parameters on their performance, including the beam's footprint shape, the aperture size, the inter-element spacing, the sub-array selection of active elements, the available phase levels of the array elements and the operating frequency. We introduce the concept of near-field virtual routing (NFVR) and we demonstrate that such beams are able to address challenges of high frequency communications, such as dynamic routing, blockage avoidance and energy-efficiency, more efficiently than conventional beamforming.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates how semantic communication can effectively influence and potentially redefine the limitations imposed by physical layer settings. Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) enable the intelligent configuration of the physical layer of communication systems. However, its practical implementation is hampered by several limitations. The Semantic Communication (SemCom) paradigm introduces additional degrees of freedom that can be exploited to improve the robustness of communication against physical layer impairments. In essence, SemCom ensures that the data representation remains robust even under adverse physical conditions by emphasizing the transmission of meaningful information in a manner that is less susceptible to degradation. Through the use of SemCom, potential RIS gains are demonstrated in terms of RIS area size and the phase shift precision of its active elements.</description>

      <title>MEMS Gyroscope Multi-Feature Calibration Using Machine Learning Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gyroscopes are crucial for accurate angular velocity measurements in navigation, stabilization, and control systems. MEMS gyroscopes offer advantages like compact size and low cost but suffer from errors and inaccuracies that are complex and time varying. This study leverages machine learning (ML) and uses multiple signals of the MEMS resonator gyroscope to improve its calibration. XGBoost, known for its high predictive accuracy and ability to handle complex, non-linear relationships, and MLP, recognized for its capability to model intricate patterns through multiple layers and hidden dimensions, are employed to enhance the calibration process. Our findings show that both XGBoost and MLP models significantly reduce noise and enhance accuracy and stability, outperforming the traditional calibration techniques. Despite higher computational costs, DL models are ideal for high-stakes applications, while ML models are efficient for consumer electronics and environmental monitoring. Both ML and DL models demonstrate the potential of advanced calibration techniques in enhancing MEMS gyroscope performance and calibration efficiency.</description>

      <title>Edge-guided inverse design of digital metamaterials for ultra-high-capacity on-chip multi-dimensional interconnect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The escalating demands of compute-intensive applications, including artificial intelligence, urgently necessitate the adoption of sophisticated optical on-chip interconnect technologies to overcome critical bottlenecks in scaling future computing systems. This transition requires leveraging the inherent parallelism of wavelength and mode dimensions of light, complemented by high-order modulation formats, to significantly enhance data throughput. Here we experimentally demonstrate a novel synergy of these three dimensions, achieving multi-tens-of-terabits-per-second on-chip interconnects using ultra-broadband, multi-mode digital metamaterials. Employing a highly efficient edge-guided analog-and-digital optimization method, we inversely design foundry-compatible, robust, and multi-port digital metamaterials with an 8xhigher computational efficiency. Using a packaged five-mode multiplexing chip, we demonstrate a single-wavelength interconnect capacity of 1.62 Tbit s-1 and a record-setting multi-dimensional interconnect capacity of 38.2 Tbit s-1 across 5 modes and 88 wavelength channels. A theoretical analysis suggests that further system optimization can enable on-chip interconnects to reach sub-petabit-per-second data transmission rates. This study highlights the transformative potential of optical interconnect technologies to surmount the constraints of electronic links, thus setting the stage for next-generation datacenter and optical compute interconnects.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Nonnegative Matrix Factorization with the Kullback-Leibler divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Orthogonal nonnegative matrix factorization (ONMF) has become a standard approach for clustering. As far as we know, most works on ONMF rely on the Frobenius norm to assess the quality of the approximation. This paper presents a new model and algorithm for ONMF that minimizes the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. As opposed to the Frobenius norm which assumes Gaussian noise, the KL divergence is the maximum likelihood estimator for Poisson-distributed data, which can model better vectors of word counts in document data sets and photo counting processes in imaging. We have developed an algorithm based on alternating optimization, KL-ONMF, and show that it performs favorably with the Frobenius-norm based ONMF for document classification and hyperspectral image unmixing.</description>

      <title>Robust Fixed-Filter Sound Zone Control with Audio-Based Position Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Performance of sound zone control (SZC) systems deployed in practical scenarios are highly sensitive to the location of the listener(s) and can degrade significantly when listener(s) are moving. This paper presents a robust SZC system that adapts to dynamic changes such as moving listeners and varying zone locations using a dictionary-based approach. The proposed system continuously monitors the environment and updates the fixed control filters by tracking the listener position using audio signals only. To test the effectiveness of the proposed SZC method, simulation studies are carried out using practically measured impulse responses. These studies show that SZC, when incorporated with the proposed audio-only position tracking scheme, achieves optimal performance when all listener positions are available in the dictionary. Moreover, even when not all listener positions are included in the dictionary, the method still provides good performance improvement compared to a traditional fixed filter SZC scheme.</description>

      <title>CoSS: Co-optimizing Sensor and Sampling Rate for Data-Efficient AI in Human Activity Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Artificial Neural Networks have significantly improved human activity recognition using multiple time-series sensors. While employing numerous sensors with high-frequency sampling rates usually improves the results, it often leads to data inefficiency and unnecessary expansion of the ANN, posing a challenge for their practical deployment on edge devices. Addressing these issues, our work introduces a pragmatic framework for data-efficient utilization in HAR tasks, considering the optimization of both sensor modalities and sampling rate simultaneously. Central to our approach are the designed trainable parameters, termed 'Weight Scores,' which assess the significance of each sensor modality and sampling rate during the training phase. These scores guide the sensor modalities and sampling rate selection. The pruning method allows users to make a trade-off between computational budgets and performance by selecting the sensor modalities and sampling rates according to the weight score ranking. We tested our framework's effectiveness in optimizing sensor modality and sampling rate selection using three public HAR benchmark datasets. The results show that the sensor and sampling rate combination selected via CoSS achieves similar classification performance to configurations using the highest sampling rate with all sensors but at a reduced hardware cost.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Models for Conditioning Extremely Noisy Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a comparison of several Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models for extracting target signals in highly noisy measurement conditions. Four CNN architectures were investigated. The first comprises six consecutive convolutional blocks while the second employs a U-Net structure. The third architecture introduces a new model inspired by the principles of wavelet transform. It consists of three CNN blocks with varied kernel sizes branching from the input layer before merging into consecutive concatenation and dense layers. The fourth is a Multilevel Wavelet Convolutional Neural Network (MWCNN), resembling U-net but the upsampling and downsampling are replaced by Discrete Wavelet transform and its inverse respectively. To evaluate these architectures, synthetic data were generated using pulse trains corrupted with various degrees of Gaussian noise to simulate measurement conditions with signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) as low as -20 dB. The methodology encompassed the generation and processing of signals with varied parameters: period (5-25 ms), duty cycle (0.1-0.5), and amplitude (1-150 mV). Subsequently, the machine learning models were trained, validated and tested. Finally, the output is processed to recover the signal amplitude before standardisation. The modified MWCNN model demonstrated superior performance achieving a median of 25.9 dB with a mean Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) that decreases with the amplitude of the signal reaching an average RMSE of 0.000128 mV for 1 mV signals. However, for this architecture, the output SNR drops by a factor of 1.23 when the input SNR decreases by 1 dB. All of the architectures exhibited consistency when testing output SNR for different signal amplitudes, periods and duty cycles. These findings indicate that CNN architectures can be used to denoise signals with SNR as low as -20 dB[...]</description>

      <title>Radio Map-assisted CSI Tracking with Uncertain Locations in Massive MIMO Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems offer significant potential to enhance wireless communication performance, yet efficient and accurate channel state information (CSI) tracking remains a key challenge, particularly in dynamic urban settings. To address this, we propose a radio mapassisted framework for CSI tracking and trajectory discovery, relying on sparse channel observations. The radio map is redefined as a mapping from spatial positions to deterministic channel covariance matrices, which captures the complex and time-varying characteristics of urban wireless environments. Leveraging these covariance maps, we develop a CSI tracking method that enables accurate estimation using only single-dimensional observations collected during user movement. Furthermore, we present an efficient algorithm that constructs and continuously refines the radio map through sequential sparse observations, even when location labels are uncertain. Numerical results based on real city maps and ray-tracing MIMO channel datasets show that the proposed framework significantly outperforms baseline methods in both accuracy and adaptability.</description>

      <title>On the Fundamental Tradeoff of Joint Communication and Quickest Change Detection with State-Independent Data Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we take the initiative in studying the information-theoretic tradeoff between communication and quickest change detection (QCD) under an integrated sensing and communication setting. We formally establish a joint communication and sensing problem for the quickest change detection. We assume a broadcast channel with a transmitter, a communication receiver, and a QCD detector in which only the detection channel is state dependent. For the problem setting, by utilizing constant subblock-composition codes and a modified CuSum detection rule, which we call subblock CuSum (SCS), we provide an inner bound on the information-theoretic tradeoff between communication rate and change point detection delay in the asymptotic regime of vanishing false alarm rate. We further provide a partial converse that matches our inner bound for a certain class of codes. This implies that the SCS detection strategy is asymptotically optimal for our codes as the false alarm rate constraint vanishes. We also present some canonical examples of the tradeoff region for a binary channel, a scalar Gaussian channel, and a MIMO Gaussian channel.</description>

Abstract: We introduce and characterize the operational diversity order (ODO) in fading channels, as a proxy to the classical notion of diversity order at any arbitrary operational signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Thanks to this definition, relevant insights are brought up in a number of cases: (i) We quantify that in dominant line-of-sight scenarios an increased diversity order is attainable compared to that achieved asymptotically, even in the single-antenna case; (ii) this effect is attenuated, but still visible, in the presence of an additional dominant specular component; (iii) the decay slope in Rayleigh product channels increases very slowly, never fully achieving unitary slope for a finite SNR.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous MIMO-OFDM Massive Unsourced Random Access with Codeword Collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates asynchronous multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) massive unsourced random access (URA) in an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system over frequency-selective fading channels, with the presence of both timing and carrier frequency offsets (TO and CFO) and non-negligible codeword collisions. The proposed coding framework segregates the data into two components, namely, preamble and coding parts, with the former being tree-coded and the latter LDPC-coded. By leveraging the dual sparsity of the equivalent channel across both codeword and delay domains (CD and DD), we develop a message-passing-based sparse Bayesian learning algorithm, combined with belief propagation and mean field, to iteratively estimate DD channel responses, TO, and delay profiles. Furthermore, by jointly leveraging the observations among multiple slots, we establish a novel graph-based algorithm to iteratively separate the superimposed channels and compensate for the phase rotations. Additionally, the proposed algorithm is applied to the flat fading scenario to estimate both TO and CFO, where the channel and offset estimation is enhanced by leveraging the geometric characteristics of the signal constellation. Extensive simulations reveal that the proposed algorithm achieves superior performance and substantial complexity reduction in both channel and offset estimation compared to the codebook enlarging-based counterparts, and enhanced data recovery performances compared to state-of-the-art URA schemes.</description>

      <title>Optimal Sensing Policy With Interference-Model Uncertainty</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06280v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers a half-duplex scenario where an interferer behaves according to a parametric model but the values of the model parameters are unknown. We explore the necessary number of sensing steps to gather sufficient knowledge about the interferer's behavior. With more sensing steps, the reliability of the model-parameter estimates is improved, thereby enabling more effective link adaptation. However, in each time slot, the communication system experiencing interference must choose between sensing and communication. Thus, we propose to investigate the optimal policy for maximizing the expected sum communication data rate over a finite-time communication. This approach contrasts with most studies on interference management in the literature, which assume that the parameters of the interference model are perfectly known. We begin by showing that the problem under consideration can be modeled within the framework of a Markov decision process (MDP). Following this, we demonstrate that both the optimal open-loop and optimal closed-loop policies can be determined with reduced computational complexity compared to the standard backward-induction algorithm.</description>

      <title>Group Movable Antenna With Flexible Sparsity: Joint Array Position and Sparsity Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) is a promising technology to exploit the spatial variation of wireless channel for performance enhancement, by dynamically varying the antenna position within a certain region. However, for multi-antenna communication systems, moving each antenna independently not only requires prohibitive complexity to find the optimal antenna positions, but also incurs sophisticated movement control in practice. To address this issue, this letter proposes a new MA architecture termed group MA (GMA), enabling the group movement of all elements collectively in a continuous manner, and simultaneously achieving flexible array architecture by antenna selection (AS). In this letter, we focus on the uniform sparse array based GMA, where equally spaced antenna elements are selected to achieve desired array sparsity. The array position and sparsity level are jointly optimized to maximize the sum rate of the multi-user communication system. Numerical results verify the necessity to optimize the position and sparsity of GMA, and considerable performance gain is achieved as compared to the conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA).</description>

      <title>Generalizing Deep Learning-Based CSI Feedback in Massive MIMO via ID-Photo-Inspired Preprocessing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13494v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL)-based channel state information (CSI) feedback has shown great potential in improving spectrum efficiency in massive MIMO systems. However, DL models optimized for specific environments often experience performance degradation in others due to model mismatch. To overcome this barrier in the practical deployment, we propose UniversalNet, an ID-photo-inspired universal CSI feedback framework that enhances model generalizability by standardizing the input format across diverse data distributions. Specifically, UniversalNet employs a standardized input format to mitigate the influence of environmental variability, coupled with a lightweight sparsity-aligning operation in the transformed sparse domain and marginal control bits for original format recovery. This enables seamless integration with existing CSI feedback models, requiring minimal modifications in preprocessing and postprocessing without updating neural network weights. Furthermore, we propose an efficient eigenvector joint optimization method to enhance the sparsity of the precoding matrix by projecting the channel correlation into the eigenspace, thus improving the implicit CSI compression efficiency. Test results demonstrate that UniversalNet effectively improves generalization performance and ensures precise CSI feedback, even in scenarios with limited training diversity and previously unseen CSI environments.</description>

Abstract: This paper explores the growing need for task-oriented communications in warehouse logistics, where traditional communication Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)-such as latency, reliability, and throughput-often do not fully meet task requirements. As the complexity of data flow management in large-scale device networks increases, there is also a pressing need for innovative cross-system designs that balance data compression, communication, and computation. To address these challenges, we propose a task-oriented, edge-assisted framework for cooperative data compression, communication, and computing in Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV)-enhanced warehouse logistics. In this framework, two UGVs collaborate to transport cargo, with control functions-navigation for the front UGV and following/conveyance for the rear UGV-offloaded to the edge server to accommodate their limited on-board computing resources. We develop a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based two-stage point cloud data compression algorithm that dynamically and collaboratively adjusts compression ratios according to task requirements, significantly reducing communication overhead. System-level simulations of our UGV logistics prototype demonstrate the framework's effectiveness and its potential for swift real-world implementation.</description>
