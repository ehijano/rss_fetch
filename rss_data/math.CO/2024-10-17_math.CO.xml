      <title>The stable maximum nullity of digraphs and $1$-DAGs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a digraph $D=(V,A)$ with vertex-set $V=\{1,\ldots,n\}$ and arc-set $A$, we denote by $Q(D)$ the set of all real $n\times n$ matrices $B=[b_{u,w}]$ with $b_{u,u}\not=0$ for all $u\in V$, $b_{u,w} \not= 0$ if $u\not=w$ and there is an arc from $u$ to $w$, and
  $b_{u,w}=0$ if $u\not=w$ and there is no arc from $u$ to $w$. We say that a matrix $B\in Q(D)$ has the Asymmetric Strong Arnold Property (ASAP) if $X\circ B = 0$, $X^T B = 0$, and $B X^T = 0$ implies $X=0$. We define
  the stable maximum nullity, $\overrightarrow{\nu}(D)$, of a digraph $D$ as the largest nullity of any matrix $A\in Q(D)$ that has the ASAP\@. We show that a digraph $D$ has $\overrightarrow{\nu}(D)\leq 1$ if and only $D$ and $\overleftarrow{D}$ a partial $1$-DAGs.</description>

      <title>Relative position in binary substitutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an infinite word ${\bf w}$ on a finite alphabet, an immediate question arises:~can we understand the frequency of letters in ${\bf w}$\,? For words that are the fixed points of substitutions, the answer to this question is often `yes' -- the details and methods of these answers have been well-documented. In this paper, toward a better-understanding of the fixed points of binary substitutions, we delve deeper by investigating, in fine detail, the position of letters by defining various position functions and proving results about their behavior. Our analysis reveals new information about the Fibonacci substitution and the extended Pisa family of substitutions, as well as a new characterization of the Thue--Morse sequence.</description>

      <title>Rainbow Combinatorial Lines in Hypercubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12192v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is about the rainbow dual of the Hales Jewett number, providing general bounds an anti-Hales Jewett Number for hypercubes of length k and dimension n denoted $ah(k, n).$ The best general bounds this paper provides are: $(k-1)^n &lt; ah(k, n) \leq \frac{(k-1)^2-2}{k-1}\cdot k^{n-1}+\frac{k+1}{k-1}.$ This paper also includes proofs about the specific cases of $k = 2$ and $k = 3$, where we show that $ah(2, n) = 2$ and $2^n &lt; ah(3, n) \leq 3^{n-1} - 2\cdot3^{n-4} + 2$ for all natural numbers n $&gt;$ 4. For $n &lt; 4$, we have found the exact values: $ah(3, 1) = 3$, $ah(3, 2) = 5$, and $ah(3, 3) = 11$. In the case $n = 4$, we have found that $23 &lt; ah(3, 4) \leq 27$.</description>

      <title>A geometric realization of the chromatic symmetric function of a unit interval graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12231v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shareshian-Wachs, Brosnan-Chow, and Guay-Pacquet [Adv. Math. ${\bf 295}$ (2016), ${\bf 329}$ (2018), arXiv:1601.05498] realized the chromatic (quasi-)symmetric function of a unit interval graph in terms of Hessenberg varieties. Here we exhibit another realization of these chromatic (quasi-)symmetric functions in terms of the Betti cohomology of the variety $\mathscr X_\Psi$ defined in [arXiv:2301.00862]. This yields a new inductive combinatorial expression of these chromatic symmetric functions. Based on this, we propose a geometric refinement of the Stanley-Stembridge conjecture, whose validity would imply the Shareshian-Wachs conjecture.</description>

      <title>On generalized Tur\'an problems with bounded matching number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generalized Tur\'an number $\mathrm{ex}(n, H, \mathcal{F})$ is defined as the maximum number of copies of a graph $H$ in an $n$-vertex graph that does not contain any graph $F \in \mathcal{F}$. Alon and Frankl initiated the study of Tur\'an problems with a bounded matching number.In this paper, we establish stability results for generalized Tur\'an problems with bounded matching number.Using the stability results, we provide exact values of $\ex(n,K_r,\{F,M_{s+1}\})$ for $F$ being any non-bipartite graph or a path on $k$ vertices.</description>

      <title>The geometry of covering codes in the sum-rank metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of a sum-rank saturating system and outline its correspondence to a covering properties of a sum-rank metric code. We consider the problem of determining the shortest sum-rank-$\rho$-saturating systems of a fixed dimension, which is equivalent to the covering problem in the sum-rank metric. We obtain upper and lower bounds on this quantity. We also give constructions of saturating systems arising from geometrical structures.</description>

      <title>$B$-Stirling numbers associated to potential polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the $B$-Stirling numbers of the first and second kind, which are the coefficients of the potential polynomials when we express them in terms of the monomials and the falling factorials, respectively. These numbers include, as particular cases, the partial and complete Bell polynomials, the degenerate and probabilistic Stirling numbers, and the $S$-restricted Stirling numbers, among others. Special attention is devoted to the computation of such numbers. On the one hand, a recursive formula is provided. On the other, we can compute Stirling numbers of one kind in terms of the other, with the help of the classical Stirling numbers.</description>

      <title>Arc-disjoint in- and out-branchings in semicomplete split digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An \emph{out-tree (in-tree)} is an oriented tree where every vertex except one, called the \emph{root}, has in-degree (out-degree) one. An \emph{out-branching $B^+_u$ (in-branching $B^-_u$)} of a digraph $D$ is a spanning out-tree (in-tree) rooted at $u$. A \emph{good $(u,v)$-pair} in $D$ is a pair of branchings $B^+_u, B^-_v$ which are arc-disjoint. Thomassen proved that deciding whether a digraph has any good pair is NP-complete. A \emph{semicomplete split digraph} is a digraph where the vertex set is the disjoint union of two non-empty sets, $V_1$ and $V_2$, such that $V_1$ is an independent set, the subdigraph induced by $V_2$ is semicomplete, and every vertex in $V_1$ is adjacent to every vertex in $V_2$. In this paper, we prove that every $2$-arc-strong semicomplete split digraph $D$ contains a good $(u, v)$-pair for any choice of vertices $u, v$ of $D$, thereby confirming a conjecture by Bang-Jensen and Wang [Bang-Jensen and Wang, J. Graph Theory, 2024].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize folding patterns, the combinatorial options of folding minimal alcove-to-alcove galleries in affine Coxeter complexes positively with respect to Weyl chamber orientations of the Coxeter complex, by drawing a connection to the Bruhat moment graph of the associated spherical Coxeter group. We also prove how to determine the spherical direction of the end alcove of a positively folded gallery using these graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The palindromic length of the finite word $v$ is equal to the minimal number of palindromes whose concatenation is equal to $v$. It was conjectured in 2013 that for every aperiodic infinite word $x$, the palindromic length of its factors is not bounded. We prove this conjecture to be true.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce new classes of infinite and combinatorially periodic tensegrities, derived from algebraic multidimensional continued fractions in the sense of F. Klein. We describe the stress coefficients on edges through integer invariants of these continued fractions, as initiated by V.I. Arnold, thereby creating a novel connection between geometric rigidity theory and the geometry of continued fractions. Remarkably, the new classes of tensegrities possess rational self-stress coefficients. To establish the self-stressability of the frameworks, we present a projective version of the classical Maxwell-Cremona lifting principle, a result of independent interest.</description>

      <title>On The Application Of State Sum Decomposition method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we apply the state sum decomposition method to derive a closed formula for the enumeration of perfect matching of $T_{a}$. This problem, originally proposed by Ciucu and Krattenthaler in 2002, has remained unsolved. We introduce the concept of "$Fibonacci-Coloring$" for planer graphs and derive a summation formula of $M(T_{a})$ in terms of powers of $2$. This formula is reminiscent to the celebrated Aztec Diamond Theorem of Elkies, Kuperberg, Larsen, and Propp, which concerns domino tiling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the cyclotomic identity we compute sums over d-tuples of monic polynomials in F_q[x] weighted by the multiplicity of their irreducible factors. As consequences we determine explicit expressions for the number of d-tuples of polynomials such that their greatest common divisor is rth power free. We also compute the number of monic polynomials where the multiplicity of each irreducible factor belongs to the monoid generated by two relatively prime integers.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the exceptional set in the $abc$ conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study solutions to the equation $a+b=c$, where $a,b,c$ form a triple of coprime natural numbers. The $abc$ conjecture asserts that, for any $\epsilon&gt;0$, such triples satisfy $\mathrm{rad}(abc) \ge c^{1-\epsilon}$ with finitely many exceptions. In this article we obtain a power-saving bound on the exceptional set of triples. Specifically, we show that there are $O(X^{33/50})$ integer triples $(a,b,c)\in [1,X]^3$, which satisfy $\mathrm{rad}(abc) &lt; c^{1-\epsilon}$. The proof is based on a combination of bounds for the density of integer points on varieties, coming from the determinant method, Thue equations, geometry of numbers, and Fourier analysis.</description>

      <title>Stability properties for subgroups generated by return words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Return words are a classical tool for studying shift spaces with low factor complexity. In recent years, their projection inside groups have attracted some attention, for instance in the context of dendric shift spaces, of generation of pseudorandom numbers (through the welldoc property), and of profinite invariants of shift spaces. Aiming at unifying disparate works, we introduce a notion of stability for subgroups generated by return words. Within this framework, we revisit several existing results and generalize some of them. We also study general aspects of stability, such as decidability or closure under certain operations.</description>

      <title>Quasi-linear distance query reconstruction for graphs of bounded treelength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In distance query reconstruction, we wish to reconstruct the edge set of a hidden graph by asking as few distance queries as possible to an oracle. Given two vertices $u$ and $v$, the oracle returns the shortest path distance between $u$ and $v$ in the graph.
  The length of a tree decomposition is the maximum distance between two vertices contained in the same bag. The treelength of a graph is defined as the minimum length of a tree decomposition of this graph. We present an algorithm to reconstruct an $n$-vertex connected graph $G$ parameterized by maximum degree $\Delta$ and treelength $k$ in $O_{k,\Delta}(n \log^2 n)$ queries (in expectation). This is the first algorithm to achieve quasi-linear complexity for this class of graphs. The proof goes through a new lemma that could give independent insight on graphs of bounded treelength.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2111.05799v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dimension of a bipartition matrix (BPM) is the sum of the dimensions of its indecomposable factors. The dimension of an indecomposable BPM is the sum of its row, column, and entry dimensions. To compute these dimensions, we apply four routines of independent interest: (1) Factor a bipartition as a product of indecomposables; (2) recover a bipartition from its indecomposable factorization; (3) factor a BPM as a product of indecomposables; and (4) compute the ``transpose-rotation'' (the column dimension of a BPM is the row dimension of its transpose-rotation).</description>

      <title>Topology of matching complexes of complete graphs via discrete Morse theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.02973v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bouc (1992) first studied the topological properties of $M_n$, the matching complex of the complete graph of order $n$, in connection with Brown complexes and Quillen complexes. Bj\"{o}rner et al. (1994) showed that $M_n$ is homotopically $(\nu_n-1)$-connected, where $\nu_n=\lfloor{\frac{n+1}{3}}\rfloor-1$, and conjectured that this connectivity bound is sharp. Shareshian and Wachs (2007) settled the conjecture by inductively showing that the $\nu_n$-dimensional homology group of $M_n$ is nontrivial, with Bouc's calculation of $H_1(M_7)$ serving as the pivotal base step. In general, the topology of $M_n$ is not very well-understood, even for a small $n$. In the present article, we look into the topology of $M_n$, and $M_7$ in particular, in the light of discrete Morse theory as developed by Forman (1998). We first construct a gradient vector field on $M_n$ (for $n \ge 5$) that doesn't admit any critical simplices of dimension up to $\nu_n-1$, except one unavoidable $0$-simplex, which also leads to the aforementioned $(\nu_n-1)$-connectedness of $M_n$ in a purely combinatorial way. However, for an efficient homology computation by discrete Morse theoretic techniques, we are required to work with a gradient vector field that admits a low number of critical simplices, and also allows an efficient enumeration of gradient paths. An optimal gradient vector field is one with the least number of critical simplices, but the problem of finding an optimal gradient vector field, in general, is an NP-hard problem (even for $2$-dimensional complexes). We improve the gradient vector field constructed on $M_7$ in particular to a much more efficient (near-optimal) one, and then with the help of this improved gradient vector field, compute the homology groups of $M_7$ in an efficient and algorithmic manner. We also augment this near-optimal gradient vector field to one that we conjecture to be optimal.</description>

Abstract: In 2011, Duncan and Steingr\'imsson conjectured that modified ascent sequences avoiding any of the patterns 212, 1212, 2132, 2213, 2231 and 2321 are counted by the Bell numbers. Furthermore, the distribution of the number of ascents is the reverse of the distribution of blocks on set partitions. We solve the conjecture for all the patterns except 2321. We describe the corresponding sets of Fishburn permutations by pattern avoidance, and leave some open questions for future work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.07095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A subset of the vertex set of a graph is geodetically convex if it contains every vertex on any shortest path between two elements of the set. The convex hull of a set of vertices is the smallest convex set containing the set. We study variations of two games introduced by Buckley and Harary, where two players take turns selecting previously-unselected vertices of a graph until the convex hull of the jointly-selected vertices becomes too large. The last player to move is the winner. The achievement game ends when the convex hull contains every vertex. In the avoidance game, the convex hull is not allowed to contain every vertex. We determine the nim-value of these games for several graph families.</description>

      <title>Resolving Sets in Temporal Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A resolving set $R$ in a graph $G$ is a set of vertices such that every vertex of $G$ is uniquely identified by its distances to the vertices of $R$. Introduced in the 1970s, this concept has been since then extensively studied from both combinatorial and algorithmic points of view. We propose a generalization of the concept of resolving sets to temporal graphs,i.e., graphs with edge sets that change over discrete time-steps. In this setting, the temporal distance from $u$ to $v$ is the earliest possible time-step at which a journey with strictly increasing time-steps on edges leaving $u$ reaches $v$, i.e., the first time-step at which $v$ could receive a message broadcast from $u$. A temporal resolving set of a temporal graph $\mathcal{G}$ is a subset $R$ of its vertices such that every vertex of $\mathcal{G}$ is uniquely identified by its temporal distances from vertices of $R$.
  We study the problem of finding a minimum-size temporal resolving set, and show that it is NP-complete even on very restricted graph classes and with strong constraints on the time-steps: temporal complete graphs where every edge appears in either time-step~1 or~2, temporal trees where every edge appears in at most two consecutive time-steps, and even temporal subdivided stars where every edge appears in at most two (not necessarily consecutive) time-steps. On the other hand, we give polynomial-time algorithms for temporal paths and temporal stars where every edge appears in exactly one time-step, and give a combinatorial analysis and algorithms for several temporal graph classes where the edges appear in periodic time-steps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10750v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that if $D$ is an $n$-vertex digraph with more than $(k-1)n$ arcs that does not contain any of three forbidden digraphs, then $D$ contains every antidirected tree on $k$ arcs. The forbidden digraphs are those orientations of $K_{2, \lceil k/12\rceil}$ where each of the vertices in the class of size two has either out-degree $0$ or in-degree $0$. This proves a conjecture of Addario-Berry et al. for a broad class of digraphs, and generalises a result for $K_{2, \lfloor k/12\rfloor}$-free graphs by Balasubramanian and Dobson.
  We also show that every digraph $D$ on $n$ vertices with more than $(k-1)n$ arcs contains every antidirected $k$-arc caterpillar, thus solving the above conjecture for caterpillars. This generalises a result of Perles.</description>

      <title>Parallel chip-firing games on directed graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1992, Bitar and Goles introduced the parallel chip-firing game on undirected graphs. Two years later, Prisner extended the game to directed graphs. While the properties of parallel chip-firing games on undirected graphs have been extensively studied, their analogs for parallel chip-firing games on directed graphs have been sporadic. In this paper, we prove the outstanding analogs of the core results of parallel chip-firing games on undirected graphs for those on directed graphs. We find the possible periods of a parallel chip-firing game on a directed simple cycle and introduce the method of Gauss-Jordan elimination on a Laplacian-like matrix to establish a lower bound on the maximum period of a parallel chip-firing game on a directed complete graph and a directed complete bipartite graph. Finally, we expand the method of motors by Jiang, Scully, and Zhang to directed graphs to show that a binary string $s$ can be the atomic firing sequence of a vertex in a parallel chip-firing game on a strongly connected directed graph if and only if $s$ contains $1$ or $s=0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let e_k(x_1,...,x_l) be an elementary symmetric polynomial and let mu = (mu_1,...,mu_l) be an integer partition. Define pre_k(mu) to be the partition whose parts are the summands in the evaluation e_k(mu_1,...,mu_l). The study of such partitions was initiated by Ballantine, Beck, and Merca who showed (among other things) that pre_2 is injective as a map on binary partitions of n. In the present work we derive a host of identities involving the sequences which count the number of parts of a given value in the image of pre_2. These include generating functions, explicit expressions, and formulas for forward differences. We generalize some of these to d-ary partitions and explore connections with color partitions. Our techniques include the use of generating functions and bijections on rooted partitions. We end with a list of conjectures and a direction for future research.</description>

      <title>On Positive and Negative $r$-th Power Energy of Graphs with Edge Addition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the positive and negative $r$-th power energy of graphs and their behavior under edge addition. Specifically, we extend the classical notions of positive and negative square energies to the $r$-th power energies, denoted as $s^{+}_r(G)$ and $s^{-}_r(G)$, respectively. We derive bounds for $s^{+}_r(G)$ and $s^{-}_r(G)$ under edge addition, which provide tighter bounds when $r=2$ compared to those of Abiad et al. Moreover, we address the problem of monotonicity of the positive $r$-th power energy under edge addition, providing a family of counterexamples for \( 1 \leq r &lt; 3 \). Finally, three related conjectures are also proposed. One of them is a reformulation of Guo's conjecture, we believe the monotonicity property holds for $r\geq 3$; the other two generalize a conjecture of Elphick et al.</description>

      <title>Optimal distance query reconstruction for graphs without long induced cycles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.05979v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given access to the vertex set $V$ of a connected graph $G=(V,E)$ and an oracle that given two vertices $u,v\in V$, returns the shortest path distance between $u$ and $v$, how many queries are needed to reconstruct $E$?
  Firstly, we show that randomised algorithms need to use at least $\frac1{200} \Delta n\log_\Delta n$ queries in expectation in order to reconstruct $n$-vertex trees of maximum degree $\Delta$. The best previous lower bound (for graphs of bounded maximum degree) was an information-theoretic lower bound of $\Omega(n\log n/\log \log n)$. Our randomised lower bound is also the first to break through the information-theoretic barrier for related query models including distance queries for phylogenetic trees, membership queries for learning partitions and path queries in directed trees.
  Secondly, we provide a simple deterministic algorithm to reconstruct trees using $\Delta n\log_\Delta n+(\Delta+2)n$ distance queries. This proves that our lower bound is optimal up to a multiplicative constant. We extend our algorithm to reconstruct graphs without induced cycles of length at least $k$ using $O_{\Delta,k}(n\log n)$ queries. Our lower bound is therefore tight for a wide range of tree-like graphs, such as chordal graphs, permutation graphs and AT-free graphs. The previously best randomised algorithm for chordal graphs used $O_{\Delta}(n\log^2 n)$ queries in expectation, so we improve by a $(\log n)$-factor for this graph class.</description>

      <title>Generalized root systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.06852v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize the notion of a root system by relaxing the conditions that ensure that it is invariant under reflections and study the resulting structures, which we call generalized root systems (GRSs for short). Since both Kostant root systems and root systems of Lie superalgebras are examples of GRSs, studying GRSs provides a uniform axiomatic approach to studying both of them. GRSs inherit many of the properties of root systems. In particular, every GRS defines a crystallographic hyperplane arrangement. We believe that GRSs provide an intrinsic counterpart to finite Weyl groupoids and crystallographic hyperplane arrangements, extending the relationship between finite Weyl groupoids and crystallographic hyperplane arrangements established by Cuntz. An important difference between GRSs and root systems is that GRSs may lack a (large enough) Weyl group. In order to compensate for this, we introduce the notion of a virtual reflection, building on a construction of Penkov and Serganova in the context of root systems of Lie superalgebras.
  The most significant new feature of GRSs is that, along with subsystems, one can define quotient GRSs. Both Kostant root systems and root systems of Lie superalgebras are equivalent to quotients of root systems and all root systems are isomorphic to quotients of simply-laced root systems. We classify all rank 2 GRSs and show that they are equivalent to quotients of root systems. Finally, we discuss in detail quotients of root systems. In particular we provide all isomorphisms and equivalences among them. Our results on quotient of root systems provide a different point of view on flag manifolds, reproving results of Alekseevsky and Graev.</description>

Abstract: Recently, Steinberg used discrete Morse theory to give a new proof of a theorem of Symonds that the orbit space of the poset of nontrivial $p$-subgroups of a finite group is contractible. We extend Steinberg's argument in two ways, covering more general versions of the theorem that were already known. In particular, following a strategy of Libman, we give a discrete Morse theoretic argument for the contractibility of the orbit space of a saturated fusion system.</description>

      <title>Scalable Structure Learning for Sparse Context-Specific Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several approaches to graphically representing context-specific relations among jointly distributed categorical variables have been proposed, along with structure learning algorithms. While existing optimization-based methods have limited scalability due to the large number of context-specific models, the constraint-based methods are more prone to error than even constraint-based directed acyclic graph learning algorithms since more relations must be tested. We present an algorithm for learning context-specific models that scales to hundreds of variables. Scalable learning is achieved through a combination of an order-based Markov chain Monte-Carlo search and a novel, context-specific sparsity assumption that is analogous to those typically invoked for directed acyclic graphical models. Unlike previous Markov chain Monte-Carlo search methods, our Markov chain is guaranteed to have the true posterior of the variable orderings as the stationary distribution. To implement the method, we solve a first case of an open problem recently posed by Alon and Balogh. Future work solving increasingly general instances of this problem would allow our methods to learn increasingly dense models. The method is shown to perform well on synthetic data and real world examples, in terms of both accuracy and scalability.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we provide algorithmic methods for conducting exhaustive searches for periodic Golay pairs. Our methods enumerate several lengths beyond the currently known state-of-the-art available searches: we conducted exhaustive searches for periodic Golay pairs of all lengths $v \leq 72$ using our methods, while only lengths $v \leq 34$ had previously been exhaustively enumerated. Our methods are applicable to periodic complementary sequences in general. We utilize sequence compression, a method of sequence generation derived in 2013 by Djokovi\'c and Kotsireas. We also introduce and implement a new method of "multi-level" compression, where sequences are uncompressed in several steps. This method allowed us to exhaustively search all lengths $v \leq 72$ using less than 10 CPU years. For cases of complementary sequences where uncompression is not possible, we introduce some new methods of sequence generation inspired by the isomorph-free exhaustive generation algorithm of orderly generation. Finally, we pose a conjecture regarding the structure of periodic Golay pairs and prove it holds in many lengths, including all lengths $v \lt 100$. We demonstrate the usefulness of our algorithms by providing the first ever examples of periodic Golay pairs of length $v = 90$. The smallest length for which the existence of periodic Golay pairs is undecided is now $106$.</description>
