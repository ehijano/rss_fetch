      <title>Multiple Population Alternate Evolution Neural Architecture Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effectiveness of Evolutionary Neural Architecture Search (ENAS) is influenced by the design of the search space. Nevertheless, common methods including the global search space, scalable search space and hierarchical search space have certain limitations. Specifically, the global search space requires a significant amount of computational resources and time, the scalable search space sacrifices the diversity of network structures and the hierarchical search space increases the search cost in exchange for network diversity. To address above limitation, we propose a novel paradigm of searching neural network architectures and design the Multiple Population Alternate Evolution Neural Architecture Search (MPAE), which can achieve module diversity with a smaller search cost. MPAE converts the search space into L interconnected units and sequentially searches the units, then the above search of the entire network be cycled several times to reduce the impact of previous units on subsequent units. To accelerate the population evolution process, we also propose the the population migration mechanism establishes an excellent migration archive and transfers the excellent knowledge and experience in the migration archive to new populations. The proposed method requires only 0.3 GPU days to search a neural network on the CIFAR dataset and achieves the state-of-the-art results.</description>

      <title>MAP-Elites with Transverse Assessment for Multimodal Problems in Creative Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent advances in language-based generative models have paved the way for the orchestration of multiple generators of different artefact types (text, image, audio, etc.) into one system. Presently, many open-source pre-trained models combine text with other modalities, thus enabling shared vector embeddings to be compared across different generators. Within this context we propose a novel approach to handle multimodal creative tasks using Quality Diversity evolution. Our contribution is a variation of the MAP-Elites algorithm, MAP-Elites with Transverse Assessment (MEliTA), which is tailored for multimodal creative tasks and leverages deep learned models that assess coherence across modalities. MEliTA decouples the artefacts' modalities and promotes cross-pollination between elites. As a test bed for this algorithm, we generate text descriptions and cover images for a hypothetical video game and assign each artefact a unique modality-specific behavioural characteristic. Results indicate that MEliTA can improve text-to-image mappings within the solution space, compared to a baseline MAP-Elites algorithm that strictly treats each image-text pair as one solution. Our approach represents a significant step forward in multimodal bottom-up orchestration and lays the groundwork for more complex systems coordinating multimodal creative agents in the future.</description>

      <title>High-speed Low-consumption sEMG-based Transient-state micro-Gesture Recognition by Spiking Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06998</link>

Abstract: Gesture recognition on wearable devices is extensively applied in human-computer interaction. Electromyography (EMG) has been used in many gesture recognition systems for its rapid perception of muscle signals. However, analyzing EMG signals on devices, like smart wristbands, usually needs inference models to have high performances, such as low inference latency, low power consumption, and low memory occupation. Therefore, this paper proposes an improved spiking neural network (SNN) to achieve these goals. We propose an adaptive multi-delta coding as a spiking coding method to improve recognition accuracy. We propose two additive solvers for SNN, which can reduce inference energy consumption and amount of parameters significantly, and improve the robustness of temporal differences. In addition, we propose a linear action detection method TAD-LIF, which is suitable for SNNs. TAD-LIF is an improved LIF neuron that can detect transient-state gestures quickly and accurately. We collected two datasets from 20 subjects including 6 micro gestures. The collection devices are two designed lightweight consumer-level EMG wristbands (3 and 8 electrode channels respectively). Compared to CNN, FCN, and normal SNN-based methods, the proposed SNN has higher recognition accuracy. The accuracy of the proposed SNN is 83.85% and 93.52% on the two datasets respectively. In addition, the inference latency of the proposed SNN is about 1% of CNN, the power consumption is about 0.1% of CNN, and the memory occupation is about 20% of CNN. The proposed methods can be used for precise, high-speed, and low-power micro-gesture recognition tasks, and are suitable for consumer-level intelligent wearable devices, which is a general way to achieve ubiquitous computing.</description>

      <title>Ant Colony Sampling with GFlowNets for Combinatorial Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Generative Flow Ant Colony Sampler (GFACS), a novel neural-guided meta-heuristic algorithm for combinatorial optimization. GFACS integrates generative flow networks (GFlowNets) with the ant colony optimization (ACO) methodology. GFlowNets, a generative model that learns a constructive policy in combinatorial spaces, enhance ACO by providing an informed prior distribution of decision variables conditioned on input graph instances. Furthermore, we introduce a novel combination of training tricks, including search-guided local exploration, energy normalization, and energy shaping to improve GFACS. Our experimental results demonstrate that GFACS outperforms baseline ACO algorithms in seven CO tasks and is competitive with problem-specific heuristics for vehicle routing problems.

      <title>On Solving Close Enough Orienteering Problem with Overlapped Neighborhoods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Close Enough Traveling Salesman Problem (CETSP) is a well-known variant of TSP whereby the agent may complete its mission at any point within a target neighborhood. Heuristics based on overlapped neighborhoods, known as Steiner Zones (SZ), have gained attention in addressing CETSP. While SZs offer effective approximations to the original graph, their inherent overlap imposes constraints on search space, potentially conflicting with global optimization objectives. Here we show how such limitations can be converted into advantages in a Close Enough Orienteering Problem (CEOP) by aggregating prizes across overlapped neighborhoods. We further extend classic CEOP with Non-uniform Neighborhoods (CEOP-N) by introducing non-uniform costs for prize collection. To tackle CEOP and CEOP-N, we develop a new approach featuring a Randomized Steiner Zone Discretization (RSZD) scheme coupled with a hybrid algorithm based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Ant Colony System (ACS), CRaSZe-AntS. The RSZD scheme identifies sub-regions for PSO exploration, and ACS determines the discrete visiting sequence. We evaluate the RSZD's discretization performance on CEOP instances derived from established CETSP instances and compare CRaSZe-AntS against the most relevant state-of-the-art heuristic focused on single-neighborhood optimization for CEOP instances. We also compare the performance of the interior search within SZs and the boundary search on individual neighborhoods in the context of CEOP-N. Our experimental results show that CRaSZe-AntS can yield comparable solution quality with significantly reduced computation time compared to the single neighborhood strategy, where we observe an average 140.44% increase in prize collection and a 55.18% reduction in algorithm execution time. CRaSZe-AntS is thus highly effective in solving emerging CEOP-N, examples of which include truck-and-drone delivery scenarios.</description>

      <title>Lander.AI: Adaptive Landing Behavior Agent for Expertise in 3D Dynamic Platform Landings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mastering autonomous drone landing on dynamic platforms presents formidable challenges due to unpredictable velocities and external disturbances caused by the wind, ground effect, turbines or propellers of the docking platform. This study introduces an advanced Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent, Lander:AI, designed to navigate and land on platforms in the presence of windy conditions, thereby enhancing drone autonomy and safety. Lander:AI is rigorously trained within the gym-pybullet-drone simulation, an environment that mirrors real-world complexities, including wind turbulence, to ensure the agent's robustness and adaptability.
  The agent's capabilities were empirically validated with Crazyflie 2.1 drones across various test scenarios, encompassing both simulated environments and real-world conditions. The experimental results showcased Lander:AI's high-precision landing and its ability to adapt to moving platforms, even under wind-induced disturbances. Furthermore, the system performance was benchmarked against a baseline PID controller augmented with an Extended Kalman Filter, illustrating significant improvements in landing precision and error recovery. Lander:AI leverages bio-inspired learning to adapt to external forces like birds, enhancing drone adaptability without knowing force magnitudes.This research not only advances drone landing technologies, essential for inspection and emergency applications, but also highlights the potential of DRL in addressing intricate aerodynamic challenges.</description>
