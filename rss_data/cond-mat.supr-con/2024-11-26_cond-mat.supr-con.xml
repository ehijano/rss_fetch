      <title>Possibility of BCS-BEC crossover in $\kappa$-type organic superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The realization of BCS-BEC crossover in superconductors, which smoothly connects Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory with Bose-Einstein Condensation (BEC) in fermion systems, is an intriguing recent topic in strongly correlated electron systems. The organic superconductor $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_4$Hg$_{2.89}$Br$_8$ ($\kappa$-HgBr) under pressure is one of the leading candidates, owing to its unique metallic spin-liquid nature and tunable electron correlation. We theoretically investigate the extended Hubbard model for $\kappa$-HgBr and discuss the possibility of the BCS-BEC crossover by systematically calculating superconducting correlation function, coherence length, superfluid weight, and chemical potential. Our findings show that the BCS-BEC crossover can be observed when competing phases, such as Mott insulators and charge and/or spin orders, are suppressed by appropriate hole doping. $\kappa$-HgBr is just the case because both the Mott insulating phase and magnetic orders are absent due to its nonstoichiometric Hg composition and geometrical frustration. We further propose that other $\kappa$-type organic superconductors could serve as potential candidates of the BCS-BEC crossover if their band fillings are systematically tuned.</description>

      <title>First-Principles Study of High-Temperature Superconductivity in X2MH6 Compounds under 20 GPa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research on high-temperature superconductors has primarily focused on hydrogen-rich compounds, however, the need for extreme pressures limits their practical applications. The X2MH6-type structure Mg2IrH6 stands out because it exhibits superconductivity at 160 K under ambient pressure. This study investigates methods to increase the superconducting transition temperature of this structure via atomic substitution and low-pressure treatment and assess the mechanical, thermodynamic, and dynamic stability of structures obtained by substituting Mg and Ir atoms in Mg2IrH6 with elements from the same groups using first-principles calculations. The findings identify 11 stable ternary compounds, 10 of which exhibit superconducting transition temperatures, with three compounds, Mg2CoH6, Mg2RhH6, and Mg2IrH6, exceeding 100 K, classifying them as high-temperature superconductors. Their superconducting figure of merit S values are 2.71, 3.35, and 3.83, respectively, suggesting strong practical application potential. The analysis results indicate that mid-frequency hydrogen phonons significantly enhance superconducting properties via electron-phonon coupling. The band structure study highlights the importance of van Hove singularities near the Fermi level. In addition, electron localization function and Fermi surface topology analyses reveal that the Fermi surface shape and density of states are crucial for increasing superconducting transition temperatures.</description>

      <title>Josephson transistor and robust supercurrent enhancement with spin-split superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the supercurrent flow in a Josephson junction consisting of two spin-split superconductors combined by a normal metal weak link. The normal metal may be driven out of equilibrium, thus modifying the electron and hole occupation and consequently the supercurrent through the system. Considering first an equilibrium normal metal, we find that increasing the spin-splitting field can enhance the supercurrent strongly for long junctions at low temperatures. In contrast to previous work, this is a much larger enhancement (over 100%) and it is achieved for both parallel and antiparallel spin-splitting field configurations, making the effect robust. On the other hand, when a gate voltage is applied to drive the system out of equilibrium, we demonstrate a more efficient $\pi$-transition of the supercurrent in terms of a lower transition voltage by tuning the spin-splitting. Moreover, we find the application of temperature bias strongly suppresses the supercurrent, resulting in very sharp supercurrent jumps as outputs.</description>

      <title>Evidence of the inverse proximity effect in tunnel magnetic Josephson Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic Josephson Junctions (MJJs) are a special class of hybrid systems where antagonistic correlations coexist, thus providing a key for advances in weak superconductivity, superconducting spintronics and quantum computation. So far, the memory properties of MJJs have been mostly investigated in view of digital electronics and for spintronic devices at liquid-helium temperature. At the operating temperature of quantum circuits, a magnetic order can rise in a Superconductor (S) at the S/Ferromagnet (F) interface, i.e., the inverse proximity effect (IPE), thus leading to a significant modification of the magnetic field patterns in MJJs. In this work, we have carried out a comparative investigation of the magnetic behavior of tunnel MJJs with a strong ferromagnetic layer inserted in the layout of both Nb and Al JJs, respectively. The comparative analysis validates the crucial role of the temperature, the fundamental scaling energies of S/F coupling systems, and the transparency of the S/F interface. This investigation points out that the IPE is a key aspect to consider when designing tunnel MJJs operating well below 4 K and thus in the perspective of hybrid superconducting quantum architectures.</description>

      <title>Charge density waves and superconductivity in the electron-positive fermion gas using a simple intuitive model. Part II: Collective modes, effective interactions, superconductivity, and transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductivity and the normal state electrical resistivity which varies as $T^2$ are strongly enhanced near the compressibility and charge density wave instabilities in the electron-positive fermion gas. The additional screening from the positive fermions introduces an attractive term in the effective electron-electron interaction that is the basis for superconductivity. Electron-positive fermion scattering is the source of the $T^2$ term in the electrical resistivity. At an instability, both interactions are divergent.
  The superconducting transition temperature is estimated using the McMillan formula. The electron-positive fermion gas conducts electricity and heat. Because electron-electron and positive fermion-positive fermion scattering conserve momentum, they do not contribute to the electrical resistivity, but electron-positive fermion scattering does. All three scattering mechanisms contribute to the thermal resistivity.
  The simple model for the electron-positive fermion gas is physically intuitive and naturally introduces instabilities at $q=0$ when the bulk modulus becomes zero and charge density waves at finite $q$ under some circumstances. For each mass ratio $M/m$, there is a unique density $r_s$ where the energy is a minimum. For different mass ratios, the interactions are investigated at several values of $r_s$ ranging from below the energy minimum to that of the instability.</description>

      <title>Resonant control of magnetization in a shunted $\varphi_0$ junction with LC circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The possibility of magnetization resonant control in a Josephson superconductor-ferromagnet-superconductor $\varphi_{0}$ junction shunted by an $LC$ circuit is demonstrated. As a result of the resonance of Josephson oscillations with oscillations in the circuit, a time-independent superconducting current arises in the junction. Due to the coupling of the Josephson phase and the magnetization of the ferromagnetic layer, the resulting superconducting current leads to a deviation of the easy axis from its initial position and to a precession of the magnetization around the tilted axis. We show that the tilt value increases with the increasing spin-orbit interaction and the Josephson to magnetic energy ratio. An analytical expression for the magnetization tilt is obtained, which agrees well with the results of numerical calculations. The emerging possibility of resonant control of magnetization in a shunted $\varphi_{0}$ junction can be used in the development of novel technologies in the field of superconducting electronics and spintronics.</description>

      <title>Decoupling between $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals in hole doped La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Through Sr and Ca doping to the La sites, we successfully obtained the hole doped La$_{3-x}$A$_x$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (A = Sr and Ca) thin films by using the pulsed-laser deposition technique. Temperature dependent resistivity shows an upturn at low temperatures, but some clear instabilities, either due to structure or the releasing of strain between the film and substrate, occur at high temperatures. After annealing the films under high pressure of oxygen atmosphere, the upturn at low temperatures is strongly suppressed; the high temperature instability is completely removed. Hall effect measurements show a clear hole-charge carrier behavior with the carrier density of an order of magnitude higher compared with the undoped films. Surprisingly, it is found that the Hall coefficient is almost temperature independent in the whole temperature region, indicating the absence of multiband effect and suggesting the decoupling of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals. This is contradicting to the rigid band picture of a bonding $d_{z^2}$ band just below the Fermi energy in the pristine sample.</description>

      <title>Two-gap superconductivity in the noncentrosymmetric La$_3$Se$_4$ compound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Point-contact Andreev reflection spectroscopy at low temperatures and high magnetic fields has been performed on a noncentrosymmetric La$_3$Se$_4$ superconductor with a critical temperature $T_c$ = 8 K. Two superconducting energy gaps $\Delta_1$ and $\Delta_2$ with $2\Delta_{1}/k_{B} T_{c}$ ~ 5.8 and $2\Delta_{2}/k_{B} T_{c}$ ~ 2.3, are directly observed in some of the spectra. The temperature and magnetic field effects help to resolve a two-gap structure even on the most frequent spectra where at low temperatures only a single gap is apparent, reflected in a pair of maxima around the zero bias. Two-gap superconductivity consistently with the point contact Andreev reflection spectroscopy is also supported by the heat capacity and the Hall probe magnetization measurements.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Quasiparticle Lifetime in a Superconducting Aluminum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use time-resolved thermometry to monitor the decay of nonequilibrium quasiparticles in superconducting Al in the temperature range from $0.3\,$K to $1.2\,$K. The quasiparticle lifetime at higher temperatures ($T&gt;0.7\,$K) agrees well with the calculated energy flow from electrons to phonons, but at lower temperatures it is significantly shorter than the theory predicts. We show well-defined internal equilibrium of quasiparticle system in the studied thermal transients, which implicates that quasiparticle-quasiparticle relaxation is much faster than electron-phonon interaction.</description>

      <title>Origin of the Unusual Temperature Dependence of the Upper Critical Field of Kagome Superconductor CsV3Sb5: Multiple Bands or van Hove Singularities?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van Hove singularities (vHs) located close to the Fermi level in Kagome superconductors AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, Cs) have profound influence on their electronic and transport characteristics. Specifically, magneto-transport and susceptibility measurements on CsV3Sb5 reveal an anomalous temperature dependence of the upper critical field H_c2 (T), characterized by a pronounced upward curvature for both in-plane and c-axis magnetic fields, with zero-temperature H_c2 values of ~6.0 T and ~1.2 T, respectively. Our theoretical analysis, using a newly developed single-band model incorporating vHs and gap anisotropy, suggests that the observed upper critical field behavior is predominantly driven by the anisotropy of the Fermi velocity originating from vHs, instead of multi-band effects or gap anisotropy. Increased electron scattering introduced by proton irradiation defects smears out the vHs, reduces anisotropy, and recovers the conventional H_c2 (T) behavior, corroborating our proposed model.</description>

      <title>Unconventional gapping behavior in a kagome superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining the types of superconducting order in quantum materials is a challenge, especially when multiple degrees of freedom, such as bands or orbitals, contribute to the fermiology and when superconductivity competes, intertwines, or coexists with other symmetry-breaking orders. Here, we study the Kagome-lattice superconductor CsV3Sb5, in which multiband superconductivity coexists with a charge order that substantially reduces the compound's space group symmetries. Through a combination of thermodynamic as well as electrical and thermal transport measurements, we uncover two superconducting regimes with distinct transport and thermodynamic characteristics, while finding no evidence for a phase transition separating them. Thermodynamic measurements reveal substantial quasiparticle weight in a high-temperature regime. At lower temperatures, this weight is removed via the formation of a second gap. The two regimes are sharply distinguished by a pronounced enhancement of the upper critical field at low temperatures and by a switch in the anisotropy of the longitudinal thermal conductivity as a function of in-plane magnetic field orientation. We argue that the band with a gap opening at lower temperatures continues to host low-energy quasiparticles, possibly due to a nodal structure of the gap. Taken together, our results present evidence for band-selective superconductivity with remarkable decoupling of the (two) superconducting gaps. The commonly employed multiband scenario, whereby superconductivity emerges in a primary band and is then induced in other bands appears to fail in this unconventional kagome superconductor. Instead, band-selective superconducting pairing is a paradigm that seems to unify seemingly contradicting results in this intensely studied family of materials and beyond.</description>

      <title>First Principles Calculations of Superconducting Critical Temperature of ThCr$_2$Si$_2$-Type Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.10716</link>
      <description>arXiv:1911.10716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High critical temperature (T$_c$) superconductor has a great potential in many industrial applications. However, discovering a compound having high T$_c$ is still remaining a big challenge for experimental approach due to time-consuming and high cost. In this paper, we investigated the critical temperature (T$_c$) of several compounds of ThCr$_2$Si$_2$-type structure (space group I4/mmm) since some of them had already been investigated and trusted as the potential candidates for superconductivity. First principle calculation was performed to compute the critical temperature (T$_c$) based on allen-dynes equation modification of McMillian formula. In order to confirm our calculation scheme, we compared our result with compounds which had been experimentally determined obtained from $NIMS$ database. The result showed a very good agreement with experimental data. Based on this scheme, finally, we found ThCu$_2$Si$_2$ and ThAu$_2$Si$_2$ which were most likely to exhibit a superconductivity around 3.88 K and 4.27.

      <title>Critical Role of Disorder for Superconductivity in the Series of Epitaxial Ti(O,N) Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Realizing experimental control of superconductivity is of paramount importance to advancing both basic research and technological applications. Disorder, generally existing in most superconductors, intricately interacts with Cooper pairs and also impacts the performance of quantum devices. In this paper, we report the study of a series of Ti(O,N) crystalline films prepared via molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). We discover that substituting nitrogen (N) for oxygen (O) in TiO, namely TiO(N), considerably increases the normal-state conductivity and the superconducting transition temperature Tc. The Tc of TiO(N) falling between those of TiO (about 0.5 K) and TiN (about 6 K) is contrary to their comparable Tc predicted by the Migdal Eliasberg theory. It is found that their resistivity vs temperature obeys the Mooij rule, known as the characteristic of metallic glasses. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that strong disorder severely scatters the Bloch electron waves at nonzero momenta, which consequently weakens electron-phonon coupling in TiO(N).</description>

      <title>Majorana Zero Modes in the Lieb-Kitaev Model with Tunable Quantum Metric</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The relation between band topology and Majorana zero energy modes (MZMs) in topological superconductors had been well studied in the past decades. However, the relation between the quantum metric and MZMs has yet to be understood. In this work, we first construct a three band Lieb-like lattice model with an isolated flat band and tunable quantum metric. By introducing nearest neighbor equal spin pairing, we obtain the Lieb-Kitaev model which supports MZMs. When the Fermi energy is set within the flat band energy, the MZMs appear which are supposed to be well-localized at the ends of the 1D superconductor due to the flatness of the band. On the contrary, we show both numerically and analytically that the localization length of the MZMs is controlled by a length scale defined by the quantum metric of the flat band, which we call the quantum metric length (QML). The QML can be several orders of magnitude longer than the conventional BCS superconducting coherence length. When the QML is comparable to the length of the superconductor, the two MZMs from the two ends of the superconductor can hybridize and induce ultra long-range crossed Andreev reflections. This work unveils how the quantum metric can greatly influence the properties of MZMs through the QML and the results can be generalized to other topological bound states.</description>

      <title>Designing Phase Sensitive Probes of Monopole Superconducting Order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distinct from familiar $s$-, $p$-, or $d$-wave pairings, the monopole superconducting order represents a novel class of pairing order arising from nontrivial monopole charge of the Cooper pair. In the weak-coupling regime, this order can emerge when pairing occurs between Fermi surfaces with different Chern numbers in, for example, doped Weyl semimetal systems. However, the phase of monopole pairing order is not well-defined over an entire Fermi surface, making it challenging to design experiments sensitive to both its symmetry and topology. To address this, we propose a scheme based on symmetry and topological principles to identify this elusive pairing order through a set of phase-sensitive Josephson experiments. By examining the discrepancy between global and local angular momentum of the pairing order, we can unveil the monopole charge of the pairing order. We demonstrate the proposed probe of monopole pairing order through analytic and numerical studies of Josephson coupling in models of monopole superconductor junctions. This work opens a promising avenue to uncover the unique topological properties of monopole pairing orders and to distinguish them from known pairing orders based on spherical harmonic symmetry.</description>

      <title>Closing in on possible scenarios for infinite-layer nickelates: comparison of dynamical mean-field theory with angular-resolved photoemission spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conflicting theoretical scenarios for infinite-layer nickelate superconductors have been hotly debated, particularly regarding whether {only} a single Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ band is relevant at low energies besides electron pockets or whether multi-orbital physics including Ni-3$d_{z^2}$ is instead essential. The first scenario has emerged from density-functional theory plus dynamical mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT) calculations. Comparing the previous DFT+DMFT spectra to recent angular-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments, we find excellent agreement for both the Fermi surface and the strongly renormalized quasi-particle bands, supporting the first scenario. Our key findings further suggest that the "waterfalls" observed in ARPES might emerge from the quasi-particle--to--Hubbard-band crossover, and that additional spectral weight close to the $A$-pocket {likely} originates from the Ni-3$d_{xy}$ orbital.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12052v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the possibility of obtaining new superconductor candidates from functionalized MXene compounds Zr$_2$NS$_2$, Zr$_2$NCl$_2$, and Sc$_2$NCl$_2$ based on $\textit{ab initio}$ calculations with density functional theory for superconductors (SCDFT). The predicted superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ at ambient pressure may reach up to 9.48 K (Zr$_2$NS$_2$). Strain-induced $T_c$ enhancement is demonstrated with an example case for Zr$_2$NCl$_2$. We note a correlation between the profiles of superconducting gap $\Delta$ and the electron-phonon coupling $\lambda$ across the Fermi surface for all compounds, which are likely influenced by their modified electronic bandstructure components.</description>

      <title>Intertwined effects of elastic deformation and damage on vortex pinning and Jc degradation in polycrystalline superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The damage and the critical current density (Jc) degradation of polycrystalline superconductors induced by strain dramatically influence their performance in applications. Unfortunately, the state-of-the-art experimental techniques are unable to detect the damage of internal polycrystalline structures and the microscopic superconductivity in the presence of strain. We propose a groundbreaking multi-scale theoretical framework aimed at revealing the underlying physical mechanisms of the reversible and irreversible Jc degradation induced by the strain through tackling the complex intertwined effects of elastic deformation and damage on the superconductivity of grain boundaries and the associated vortex pinning. The results are well validated by experimental measurements. Utilizing the benchmarked physical model, we demonstrate that the damage evolutions of polycrystalline superconductors in the presence of strain can be approximately estimated by means of the electromagnetic experiments on Jc. Furthermore, we also discuss the characteristics of damage and Jc degradation of polycrystalline superconductors subjected to biaxial mechanical loads. The findings will pave the way to investigate the tunable vortex pinning and Jc of superconductors by strain, and to develop a brand new electromagnetic method to manifest the damage of polycrystalline superconductors.</description>

      <title>Emerging topological characterization in non-equilibrium states of quenched Kitaev chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08056v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological characteristics of quantum systems are typically determined by the closing of a gap, while the dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT) during quantum real-time evolution has emerged as a nonequilibrium analog to the quantum phase transition (QPT). In this paper, we illustrate that the system dynamics can be elucidated by considering the precession of a collection of free-pseudo spins under a magnetic field based on the exact results of extended Kitaev chains. The topology of the driven Hamiltonian is determined by the average winding number of the nonequilibrium state. Furthermore, we establish that the singularity of the DQPT arises from two perpendicular pseudo-spin vectors associated with the pre- and post-quenched Hamiltonians. Moreover, we investigate the distinct behaviors of the dynamic pairing order parameter in both topological and non-topological regions. These findings offer valuable insights into the non-equilibrium behavior of topological superconductors, contributing to the understanding of the resilience of topological properties in driven quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Spectral Signatures of Non-Trivial Topology in a Superconducting Circuit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10876v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topology, like symmetry, is a fundamental concept in understanding general properties of physical systems. In condensed matter, nontrivial topology may manifest itself as singular features in the energy spectrum or the quantization of electrical properties such as conductance and magnetic flux. Using microwave spectroscopy, we determine that a superconducting circuit with three Josephson tunnel junctions in parallel can possess degeneracies indicative of \emph{intrinsic} nontrivial topology. We identify three topological invariants, one of which is related to a hidden quantum mechanical supersymmetry. Measurements show that devices fabricated in different topological regimes fall on a simple phase diagram which should be robust to junction imperfections and geometric inductance. Josephson tunnel junction circuits, which are readily fabricated with conventional microlithography techniques, allow access to a wide range of topological systems that may have no condensed matter analog. Notable spectral features of these circuits, such as degeneracies and flat bands, may find use in quantum information, sensing, and metrology.</description>

      <title>Ballistic Andreev interferometers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13669v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Josephson junction, formed between two phase-biased superconductors and a normal metal, hosts a discrete spectrum of Andreev bound states (ABS). In this paper, we develop a theory for long ballistic Andreev interferometers in two-dimensional metals. We consider three frameworks in our theoretical analysis: (i) perturbation theory in the tunneling amplitudes; (ii) non-perturbative transport theory; and (iii) physically motivated approximations to visualize the conductance maps in the (flux, voltage) plane. We find a non-standard phase-sensitive Andreev reflection process in ballistic interferometers that couples the supercurrent to the non-equilibrium populations of the ABS in the normal region. Furthermore, our model shows that conductance spectroscopy follows the spectrum of the ABS in long junctions. We also discuss our results in terms of the semiclassical theory, the classical orbits being the one-dimensional Andreev tubes. Our theoretical analysis captures the results of recent experiments by the Penn State and Harvard groups.</description>

      <title>Theory of charge-6e condensed phase in Kagome lattice superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a Ginzburg-Landau theory for commensurate pair density wave (PDW) states in a hexagonal lattice system, relevant to the kagome superconductors $\rm{AV_3Sb_5}$. Compared to previous theoretical frameworks, the commensurate wave vectors permit additional symmetric terms in the free energy, altering the system's ground state and its degeneracy. In particular, we analyze topological defects in the energetically favorable $\psi_{\text{kagome}}$ ground state and find that kinks on domain walls can carry $1/3$ topological charges. We further establish a correspondence between the SC fluctuations in these states and an effective $J_1-J_2$ frustrated XY model on the emergent kagome lattice. By employing a state-of-the-art numerical tensor network method, we rigorously solve this effective model at finite temperatures and confirm the existence of a vestigial phase characterized by $1/3$ vortex-antivortex pairs in low temperatures with the absence of phase coherence of Cooper pairs, which is dual to the charge-$6e$ condensed phase. Our theory provides a potential explanation for the vestigial charge-$6e$ magnetoresistance oscillations observed in recent experiments [J. Ge, et. al., Phys. Rev. X 14, 021025 (2024)].</description>

      <title>Long-range crossed Andreev reflection in topological insulator nanowires proximitized by a superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Crossed Andreev reflection (CAR) is a nonlocal transport phenomenon that creates/detects Cooper-pair correlations between distant places. It is also the basis of Cooper-pair splitting to generate remote entanglement. Although CAR has been extensively studied in semiconductors proximity-coupled to a superconductor, it has been very difficult to observe it in a topological insulator (TI). Here we report the first observation of CAR in a proximitized TI nanowire (TINW). We performed local and nonlocal conductance spectroscopy on mesoscopic TINW devices in which superconducting (Nb) and metallic (Pt/Au) contacts are made on a bulk-insulating TINW. The local conductance detected a hard gap, accompanied by the appearance of Andreev bound states that can reach zero-bias, while a negative nonlocal conductance was occasionally observed upon sweeping the chemical potential, giving evidence for CAR. Surprisingly, the CAR signal was detected even over 1.5 $\mu$m, which implies that pair correlations extend over a length scale much longer than the expected superconducting coherence length of either Nb or the proximitised TINW. Such a long-range CAR effect is possibly due to an intricate role of disorder in proximitized nanowires. Also, our 0.9-$\mu$m device presented a decent Cooper-pair splitting efficiency of up to 0.5.</description>

      <title>A facile route to synthesize cubic gauche polymeric nitrogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, the long-sought cg-N with N-N single bond has been synthesized for the first time by a thermal-driven-only chemical route at ambient conditions. The successful synthesis of cg-N was achieved by first creating a solution of azides, which was then pretreated under vacuum conditions. Following the pretreatment, the resultant concentrated azide was heated at temperatures ranging from 260{\deg}C to 330{\deg}C for a reaction time of 3 hours, ultimately leading to the formation of cg-N. The emergent intense Raman peak characterized of cg-N provides solid evidence that the double bonded nitrogen-nitrogen transforms into a single bond form, which agrees well with cg-N structure. To date, this is the only work achieving the quantity of cg-N synthesized at ambient conditions by a facile route that can be further developed for the scalable synthesis and applications of polymerized nitrogen-based materials as high energy density materials.</description>
