      <title>High-throughput viscometry via machine-learning from videos of inverted vials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the inverted vial test has been widely used as a qualitative method for estimating fluid viscosity, quantitative rheological characterization has remained limited due to its complex, uncontrolled flow - driven by gravity, surface tension, inertia, and initial conditions. Here, we present a computer vision (CV) viscometer that automates the inverted vial test and enables quantitative viscosity inference across nearly five orders of magnitude (0.01-1000 Pas), without requiring direct velocity field measurements. The system simultaneously inverts multiple vials and records videos of the evolving fluid, which are fed into a neural network that approximates the inverse function from visual features and known fluid density. Despite the complex, multi-regime flow within the vial, our approach achieves relative errors below 25%, improving to 15% for viscosities above 0.1 Pas. When tested on non-Newtonian polymer solutions, the method reliably estimates zero-shear viscosity as long as viscoelastic or shear-thinning behaviors remain negligible within the flow regime. Moreover, high standard deviations in the inferred values may serve as a proxy for identifying fluids with strong non-Newtonian behavior. The CV viscometer requires only one camera and one motor, is contactless and low-cost, and can be easily integrated into high-throughput experimental automated and manual workflows. Transcending traditional characterization paradigms, our method leverages uncontrolled flows and visual features to achieve simplicity and scalability, enabling high-throughput viscosity inference that can meet the growing demand of data-driven material models while remaining accessible to lower resource environments.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Barnes-Hut Approximation for Fast Summation on the GPU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel stochastic version of the Barnes-Hut approximation. Regarding the level-of-detail (LOD) family of approximations as control variates, we construct an unbiased estimator of the kernel sum being approximated. Through several examples in graphics applications such as winding number computation and smooth distance evaluation, we demonstrate that our method is well-suited for GPU computation, capable of outperforming a GPU-optimized implementation of the deterministic Barnes-Hut approximation by achieving equal median error in up to 9.4x less time.</description>

      <title>FlexPainter: Flexible and Multi-View Consistent Texture Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Texture map production is an important part of 3D modeling and determines the rendering quality. Recently, diffusion-based methods have opened a new way for texture generation. However, restricted control flexibility and limited prompt modalities may prevent creators from producing desired results. Furthermore, inconsistencies between generated multi-view images often lead to poor texture generation quality. To address these issues, we introduce \textbf{FlexPainter}, a novel texture generation pipeline that enables flexible multi-modal conditional guidance and achieves highly consistent texture generation. A shared conditional embedding space is constructed to perform flexible aggregation between different input modalities. Utilizing such embedding space, we present an image-based CFG method to decompose structural and style information, achieving reference image-based stylization. Leveraging the 3D knowledge within the image diffusion prior, we first generate multi-view images simultaneously using a grid representation to enhance global understanding. Meanwhile, we propose a view synchronization and adaptive weighting module during diffusion sampling to further ensure local consistency. Finally, a 3D-aware texture completion model combined with a texture enhancement model is used to generate seamless, high-resolution texture maps. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both flexibility and generation quality.</description>

      <title>Voyager: Real-Time Splatting City-Scale 3D Gaussians on Your Phone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02774v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is an emerging technique for photorealistic 3D scene rendering. However, rendering city-scale 3DGS scenes on mobile devices, e.g., your smartphones, remains a significant challenge due to the limited resources on mobile devices. A natural solution is to offload computation to the cloud; however, naively streaming rendered frames from the cloud to the client introduces high latency and requires bandwidth far beyond the capacity of current wireless networks.
  In this paper, we propose an effective solution to enable city-scale 3DGS rendering on mobile devices. Our key insight is that, under normal user motion, the number of newly visible Gaussians per second remains roughly constant. Leveraging this, we stream only the necessary Gaussians to the client. Specifically, on the cloud side, we propose asynchronous level-of-detail search to identify the necessary Gaussians for the client. On the client side, we accelerate rendering via a lookup table-based rasterization. Combined with holistic runtime optimizations, our system can deliver low-latency, city-scale 3DGS rendering on mobile devices. Compared to existing solutions, Voyager achieves over 100$\times$ reduction on data transfer and up to 8.9$\times$ speedup while retaining comparable rendering quality.</description>

      <title>PhysGaia: A Physics-Aware Dataset of Multi-Body Interactions for Dynamic Novel View Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce PhysGaia, a novel physics-aware dataset specifically designed for Dynamic Novel View Synthesis (DyNVS), encompassing both structured objects and unstructured physical phenomena. Unlike existing datasets that primarily focus on photorealistic reconstruction, PhysGaia is created to actively support physics-aware dynamic scene modeling. Our dataset provides complex dynamic scenarios with rich interactions among multiple objects, where they realistically collide with each other and exchange forces. Furthermore, it contains a diverse range of physical materials, such as liquid, gas, viscoelastic substance, and textile, which moves beyond the rigid bodies prevalent in existing datasets. All scenes in PhysGaia are faithfully generated to strictly adhere to physical laws, leveraging carefully selected material-specific physics solvers. To enable quantitative evaluation of physical modeling, our dataset provides essential ground-truth information, including 3D particle trajectories and physics parameters, e.g., viscosity. To facilitate research adoption, we also provide essential integration pipelines for using state-of-the-art DyNVS models with our dataset and report their results. By addressing the critical lack of datasets for physics-aware modeling, PhysGaia will significantly advance research in dynamic view synthesis, physics-based scene understanding, and deep learning models integrated with physical simulation -- ultimately enabling more faithful reconstruction and interpretation of complex dynamic scenes. Our datasets and codes are available in the project website, http://cvlab.snu.ac.kr/research/PhysGaia.</description>

      <title>VolTex: Food Volume Estimation using Text-Guided Segmentation and Neural Surface Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate food volume estimation is crucial for dietary monitoring, medical nutrition management, and food intake analysis. Existing 3D Food Volume estimation methods accurately compute the food volume but lack for food portions selection. We present VolTex, a framework that improves \change{the food object selection} in food volume estimation. Allowing users to specify a target food item via text input to be segmented, our method enables the precise selection of specific food objects in real-world scenes. The segmented object is then reconstructed using the Neural Surface Reconstruction method to generate high-fidelity 3D meshes for volume computation. Extensive evaluations on the MetaFood3D dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in isolating and reconstructing food items for accurate volume estimation. The source code is accessible at https://github.com/GCVCG/VolTex.</description>

      <title>PartComposer: Learning and Composing Part-Level Concepts from Single-Image Examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present PartComposer: a framework for part-level concept learning from single-image examples that enables text-to-image diffusion models to compose novel objects from meaningful components. Existing methods either struggle with effectively learning fine-grained concepts or require a large dataset as input. We propose a dynamic data synthesis pipeline generating diverse part compositions to address one-shot data scarcity. Most importantly, we propose to maximize the mutual information between denoised latents and structured concept codes via a concept predictor, enabling direct regulation on concept disentanglement and re-composition supervision. Our method achieves strong disentanglement and controllable composition, outperforming subject and part-level baselines when mixing concepts from the same, or different, object categories.</description>

      <title>HumanRAM: Feed-forward Human Reconstruction and Animation Model using Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D human reconstruction and animation are long-standing topics in computer graphics and vision. However, existing methods typically rely on sophisticated dense-view capture and/or time-consuming per-subject optimization procedures. To address these limitations, we propose HumanRAM, a novel feed-forward approach for generalizable human reconstruction and animation from monocular or sparse human images. Our approach integrates human reconstruction and animation into a unified framework by introducing explicit pose conditions, parameterized by a shared SMPL-X neural texture, into transformer-based large reconstruction models (LRM). Given monocular or sparse input images with associated camera parameters and SMPL-X poses, our model employs scalable transformers and a DPT-based decoder to synthesize realistic human renderings under novel viewpoints and novel poses. By leveraging the explicit pose conditions, our model simultaneously enables high-quality human reconstruction and high-fidelity pose-controlled animation. Experiments show that HumanRAM significantly surpasses previous methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy, animation fidelity, and generalization performance on real-world datasets. Video results are available at https://zju3dv.github.io/humanram/.</description>

      <title>EyeNavGS: A 6-DoF Navigation Dataset and Record-n-Replay Software for Real-World 3DGS Scenes in VR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is an emerging media representation that reconstructs real-world 3D scenes in high fidelity, enabling 6-degrees-of-freedom (6-DoF) navigation in virtual reality (VR). However, developing and evaluating 3DGS-enabled applications and optimizing their rendering performance, require realistic user navigation data. Such data is currently unavailable for photorealistic 3DGS reconstructions of real-world scenes. This paper introduces EyeNavGS (EyeNavGS), the first publicly available 6-DoF navigation dataset featuring traces from 46 participants exploring twelve diverse, real-world 3DGS scenes. The dataset was collected at two sites, using the Meta Quest Pro headsets, recording the head pose and eye gaze data for each rendered frame during free world standing 6-DoF navigation. For each of the twelve scenes, we performed careful scene initialization to correct for scene tilt and scale, ensuring a perceptually-comfortable VR experience. We also release our open-source SIBR viewer software fork with record-and-replay functionalities and a suite of utility tools for data processing, conversion, and visualization. The EyeNavGS dataset and its accompanying software tools provide valuable resources for advancing research in 6-DoF viewport prediction, adaptive streaming, 3D saliency, and foveated rendering for 3DGS scenes. The EyeNavGS dataset is available at: https://symmru.github.io/EyeNavGS/.</description>

      <title>MotionRAG-Diff: A Retrieval-Augmented Diffusion Framework for Long-Term Music-to-Dance Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating long-term, coherent, and realistic music-conditioned dance sequences remains a challenging task in human motion synthesis. Existing approaches exhibit critical limitations: motion graph methods rely on fixed template libraries, restricting creative generation; diffusion models, while capable of producing novel motions, often lack temporal coherence and musical alignment. To address these challenges, we propose $\textbf{MotionRAG-Diff}$, a hybrid framework that integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with diffusion-based refinement to enable high-quality, musically coherent dance generation for arbitrary long-term music inputs. Our method introduces three core innovations: (1) A cross-modal contrastive learning architecture that aligns heterogeneous music and dance representations in a shared latent space, establishing unsupervised semantic correspondence without paired data; (2) An optimized motion graph system for efficient retrieval and seamless concatenation of motion segments, ensuring realism and temporal coherence across long sequences; (3) A multi-condition diffusion model that jointly conditions on raw music signals and contrastive features to enhance motion quality and global synchronization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MotionRAG-Diff achieves state-of-the-art performance in motion quality, diversity, and music-motion synchronization accuracy. This work establishes a new paradigm for music-driven dance generation by synergizing retrieval-based template fidelity with diffusion-based creative enhancement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present TalkingMachines -- an efficient framework that transforms pretrained video generation models into real-time, audio-driven character animators. TalkingMachines enables natural conversational experiences by integrating an audio large language model (LLM) with our video generation foundation model. Our primary contributions include: (1) We adapt a pretrained SOTA image-to-video DiT into an audio-driven avatar generation model of 18 billion parameters; (2) We enable infinite video streaming without error accumulation through asymmetric knowledge distillation from a bidirectional teacher model into a sparse causal, autoregressive student model; (3) We design a high-throughput, low-latency inference pipeline incorporating several key engineering optimizations such as: (a) disaggregation of the DiT and VAE decoder across separate devices, (b) efficient overlap of inter-device communication and computation using CUDA streams, (c) elimination of redundant recomputations to maximize frame-generation throughput.

      <title>SceneMotifCoder: Example-driven Visual Program Learning for Generating 3D Object Arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite advances in text-to-3D generation methods, generation of multi-object arrangements remains challenging. Current methods exhibit failures in generating physically plausible arrangements that respect the provided text description. We present SceneMotifCoder (SMC), an example-driven framework for generating 3D object arrangements through visual program learning. SMC leverages large language models (LLMs) and program synthesis to overcome these challenges by learning visual programs from example arrangements. These programs are generalized into compact, editable meta-programs. When combined with 3D object retrieval and geometry-aware optimization, they can be used to create object arrangements varying in arrangement structure and contained objects. Our experiments show that SMC generates high-quality arrangements using meta-programs learned from few examples. Evaluation results demonstrates that object arrangements generated by SMC better conform to user-specified text descriptions and are more physically plausible when compared with state-of-the-art text-to-3D generation and layout methods.</description>

      <title>Pro3D-Editor : A Progressive-Views Perspective for Consistent and Precise 3D Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-guided 3D editing aims to precisely edit semantically relevant local 3D regions, which has significant potential for various practical applications ranging from 3D games to film production. Existing methods typically follow a view-indiscriminate paradigm: editing 2D views indiscriminately and projecting them back into 3D space. However, they overlook the different cross-view interdependencies, resulting in inconsistent multi-view editing. In this study, we argue that ideal consistent 3D editing can be achieved through a \textit{progressive-views paradigm}, which propagates editing semantics from the editing-salient view to other editing-sparse views. Specifically, we propose \textit{Pro3D-Editor}, a novel framework, which mainly includes Primary-view Sampler, Key-view Render, and Full-view Refiner. Primary-view Sampler dynamically samples and edits the most editing-salient view as the primary view. Key-view Render accurately propagates editing semantics from the primary view to other key views through its Mixture-of-View-Experts Low-Rank Adaption (MoVE-LoRA). Full-view Refiner edits and refines the 3D object based on the edited multi-views. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in editing accuracy and spatial consistency.</description>

      <title>Controllable Satellite-to-Street-View Synthesis with Precise Pose Alignment and Zero-Shot Environmental Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03498v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generating street-view images from satellite imagery is a challenging task, particularly in maintaining accurate pose alignment and incorporating diverse environmental conditions. While diffusion models have shown promise in generative tasks, their ability to maintain strict pose alignment throughout the diffusion process is limited. In this paper, we propose a novel Iterative Homography Adjustment (IHA) scheme applied during the denoising process, which effectively addresses pose misalignment and ensures spatial consistency in the generated street-view images. Additionally, currently, available datasets for satellite-to-street-view generation are limited in their diversity of illumination and weather conditions, thereby restricting the generalizability of the generated outputs. To mitigate this, we introduce a text-guided illumination and weather-controlled sampling strategy that enables fine-grained control over the environmental factors. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that our approach significantly improves pose accuracy and enhances the diversity and realism of generated street-view images, setting a new benchmark for satellite-to-street-view generation tasks.</description>

Abstract: There have been many attempts to leverage multiple diffusion models for collaborative generation, extending beyond the original domain. A prominent approach involves synchronizing multiple diffusion trajectories by mixing the estimated scores to artificially correlate the generation processes. However, existing methods rely on naive heuristics, such as averaging, without considering task specificity. These approaches do not clarify why such methods work and often produce suboptimal results when a heuristic suitable for one task is blindly applied to others. In this paper, we present a probabilistic framework for analyzing why diffusion synchronization works and reveal where heuristics should be focused; modeling correlations between multiple trajectories and adapting them to each specific task. We further identify optimal correlation models per task, achieving better results than previous approaches that apply a single heuristic across all tasks without justification.</description>
