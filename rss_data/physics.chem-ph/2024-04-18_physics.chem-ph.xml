      <title>Physics-informed active learning for accelerating quantum chemical simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum chemical simulations can be greatly accelerated by constructing machine learning potentials, which is often done using active learning (AL). The usefulness of the constructed potentials is often limited by the high effort required and their insufficient robustness in the simulations. Here we introduce the end-to-end AL for constructing robust data-efficient potentials with affordable investment of time and resources and minimum human interference. Our AL protocol is based on the physics-informed sampling of training points, automatic selection of initial data, and uncertainty quantification. The versatility of this protocol is shown in our implementation of quasi-classical molecular dynamics for simulating vibrational spectra, conformer search of a key biochemical molecule, and time-resolved mechanism of the Diels-Alder reaction. These investigations took us days instead of weeks of pure quantum chemical calculations on a high-performance computing cluster.</description>

      <title>Diamond surfaces with lateral gradients for systematic optimization of surface chemistry for relaxometry -- A low pressure plasma-based approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diamond is increasingly popular because of its unique material properties. Diamond defects called nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers allow measurements with unprecedented sensitivity. However, to achieve ideal sensing performance NV centers need to be within nanometers from the surface and are thus strongly dependent on the local surface chemistry. Several attempts have been made to compare diamond surfaces. However, due to the high price of diamond crystals with shallow NV centers, a limited number of chemical modifications have been studied. Here, we developed a systematic method to investigate a continuity of different local environments with a varying density and nature of surface groups in a single experiment on a single diamond plate. To achieve this goal, we used diamonds with a shallow ensemble of NV centers and introduced a chemical gradient across the surface. More specifically we used air and hydrogen plasma. The gradients were formed by low pressure plasma treatment after masking with a right-angled triangular prism shield. As a result, the surface contained gradually more oxygen/hydrogen towards the open end of the shield. We then performed widefield relaxometry to determine the effect of surface chemistry on the sensing performance. As expected, relaxation times and thus sensing performance indeed varies along the gradient.</description>

      <title>Non-adiabatic electronic relaxation of tetracene from its brightest singlet excited state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ultrafast relaxation dynamics of tetracene following UV excitation to a bright singlet state S6 has been studied with time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy. With the help of high-level ab-initio multireference perturbation theory calculations, we assign photoelectron signals to intermediate dark electronic states S3, S4 and S5 as well as a to a low-lying electronic state S2. The energetic structure of these dark states has not been determined experimentally previously. The time-dependent photoelectron yields assigned to the states S6, S5 and S4 have been analyzed and reveal the depopulation of S6 within 50 fs, while S5 and S4 are populated with delays of about 50 and 80 fs. The dynamics of the lower-lying states S3 and S2 seem to agree with a delayed population coinciding with the depopulation of the higher-lying states S4-S6, but could not be elucidated in full detail due to the low signal levels of the corresponding two-photon ionization probe processes.</description>

      <title>How Thick is the Air-Water Interface? -- A Direct Experimental Measurement of the Decay Length of the Interfacial Structural Anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The air-water interface is a highly prevalent phase boundary with a far-reaching impact on natural and industrial processes. Water molecules behave differently at the interface compared to the bulk, exhibiting anisotropic orientational distributions, reduced intermolecular connectivity in the hydrogen bond network, and significantly slower dynamics. Despite many decades of research, the thickness of the structural anisotropy in the interfacial layer remains controversial, with a direct experimental measurement being absent. In this study, we utilise an advancement in non-linear vibrational spectroscopy to gain access to this important parameter. Combining phase-resolved sum- and difference-frequency generation (SFG and DFG) responses, we directly measure the decay in structural anisotropy of the air-water interface. We find a decay length of ~6-8\r{A}, in excellent agreement with depth-resolved SFG spectra calculated from ab initio parameterised molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The result reveals surprisingly short anisotropic orientational correlations from the interfacial layer that are even shorter than in the bulk. Furthermore, the recorded SFG and DFG responses are decomposed into a vibrationally resonant and non-resonant contribution through isotopic exchange measurements. Through their separate analysis, we show that the resonant response is a sensitive probe of the structural anisotropy at the interface whereas the non-resonant contribution contains a significant isotropic contribution from the bulk and therefore only partially reports on the interfacial structure. This finding places stringent restrictions on the insight available through both purely non-resonant and second-order intensity studies.</description>

      <title>Detection and prebiotic chemistry of possible glycine precursor molecule methylenimine towards the hot molecular core G10.47+0.03</title>

Abstract: Amino acids are essential for the synthesis of protein. Amino acids contain both amine (R$-$NH$_{2}$) and carboxylic acid (R$-$COOH) functional groups, which help to understand the possible formation mechanism of life in the universe. Among the 20 types of amino acids, glycine (NH$_{2}$CH$_{2}$COOH) is known as the simplest non-essential amino acid. In the last 40 years, all surveys of NH$_{2}$CH$_{2}$COOH in the interstellar medium, especially in the star-formation regions, have failed at the millimeter and sub-millimeter wavelengths. We aimed to identify the possible precursors of NH$_{2}$CH$_{2}$COOH, because it is highly challenging to identify NH$_{2}$CH$_{2}$COOH in the interstellar medium. Many laboratory experiments have suggested that methylenimine (CH$_{2}$NH) plays a key role as a possible precursor of NH$_{2}$CH$_{2}$COOH in the star-formation regions via the Strecker synthesis reaction. After spectral analysis using the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) model, we successfully identified the rotational emission lines of CH$_{2}$NH towards the hot molecular core G10.47+0.03 using the Atacama Compact Array (ACA). The estimated column density of CH$_{2}$NH towards G10.47+0.03 is (3.40$\pm$0.2)$\times$10$^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ with a rotational temperature of 218.70$\pm$20 K, which is estimated from the rotational diagram. The fractional abundance of CH$_{2}$NH with respect to H$_{2}$ towards G10.47+0.03 is 2.61$\times$10$^{-8}$. We found that the derived abundance of CH$_{2}$NH agree fairly well with the existing two-phase warm-up chemical modelling abundance value of CH$_{2}$NH. We discuss the possible formation pathways of CH$_{2}$NH within the context of hot molecular cores, and we find that CH$_{2}$NH is likely mainly formed via neutral-neutral gas-phase reactions of CH$_{3}$ and NH radicals towards G10.47+0.03.</description>

      <title>Information theory unifies atomistic machine learning, uncertainty quantification, and materials thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An accurate description of information is relevant for a range of problems in atomistic modeling, such as sampling methods, detecting rare events, analyzing datasets, or performing uncertainty quantification (UQ) in machine learning (ML)-driven simulations. Although individual methods have been proposed for each of these tasks, they lack a common theoretical background integrating their solutions. Here, we introduce an information theoretical framework that unifies predictions of phase transformations, kinetic events, dataset optimality, and model-free UQ from atomistic simulations, thus bridging materials modeling, ML, and statistical mechanics. We first demonstrate that, for a proposed representation, the information entropy of a distribution of atom-centered environments is a surrogate value for thermodynamic entropy. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we show that information entropy differences from trajectories can be used to build phase diagrams, identify rare events, and recover classical theories of nucleation. Building on these results, we use this general concept of entropy to quantify information in datasets for ML interatomic potentials (IPs), informing compression, explaining trends in testing errors, and evaluating the efficiency of active learning strategies. Finally, we propose a model-free UQ method for MLIPs using information entropy, showing it reliably detects extrapolation regimes, scales to millions of atoms, and goes beyond model errors. This method is made available as the package QUESTS: Quick Uncertainty and Entropy via STructural Similarity, providing a new unifying theory for data-driven atomistic modeling and combining efforts in ML, first-principles thermodynamics, and simulations.</description>

      <title>Impact of Cavity on Molecular Ionization Spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ionization phenomena are widely studied for decades. With the advent of cavity technology, the question arises how quantum light affects molecular ionization. As the ionization spectrum is recorded from the neutral ground state, it is usually possible to choose cavities which exert negligible effect on the neutral ground state, but have significant impact on the ion and the ionization spectrum. Particularly interesting are cases where the ion exhibits conical intersections between close-lying electronic states, which gives rise to substantial nonadiabatic effects. Assuming single-molecule strong coupling, we demonstrate that vibrational modes irrelevant in the absence of cavity play a decisive role when the molecule is in the cavity. Here, dynamical symmetry breaking is responsible for the ion-cavity coupling and high symmetry enables control of the coupling via molecular orientation relative to the cavity field polarization. Significant impact on the spectrum by the cavity is found and shown to even substantially increase for less symmetric molecules.</description>

Abstract: We study the ultrafast time evolution of cyclobutanone excited to singlet n--&gt;Rydberg state through XMS-CASPT2 nonadiabatic surface-hopping simulations. These dynamics predict relaxation to ground-state with a timescale of 822 +/- 45 fs with minimal involvement of triplets. The major relaxation path to the ground-state involves a three-state degeneracy region and leads to variety of fragmented photoproducts. We simulate the resulting time-resolved electron-diffraction spectra which track the relaxation of the excited state and the formation of various photoproducts in the ground-state.</description>

      <title>Density Functional Theory Calculations of the thermochemistry of the dehydration of 2-propanol</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electronic structure theory provides a foundation for understanding chemical transformations and processes in complex chemical environments. Our work is focused on the NWChemEx project that has selected two interrelated science challenges that address the production of advanced biomass-derived fuels and other value-added chemical compounds. One of which is the dehydration of 2-propanol over a zeolite catalyst. Aqueous phase dehydration of 2-propanol was investigated using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We considered and analyzed the thermochemistry of the dehydration of 2-propanol using NWChem calculations while the NWChemEx code is still under development. Realistically modeling the reaction in this study properly requires simulations using extended atomistic models. We validated our computational models by comparing the predicted outcomes for 2-propanol dehydration with the calculated results from 1-propanol dehydration studies. We used the first-principles DFT calculations to investigate aqueous phase dehydration of 2-propanol, examine the enthalpy of the 2-propanol reaction and computed the energy for geometry optimization for increasingly better basis sets: cc-pVDZ, cc-pVTZ, cc-pVQZ, cc-pV5Z, and cc-pV6Z. The various transition states and minima along the reaction pathway are critical to inform the NWChemEx science challenge calculations. In this work, we established how the accuracy of the calculations depends on the basis sets, and we determined what basis sets are needed to achieve sufficient accurate results. We also calculated the reaction free energy as a function of temperature as thermodynamic parameter. We found that at low temperature the reaction is thermodynamically unfavorable. Nevertheless, dehydrating 2-propanol increases entropy, underscoring the need for high temperatures to facilitate the reaction.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Global Natural Orbital Functional Approximation on Model Systems with Strong Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03554v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the past decade, natural orbital functional (NOF) approximations have emerged as prominent tools for characterizing electron correlation. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches, which rely on natural orbitals and their associated occupation numbers, often require hybridization with other methods to fully account for all correlation effects. Recently, a global NOF (GNOF) has been proposed [Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 233001 (2021)] to comprehensively address both dynamic and static correlations. This study evaluates the performance of GNOF on strongly correlated model systems, including comparisons with highly accurate Full Configuration Interaction (FCI) calculations for hydrogen atom clusters in one, two, and three dimensions. Additionally, the investigation extends to a BeH2 reaction, involving the insertion of a beryllium atom into a hydrogen molecule along a C2v pathway. According to the results obtained using GNOF, consistent behavior is observed across various correlation regions, encompassing a range of occupation and orbital schemes. Furthermore, distinctive features are identified when varying the dimensionality of the system.</description>

      <title>Quantifying spin contamination in algebraic diagrammatic construction theory of electronic excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Algebraic diagrammatic construction (ADC) is a computationally efficient approach for simulating excited electronic states, absorption spectra, and electron correlation. Due to their origin in perturbation theory, the single-reference ADC methods may be susceptible to spin contamination when applied to molecules with unpaired electrons. In this work, we develop an approach to quantify spin contamination in the ADC calculations of electronic excitations and apply it to a variety of open-shell molecules starting with either the unrestricted (UHF) or restricted open-shell (ROHF) Hartree-Fock reference wavefunctions. Our results show that the accuracy of low-order ADC approximations (ADC(2), ADC(3)) significantly decreases when the UHF reference spin contamination exceeds 0.05 a.u. Such strongly spin-contaminated molecules exhibit severe excited-state spin symmetry breaking that contributes to decreasing the quality of computed excitation energies and oscillator strengths. In a case study of phenyl radical, we demonstrate that spin contamination can significantly affect the simulated UV/Vis spectra, altering the relative energies, intensities, and order of electronic transitions. The results presented here motivate the development of spin-adapted ADC methods for open-shell molecules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13253v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Water molecules confined between biological membranes exhibit a distinctive non-Gaussian displacement distribution, far different from bulk water. Here, we introduce a new transport equation for water molecules in the intermembrane space, quantitatively explaining molecular dynamics simulation results. We find the unique transport dynamics of water molecules stems from the lateral diffusion coefficient fluctuation caused by their longitudinal motion. We also identify an interfacial region where water possesses distinct physical properties, unaffected by changes in the intermembrane separation.</description>
