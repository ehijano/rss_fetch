      <title>Trade execution games in a Markovian environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines a trade execution game for two large traders in a generalized price impact model. We incorporate a stochastic and sequentially dependent factor that exogenously affects the market price into financial markets. Our model accounts for how strategic and environmental uncertainties affect the large traders' execution strategies. We formulate an expected utility maximization problem for two large traders as a Markov game model. Applying the backward induction method of dynamic programming, we provide an explicit closed-form execution strategy at a Markov perfect equilibrium. Our theoretical results reveal that the execution strategy generally lies in a dynamic and non-randomized class; it becomes deterministic if the Markovian environment is also deterministic. In addition, our simulation-based numerical experiments suggest that the execution strategy captures various features observed in financial markets.</description>

      <title>Co-trading networks for modeling dynamic interdependency structures and estimating high-dimensional covariances in US equity markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.09382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The time proximity of trades across stocks reveals interesting topological structures of the equity market in the United States. In this article, we investigate how such concurrent cross-stock trading behaviors, which we denote as co-trading, shape the market structures and affect stock price co-movements. By leveraging a co-trading-based pairwise similarity measure, we propose a novel method to construct dynamic networks of stocks. Our empirical studies employ high-frequency limit order book data from 2017-01-03 to 2019-12-09. By applying spectral clustering on co-trading networks, we uncover economically meaningful clusters of stocks. Beyond the static Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) sectors, our data-driven clusters capture the time evolution of the dependency among stocks. Furthermore, we demonstrate statistically significant positive relations between low-latency co-trading and return covariance. With the aid of co-trading networks, we develop a robust estimator for high-dimensional covariance matrix, which yields superior economic value on portfolio allocation. The mean-variance portfolios based on our covariance estimates achieve both lower volatility and higher Sharpe ratios than standard benchmarks.</description>
