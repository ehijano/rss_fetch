      <title>A structural instability drives the VO2 metal-insulator transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: VO2 features concomitant structural and metal-insulator transitions. This poses a challenge for understanding the underlying mechanism: is the transition triggered by a structural or by an electronic instability? Here, we address this question by studying pre-transitional fluctuations in the metallic state. By measuring resonant diffuse X-ray scattering we find no evidence that spatial fluctuations of d-electrons are any different from those of vanadium ion cores. That is, charge and lattice remain coupled as they fluctuate jointly towards the insulating phase, strongly supporting the case that the VO2 metal-insulator transition is triggered by a structural instability. Our work offers a novel approach to solve similar problems in other strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <title>Spin nematic order and superconductivity in $J_1$-$J_2$ Kondo lattice model on square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate competition and cooperation of magnetic frustration and the Kondo effect in the $J_1$-$J_2$ Kondo lattice model on the square lattice at zero temperature. In this model, the frustrated interactions $J_1,J_2$ between the localized spins stabilize spin nematic orders, while the Kondo coupling favors local spin singlets. Using the slave boson mean field approximation, we find that the spin nematic order remains stable against small Kondo coupling, and the localized spins and the conduction electrons are effectively decoupled. On the other hand, a standard Fermi liquid state is formed for sufficiently strong Kondo interactions. Furthermore, in an intermediate region with moderate Kondo coupling, the spin nematic order and the Kondo effect coexist, and superconducting pairing of the conduction electrons is induced by the spinon pairing. We discuss the ground state phase diagram and nature of the quantum phase transitions between the different superconducting states.</description>

      <title>A Monte Carlo examination for the numerical values of universal quantities in spatial dimension two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By simulating a two-dimensional (2D) dimerized spin-1/2 antiferromagnet with the quantum Monte Carlo method, the numerical values of two universal quantities associated with the quantum critical regime (QCR), namely $S(\pi,\pi)/\left(\chi_s T\right)$ and $c/\left(T\xi\right)$, are determined. Here $S(\pi,\pi)$, $\chi_s$, $c$, $\xi,$ and $T$ are the staggered structure factor, the staggered susceptibility, the spin-wave velocity, the correlation length, and the temperature, respectively. For other QCR universal quantities, such as the Wilson ratio $W$ and $\chi_u c^2/T$ ($\chi_u$ is the uniform susceptibility), it is shown that the addition of higher order theoretical contribution makes the agreement between the numerical and the analytic results worse. We find that the same scenario applies to $S(\pi,\pi)/\left(\chi_s T\right)$ and $c/\left(T\xi\right)$ as well. Specifically, our calculations lead to $S(\pi,\pi)/\left(\chi_s T\right)\sim 1.073$ and $c/\left(T\xi\right)\sim 0.963$ which are in better consistence with the leading theoretical predictions than those with the next-to-leading order terms. The presented outcome here as well as those in some relevant literature suggest that it is desirable to conduct a refinement of the analytic calculation to resolve the puzzle of why the inclusion of higher order terms leads to less accurate predictions for these universal quantities.</description>

      <title>Pyrochlore NaYbO2: A potential Quantum Spin Liquid Candidate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for quantum spin liquids (QSL) and chemical doping in such materials to explore superconductivity have continuously attracted intense interest. Here, we report the discovery of a potential QSL candidate, pyrochlore-lattice beta-NaYbO2. Colorless and transparent NaYbO2 single crystals, layered alpha-NaYbO2 (~250 um on edge) and octahedral beta-NaYbO2 (~50 um on edge), were grown for the first time. Synchrotron X-ray single crystal diffraction unambiguously determined that the newfound beta-NaYbO2 belongs to the three-dimensional pyrochlore structure characterized by the R-3m space group, corroborated by synchrotron X-ray and neutron powder diffraction and pair distribution function. Magnetic measurements revealed no long-range magnetic order or spin glass behavior down to 0.4 K with a low boundary spin frustration factor of 17.5, suggesting a potential QSL ground state. Under high magnetic fields, the potential QSL state was broken and spins order. Our findings reveal that NaYbO2 is a fertile playground for studying novel quantum states.</description>

      <title>Anomalous temperature-dependent magnetization in the nearly collinear antiferromagnet Y$_2$Co$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Y$_2$Co$_3$ is a newly discovered antiferromagnetic (AFM) compound with distorted kagome layers. Previous investigations via bulk magnetization measurements suggested a complex noncollinear magnetic behavior, with magnetic moments primarily anti-aligned along the $b$ axis and some canting towards the $ac$ plane. In this study, we report the magnetic structure of Y$_2$Co$_3$ to be an A-type AFM structure with ferromagnetic (FM) interactions within the distorted kagome plane and an interplane antiferromagnetic interaction, as determined by single-crystal neutron diffraction. The magnetic moments align along the $b$ axis, with minimal canting towards the $c$ axis, at odds with the previous interpretation of bulk magnetization measurements. The magnetic moments on the two distinct Co sites are [0, -0.68(3), 0] $\mu_B$ and [0, 1.25(4), 0.07(1)] $\mu_B$. We attribute the previously reported "noncollinear" behavior to the considerable temperature dependence of itinerant AFM exchange interactions, induced by thermal contraction along the $b$ axis. Additionally, our examination of lattice constants through pressure studies reveals compensating effects on FM and AFM interactions, resulting in negligible pressure dependence of $T_\textrm{N}$.</description>

      <title>The significance of "stripes" in the physics of the cuprates, the Hubbard model, and other highly correlated electronic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: "Stripes" - meaning unidirectional charge-density-waves, sometimes (but not always) accompanied by spin-density-waves with twice the period - are now known to arise in broad swathes of the cuprate phase diagram, and appear as a strong ordering tendency in numerical studies of Hubbard-like models of highly correlated electron systems. Jan Zaanen's work played a seminal role in predicting their existence, and exploring their possible significance. They are {\it not} related to any weak-coupling physics associated with some form of Fermi-surface nesting. And whether one likes them or not, they are surprisingly difficult to avoid; in the Hubbard model, for example, they often appear as an alternative order that can out-compete the otherwise favored $d$-wave superconductivity.</description>

      <title>The geometric impact of the quantum Hall interface on a cone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, quantum Hall interface has become a popular subject of research; distinct from that of the quantum Hall edge, which is constrained by external background confinement, the interface has the freedom to move, likely towards a string-like state. In disk geometry, it was known that the interface energy has an extra correction due to its curvature which depends on the size of the disk. In this work, we analytically calculate the energy of the integer quantum Hall interface on a cone surface which has the advantage that its curvature is more easily adjustable. By tuning the length and curvature of the interface by the cone angle parameter $\beta$, we analyze the dependence of the quantum Hall interface energy on the curvature and verify this geometric correction. Moreover, we find that the tip of the cone geometry has an extra contribution to the energy that reflects on the $u_2,u_4$ term.</description>

      <title>Absence of two-phonon quasi-elastic scattering in the normal state of doped--SrTiO$_3$ by THz pump-probe spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-pulse nonlinear THz spectroscopies enable a new understanding of interacting metallic systems via their sensitivity to novel correlation functions. Here, we investigated the THz nonlinear properties of the dilute metallic phase of doped-SrTiO$_3$ thin films using nonlinear terahertz 2D coherent spectroscopy. We observed a large $\chi^{(3)}$ response in the low temperature region where the dc electrical resistivity follows a T$^2$-dependence. This is largely a pump-probe response, which we find is governed by a single energy relaxation rate that is much smaller at all temperatures than the momentum relaxation rates obtained from the optical conductivity. This indicates that the processes that dominate the resistive scattering are not the same as those that remove energy from the electronic system. Moreover the fact that the energy relaxation rate is an increasing function of temperature indicates that the excitations that do carry away energy from the electronic system cannot be considered as quasi-elastic and as such soft two-phonon electron scattering does not play a major role in the physics as proposed. This indicates that these materials' resistive T$^2$ scattering likely originates in electron-electron interactions despite the very small Fermi wave vectors at the lowest dopings.</description>

      <title>Eigenstate solutions of the Fermi-Hubbard model via symmetry-enhanced variational quantum eigensolver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), as a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm, is an important tool for effective quantum computing in the current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. However, the traditional hardware-efficient ansatz without taking into account symmetries requires more computational resources to explore the unnecessary regions in the Hilbert space. The conventional Subspace-Search VQE (SSVQE) algorithm, which can calculate excited states, is also unable to effectively handle degenerate states since the loss function only contains the expectation value of the Hamiltonian. In this study, the energy eigenstates of the one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model with two lattice sites and the two-dimensional Hubbard model with four lattice sites are calculated. By incorporating symmetries into the quantum circuits and loss function, we find that both the ground state and excited state calculations are improved greatly compared to the case without symmetries. The enhancement in excited state calculations is particularly significant. This is because quantum circuits that conserve the particle number are used, and appropriate penalty terms are added to the loss function, enabling the optimization process to correctly identify degenerate states. The results are verified through repeated simulations.</description>

      <title>Magnetoelastic coupling in the stretched diamond lattice of TbTaO$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic structure of diamond-like lattice has been studied extensively in terms of the magnetic frustration. Here we report the distortion of stretched diamond lattice of Tb$^{3+}$ (4$f^8$) in M-TbTaO$_4$ on application of a magnetic field. We have investigated the structural and magnetic properties of M phase terbium tantalate M-TbTaO$_4$ as a function of temperature and magnetic field using magnetometry and powder neutron diffraction. Sharp ${\lambda}$-shape transitions in $d(\chi T)/dT$, $dM/dH$ and specific heat data confirm the previously reported three-dimensional (3D) antiferromagnetic ordering at $T_N \approx 2.25$ K. On application of a magnetic field the N\'eel temperature is found to decrease and variable field neutron diffraction experiments below $T_N$ at 1.6 K show an increase in both the bond and angle distortion of the stretched diamond lattice with magnetic field, indicating a potential magneto-elastic coupling effect. By combining our magnetometry, heat capacity and neutron diffraction results we generate a magnetic phase diagram for M-TbTaO$_4$ as a function of temperature and field.</description>

      <title>Strongly correlated states of transition metal spin defects: the case of an iron impurity in aluminum nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the electronic properties of an exemplar transition metal impurity in an insulator, with the goal of accurately describing strongly correlated, defect states. We consider iron in aluminum nitride, a material of interest for hybrid quantum technologies, and we carry out calculations with quantum embedding methods -- density matrix embedding theory (DMET) and quantum defect embedding theory (QDET) and with spin-flip time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). We show that both DMET and QDET accurately describe the ground state and low-lying excited states of the defect, and that TDDFT yields photoluminescence spectra in agreement with experiments. In addition, we provide a detailed discussion of the convergence of our results as a function of the active space used in the embedding methods, thus defining a protocol to obtain converged data, directly comparable with experiments.</description>

      <title>Twisted gauging and topological sectors in (2+1)d abelian lattice gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a two-dimensional quantum lattice model with an abelian gauge theory interpretation, we investigate a duality operation that amounts to gauging its invertible 1-form symmetry, followed by gauging the resulting 0-form symmetry in a twisted way via a choice of discrete torsion. Using tensor networks, we introduce explicit lattice realisations of the so-called condensation defects, which are obtained by gauging the 1-form symmetry along submanifolds of spacetime, and employ the same calculus to realise the duality operators. By leveraging these tensor network operators, we compute the non-trivial interplay between symmetry-twisted boundary conditions and charge sectors under the duality operation, enabling us to construct isometries relating the dual Hamiltonians. Whenever a lattice gauge theory is left invariant under the duality operation, we explore the possibility of promoting the self-duality to an internal symmetry. We argue that this results in a symmetry structure that encodes the 2-representations of a 2-group.</description>

      <title>Optimizing the Critical Temperature and Superfluid Density of a Metal-Superconductor Bilayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A promising path to realizing higher superconducting transition temperatures $T_c$ is the strategic engineering of artificial heterostructures. For example, quantum materials exhibiting some but not all of the characteristics necessary for a robust superconducting state could, in principle, be coupled with other materials in a way that alleviates their intrinsic shortcomings. In this work, we add numerical support to the hypothesis that a strongly interacting superconductor weakened by phase fluctuations can boost its $T_c$ by hybridizing the system with a metal. Using determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC), we simulate a two-dimensional bilayer composed of an attractive Hubbard model and a metallic layer in two regimes of the interaction strength $-|U|$. In the strongly interacting regime, we find that increasing the interlayer hybridization $t_\perp$ results in a nonmonotonic enhancement of $T_c$, with an optimal value comparable to the maximum $T_c$ observed in the single-layer attractive Hubbard model, confirming trends inferred from other approaches. In the intermediate coupling regime, when $-|U|$ is close to the value associated with the maximum $T_c$ of the single-layer model, increasing $t_\perp$ tends to decrease $T_c$, implying that the correlated layer was already optimally tuned. Importantly, we demonstrate that the mechanism behind these trends is related to enhancement in the superfluid stiffness, as was initially proposed by Kivelson [Physica B: Condensed Matter 318, 61 (2002)].</description>

      <title>Spin-imbalance induced buried topological edge currents in Mott \&amp; topological insulator heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the heterostructure between a ferrimagnetic Mott insulator and a time-reversal invariant topological band insulator on the two-dimensional Lieb lattice with periodic boundary conditions. Our Hartree-Fock and slave-rotor mean-field results incorporate long-range Coulomb interactions. We present charge and magnetic reconstructions at the two edges of the heterostructure and reveal how \textit{buried} topological edge modes adapt to these heterostructure edge reconstructions. In particular, we demonstrate that the interface magnetic field induces a spin imbalance in the edge modes while preserving their topological character and metallic nature. We show that this imbalance leads to topologically protected buried spin and charge currents. The inherent spin-momentum locking ensures that left and right movers contribute to the current at the two buried interfaces in opposite directions. We show that the magnitude of the spin-imbalance induced charge and spin current can be tuned by adjusting the spin-orbit coupling of the bulk topological insulator relative to the correlation strength of the bulk Mott insulator. Thus, our results demonstrate a controlled conversion of a spin Hall effect into an analog of a charge Hall effect driven by band topology and interaction effects. These topologically protected charge and spin currents pave the way for advances in low-energy electronics and spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Complete classification of integrability and non-integrability of S=1/2 spin chains with symmetric next-nearest-neighbor interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study S=1/2 quantum spin chains with shift-invariant and inversion-symmetric next-nearest-neighbor interaction, also known as zigzag spin chains. We completely classify the integrability and non-integrability of the above class of spin systems. We prove that in this class there are only two integrable models, a classical model and a model solvable by the Bethe ansatz, and all the remaining systems are non-integrable. Our classification theorem confirms that within this class of spin chains, there is no missing integrable model. This theorem also implies the absence of intermediate models with a finite number of local conserved quantities.</description>

      <title>Overdoping YBa2Cu3O7 via a heterostructure with La0.67Sr0.33MnO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: YBa2Cu3Ox, the first superconductor discovered with Tc higher than 77 K, is among the most complex cuprates having both CuO chains and plains in the structure. YBa2Cu3O7 (YBCO) exhibits slightly overdoped behavior and further doping is difficult as all the lattice sites in the CuO chains are occupied. We have grown high quality single crystalline films of YBCO and bilayer La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 (LSMO)/YBCO exhibiting superconductivity in both the cases. Photoemission spectra reveal different surface and bulk electronic structures; the difference reduces in the bilayer. Evidence of charge transfer across the bilayer interface is observed in the valence band and core level spectra indicating an overdoped condition in YBCO. While superconductivity in the presence of magnetic order in the bilayer is puzzling, this pathway to reach overdoped regime in YBCO opens up a new landscape to probe the exotic physics of unconventional superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Circular dichroism in resonant inelastic x-ray scattering from birefringence in CuO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) has become a prominent technique to study quasiparticle excitations. With advances in polarization analysis capabilities at different facilities, RIXS offers exceptional potential for investigating symmetry-broken quasiparticles like chiral phonons and magnons. At optical wavelengths birefringence can severely affect polarization states in low-symmetry systems. Here we show its importance for soft x-ray resonances. Given the growing interest in Circular Dichroism (CD) in RIXS, it is important to evaluate how birefringence may affect the RIXS spectra of anisotropic systems. We investigate CuO, a well-known anisotropic material, using Cu $L_3$-edge RIXS and detect significant CD in both magnetic and orbital excitations in the collinear antiferromagnetic phase. We demonstrate that the CD can be modeled by a proper treatment of RIXS scattering amplitudes derived from single-ion calculations with birefringence. Recognizing these effects is crucial for unambiguous identification of subtle dichroic effects induced by symmetry-broken quasiparticles. Furthermore, the combined sensitivity of RIXS and birefringence to local symmetry presents an opportunity to study microscopic changes driven by external perturbations.</description>

      <title>Critical Current Density and AC Magnetic Susceptibility of High-quality FeTe$_{0.5}$Se$_{0.5}$ Superconducting Tapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Iron telluride-selenium superconducting materials, known for their non-toxicity, ease of preparation, simple structure, and high upper critical fields, have attracted much research interest in practical application. In this work, we conducted electrical transport measurements, magneto-optical imaging, and AC magnetic susceptibility measurements on FeTe$_{0.5}$Se$_{0.5}$ superconducting long tapes fabricated via reel-to-reel pulsed laser deposition. Our transport measurements revealed a high critical current density that remains relatively stable even with increasing external magnetic fields, reaching over $1\times 10^5$ A/cm$^2$ at 8 K and 9 T. The calculated pinning force density indicates that normal point pinning is the primary mechanism in these tapes. The magneto-optical images demonstrated that the tapes show homogeneous superconductivity and uniform distribution of critical current density. The AC magnetic susceptibility measurements also confirmed their strong flux pinning nature of withstanding high magnetic field. Based on these characteristics, FeTe$_{0.5}$Se$_{0.5}$ superconducting tapes show promising prospects for applications under high magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Expediting quantum state transfer through long-range extended XY model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Going beyond short-range interactions, we explore the role of long-range interactions in the extended XY model for transferring quantum states through evolution. In particular, employing a spin-1/2 chain with interactions decaying as a power law, we demonstrate that long-range interactions significantly enhance the efficiency of a quantum state transfer (QST) protocol, reducing the minimum time required to achieve fidelity beyond the classical limit. Our study identifies the long-range regime as providing an optimal balance between interaction range and transfer efficiency, outperforming the protocol with the short-range interacting model. Our detailed analysis reveals the impact of system parameters, such as anisotropy, magnetic field strength, and coordination number, on QST dynamics. Specifically, we find that intermediate coordination numbers lead to a faster and more reliable state transfer, while extreme values diminish performance. Further, we exhibit that the presence of long-range interactions also improves the achievable fidelity, mitigating its decline associated with increasing system-size.</description>

      <title>Transition Metal-Driven Variations in Structure, Magnetism, and Photocatalysis of Monoclinic M3Se4 (M = Fe, Co, Ni) Nanoparticles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transition metal selenides (MxSey) have gained attention for their unique physical and chemical properties, especially those associated with the transition metal (M). Despite advancements in synthesis, fabricating these selenides is challenging due to their complex stoichiometry and high asymmetry. One such system is monoclinic iron selenide (Fe3Se4), which can be used in permanent-magnet technologies and serve as a model system for understanding magnetism. This study focuses on fabricating monoclinic M3Se4 (M = Fe, Co, or Ni) compounds via thermal decomposition, examining how solution chemistry influences their morphology and properties. With a Curie temperature of about 322 K, Fe3Se4 is ferrimagnetic, whereas Co3Se4 and Ni3Se4 are paramagnetic between 5 and 300 K. The latter two compounds also show higher catalytic activity for hydrogen evolution in water splitting, with maximum H2-evolution rates of 1.01, 5.16, and 6.83 mmol h-1g-1 for Fe3Se4, Co3Se4, and Ni3Se4, respectively.</description>

Abstract: The boundary critical behavior of the two-dimensional (2D) quantum antiferromagnetic (AF) XXZ model coupled with either a dangling spin-1/2 XXZ chain or a dangling two-leg ladder on the boundary is studied with the bosonization and renormalization group analysis. A rich boundary phase diagram is obtained in each case. In the dangling chain case, the boundary either develops a long-range AF order in the easy-plane or the easy-axis direction with extraordinary critical behavior, or has a valence bond solid order with ordinary boundary critical behavior. In the case of a dangling two-leg ladder, besides the possible easy-plane or easy-axis AF ordered phases on the boundary with extraordinary critical behavior, the boundary can form a singlet phase with ordinary critical behavior without breaking any symmetry. These results are consistent with recent numerical simulations on the boundary critical behavior of 2D quantum spin models.</description>

      <title>Noncollinear phase of the antiferromagnetic sawtooth chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The antiferromagnetic sawtooth chain is a prototypical example of a frustrated spin system with vertex-sharing triangles, giving rise to complex quantum states. Depending on the interaction parameters, this system has three phases, of which the gapless non-collinear phase (for strongly coupled basal spins and loosely attached apical spins) has received little theoretical attention so far. In this work, we comprehensively investigate the properties of the non-collinear phase using large-scale tensor network computations which exploit the full SU(2) symmetry of the underlying Heisenberg model. We study the ground state both for finite systems using the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) as well as for infinite chains via the variational uniform matrix-product state (VUMPS) formalism. Finite temperatures and correlation functions are tackled via imaginary- or real time evolutions, which we implement using the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP). We find that the non-collinear phase is characterized by a low-momentum peak and a diffuse tail for the apex-apex correlations. Deep into the phase, the pattern sharpens into a peak indicating a 90-degree spiral. The apical spins are soft and highly susceptible to external perturbations; they give rise to a large number of gapless magnetic states that are polarized by weak fields and cause a long low-temperature tail in the specific heat. The dynamic spin-structure factor exhibits additive contributions from a two-spinon continuum (excitations of the basal chain) and a gapless peak at $k=\pi/2$ (excitations of the apical spins). Small temperatures excite the gapless states and smear the spectral weight of the $k=\pi/2$ peak out into a homogeneous flat-band structure. Our results are relevant, e.g., for the material atacamite Cu$_2$Cl(OH)$_3$ in high magnetic fields.</description>

Abstract: A new implementation of many-body calculations is of paramount importance in the field of computational physics. In this study, we leverage the capabilities of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) for conducting quantum many-body calculations. Through the design of appropriate schemes for Monte Carlo and tensor network methods, we effectively utilize the parallel processing capabilities provided by FPGAs. This has resulted in a tenfold speedup compared to CPU-based computation for a Monte Carlo algorithm. By using a supercell structure and simulating the FPGA architecture on a CPU with High-Level Synthesis, we achieve $O(1)$ scaling for the time of one sweep, regardless of the overall system size. We also demonstrate, for the first time, the utilization of FPGA to accelerate a typical tensor network algorithm for many-body ground state calculations. Additionally, we show that the current FPGA computing acceleration is on par with that of multi-threaded GPU parallel processing. Our findings unambiguously highlight the significant advantages of hardware implementation and pave the way for novel approaches to many-body calculations.</description>

Abstract: Altermagnetism, a type of magnetic order that combines properties of ferro- and antiferromagnets, has stirred great interest lately not only as a promising source of spintronics applications, but also as a potential gateway to exotic phases of matter. Here, we demonstrate how to generalize collinear altermagnetism to SU($N$) magnets with $N&gt;2$. Guided by symmetry principles, we present a recipe to construct Heisenberg models for such generalized altermagnets and apply it explicitly for $N=3,4$. Using flavor-wave theory, we compute the excitation spectrum of a two-dimensional SU(3) model and show that it exhibits magnon bands with altermagnetic splitting according to magnetic quantum numbers; we connect this quantum-number splitting to the frequently used concept of magnon chirality. We also compute the electronic band structure for a metallic system of the same symmetry and map out the polarization of the resulting flavor-split bands.</description>

      <title>Giant Impurity Effects on Charge Loop Current Order States in Kagome Metals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The exotic electronic states in the charge loop current (cLC) phase, in which the permanent charge current breaks the time-reversal-symmetry (TRS), have been attracting increasing attention in recently discovered kagome metal AV3Sb5 (A = Cs, Rb, K). Interestingly, the cLC state is sensitively controlled by applying small magnetic field as well as tiny uniaxial strain. In addition, many experiments indicate that the cLC state is sensitive to the small number of impurities. To understand the impurity effects on the cLC electronic states accurately, we analyze the giant unit-cell (up to 1200 sites) kagome lattice model with single impurity potential. The loop current is found to be strongly suppressed within the current correlation length $\xi_J$ centered on the impurity site, where $\xi_J$ increases as the cLC order parameter $\eta$ decreases. (The cLC order is the pure imaginary hopping integral modulation $\delta t_{i,j}=\pm i\eta$.) In addition, both the uniform orbital magnetization $M_{orb}$ and the anomalous Hall conductivity $\sigma_{xy}$ are drastically suppressed by dilute impurities. Especially, the suppression ratio $R=-\Delta M_{orb}/M_{orb}^0$ can exceed 50% by introducing $\sim1\,\%$ impurities. Unexpectedly, the ratio $R$ is qualitatively insensitive to $\eta$, in highly contrast to a naive expectation that $R$ is proportional to the current suppression area $\pi \xi_J^2$. The obtained giant impurity effect of $M_{orb}$ would originate from the non-local contribution from the itinerant circulation of electrons. The present study gives a natural explanation why the cLC electronic states in kagome metals are sensitive to the dilute impurities.</description>

      <title>Comparison of superconducting pairing in doped cuprates and nickelates within an extended Hubbard model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within a Hubbard model, we investigate the superconducting pairing behavior of infinite-layer nickelate $\mathrm{NdNiO_2}$ and cuprate superconductors by using the determinant quantum Monte Carlo method. Our focus is on comparing their dominant pairing symmetries. The results indicate that the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing interaction is significantly enhanced at low temperatures in both doped nickelates and cuprates, whereas other typical pairing symmetries are effectively suppressed, highlighting the dominance of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing form. Additionally, we find that the effective pairing interaction for $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing in doped nickelates is slightly lower than that in doped cuprates, which may be attributed to the different degrees of Fermi surface warping caused by the third-nearest hopping $t''$. Further studies show that the hole doping and interaction strength have significant effects on the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing interaction within the selected parameter range. The $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing interaction is notably weakened when the hole doping increases, whereas it is significantly enhanced with increasing Coulomb interaction strength $U$. This comparative analysis reveals the similarities and differences in the pairing behaviors of doped nickelates and cuprates, which may provide further insights into understanding the superconducting properties of these two classes of materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21102v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We solve a model of electrons with Hubbard-$U$ Coulomb repulsion and a random Yukawa coupling to a two-dimensional bosonic bath, using an extended dynamical mean field theory scheme. Our model exhibits a quantum critical point, at which the repulsive component of the electron interactions strongly enhances the effects of the quantum critical bosonic fluctuations on the electrons, leading to a breakdown of Fermi liquid physics and the formation of a strange metal with `Planckian' ($\mathcal{O}(k_B T/\hbar)$) quasiparticle decay rates at low temperatures $T\rightarrow 0$. Furthermore, the eventual Mott transition that occurs as the repulsion is increased seemingly bounds the maximum decay rate in the strange metal. Our results provide insight into low-temperature strange metallicity observed in proximity to a Mott transition, as is observed, for instance, in recent experiments on certain moir\'{e} materials.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal Moments in the Chern Bands of Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) has elements in common with two paradigmatic examples of strongly correlated physics: quantum Hall physics and Hubbard physics. On one hand, TBG hosts flat topological Landau-level-like bands which exhibits quantum anomalous Hall effects. On the other hand, these bands have concentrated charge density and show signs of extensive entropy resembling local moments. The combination of these features leads to a question: can decoupled moments emerge in an isolated topological band, despite the lack of exponentially localized Wannier states? In this work, we answer the question affirmatively by proposing a minimal model for these bands in TBG that combines topology and charge concentration at the AA sites, leading to analytic wavefunctions that closely approximate those of the BM model with realistic parameters. Importantly, charge concentration also leads to Berry curvature concentration at $\Gamma$, generating a small parameter $s$ that yields analytic tractability. We show that, rather surprisingly, the model hosts nearly decoupled flavor moments without any extra degrees of freedom. These moments are non-local due to topology-enforced power-law tails, yet have parametrically small overlap. We further develop a diagrammatic expansion in which the self energy can be computed exactly to leading order in $s^2$ in the fluctuating moment regime. At charge neutrality, we find a "Mott semimetal", with large flavor entropy and a Mott gap everywhere in the BZ except for the vicinity of the $\Gamma$ point. Away from neutrality, the Mott semimetal gaps out in a spectrally imbalanced manner, with one Mott band having zero $Z_k$ at the $\Gamma$ point. The model accurately reproduces results from finite temperature thermodynamic measurements, leads to new experimental predictions, and resolves the problem of the emergence of Hubbard physics in isolated topological bands.</description>

      <title>Interplay of Quantum and Thermal Fluctuations in Two-Dimensional Randomly Pinned Charge Density Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interplay between quantum and thermal fluctuations in the presence of quenched random disorder is a long-standing open theoretical problem which has been made more urgent by advances in modern experimental techniques. The fragility of charge density wave order to impurities makes this problem of particular interest in understanding a host of real materials, including the cuprate high-temperature superconductors. To address this question, we consider the quantum version of an exactly solvable classical model of two-dimensional randomly pinned incommensurate charge density waves first introduced by us in a recent work, and use the large-$N$ technique to obtain the phase diagram and order parameter correlations. Our theory considers quantum and thermal fluctuations and disorder on equal footing by accounting for all effects non-perturbatively, which reveals a novel crossover between under-damped and over-damped dynamics of the fluctuations of the charge density wave order parameter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A theory of the normal and superconducting states of piezomagnetic metals, which are altermagnetic materials, has been developed. This has been done in comparison with the corresponding theoretical description for metals that do not have spatial inversion symmetry. Particular attention has been paid to the problem of the anomalous Hall effect, and its absence has been demonstrated in both altermagnetic and non-centrosymmetric metals. It has been shown that the superconducting state in altermagnets always arises by pairing electrons from zones split by spin-orbit interaction, which makes the existence of such superconductors unlikely.</description>

      <title>On the pseudo-doublet ground state of the non-Kramers compound SrTm2O4 and its frustrated antiferromagnetic interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here we present experimental evidence of the pseudo-doublet ground state of the non-Kramers compound SrTm2O4, based on specific heat, magnetic entropy and electron paramagnetic resonance. We demonstrate that the two crystallographic Tm3+ sites give rise to distinct single-ion anisotropies, and by extension, SrTm2O4 hosts two magnetic sublattices. Inelastic neutron scattering reveals low-lying dispersing crystal-field excitations, which we modelled using an effective charge model and mean field random phase approximation. The extracted magnetic exchange interactions are both antiferromagnetic and frustrated for both chains. Interchain magnetic exchange interactions are negligible. The strength of the magnetic exchange interactions in relation to the size of crystal field gaps, together with the frustration and low dimensionality, force the system to remain paramagnetic down to the lowest experimentally reachable temperature despite the pseudo-doublet nature of its ground state.</description>

Abstract: Topological qubits are inherently resistant to noise and errors. However, experimental demonstrations have been elusive as their realization and control is highly complex. In the present work, we demonstrate the emergence of topological $X$-states in the long-time response of a locally perturbed quantum impurity model. The emergence of the double-qubit state is heralded by the lack of decay of the response function as well as the out-of-time order correlator signifying the trapping of excitations, and hence information in local edge modes.</description>

      <title>Ab initio quantum many-body description of superconducting trends in the cuprates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.16561v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a systematic ab initio quantum many-body approach that goes beyond low-energy models, we directly compute the superconducting pairing order and estimate the pairing gap of several doped cuprate materials and structures within a purely electronic picture. We find that we can correctly capture two well-known trends: the pressure effect, where the pairing order and gap increase with intra-layer pressure, and the layer effect, where the pairing order and gap vary with the number of copper-oxygen layers. From these calculations, we observe that the strength of superexchange and the covalency at optimal doping are the best descriptors for these trends. Our microscopic analysis further identifies that strong short-range spin fluctuations and multi-orbital charge fluctuations drive the development of the pairing order. Our work illustrates the possibility of a material-specific ab initio understanding of unconventional high-temperature superconducting materials.</description>

      <title>Entanglement of weighted graphs uncovers transitions in variable-range interacting models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cluster state acquired by evolving the nearest-neighbor (NN) Ising model from a completely separable state is the resource for measurement-based quantum computation. Instead of an NN system, a variable-range power law interacting Ising model can generate a genuine multipartite entangled (GME) weighted graph state (WGS) that may reveal intrinsic characteristics of the evolving Hamiltonian. We establish that the pattern of generalized geometric measure (GGM) in the evolved state with an arbitrary number of qubits is sensitive to fall-off rates and the range of interactions of the evolving Hamiltonian. We report that the time-derivative and time-averaged GGM at a particular time can detect the transition points present in the fall-off rates of the interaction strength, separating different regions, namely long-range, quasi-local and local ones in one- and two-dimensional lattices with deformation. Moreover, we illustrate that in the quasi-local and local regimes, there exists a minimum coordination number in the evolving Ising model for a fixed total number of qubits which can mimic the GGM of the long-range model. In order to achieve a finite-size subsystem from the entire system, we design a local measurement strategy that allows a WGS of an arbitrary number of qubits to be reduced to a local unitarily equivalent WGS having fewer qubits with modified weights.</description>

      <title>Hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for the transverse-field Ising model in the thermodynamic limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07600v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a hybrid quantum-classical approach to treat quantum many-body systems in the thermodynamic limit. This is done by combining numerical linked-cluster expansions (NLCE) with the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). Here, the VQE algorithm is used as a cluster solver within the NLCE. We test our hybrid quantum-classical algorithm (NLCE$+$VQE) for the ferromagnetic transverse-field Ising model on the one-dimensional chain and the two-dimensional square lattice. The calculation of ground-state energies on each open cluster demands a modified Hamiltonian variational ansatz for the VQE. One major finding is convergence of NLCE$+$VQE to the conventional NLCE result in the thermodynamic limit when at least $N/2$ layers are used in the VQE ansatz for each cluster with $N$ sites. Our approach demonstrates the fruitful connection of techniques known from correlated quantum many-body systems with hybrid algorithms explored on existing quantum-computing devices.</description>

      <title>Exact, Average, and Broken Symmetries in a Simple Adaptive Monitored Circuit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry is a powerful tool for understanding phases of matter in equilibrium. Quantum circuits with measurements have recently emerged as a platform for novel states of matter intrinsically out of equilibrium. Can symmetry be used as an organizing principle for these novel states, their phases and phase transitions? In this work, we give an affirmative answer to this question in a simple adaptive monitored circuit, which hosts an ordering transition in addition to a separate entanglement transition, upon tuning a single parameter. Starting from a symmetry-breaking initial state, depending on the tuning parameter, the steady state could (i) remain symmetry-broken, (ii) exhibit the average symmetry in the ensemble of trajectories, or (iii) exhibit the exact symmetry for each trajectory. The ordering transition is mapped to the transition in a classical majority vote model, described by the Ising universality class, while the entanglement transition lies in the percolation class. Numerical simulations are further presented to support the analytical understandings.</description>

      <title>Combined X-ray diffraction, electrical resistivity, and $ab$ $initio$ study of (TMTTF)$_2$PF$_6$ under pressure: implications to the unified phase diagram</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a combined experimental and theoretical study on the quasi-one-dimensional organic conductor (TMTTF)$_2$PF$_6$, and elucidate the variation of its physical properties under pressure. We fully resolve the crystal structure by single crystal x-ray diffraction measurements using a diamond anvil cell up to 8 GPa, and based on the structural data, we perform first-principles density-functional theory calculations and derive the $ab$ $initio$ extended Hubbard-type Hamiltonians. Furthermore, we compare the behavior of the resistivity measured up to 3 GPa using a BeCu clamp-type cell and the ground state properties of the obtained model numerically calculated by the many-variable variational Monte Carlo method. Our main findings are as follows: i) The crystal was rapidly compressed up to about 3 GPa where the volume drops to 80% and gradually varies down to 70% at 8 GPa. The transfer integrals increase following such behavior whereas the screened Coulomb interactions decrease, resulting in a drastic reduction of correlation effect. ii) The degree of dimerization in the intrachain transfer integrals, as the result of the decrease in structural dimerization together with the change in the intermolecular configuration, almost disappears above 4 GPa; the interchain transfer integrals also show characteristic variations under pressure. iii) The results of identifying the characteristic temperatures in the resistivity and the charge and spin orderings in the calculations show an overall agreement: The charge ordering sensitively becomes unstable above 1 GPa, while the spin ordering survives up to higher pressures. These results shed light on the similarities and differences between applying external pressure and substituting the chemical species (chemical pressure).</description>

Abstract: In this paper we investigate the shear viscoelasticity and the hydrodynamic modes in a holographic solid model with several sets of axions that all break the translations spontaneously on boundary. Comparing with the single-axion model, the shear modulus is enhanced at high temperatures and the shear viscosity is always suppressed in the presence of additional axions. However, the different sets of axions exhibit competitive relationship in determining the shear modulus at low temperatures. Furthermore, by calculating the black hole quasi-normal modes, it is found that adding more axions only increases the amount of diffusive modes. The number of the sound modes always remains unchanged.</description>

      <title>Lindblad quantum dynamics from correlation functions of classical spin chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12396v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lindblad quantum master equation is one of the central approaches to the physics of open quantum systems. In particular, boundary driving enables the study of transport, where a steady state emerges in the long-time limit, which features a constant current and a characteristic density profile. While the Lindblad equation complements other approaches to transport in closed quantum systems, it has become clear that a connection between closed and open systems exists in certain cases. Here, we build on this connection for magnetization transport in the spin-1/2 XXZ chain with and without integrability-breaking perturbations. Specifically, we study the question whether the time evolution of the open quantum system can be described on the basis of classical correlation functions, as generated by the Hamiltonian equations of motion for real vectors. By comparing to exact numerical simulations of the Lindblad equation, we find a good accuracy of such a description for a range of model parameters, which is consistent with previous studies on closed systems. While this agreement is an interesting physical observation, it also suggests that classical mechanics can be used to solve the Lindblad equation for comparatively large system sizes, which lie outside the possibilities of a quantum mechanical treatment. We also point out counterexamples and limitations for the quantitative extraction of transport coefficients. Remarkably, our classical approach to large open systems allows to detect superdiffusion at the isotropic point.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10698v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This note provides a comprehensive examination of the various approaches to formulating relativistic hydrodynamics, with a particular emphasis on the canonical approach. Relativistic hydrodynamics plays a crucial role in understanding the behavior of fluids in high-energy astrophysical phenomena and heavy-ion collisions. The canonical approach is explored in detail, highlighting its foundational principles, mathematical formulations, and practical implications in modeling relativistic fluid dynamics. Following this, we delve into the linear response theory, elucidating its relevance in the context of hydrodynamics. We analyze the response of relativistic fluids to external perturbations, discussing the theoretical framework and key results. This dual focus aims to bridge the gap between theoretical foundations and practical applications, offering a robust perspective on the dynamic interplay between relativistic hydrodynamics and linear response theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent experimental and theoretical development in the Quantum Hall effect in monolayer graphene showed that the previous model of the valley-anisotropy interaction is incomplete, as it was assumed to be ultra-short range (USR). In this work, we use exact diagonalization to go beyond the ultra-short range to find the different phases for $\nu=2/3$. We model the interaction as Yukawa so that we can control the range as a proof of concept. Even in this simple setting, we discovered how dropping the USR condition shifts the transition borders in favour of certain phases, leads to a new bond-ordered phase appearing, and breaks the ferromagnetic phase in two competing states as a result of lifting the USR-driven degeneracy.</description>

Abstract: The development of future quantum devices requires understanding the dynamics of driven many-body systems, in which the Floquet-induced interactions play a central role. This understanding is crucial for coherently controlling quantum states, minimising errors, and benchmarking the performance of these devices. In this thesis, we analyse the enhancement on the Floquet-induced interactions by many-body correlations, and develop an advanced Floquet method to understand the Floquet-induced interactions relevant for future quantum devices.</description>

Abstract: Discovering and categorizing quantum orders in mixed many-body systems are currently one of the most important problems. Specific types of decoherence applied to typical quantum many-body states can induce a novel kind of mixed state accompanying characteristic symmetry orders, which has no counterparts in pure many-body states. We study phenomena generated by interplay between two types of decoherence applied to the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model (TFIM). We show that in the doubled Hilbert space formalism, the decoherence can be described by filtering operation applied to matrix product states (MPS) defined in the doubled Hilbert system. The filtering operation induces specific deformation of the MPS, which approximates the ground state of a certain parent Hamiltonian in the doubled Hilbert space. In the present case, such a parent Hamiltonian is the quantum Ashkin-Teller model, having a rich phase diagram with a critical lines and quantum phase transitions. By investigating the deformed MPS, we find various types of mixed states emergent from the ground states of the TFIM, and clarify phase transitions between them. In that study, strong and weak $Z_2$ symmetries play an important role, for which we introduce efficient order parameters, such as R\'{e}nyi-2 correlators, entanglement entropy, etc., in the doubled Hilbert space.</description>
