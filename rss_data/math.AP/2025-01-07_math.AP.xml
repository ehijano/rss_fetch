      <title>The radiative transport equation with waiting time and its diffusion approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Albeit the past intensive research, the governing equation of anomalous diffusion which is observed for the transport of particles underground is still an open problem. In this paper, as a governing equation, the advection-diffusion equation with a time-fractional derivative term is derived from the radiative transport equation with an integral term for waiting time.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical Green functions and Lagrangian intersection. Applications to the propagation of Bessel beams in non-homogeneous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study semi-classical asymptotics for problems with localized right-hand sides by considering a Hamiltonian $H(x,p)$ positively homogeneous of degree $m\geq1$ on $T^*{\bf R}^n\setminus0$. The energy shell is $H(x,p)=E$, and the right-hand side $f_h$ is microlocalized: (1) on the vertical plane $\Lambda_0=\{x=x_0\}$; (2) on the ``cylinder'' $\Lambda_0=\{(X,P)=\bigl(\varphi\omega(\psi),\omega(\psi)\bigr); \ \varphi\in {\bf R}, \omega(\psi)=(\cos\psi,\sin\psi)\}$. when $n=2$. Most precise results are obtained in the isotropic case $H(x,p)={|p|^m\over\rho(x)}$, with $\rho$ a smooth positive function. In case (2), $\Lambda_0$ is the frequency set of Bessel function $J_0({|x|\over h})$, and the solution $u_h$ of $(H(x,hD_x)-E)u_h=f_h$ when $m=1$, already provides an insight in the structure of ``Bessel beams'', which arise in the theory of optical fibers. We present in this work some extensions of A.Anikin, S.Dobrokhotov, V.Nazaikinskii, M.Rouleux, Theor. Math. Phys. 214(1): p.1-23, 2023. In Sect.3 we sketch the semi-classical counterpart of the construction of parametrices for the Cauchy problem with Lagrangian intersections, as is set up by R.Melrose and G.Uhlmann. This involves Maslov {\it bi-canonical operator}.</description>

      <title>Global second order regularity for degenerate p-Laplace type equations with log-concave weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider weighted p-Laplace type equations with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions in convex domains, where the weight is a log-concave function which may degenerate at the boundary. In the case of bounded domains, we provide sharp global second-order estimates. For unbounded domains, we prove local estimates at the boundary. The results are new even for the case p = 2.</description>

      <title>Bifurcations in monotonic viscous boundary layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-established that shear layer flows are linearly unstable provided the viscosity is small enough, when the horizontal Fourier number lies in some interval, between the so called lower and upper marginally stable curves. In this article, we prove that monotonic shear layers undergo a bifurcation near the upper marginally stable curve. In the particular case of the exponential boundary layer, we give evidences that this bifurcation is a Hopf bifurcation, which corresponds to the onset of moving rolls near the boundary. The onset of such rolls is the first step of one of the possible ``routes to chaos'' for shear layer flows.</description>

      <title>Crossover from ballistic transport to normal diffusion: a kinetic view</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The crossover between dispersion patterns has been frequently observed in various systems. Inspired by the pathway-based kinetic model for E. coli chemotaxis that accounts for the intracellular adaptation process and noise, we propose a kinetic model that can exhibit a crossover from ballistic transport to normal diffusion at the population level. At the particle level, this framework aligns with a stochastic individual-based model. Using numerical simulations and rigorous asymptotic analysis, we demonstrate this crossover both analytically and computationally. Notably, under suitable scaling, the model reveals two distinct limits in which the macroscopic densities exhibit either ballistic transport or normal diffusion.</description>

      <title>On the existence and regularity of weakly nonlinear stationary Boltzmann equations : a Fredholm alternative approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The celebrated Fredholm alternative theorem works for the setting of identity compact operators. This idea has been widely used to solve linear partial differential equations \cite{Evans}. In this article, we demonstrate a generalized Fredholm theory in the setting of identity power compact operators, which was suggested in Cercignani and Palczewski \cite{CP} to solve the existence of the stationary Boltzmann equation in a slab domain. We carry out the detailed analysis based on this generalized Fredholm theory to prove the existence theory of the stationary Boltzmann equation in bounded three-dimensional convex domains. To prove that the integral form of the linearized Boltzmann equation satisfies the identity power compact setting requires the regularizing effect of the solution operators. Once the existence and regularity theories for the linear case are established, with suitable bilinear estimates, the nonlinear existence theory is accomplished.</description>

      <title>On the local Maxwellians solving the Boltzmann equation with boundary condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02431v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the expressions of the local Maxwellians that solve the Boltzmann equation in the interior of an open domain. We determine which of these local Maxwellians satisfy the Boltzmann equation in a regular domain with boundary, without assuming the boundedness of the domain. We investigate separately, on the one hand, the case of the bounce-back boundary condition in any dimension, and on the other hand the case of the specular reflection boundary condition, in dimension $d = 2$ and $d = 3$. In the case of the bounce-back boundary condition, we prove that the only local Maxwellians solving the Boltzmann equation with boundary condition are the global Maxwellians. In the case of the specular reflection, we provide a complete classification of the domains for which only the global Maxwellians solve the Boltzmann equation with boundary condition, and we describe all the local Maxwellians that solve the equation for the domains presenting symmetries.</description>

      <title>Pointwise estimates for the fundamental solutions of higher order schr\"{o}dinger equations with finite rank perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is dedicated to studying pointwise estimates of the fundamental solution for the higher order Schr\"{o}dinger equation: % we investigate the fundamental solution of the higher order Schr\"{o}dinger equation $$i{\partial}_{t}u(x,t)=Hu(x,t),\ \ \ t\in \mathbb{R},\ x\in {\mathbb{R}}^{n},$$ where the Hamiltonian $H$ is defined as $$H={(-\Delta)}^{m}+\displaystyle\sum_{j=1}^{N} \langle\cdotp ,{\varphi }_{j} \rangle{\varphi }_{j},$$ with each $\varphi_j$ ($1\le j\le N$) satisfying certain smoothness and decay conditions. %Let ${P}_{ac}(H)$ denote the projection onto the absolutely continuous space of $H$. We show that for any positive integer $m&gt;1$ and spatial dimension $n\ge 1$, %under a spectral assumption, the operator is sharp in the sense that it
  ${e}^{-i tH}P_{ac}(H)$ has an integral kernel $K(t,x,y)$ satisfying the following pointwise estimate: $$\left |K(t,x,y)\right |\lesssim |t|^{-\frac{n}{2m}}(1+|t|^{-\frac{1}{2m}}\left | x-y\right |)^{-\frac{n(m-1)}{2m-1}} ,\ \ t\ne 0,\ x,y\in {\mathbb{R}}^{n}.$$ This estimate is consistent with the upper bounds in the free case. As an application, we derive $L^p-L^q$ decay estimates for the propagator ${e}^{-\i tH}P_{ac}(H)$, where the pairs $(1/p, 1/q)$ lie within a quadrilateral region in the plane.</description>

      <title>Well-Posedness for Non-local Reaction-Diffusion Systems with Mass Dissipation in $\mathbb R^N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global existence of bounded solutions to reaction-diffusion systems with fractional diffusion in the whole space $\mathbb R^N$ is investigated. The systems are assumed to preserve the non-negativity of initial data and to dissipate total mass. We first show that if the nonlinearities are at most quadratic then there exists a unique global bounded solution regardless of the fractional order. This is done by combining a regularizing effect of the fractional diffusion operator and the H\"older continuity of a non-local inhomogeneous parabolic equation. When the nonlinearities might be super-quadratic, but satisfy some intermediate sum conditions, we prove the global existence of bounded solutions by adapting the well-known duality methods to the case of fractional diffusion. In this case, the order of the intermediate sum conditions depends on the fractional order. These results extend the existing theory for mass dissipated reaction-diffusion systems to the case of non-local diffusion and unbounded domains.</description>

      <title>Elliptic Schr\"odinger equations with gradient-dependent nonlinearity and Hardy potential singular on manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^N$ ($N \geq 3$) be a $C^2$ bounded domain and $\Sigma \subset \Omega$ is a $C^2$ compact boundaryless submanifold in $\mathbb{R}^N$ of dimension $k$, $0\leq k &lt; N-2$. For $\mu\leq (\frac{N-k-2}{2})^2$, put $L_\mu := \Delta + \mu d_{\Sigma}^{-2}$ where $d_{\Sigma}(x) = \mathrm{dist}(x,\Sigma)$. We study boundary value problems for equation $-L_\mu u = g(u,|\nabla u|)$ in $\Omega \setminus \Sigma$, subject to the boundary condition $u=\nu$ on $\partial \Omega \cup \Sigma$, where $g: \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}_+ \to \mathbb{R}_+$ is a continuous and nondecreasing function with $g(0,0)=0$, $\nu$ is a given nonnegative measure on $\partial \Omega \cup \Sigma$. When $g$ satisfies a so-called subcritical integral condition, we establish an existence result for the problem under a smallness assumption on $\nu$. If $g(u,|\nabla u|) = |u|^p|\nabla u|^q$, there are ranges of $p,q$, called subcritical ranges, for which the subcritical integral condition is satisfied, hence the problem admits a solution. Beyond these ranges, where the subcritical integral condition may be violated, we establish various criteria on $\nu$ for the existence of a solution to the problem expressed in terms of appropriate Bessel capacities.</description>

      <title>The 3D energy-critical inhomogeneous nonlinear Schrodinger equation with strong singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Cauchy problem for the 3D energy-critical inhomogeneous nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation(INLS) $$i\partial_{t}u+\Delta u=\pm|x|^{-\alpha}|u|^{4-2\alpha}u$$ with strong singularity $3/2\leq \alpha&lt;2$. The well-posedness problem is well-understood for $0&lt;\alpha&lt;3/2$, but the case $3/2\leq \alpha&lt;2$ has remained open so far. We address the local/small data global well-posedness result for $3/2\leq \alpha&lt;11/6$ by improving the inhomogeneous Strichartz estimates on the weighted space.</description>

      <title>Confirmed answer to the Schiffer conjecture and the Berenstein conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Omega$ be a bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^{N+1}$ with a connected $C^{2,\epsilon}$ ($\epsilon\in(0,1)$) boundary. We show that, if the following overdetermined elliptic problem \begin{equation} -\Delta u=\alpha u\,\, \text{in}\,\,\Omega, \,\, u=0\,\,\text{on}\,\, \partial\Omega,\,\,\frac{\partial u}{\partial n} =c\,\,\text{on}\,\,\partial\Omega\nonumber \end{equation} has a nontrivial solution, then $\Omega$ is a ball, which is exactly the affirmative answer to the Berenstein conjecture. Similarly, we show that, if $\Omega$ has a Lipschitz connected boundary and the following overdetermined elliptic problem \begin{equation} -\Delta u=\alpha u\,\, \text{in}\,\,\Omega, \,\, \frac{\partial u}{\partial n}=0\,\,\text{on}\,\, \partial\Omega,\,\,u =c\,\,\text{on}\,\,\partial\Omega\nonumber \end{equation} has a nontrivial solution, then $\Omega$ is also a ball, which is exactly the affirmative answer to the Schiffer conjecture.</description>

      <title>Decay of mass for a semilinear heat equation with mixed local-nonlocal operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02827v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with the Cauchy problem for the reaction-diffusion equation $\partial_t u+t^\beta\mathcal{L} u= - h(t)u^p$ posed on $\mathbb{R}^N$, driven by the mixed local-nonlocal operator $\mathcal{L}=-\Delta+(-\Delta)^{\alpha/2}$, $\alpha\in(0,2)$, and supplemented with a nonnegative integrable initial data, where $p&gt;1$, $\beta\geq 0$, and $h:(0,\infty)\to(0,\infty)$ is a locally integrable function. We study the large time behavior of non-negative solutions and show that the nonlinear term determines the large time asymptotic for $p\leq 1+{\alpha}/{N(\beta+1)},$ while the classical/anomalous diffusion effects win if $p&gt;1+{\alpha}/{N(\beta+1)}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to provide a qualitative analysis of the optimisation of space-time periodic principal eigenvalues. Namely, considering a fixed time horizon $T$ and the $d$-dimensional torus $\mathbb{T}^d$, let, for any $m\in L^\infty((0,T)\times\mathbb{T}^d)$, $\lambda(m)$ be the principal eigenvalue of the operator $\partial_t-\Delta-m$ endowed with (time-space) periodic boundary conditions. The main question we set out to answer is the following: how to choose $m$ so as to minimise $\lambda(m)$? This question stems from population dynamics. We prove that in several cases it is always beneficial to rearrange $m$ with respect to time in a symmetric way, which is the first comparison result for the rearrangement in time of parabolic equations. Furthermore, we investigate the validity (or lack thereof) of Talenti inequalities for the rearrangement in time of parabolic equations. The numerical simulations which illustrate our results were obtained by developing a framework within which it is possible to optimise criteria with respect to functions having a prescribed rearrangement (or distribution function).</description>

      <title>Extending relative entropy for Korteweg-Type models with non-monotone pressure:large friction limit and weak-strong uniqueness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study weak-strong uniqueness and singular relaxation limits for the Euler--Korteweg and Navier--Stokes--Korteweg systems with non monotone pressure. Both weak-strong uniqueness and the relaxation limit are investigated using relative entropy technique. We make use of the enlarged formulation of the model in terms of the drift velocity introduced in [6], generalizing in this way results proved in [17] for the Euler-Korteweg model, by allowing more general capillarity functions, and the result contained in [8] for the monotone pressure case.</description>

      <title>Stochastic very weak solution to parabolic equations with singular coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A class of stochastic parabolic equations with singular potentials is analysed in the chaos expansion setting where the Wick product is used to give sense to the product of generalized stochastic processes. For the analysis of such equations we combine the chaos expansion method from the white noise analysis and the concept of very weak solutions from the theory of partial differential equations. The stochastic very weak solution to the stochastic parabolic evolution problem is defined and its existence and uniqueness are shown. For regular enough potentials and data we prove consistency of stochastic very weak solution with a stochastic weak solution. We give an example to illustrate the method and possible applications.</description>

      <title>Analysis of mean-field models arising from self-attention dynamics in transformer architectures with layer normalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to provide a mathematical analysis of transformer architectures using a self-attention mechanism with layer normalization. In particular, observed patterns in such architectures resembling either clusters or uniform distributions pose a number of challenging mathematical questions. We focus on a special case that admits a gradient flow formulation in the spaces of probability measures on the unit sphere under a special metric, which allows us to give at least partial answers in a rigorous way. The arising mathematical problems resemble those recently studied in aggregation equations, but with additional challenges emerging from restricting the dynamics to the sphere and the particular form of the interaction energy.
  We provide a rigorous framework for studying the gradient flow, which also suggests a possible metric geometry to study the general case (i.e. one that is not described by a gradient flow). We further analyze the stationary points of the induced self-attention dynamics. The latter are related to stationary points of the interaction energy in the Wasserstein geometry, and we further discuss energy minimizers and maximizers in different parameter settings.</description>

      <title>On inequalities of Bliss-Moser type with loss of compactness in $\mathbb{R}^N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the following Limiting Bliss inequalities \begin{equation}\nonumber \sup\limits_{v(0) = 0, \int_0^1|v'|^Ndx=1 }\int_0^1 e^{\beta\left(\log\frac{e}{s}\right)\frac{v^N(s)}{s^{N-1}}}ds\leq C(N,\beta), \ \hbox{ for } \beta \le 1 \end{equation} The inequalities are optimal with respect to $\beta \le 1$; there is compactness for $\beta&lt;1$, and along the infinitesimal Moser sequence for $\beta = 1$.
  Moreover, we show that the improved inequalities \begin{equation}\nonumber \sup\limits_{v(0) = 0, \int_0^1|v'|^Ndx=1 }\int_0^1 e^{\left(\log\frac{e}{s}+\gamma\log\log\frac{e}{s}\right)\frac{v^N(s)}{s^{N-1}}}ds\leq C(N,\gamma) \end{equation} hold for $\gamma\leq1$, and for $\gamma=1$ the inequalities are critical with loss of compactness. The inequalities are optimal: no further improvement in the coefficient of the exponent is possible.
  The second result extends the result in [J. M. do \'{O}, B. Ruf and P. Ubilla, A critical Moser type inequality with loss of compactness due to infinitesimal shocks, Calc. Var. Partial Differential Equations 62 (2023)] from $N=2$ to general dimensions $N\geq2$.</description>

      <title>Stochastic flows for H\"older drifts and transport/continuity equations with noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove existence of a stochastic flow of diffeomorphisms generated by SDEs with drift in $L^q_t C^{0, \alpha}_x$ for any $q \in [2, \infty)$ and $\alpha \in (0, 1)$. This result is achieved using a Zvonkin-type transformation for the SDE. As a key intermediate step, well-posedness and optimal regularity for a class of parabolic PDEs related to the transformation is established. Using the existence of a differentiable stochastic flow, we prove well-posedness of $BV_\text{loc}$-solutions of stochastic transport equations and weak solutions of stochastic continuity equations with so-called transport noise and velocity fields in $L^q_t C^{0, \alpha}_x$. For both equations, solutions may fail to be unique in the deterministic setting.</description>

      <title>Besov--Triebel--Lizorkin-Type Spaces with Matrix $A_\infty$ Weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Introduced by A. Volberg, matrix $A_{p,\infty}$ weights provide a suitable generalization of Muckenhoupt $A_\infty$ weights from the classical theory. In our previous work, we established new characterizations of these weights. Here, we use these results to study inhomogeneous Besov-type and Triebel--Lizorkin-type spaces with such weights. In particular, we characterize these spaces, in terms of the $\varphi$-transform, molecules, and wavelets, and obtain the boundedness of almost diagonal operators, pseudo-differential operators, trace operators, pointwise multipliers, and Calder\'on--Zygmund operators on these spaces. This is the first systematic study of inhomogeneous Besov--Triebel--Lizorkin-type spaces with $A_{p,\infty}$-matrix weights, but some of the results are new even when specialized to the scalar unweighted case.</description>

      <title>Propagation of chaos for multi-species moderately interacting particle systems up to Newtonian singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a class of multi-species aggregation-diffusion systems from stochastic interacting particle systems via relative entropy method with quantitative bounds. We show an algebraic $L^1$-convergence result using moderately interacting particle systems approximating attractive/repulsive singular potentials up to Newtonian/Coulomb singularities without additional cut-off on the particle level. The first step is to make use of the relative entropy between the joint distribution of the particle system and an approximated limiting aggregation-diffusion system. A crucial argument in the proof is to show convergence in probability by a stopping time argument. The second step is to obtain a quantitative convergence rate to the limiting aggregation-diffusion system from the approximated PDE system. This is shown by evaluating a combination of relative entropy and $L^2$-distance.</description>

      <title>A look into some of the fine properties of functions with bounded $\mathscr A$-variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08474</link>
      <description>arXiv:1911.08474v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish certain fine properties for functions of bounded $\mathscr A$-variation known in the classical $BV$ setting. Here, $\mathscr A$ is a $k$th order constant-coefficient homogeneous linear differential operator with a finite-dimensional kernel (also known as a complex-elliptic operator). We prove that if $\mathscr Au$ can be represented by a finite Radon measure, then the potential $u$ has one-sided $L^p$-approximate limits on Lipschitz hypersurfaces, and, more generally, on countably rectifiable sets of codimension one. We use this to give pointwise characterizations of the (functional) interior and exterior traces. We also establish a quantitative scale-dependent continuity result, which allows us to prove that the Lebesgue discontinuity set has zero $(n-1)$-dimensional Riesz capacity. Lastly, we introduce a decomposition that reduces the complexity of analyzing $k$th-order operators to that of first-order methods and allows us to establish the $k$th order $L^p$-differentiability of $BV^{\mathscr A}$ maps.</description>

      <title>Maxwell's equations with hypersingularities at a negative index material conical tip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.01982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a transmission problem for the time harmonic Maxwell's equations between a classical positive material and a so-called negative index material in which both the permittivity $\varepsilon$ and the permeability $\mu$ take negative values. Additionally, we assume that the interface between the two domains is smooth everywhere except at a point where it coincides locally with a conical tip. In this context, it is known that for certain critical values of the contrasts in $\varepsilon$ and in $\mu$, the corresponding scalar operators are not of Fredholm type in the usual $H^1$ spaces. In this work, we show that in these situations, the Maxwell's equations are not well-posed in the classical $L^2$ framework due to existence of hypersingular fields which are of infinite energy at the tip. By combining the $\mathrm{T}$-coercivity approach and the Kondratiev theory, we explain how to construct new functional frameworks to recover well-posedness of the Maxwell's problem. We also explain how to select the setting which is consistent with the limiting absorption principle. From a technical point of view, the fields as well as their curls decompose as the sum of an explicit singular part, related to the black hole singularities of the scalar operators, and a smooth part belonging to some weighted spaces. The analysis we propose rely in particular on the proof of new key results of scalar and vector potential representations of singular fields.</description>

      <title>Explicit Semiclassical Resonances from Many Delta Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the scattering resonances arising from multiple $h$-dependent Dirac delta functions on the real line in the semiclassical regime $h \rightarrow 0$. We focus on resonances lying in strings along curves of the form $\text{Im } z \sim -\gamma h\log(1/h)$ and find that resonances along such strings exist if and only if $\gamma$ is a slope of a Newton polygon we construct from the parameters. Furthermore, the set of these $\gamma$ corresponds to a complete and disjoint partitioning of a line segment with delta functions at interval endpoints. Hence, there are at most $N-1$ strings of resonances from $N$ delta functions, improving a bound from (Datchev, Marzuola, &amp; Wunsch 2023). Lastly, we identify a `dominant pair' of delta functions in the sense that they correspond to the longest-living string of resonances, this string is the only one of logarithmic shape with respect to $\text{Re } z$, and no delta functions between them can contribute to strings of resonances. The simple properties of delta functions permit elementary proofs, and we provide many visual examples to demonstrate the results.</description>

      <title>Modeling of groundwater flow in porous medium layered over inclined impermeable bed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new mathematical model of groundwater flow in porous medium layered over inclined impermeable bed. In its full generality, this is a free-surface problem. To obtain analytically tractable model, we use generalized Dupuit-Forchheimer assumption for inclined impermeable bed. In this way, we arrive at parabolic partial differential equation which is a generalization of the classical Boussinesq equation. Novelty of our approach consists in considering nonlinear constitutive law of the power type. Thus introducing $p$-Laplacian-like differential operator into the Boussinesq equation. Unlike in the classical case of the Boussinesq equation, the convective term cannot be set aside from the main part of the diffusive term and remains incorporated within it.
  In the sequel of the paper, we analyze qualitative properties of the stationary solutions of our model. In particular, we study existence and regularity of weak solutions for the following boundary value problem \begin{equation*} \begin{aligned}
  &amp;
  -
  \frac{\rm d}{{\rm d} x}
  \left[
  (u(x) + H) \left|\frac{{\rm d} u}{{\rm d} x}(x) \cos(\varphi) + \sin(\varphi) \right|^{p - 2}
  \left(\frac{{\rm d} u}{{\rm d} x}(x) \cos(\varphi) + \sin(\varphi)\right)
  \right]
  &amp;
  \begin{aligned}
  &amp;
  =
  f(x)\,, &amp; \qquad\qquad x \in (-1,1)\,,
  &amp;
  u(-1) = u(1) = 0\,,&amp;
  \end{aligned} \end{aligned} \end{equation*} where $p&gt;1$, $H&gt;0$, $\varphi\in (0, \pi/2)$, $f\geq 0$, $f\in L^{1}(-1,1)$. In the case of $p&gt;2$, we study validity of Weak and Strong Maximum Principles as well. We use methods based on the linearization of the $p$-Laplacian-type problems in the vicinity of known solution, error estimates, and analysis of Green's function of the linearized problem.</description>

      <title>Sufficient Conditions for Solvability of Operators of Subprincipal Type</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19054v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we show that condition $\operatorname{Sub_r}(\Psi)$ on the subprincipal symbol is sufficient for local solvability of linear pseudodifferential operators of real subprincipal type. These are the operators having real principal symbol, which is of principal type and vanishes of second order on an involutive manifold where the subprincipal symbol is of principal type. Condition $\operatorname{Sub_r}(\Psi)$ is a condition on the sign changes of the imaginary part of the subprincipal symbol, which has previously been shown by the author to be necessary for local solvability of linear pseudodifferential operators of real subprincipal type. In the appendix, we study the local solvability of quasilinear second order partial differential operators of real principal type.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies solutions to a singular $SU(3)$ Toda system with linear source terms on a compact Riemann surface $\Sigma$ with smooth boundaries $\partial\Sigma$. We establish the existence of solutions when the parameters are not critical, assuming that Euler characteristic $\chi(\Sigma)&lt;1$ via analyzing the sublevels. Furthermore, we find a sufficient condition that ensures multiple solutions for generic potentials by Morse inequalities and a transversality theorem.</description>

      <title>Blow-up solutions for mean field equations with Neumann boundary conditions on Riemann surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On a compact Riemann surface $(\Sigma, g)$ with a smooth boundary $\partial \Sigma$, we consider the following mean field equations with Neumann boundary conditions: $$ -\Delta_g u = \lambda \left(\frac{Ve^u}{\int_{\Sigma} Ve^u \, dv_g} - \frac{1}{|\Sigma|_g}\right) \text{ in } \Sigma \text{ with } \partial_{\nu_g} u = 0 \text{ on } \partial \Sigma, $$ We find conditions on the potential function $V: \Sigma \to \mathbb{R}^+$ such that solutions exist for the parameter $\lambda$ when it is in a small right (or left) neighborhood of a critical value $4\pi(m+k)$ for $k \leq m \in \mathbb{N}_+$ and blow up as $\lambda$ approaches the critical parameter. The blow-up occurs exactly at $k$ points in the interior of $\Sigma$ and $(m-k)$ points on the boundary $\partial \Sigma$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the non-degeneracy of bubbling solutions for singular mean field equations when the blow-up points are either regular or involve non-quantized singular sources. This extends the results from Bartolucci-Jevnikar-Lee-Yang \cite{bart-5}, which focused on regular blow-up points. As a consequence, we establish the strict convexity of the Entropy in the large energy limit for a specific class of two-dimensional domains in the Onsager mean field vortex model with singular sources.</description>

      <title>Note on the existence of classical solutions of derivative semilinear models for one dimensional wave equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06378v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This note is a supplement with a new result to the review paper by Takamura [13] on nonlinear wave equations in one space dimension. We are focusing here to the long-time existence of classical solutions of semilinear wave equations in one space dimension, especially with derivative nonlinear terms of product-type. Our result is an extension of the single component case, but it is meaningful to provide models as possible as many to cover the optimality of the general theory. The proof is based on the classical iteration argument of the point-wise estimate of the solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we deal with the following $(p,q)$-fractional problem $$ (-\Delta)^{s_{1}}_{p}u +(-\Delta)^{s_{2}}_{q}u=\lambda P(x)|u|^{k-2}u+\theta|u|^{p_{s_{1}}^{*}-2}u \, \mbox{ in }\, \Omega,\qquad u=0\, \mbox{ in }\, \mathbb{R}^{N} \setminus \Omega, $$ where $\Omega\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{N}$ is a general open set, $0&lt;s_{2}&lt;s_{1}&lt;1$, $1&lt;q&lt;k&lt;p&lt;N/s_{1}$, parameter $\lambda,\ \theta&gt;0$, $P$ is a nontrivial nonnegative weight, while $p_{s_{1}}^{*}=Np/(N-ps_{1})$ is the critical exponent. We prove that there exists a decreasing sequence $\{\theta_j\}_j$ such that for any $j\in\mathbb N$ and with $\theta\in(0,\theta_j)$, there exist $\lambda_*$, $\lambda^*&gt;0$ such that above problem admits at least $j$ distinct weak solutions with negative energy for any $\lambda\in (\lambda_*,\lambda^*)$. On the other hand, we show there exists $\overline{\lambda}&gt;0$ such that for any $\lambda&gt;\overline{\lambda}$, there exists $\theta^*=\theta^*(\lambda)&gt;0$ such that the above problem admits a nonnegative weak solution with negative energy for any $\theta\in(0,\theta^*)$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we prove local solvability of quasilinear pseudodifferential operators which has homogeneous principal symbol of real principal type. This generalizes Theorem A.1 in arXiv:2403.19054, which treats the case of quasilinear partial differential operators of order 2.

      <title>The helicity distribution for the 3D incompressible Euler equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the helicity associated to solutions of the 3D incompressible Euler equations. We show that under mild conditions on the regularity of the velocity field of an incompressible ideal fluid it is possible to define a defect distribution describing the local helicity balance. Under suitable regularity assumptions, we also provide the global helicity balance on bounded domains in terms of the boundary contributions of the vorticity, velocity and pressure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Originally motivated by the morphogenesis of bacterial microcolonies, the aim of this article is to explore models through different scales for a spatial population of interacting, growing and dividing particles. We start from a microscopic stochastic model, write the corresponding stochastic differential equation satisfied by the empirical measure, and rigorously derive its mesoscopic (mean-field) limit. Under smoothness and symmetry assumptions for the interaction kernel, we then obtain entropy estimates, which provide us with a localization limit at the macroscopic level. Finally, we perform a thorough numerical study in order to compare the three modeling scales.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Minkowski problem associated with the solution to the anisotropic $p$-Laplacian (or Finsler $p$-Laplacian) equation, namely, the Minkowski problem of anisotropic $p$-torsional rigidity. The sufficient and necessary conditions for the existence of a solution to the anisotropic $p$-torsional rigidity Minkowski problem are presented. Meanwhile, the existence of a solution to the log-Minkowski problem of anisotropic $p$-torsional rigidity without symmetry assumptions is solved.</description>

      <title>Magnetisation moment of a bounded 3D sample: asymptotic recovery from planar measurements on a large disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.14776v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of reconstruction of the overall magnetisation vector (net moment) of a sample from partial data of the magnetic field. Namely, motivated by a concrete experimental set-up, we deal with a situation when the magnetic field is measured on a portion of the plane in vicinity of the sample and only one (normal to the plane) component of the field is available. Under assumption that the measurement area is a sufficiently large disk (lying in a horizontal plane above the sample), we obtain a set of estimates for the components of the net moment vector with the accuracy which improves asymptotically with the increase of the measurement disk radius. Compared to our previous preliminary results, the asymptotic formulas are now rigorously justified and higher-order estimates are derived. Moreover, the presented approach, based on an appropriate splitting in the Fourier domain and estimates of oscillatory integrals (involving both small and large parameters), elucidates the derivation of asymptotic estimates of an arbitrary order, a possibility that was previously unclear. The obtained results are illustrated numerically and their robustness with respect to noise is discussed. The proposed methodology should be applicable to other magnetic and gravimetric problems with planar measurements.</description>

      <title>Singular SPDEs on Homogeneous Lie Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.05121v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this article is to extend the scope of the theory of regularity structures in order to deal with a large class of singular SPDEs of the form $$\partial_t u = \mathfrak{L} u+ F(u, \xi)\ ,$$ where the differential operator $\mathfrak{L}$ fails to be elliptic. This is achieved by interpreting the base space $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ as a non-trivial homogeneous Lie group $\mathbb{G}$ such that the differential operator $\partial_t -\mathfrak{L}$ becomes a translation invariant hypoelliptic operator on $\mathbb{G}$. Prime examples are the kinetic Fokker-Planck operator $\partial_t -\Delta_v - v\cdot \nabla_x$ and heat-type operators associated to sub-Laplacians. As an application of the developed framework, we solve a class of parabolic Anderson type equations $$\partial_t u = \sum_{i} X^2_i u + u (\xi-c)$$ on the compact quotient of an arbitrary Carnot group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When studying out-of-equilibrium systems, one often excites the dynamics in some degrees of freedom while removing the excitation in others through damping. In order for the system to converge to a statistical steady state, the dynamics must transfer the energy from the excited modes to the dissipative directions. The precise mechanisms underlying this transfer are of particular interest and are the topic of this paper. We explore a class of randomly switched models introduced in [2,3] and provide some of the first results showing that minimal damping is sufficient to stabilize the system in a fluids model.</description>

      <title>Classification of ancient noncollapsed flows in $\mathbb{R}^4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10581v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we classify all noncollapsed singularities of the mean curvature flow in $\mathbb{R}^4$. Specifically, we prove that any ancient noncollapsed solution either is one of the classical historical examples (namely $\mathbb{R}^j\times S^{3-j}$, $\mathbb{R}\times $2d-bowl, $\mathbb{R}\times $2d-oval, the rotationally symmetric 3d-bowl, or a cohomogeneity-one 3d-oval), or belongs to the 1-parameter family of $\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathrm{O}_2$-symmetric 3d-translators constructed by Hoffman-Ilmanen-Martin-White, or belongs to the 1-parameter family of $\mathbb{Z}_2^2\times \mathrm{O}_2$-symmetric ancient 3d-ovals constructed by Du-Haslhofer.
  In light of the five prior papers on the classification program in $\mathbb{R}^4$ from our collaborations with Du, Hershkovits, and Choi-Daskalopoulos-Sesum, the major remaining challenge is the case of mixed behaviour, where the convergence to the round bubble-sheet is fast in $x_1$-direction, but logarithmically slow in $x_2$-direction. To address this, we prove a differential neck theorem, which allows us to capture the (dauntingly small) slope in $x_1$-direction. To establish the differential neck theorem, we introduce a slew of new ideas of independent interest, including switch and differential Merle-Zaag dynamics, anisotropic barriers, and propagation of smallness estimates. Applying our differential neck theorem, we show that every noncompact strictly convex solution is selfsimilarly translating, and also rule out exotic ovals.</description>

      <title>A particle system approach towards the global well-posedness of master equations for potential mean field games of control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the $N$-particle systems as well as the HJB/master equations for a class of generalized mean field control (MFC) problems and the corresponding potential mean field games of control (MFGC). A local in time classical solution for the HJB equation is generated via a probabilistic approach based on the mean field maximum principle. Given an extension of the so called displacement convexity condition, we obtain the uniform estimates on the HJB equation for the $N$-particle system. Such estimates imply the displacement convexity/semi-concavity and thus the prior estimates on the solution to the HJB equation for generalized MFC problems. The global well-posedness of HJB/master equation for generalized MFC/potential MFGC is then proved thanks to the local well-posedness and the prior estimates. In view of the nature of the displacement convexity condition, such well-posedness is also true for the degenerated case. Our analysis on the $N$-particle system also induces an Lipschitz approximator to the optimal feedback function in generalized MFC/potential MFGC where an algebraic convergence rate is obtained. Furthermore, an alternative approximate Nash equilibrium is proposed based on the $N$-particle system, where the approximation error is quantified thanks to the aforementioned uniform estimates.</description>

      <title>A positivity preserving second-order scheme for multi-dimensional system of non-local conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-local systems of conservation laws play a crucial role in modeling flow mechanisms across various scenarios. The well-posedness of such problems is typically established by demonstrating the convergence of robust first-order schemes. However, achieving more accurate solutions necessitates the development of higher-order schemes. In this article, we present a fully discrete, second-order scheme for a general class of non-local conservation law systems in multiple spatial dimensions. The method employs a MUSCL-type spatial reconstruction coupled with Runge-Kutta time integration. The proposed scheme is proven to preserve positivity in all the unknowns and exhibits L-infinity stability. Numerical experiments conducted on both the non-local scalar and system cases illustrate the8 importance of second-order scheme when compared to its first-order counterpart.</description>
