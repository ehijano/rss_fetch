      <title>Dynamics and lifetime of geometric excitations in moir\'e systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that spin-2 geometric excitations, known as graviton modes, generally exhibit vanishing lifetimes in lattice Chern bands, including in moir\'e systems. In contrast to the Landau levels, we first numerically demonstrate that the prominent graviton peaks in spectral functions diminish rapidly with increasing system sizes. We explore how the choice of interaction affects the strength of these peaks, with short-ranged interactions pushing the graviton mode far into the continuum of excitations, where it can be significantly scattered due to the increased density of states. We also analytically investigate the short lifetime of the graviton mode. In lattice systems, continuous rotational symmetry is broken, leading to highly anisotropic gapped excitations that mix different angular momentum or "spins''. This is despite the surprising emergence of a "guiding center" continuous rotational symmetry in the ground state, which is shared by the graviton mode. Consequently, the graviton mode in Chern bands can be strongly scattered by the anisotropic gapped excitations. However, the emergent rotational symmetry implies that gravitons can be robust in principle, and we propose experimental tuning strategies to lower the graviton mode energy below the continuum. We argue this is a necessary condition enabling the observation of graviton modes and geometric excitations in realistic moir\'e systems.</description>

      <title>Dispersion of neutral collective modes in partonic fractional quantum Hall states and its applications to paired states of composite fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Moore-Read Pfaffian (Pf) state exhibits two distinct neutral excitation modes, the bosonic magnetoroton mode, and the neutral fermion mode. These two modes have been conjectured to be supersymmetric (SUSY) partners in the long-wavelength limit. Previous studies on these neutral excitations of the Pf state have shown evidence in favor of SUSY in the vicinity of the second Landau level (SLL) Coulomb interaction. Inspired by that, using the framework of parton theory, we test the SUSY conjecture for a state that lies in the same universality class as the particle-hole conjugate of the Pf, namely the anti-Pf (aPf) state, by constructing explicit wave functions for its magnetoroton and neutral fermion excitations and evaluating them for very large system sizes. As with the previous studies on the Pf state, we find that the long-wavelength gaps of the neutral modes of the parton state belonging to the same topological class as the aPf are close to each other for the SLL Coulomb interaction. Furthermore, using the parton wave functions, we compute the dispersion of various neutral collective excitations, including the magnetoroton, neutral fermion, and parton-excitons, for several notable non-Abelian and Abelian states. Finally, we propose a parton-exciton ansatz for the gapped neutral excitation of the composite fermion Fermi liquid at quarter filling and compute its dispersion for the Coulomb interaction in the lowest Landau level.</description>

      <title>Dipolar and quadrupolar correlations in the $5d^2$ Re-based double perovskites Ba$_2$YReO$_6$ and Ba$_2$ScReO$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Double perovskites containing heavy transition metal ions are an important family of compounds for the study of the interplay between electron correlation and spin-orbit coupling. Here, by combining magnetic susceptibility, heat capacity, and neutron scattering measurements, we investigate the dipolar and quadrupolar correlations in two prototype rhenium-based double perovskite compounds, Ba$_2$YReO$_6$ and Ba$_2$ScReO$_6$. A type-I dipolar antiferromagnetic ground state with a propagation vector $\mathbf{q} = (0, 0, 1)$ is observed in both compounds. At temperatures above the magnetic transitions, a quadrupolar ordered phase is identified. Weak spin excitations, which are gapped at low temperatures and softened in the correlated paramagnetic phase, are explained using a minimal model that considers both the dipolar and quadrupolar interactions. At larger wavevectors, we observe dominant phonon excitations that are well described by density functional calculations.</description>

      <title>Robust spin-orbit coupling in semi-metallic SrIrO3 under hydrostatic pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The semi-metallic behavior of the perovskite iridate SrIrO3 shifts the end-member of the strongly spin-orbit (SO) coupled Ruddlesden-Popper series Srn+1IrnO3n+1 away from the Mott insulating regime and the half-filled pseudospin Jeff=1/2 ground state well-established in the layered iridates (n = 1 and 2). To investigate the robustness of the SO coupled ground state of SrIrO3, X-ray absorption spectroscopy was carried out at the Ir L2,3 edges under hydrostatic pressure up to 50 GPa at room temperature. The effective SO coupling was deduced from the branching ratio of the Ir L2 and L3 white lines. With increasing pressure, the branching ratio decreases, and the Ir L2,3 peak positions shift to higher energies. The number of 5d holes remains constant indicating that the spectral weight redistribution and peak shifts arise from orbital mixing between t2g and eg related states. The expectation value of the angular part of the SO operator &lt;LS&gt; decreases by about 15% at 50 GPa. This reduction, which is very similar to that observed in the layered iridates, is well explained by an increase of the octahedral crystal field due to the shortening of the Ir-O bond-length under compression. Consistent with theoretical predictions, the orbital mixing and &lt;LS&gt; decrease as the crystal field increases. However, the effective SO coupling remains robust against pressure and does not indicate a covalency-driven breakdown within the investigated pressure range.</description>

      <title>High temperature surface state in Kondo insulator U$_3$Bi$_4$Ni$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The resurgence of interest in Kondo insulators has been driven by two major mysteries: the presence of metallic surface states and the observation of quantum oscillations. To further explore these mysteries, it is crucial to investigate another similar system beyond the two existing ones, SmB$_6$ and YbB$_{12}$. Here, we address this by reporting on a Kondo insulator, U$_3$Bi$_4$Ni$_3$. Our transport measurements reveal that a surface state emerges below 250 K and dominates transport properties below 150 K, which is well above the temperature scale of SmB$_6$ and YbB$_{12}$. At low temperatures, the surface conductivity is about one order of magnitude higher than the bulk. The robustness of the surface state indicates that it is inherently protected. The similarities and differences between U$_3$Bi$_4$Ni$_3$ and the other two Kondo insulators will provide valuable insights into the nature of metallic surface states in Kondo insulators and their interplay with strong electron correlations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perhaps the simplest approach to constructing models with sub-dimensional particles or fractons is to require the conservation of dipole or higher multipole moments. We generalize this approach to allow for moments in phase space and classify all possible classical fracton models with phase-space multipole conservation laws. We focus on a new self-dual model that conserves both dipole and quadrupole moments in position and momentum; we analyze its dynamics and find quasi-periodic orbits in phase space that evade ergodic exploration of the full phase space.</description>

      <title>Lieb-Robinson bounds with exponential-in-volume tails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lieb-Robinson bounds demonstrate the emergence of locality in many-body quantum systems. Intuitively, Lieb-Robinson bounds state that with local or exponentially decaying interactions, the correlation that can be built up between two sites separated by distance $r$ after a time $t$ decays as $\exp(vt-r)$, where $v$ is the emergent Lieb-Robinson velocity. In many problems, it is important to also capture how much of an operator grows to act on $r^d$ sites in $d$ spatial dimensions. Perturbation theory and cluster expansion methods suggest that at short times, these volume-filling operators are suppressed as $\exp(-r^d)$ at short times. We confirm this intuition, showing that for $r &gt; vt$, the volume-filling operator is suppressed by $\exp(-(r-vt)^d/(vt)^{d-1})$. This closes a conceptual and practical gap between the cluster expansion and the Lieb-Robinson bound. We then present two very different applications of this new bound. Firstly, we obtain improved bounds on the classical computational resources necessary to simulate many-body dynamics with error tolerance $\epsilon$ for any finite time $t$: as $\epsilon$ becomes sufficiently small, only $\epsilon^{-O(t^{d-1})}$ resources are needed. A protocol that likely saturates this bound is given. Secondly, we prove that disorder operators have volume-law suppression near the "solvable (Ising) point" in quantum phases with spontaneous symmetry breaking, which implies a new diagnostic for distinguishing many-body phases of quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Cooper pairing in nano-patterned metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nano-patterning has been shown to be a powerful tool for manipulating the vibrational modes of elastic structures, with applications such as optical-mechanical mode coupling. Inspired by these recent developments in phononic band engineering, we propose a nano-patterning scheme to enhance the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ in phonon-mediated nano-film superconductors, such as aluminum. Using the finite element method, we simulate the lattice vibrational modes of nano-patterned films within the Debye model. Our results show that periodic nano-patterning softens the lattice vibrational modes compared to bulk films. It also increases the density of states at high energies, resulting in a couple of percent enhancement in $T_c$. Moreover, we investigate connections to random matrix theory and provide an experimental design prescription to optimize nano-patterning for further enhancement of the superconducting transition temperature.</description>

      <title>Pervasive symmetry-lowering nanoscale structural fluctuations in the cuprate La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_{4}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cuprate superconductors are among the most widely studied quantum materials, yet there remain fundamental open questions regarding their electronic properties and the role of the structural degrees of freedom. Recent neutron and x-ray scattering measurements uncovered exponential scaling with temperature of the strength of orthorhombic fluctuations in the tetragonal phase of $La_{2-x}Sr_xCuO_4$ and $Tl_2Ba_2CuO_{6+y}$, unusual behavior that closely resembles prior results for the emergence of superconducting fluctuations, and that points to a common origin rooted in inherent correlated structural inhomogeneity. Here we extend the measurements of $La_{2-x}Sr_xCuO_4$ to higher temperatures in the parent compound (x=0) and to optimal doping (x=0.155), and we furthermore investigate the effects of in-situ in-plane uniaxial stress. Our neutron scattering result for undoped $La_2CuO_4$ complement prior x-ray data and reveal that the structural fluctuations persist to the maximum experimental temperature of nearly 1000K, i.e., to a significant fraction of the melting point. At this temperature, the spatial correlation length extracted from the momentum-space data is still about three lattice constants. The neutron scattering experiment enables quasistatic discrimination and reveals that the response is increasingly dynamic at higher temperatures. We also find that uniaxial stress up to 500 MPa along the tetragonal [110] direction, which corresponds to a strain of about 0.2%, does not significantly alter this robust behavior. Overall, these results support the notion that subtle, underlying inhomogeneity underpins the cuprate phase diagram. Finally, we uncover (for x=0.2) low-energy structural fluctuations at a nominally forbidden reflection. While the origin of these fluctuations is not clear, they might be related to the presence of extended defects such as dislocations or stacking faults.</description>

      <title>Significant Chiral Magnetotransport Magnified by Multiple Weyl Nodes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intertwining of magnetism with topology is known to give rise to exotic quantum phenomena. Here, we explore the magnetotransport properties of NdAlSi, a magnetic Weyl semimetal that spontaneously breaks inversion and time-reversal symmetries and hosts a large number of Weyl nodes. We observe a significant negative magnetoresistance, which we attribute to the chiral anomaly associated with multiple Weyl nodes. Remarkably, the extracted chiral coefficient reaches approximately $52~\mathrm{m\Omega}^{-1}~\mathrm{m}^{-1}~\mathrm{T}^{-2}$, larger than many other topological materials. Additionally, we observe an exotic anomalous Hall effect with an out-of-sync behavior, where the anomalous Hall resistance does not exactly follow the field dependence of the magnetization, in contrast to that in conventional ferromagnets. These rich quantum transport phenomena, driven by the interplay between magnetism and Weyl nodes, establish NdAlSi as a prime platform for exploring the intricate topological behaviors of magnetic Weyl semimetals.</description>

      <title>Lattice Weyl Fermion on a Single Spherical Domain-Wall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a single spherical domain-wall embedded in a three-dimensional Euclidean lattice. We employ the Shamir-type domain-wall fermion formulation, where the negative mass region is confined inside the $S^2$ domain-wall, while the positive mass outside is taken to the infinite limit, allowing the exterior region to be neglected effectively. In the absence of a gauge potential, Weyl fermions emerge as edge-localized modes along the $S^2$ domain-wall. When a nontrivial $U(1)$ gauge potential is present, additional zero modes with opposite chirality appears, localized at the center near the monopole. This centrally localized mode originates from the effective mass contribution of the Wilson term, which induces a domain-wall near the monopole.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetic spin splitting and symmetry-enforced partial spin degeneracy in hexagonal MnTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Besides hosting several intriguing physical properties, the recently discovered time-reversal-asymmetric antiferromagnets, known as altermagnets, hold immense promise for technologies based on spintronics. Understanding the symmetry conditions leading to the spin-splitting becomes the key to further progress in the field. Hexagonal MnTe emerges as an even-parity magnet within the altermagnet family. In this work, using ab initio density functional theory (DFT) within a combination of an appropriate exchange-correlation functional and the relevant corrections, we uncover the spin-splitting features of MnTe. Our calculations reveal the spin degeneracy to be preserved in the $k_z = 0$ and $k_y = 0$ planes, while spin-splitting is observed everywhere else in the Brillouin zone, except the nodal lines identified here. To explain these findings, we provide a comprehensive symmetry analysis based on magnetic space group theory and introduce an insightful symmetry-adapted model Hamiltonian that qualitatively describes the spin-splitting behavior in different parts of the Brillouin zone. Our calculations considering spin-orbit interaction reveal no weak ferromagnetism in MnTe. Nevertheless, we discuss plausible explanations for weak ferromagnetism and anomalous Hall effect reported from experiments. Our comprehensive analysis of the magnetic space group symmetry and the DFT results leads to a thorough understanding of altermagnetism in MnTe, paving the way for possible future technology.</description>

      <title>Epitaxial strain tuning of electronic and spin excitations in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of ambient-pressure superconductivity with $T_{c,\text{onset}} &gt; 40$ K in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (LNO) thin films under in-plane biaxial compressive strain underscores the pivotal role of epitaxial strain in tuning exotic electronic states and provides a unique platform for investigating the superconducting mechanisms in nickelate superconductors. Here, we use resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) to probe the strain-dependent electronic and spin excitations in LNO thin films with biaxial strain ranging from $\epsilon\approx-1.04\%$ to $1.91\%$. Compared with the bulk crystal, the LNO thin film grown on LaAlO$_3$ (with $\epsilon\approx-1.04\%$) exhibits similar $dd$ excitations and enhanced spin excitation bandwidth. In contrast, the 0.4 eV and 1.6 eV $dd$ excitations associated with the Ni 3$d_{z^2}$ orbital, along with the spin excitations, are significantly suppressed in the film grown on SrTiO$_3$ ($\varepsilon\approx1.91\%$). The $c$-axis compression and the reduced out-of-plane Ni-O-Ni bond angle, induced by in-plane tensile strain in LNO/SrTiO$_3$ broaden the Ni 3$d_{z^2}$ bandwidth and decrease the Ni 3$d_{z^2}$-O 2$p_{z}$ hybridization, thereby suppressing the $dd$ excitations. The evolution of spin excitations reflects significant changes in the interlayer exchange coupling $J_z$, which can be attributed to the strain-tuned Ni-O-Ni bond angle. Since superconductivity is observed only in films with in-plane compressive strain ($\epsilon\sim-2\%$), the strain-dependent spin correlations align with the emergence of superconductivity, providing indirect evidence for spin-fluctuation-mediated unconventional superconductivity in LNO.</description>

      <title>Easy-cone state mediating the spin reorientation in topological kagome magnet Fe$_3$Sn$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated temperature-driven spin reorientation (SR) in the itinerant kagome magnet Fe$_3$Sn$_2$ using high-resolution synchrotron x-ray diffraction, neutron diffraction, magnetometry, and magnetic force microscopy (MFM), further supported by phenomenological analysis. Our study reveals a crossover from the state with easy-plane anisotropy to the high-temperature state with uniaxial easy-axis anisotropy taking place between $\sim40-130$~ K through an intermediate easy-cone (or tilted spin) state. This state, induced by the interplay between the anisotropy constants $K_1$ and $K_2$, is clearly manifested in the thermal evolution of the magnetic structure factor, which reveals a gradual change of the SR angle $\mathbf{\theta}$ between $40-130$~K. We also found that the SR is accompanied by a magnetoelastic effect. Zero-field MFM images across the SR range show a transformation in surface magnetic patterns from a dendritic structure at 120~K, to domain wall dominated MFM contrast at 40~K.</description>

      <title>Room Temperature Dy Spin-Flop Switching in Strained DyFeO3 Thin Films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Epitaxial strain in thin films can yield surprising magnetic and electronic properties not accessible in bulk. One materials system destined to be explored in this direction are orthoferrites with two intertwined spin systems where strain is predicted to have a significant impact on magnetic and polar properties by modifying the strength of the rare earth-Fe interaction. Here we report the impact of epitaxial strain is reported on the linear magneto-electric DyFeO3, a canted bulk antiferromagnet with a high Neel temperature (645 K) exhibiting a Dy-induced spin reorientation transition at approx. 50 K and antiferromagnetic ordering of the Dy spins at 4 K. An increase in the spin transition of &gt; 20 K is found and a strictly linear, abnormal temperature magnetic response under an applied magnetic field between 100 and 400 K for [010]-oriented DyFeO3 thin films with an in-plane compressive strain between 2% and 3.5%. At room temperature and above, we found that application of approx. 0.06 T causes a spin-flop of the Dy spins coupled to the antiferromagnetic Fe spin lattice, whereby the Dy spins change from an antiferromagnetic alignment to ferromagnetic. The spin-flop field gives a lower energy bound on the Dy-Fe exchange interaction of approx. 15 microeV.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of monitored SSH Model in Krylov Space: From Complexity to Quantum Fisher Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of a non-Hermitian SSH model that arises out of the no-click limit of a monitored SSH model in the Krylov space. We find that the saturation timescale of the complexity associated with the spread of the state in the Krylov subspace increases with the measurement rate, and late time behaviour differs across the $\mathrm{PT}$ symmetry transition point. Furthermore, extending the notion of this complexity for subsystems in Krylov space, we find that the scaling of its late time value with subsystem size shows a discontinuous jump across the $\mathrm{PT}$ transition point, indicating that it can be used as a suitable order parameter for such transition but not for the measurement-induced transition. Finally, we show that the measurement-induced transition can be detected using a generalized measure in the Krylov subspace, which contains information about the correlation landscape, such as Quantum Fisher information, which also possesses some structural similarity with the complexity functional.</description>

      <title>Fragile topology on solid grounds and the Thouless conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a mathematical perspective on fragile topology in condensed matter physics. In dimension $d \le 3$, vanishing Chern classes characterize the topological phases of periodic media that exhibit localized Wannier functions. However, for special symmetries $I$ of the system, such as $C_{2z}T$ (space-time reversal), the existence of a localized set of Wannier functions that is also invariant under this symmetry $I$ may not always exist. In systems with fragile topology, Wannier functions cannot respect both the symmetry $I$ and the localization constraints. Nevertheless, this obstruction can be lifted by adding Chern-trivial line bundles, invariant under the $I$-symmetry. This allows for the construction of localized Wannier functions that respect symmetry. In the last section, we take on a broader perspective and obtain Wannier localization in dimensions $d=2,3$ without symmetry constraints for Chern nontrivial Bloch bundles. For $d=2$, we obtain the Wannier decay with Thouless exponent $\mathcal{O}(|x|^{-2})$; for $d=3$, we obtain the decay rate $\mathcal{O}(|x|^{-7/3})$.</description>

      <title>Permanent oscillations and solitary wave behavior in flatband Heisenberg quantum spin systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18646v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Research on the emergence of thermodynamics in closed quantum systems under unitary time evolution arrived at the consensus that generic systems equilibrate under rather general assumptions. A new focus of the field is thus on exceptions. Persistent oscillations are one possible hallmark of non-ergodic time evolution. While time-crystalline behavior results from, e.g., many-body localization, here we show that ever-revolving solitary waves emerge in flatband Heisenberg quantum spin systems. This phenomenon is rather general for a variety of frustrated spin systems in one, two, and three dimensions as well as for Hubbard systems.</description>

      <title>(H,Li)$_{6}$Ru$_{2}$O$_{6}$ : a possible zero-field Ru$^{3+}$-based Kitaev Quantum Spin Liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06380v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the synthesis and properties of (H,Li)$_{6}$Ru$_{2}$O$_{6}$, which is shown to be a $J_{\text{eff}}=\frac{1}{2}$ system made out of Ru$^{3+}$ moments in a honeycomb geometry. Bulk magnetization, heat capacity, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) rule out the presence of static moments or any spin glass phase down to 84 mK. All techniques suggest a crossover to a liquid-like state below about 40 K. The $^{7}$Li nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) shift data suggest a non-zero $T$-independent spin susceptibility at low $T$. In zero field, $C_m/T$ shows $T^{-0.9}$ divergence which is consistent with vacancy-induced effects on low-energy excitations of the pristine Kitaev spin liquid. With field, power-law variations in the $^{7}$Li NMR spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T$_{1}$ and magnetic heat capacity $C_{m}$ show quantitatively new scaling behaviors. A two-step entropy release in heat capacity is also observed putatively from $Z_{2}$ flux (low-$T$ step) and itinerant Majorana fermions (high-$T$ step). Based on these findings, we propose that (H,Li)$_{6}$Ru$_{2}$O$_{6}$ realizes a Kitaev spin liquid with no evidence of inherent magnetic ordering in zero field unlike $\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$ where approximately $8$ Tesla field is required to suppress magnetic order.</description>

      <title>Fermi-liquid corrections to the intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity of topological metals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that topological metals lacking time-reversal symmetry have an intrinsic non-quantized component of the anomalous Hall conductivity which is contributed not only by the Berry phase of quasiparticles on the Fermi surface, but also by Fermi-liquid corrections due to the residual interactions among quasiparticles, the Landau f-parametes. These corrections pair up with those that modify the optical mass with respect to the quasiparticle effective one, or the charge compressibility with respect to the quasiparticle density of states. Our result supports recent claims that the correct expressions for topological observables include vertex corrections besides the topological invariants built just upon the Green's functions. Furthermore, it demonstrates that such corrections are naturally accounted for by Landau's Fermi liquid theory, here extended to the case in which coherence effects between bands crossing the chemical potential and those that are instead away from it play a crucial role, as in the anomalous Hall conductivity, and have important implications when those metals are on the verge of a doping-driven Mott transition, as we discuss.</description>

Abstract: Three-dimensional quantum spin liquids have remained elusive, hindered by reduced quantum fluctuations from larger lattice connectivity inherent to high-dimensional systems. Here, we investigate the remarkable persistence of dynamical short-range magnetic correlations in the nearly body-centered cubic garnet NaCa$_2$Cu$_2$(VO$_4$)$_3$ down to $T = 50$ mK, two orders of magnitude below its Curie-Weiss temperature. Using a combination of neutron and muon spectroscopies plus numerical simulations, we demonstrate that a spin-liquid phase emerges from the interplay of strongly frustrated exchange interactions and subtle temperature-dependent Jahn-Teller spin-lattice effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many microscopic models with the interaction between the next-nearest neighbours as a key parameter for cuprate physics have inspired us to study the diagonal superexchange interaction in a CuO$_2$ layer. Our investigation shows that models with extended hopping provide a correct representation of magnetic interactions only in a hypothetical square CuO$_2$ layer, where the diagonal superexchange interaction with the next-nearest neighbors always has the AFM nature. The conclusions are based on the symmetry prohibition on FM contribution to the diagonal superexchange between the next-nearest neighbors for a simple square CuO$_2$ layer rather than for a real CuO$_2$ layer, where diagonal AFM superexchange may be overestimated. We also discuss the reasons for magnetic frustration effects and high sensitivity of spin nanoinhomogeneity to square symmetry breaking.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17793v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the magnetic ground state and properties of a frustrated two-dimensional classical Heisenberg model of interacting hexagonal clusters of spins. The energy of the ground states is found exactly for arbitrary values of $J_1$ (intra-cluster couplings) and $J_2$ (inter-cluster couplings). Our main results concern a frustrated region of the phase diagram, where we show that the set of ground states has a degeneracy larger than that due to global rotation symmetry. Furthermore, the ground state manifold does not have a fixed total magnetization~: there is a range of allowed values. At finite temperature, our Monte-Carlo simulations show that the entropy selects the most probable value of the total magnetization, while the histogram of the Monte-Carlo time series is non-trivial. This model is a first step towards modelling properties of a class of frustrated magnetic structures composed of coupled spin clusters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fractional quantum Hall states are the most prominent example of states with topological order, hosting excitations with fractionalized charge. Recent experiments in twisted $\text{MoTe}_2$ and graphene-based heterostructures provided evidence of fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) states, which spontaneously break time-reversal symmetry and persist even without an external magnetic field. Understanding the unique properties of these states requires the characterization of their low-energy excitations. To that end, we construct a parton theory for the energy and momentum-resolved single-particle spectral function of FQAH states. We explicitly consider several experimentally observed filling fractions as well as a composite Fermi liquid in the half-filled Chern band. The parton description qualitatively captures our numerical exact diagonalization results. Additionally, we discuss how the finite bandwidth of the Chern band and the non-ideal quantum geometry affect the fractionalized excitations. Our work demonstrates that the energy and momentum-resolved electronic single-particle spectral function provides a valuable tool to characterize fractionalized excitations of FQAH states in moir\'e lattices.</description>

Abstract: Electrons at the Fermi energy may lose their ability to propagate to long distances in certain disordered media. We use Green functions and solve parquet equations in high spatial dimensions to construct a conserving mean-field theory of the metallic and localized phases with the transition between them in the disordered Anderson model. We find that the static diffusion constant $D$ does not vanish at the Anderson localization transition. The divergence of a new time scale, proportional to the static electrical polarizability, signals the vanishing of diffusion. We introduce an extension of the diffusion equation to reach a consistent microscopic picture of the Anderson localization transition and the localized phase. Anderson localization is caused by the emergence of a spatially localized quantum bound state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The current progress in describing rare-earth-based magnets' electronic structure and magnetic properties is discussed. We use several currently popular electronic structure methods to show the typical values of critical parameters that define the physics of RECo$_5$ (RE = rare earth atom) materials. The magnetic moments and anisotropy of 4\textit{f} atoms are obtained using several approaches, including anisotropic 4\textit{f}-charge density-constrained DFT and DFT+HI methods. We also suggest the introduction of 'penalty' functional for obtaining correct variational total energy in the traditional Hund's rule-constrained DFT-based techniques. The applicability and future extensions are discussed. The proposed combination of methods is potentially suitable for high-throughput computational searches of new rare-earth-containing magnetic materials.</description>
