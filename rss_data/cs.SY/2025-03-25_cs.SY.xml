      <title>Temporally-Consistent Bilinearly Recurrent Autoencoders for Control Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the temporally-consistent bilinearly recurrent autoencoder (tcBLRAN), a Koopman operator based neural network architecture for modeling a control-affine nonlinear control system. The proposed method extends traditional Koopman autoencoders (KAE) by incorporating bilinear recurrent dynamics that are consistent across predictions, enabling accurate long-term forecasting for control-affine systems. This overcomes the roadblock that KAEs face when encountered with limited and noisy training datasets, resulting in a lack of generalizability due to inconsistency in training data. Through a blend of deep learning and dynamical systems theory, tcBLRAN demonstrates superior performance in capturing complex behaviors and control systems dynamics, providing a superior data-driven modeling technique for control systems and outperforming the state-of-the-art Koopman bilinear form (KBF) learned by autoencoder networks.</description>

      <title>QSID-MPC: Model Predictive Control with System Identification from Quantized Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Least-square system identification is widely used for data-driven model-predictive control (MPC) of unknown or partially known systems. This letter investigates how the system identification and subsequent MPC is affected when the state and input data is quantized. Specifically, we examine the fundamental connection between model error and quantization resolution and how that affects the stability and boundedness of the MPC tracking error. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, with a sufficiently rich dataset, the model error is bounded by a function of quantization resolution and the MPC tracking error is also ultimately bounded similarly. The theory is validated through numerical experiments conducted on two different linear dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Insights into the explainability of Lasso-based DeePC for nonlinear systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-enabled Predictive Control (DeePC) has recently gained the spotlight as an easy-to-use control technique that allows for constraint handling while relying on raw data only. Initially proposed for linear time-invariant systems, several DeePC extensions are now available to cope with nonlinear systems. Nonetheless, these solutions mainly focus on ensuring the controller's effectiveness, overlooking the explainability of the final result. As a step toward explaining the outcome of DeePC for the control of nonlinear systems, in this paper, we focus on analyzing the earliest and simplest DeePC approach proposed to cope with nonlinearities in the controlled system, using a Lasso regularization. Our theoretical analysis highlights that the decisions undertaken by DeePC with Lasso regularization are unexplainable, as control actions are determined by data incoherent with the system's local behavior. This result is true even when the available input/output samples are grouped according to the different operating conditions explored during data collection. This result is confirmed by our numerical study, which highlights the benefits of data grouping in terms of performance while showing that explainability remains a challenge in control design via DeePC.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Sim-to-real Gap: A Control Framework for Imitation Learning of Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To address the computational challenges of Model Predictive Control (MPC), recent research has studied on using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) trained through imitation learning to approximate the MPC. However, this introduces a common issue in learning-based control: the simulation-to-reality (sim-to-real) gap. Therefore, Domain Randomization (DR) has been widely used to mitigate this gap by introducing perturbations in the source domain. However, this led to low data collection efficiency and an overly conservative control strategy. This study proposes a new control framework that deals with this issue from a control perspective inspired by Robust Tube MPC. The framework ensures the DNN operates in the same environment as the source domain, handling the sim-to-real gap with great data collection efficiency. Moreover, a parameter governor is introduced to address the DNN's inability to adapt to model parameter variations, enabling the system to satisfy MPC constraints more robustly under changing conditions. The proposed framework was validated through a cart-pole system case study compared by DR baselines, demonstrating that a single MPC-demonstrated trajectory in the source domain was sufficient for controlling the cart-pole in the target domain. Furthermore, the system effectively handled model parameter variations, allowing for a less conservative control.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Predicting Runtime Savings from Discrete-Event Simulation Model Simplification Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Abstraction or substitution and aggregation are the most widely used simulation model simplification operations. Abstraction involves replacing subsystems within a discrete-event simulation (DES) with one or more quantities - typically random variables - representing the lengths of stay in the subsystems(s) in question to create a `simplified' system comprising only of subsystems of interest to the analysis at hand. Aggregation involves replacing more than one subsystem of the original `parent' simulation with a single subsystem. However, the model simplification process itself can be expensive, in terms of the computational runtime and effort required to collect the data required to estimate the distributions of the length of stay variables, the distribution-fitting process, and testing and validation of the simplified model. Moreover, the savings in simulation runtime that the simplification process yields is \textit{a priori} unknown to the modeller. In this context, a method that predicts the runtime savings (RS) from DES model simplification operations before their execution - at the conceptualisation stage of the simplified model development process - may help judge whether its development is indeed worth undertaking. In this paper, we present a queueing-theoretic framework for the prediction of RS from model simplification operations. Our framework is applicable for DES models comprising $M/M/, M/G/ \text{ and } G/G/$ subsystems. The performance of the RS prediction framework is demonstrated using multiple computational experiments. Our proposed framework contributes to the literature around DES model complexity and more broadly to DES runtime prediction.</description>

      <title>Optimal Parameter Adaptation for Safety-Critical Control via Safe Barrier Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safety is of paramount importance in control systems to avoid costly risks and catastrophic damages. The control barrier function (CBF) method, a promising solution for safety-critical control, poses a new challenge of enhancing control performance due to its direct modification of original control design and the introduction of uncalibrated parameters. In this work, we shed light on the crucial role of configurable parameters in the CBF method for performance enhancement with a systematical categorization. Based on that, we propose a novel framework combining the CBF method with Bayesian optimization (BO) to optimize the safe control performance. Considering feasibility/safety-critical constraints, we develop a safe version of BO using the barrier-based interior method to efficiently search for promising feasible configurable parameters. Furthermore, we provide theoretical criteria of our framework regarding safety and optimality. An essential advantage of our framework lies in that it can work in model-agnostic environments, leaving sufficient flexibility in designing objective and constraint functions. Finally, simulation experiments on swing-up control and high-fidelity adaptive cruise control are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.</description>

      <title>Iterative Learning Predictive Control for Constrained Uncertain Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Iterative learning control (ILC) improves the performance of a repetitive system by learning from previous trials. ILC can be combined with Model Predictive Control (MPC) to mitigate non-repetitive disturbances, thus improving overall system performance. However, existing approaches either assume perfect model knowledge or fail to actively learn system uncertainties, leading to conservativeness. To address these limitations we propose a binary mixed-integer ILC scheme, combined with a convex MPC scheme, that ensures robust constraint satisfaction, non-increasing nominal cost, and convergence to optimal performance. Our scheme is designed for uncertain nonlinear systems subject to both bounded additive stochastic noise and additive uncertain components. We showcase the benefits of our scheme in simulation.</description>

      <title>A multiobjective approach to robust predictive control barrier functions for discrete-time systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an optimisation-based approach to ensure robust asymptotic stability stability of a desired set in the state space of nonlinear dynamical systems, while optimising a general control objective. The approach relies on the decrease of a robust predictive control barrier function (PCBF), which is defined as the optimal value function of a slack minimisation problem with respect to the target set. We show continuity of the proposed robust PCBF, allowing the introduction of a decrease constraint in the control objective minimisation. The PCBF decrease is given with respect to a warmstart value based on a feasible solution at the prior time step. Thereby, the control objective can be optimised while ensuring robust asymptotic stability of the target set. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed formulation on a linear space rendezvous and nonlinear lane changing problem.</description>

      <title>On the Completeness and Ordering of Path-Complete Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with path-complete barrier functions which offer a graph-based methodology for verifying safety properties in switched systems. The path-complete framework leverages algebraic (barrier functions) as well as combinatorial (graph) components to characterize a set of safety conditions for switched systems, thus offering high flexibility (two degrees of freedom) in searching for suitable safety certificates. In this paper, we do not propose any new safety criteria. Instead, we further investigate the role that the combinatorial component plays in the safety verification problem. First, we prove that path-completeness, which is a property on a graph that describes the switching sequences, is necessary to obtain a set of valid safety conditions. As a result, the path-complete framework is able to provide a complete characterization of safety conditions for switched systems. Furthermore, we provide a systematic methodology for comparing two path-complete graphs and the conservatism associated with the resulting safety conditions. Specifically, we prove that under some conditions, such as when there exists a simulation relation between two path-complete graphs, it is possible to conclude that one graph is always able to provide less conservative safety conditions than another, independent of the algebraic properties of the switched system and the template of the barrier function under consideration. Such a result paves the way for a systematic use of the path-complete frame- work with barrier functions, as one can then consistently choose the appropriate graph that provides less conservative safety conditions.</description>

      <title>Optimal Safe Sequencing and Motion Control for Mixed Traffic Roundabouts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops an Optimal Safe Sequencing (OSS) control framework for Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) navigating a single-lane roundabout in mixed traffic, where both CAVs and Human-Driven Vehicles (HDVs) coexist. The framework jointly optimizes vehicle sequencing and motion control to minimize travel time, energy consumption, and discomfort while ensuring speed-dependent safety guarantees and adhering to velocity and acceleration constraints. This is achieved by integrating (a) a Safe Sequencing (SS) policy that ensures merging safety without requiring any knowledge of HDV behavior, and (b) a Model Predictive Control with Control Lyapunov Barrier Functions (MPC-CLBF) framework, which optimizes CAV motion control while mitigating infeasibility and myopic control issues common in the use of Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to provide safety guarantees. Simulation results across various traffic demands, CAV penetration rates, and control parameters demonstrate the framework's effectiveness and stability.</description>

      <title>Nordic perspective on System Integrity Protection Schemes in relation to capacity allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The urgent need to address climate change prompts societies worldwide to adopt carbon neutral energy and electrification. To facilitate this, a range of technologies and policies will be needed. Alternatives to traditional power grid reinforcement, such as grid-enhancing technologies and system automation, are particularly attractive due to their potentially low cost and fast deployment time. One alternative is System Integrity Protection Schemes (SIPS) - automatic and curative remedial actions (RAs) which can boost grid transfer capacities without compromising with reliability since they can act faster than manual control. The use of SIPS however is scattered, with limited coordination between countries, and the full potential of using SIPS for capacity enhancement is not yet realized. The aim of this paper is to provide a case study and comparison of SIPS in the Nordic countries, particularly in relation to capacity allocation. It also seeks to harmonize terminology relating to ancillary services, RAs, and SIPS. Finally, it examines and compares the inclusion of RAs and SIPS in different Capacity Calculation Methodologies (CCMs). In both main EU CCMs - Net Transfer Capacity (NTC) and Flow-Based (FB) - RAs play a pronounced role. The paper is based on a survey and interviews with Nordic stakeholders, along with a literature review and analysis of public data. The results indicate a large variation in SIPS use across the Nordics. Regarding terminology, we suggest that SIPS is a subcategory of RAs which overlaps with ancillary services. Concerning CCMs, NTC is unable to fully represent capacity constraints in meshed AC systems, which in turn hinders systematic capacity enhancement using RAs. FB on the other hand explicitly includes RAs in the capacity domain. A lower bound for the economic value of RAs can be calculated, amounting to 11.5 million EUR in the Nordics in Nov and Dec 2024.</description>

      <title>A Spectrum-based Filter Design for Periodic Control of Systems with Time Delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fully analytical controller design is proposed to tackle a periodic control problem for stable linear systems with an input delay. Applying the internal model control scheme, the controller design reduces to designing a filter, which is done through the placement of poles and zeros. The zeros are placed to compensate for the harmonics and to achieve the desired degree of properness for the filter. For placing the poles, a quasi-optimal procedure is proposed utilizing the standard LQR method. Given the high-dimensionality of the filter due to targeting a large number of harmonics, the design, as well as controller implementation, is performed over a state-space representation. A thorough experimental case study is included to demonstrate both the practical feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed control design. The experimental validation is performed on a physical system, the goal of which is to reject periodic vibrations acting on a mass-spring-damper setup where the sensor and the actuator are non-collocated.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Satisfaction of Long-Term Spatial Constraints in Multi-Agent Systems: A Distributed Optimization Approach (extended version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of collaboratively satisfying long-term spatial constraints in multi-agent systems. Each agent is subject to spatial constraints, expressed as inequalities, which may depend on the positions of other agents with whom they may or may not have direct communication. These constraints need to be satisfied asymptotically or after an unknown finite time. The agents' objective is to collectively achieve a formation that fulfills all constraints. The problem is initially framed as a centralized unconstrained optimization, where the solution yields the optimal configuration by maximizing an objective function that reflects the degree of constraint satisfaction. This function encourages collaboration, ensuring agents help each other meet their constraints while fulfilling their own. When the constraints are infeasible, agents converge to a least-violating solution. A distributed consensus-based optimization scheme is then introduced, which approximates the centralized solution, leading to the development of distributed controllers for single-integrator agents. Finally, simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Prototyping and Test of the "Canis" HTS Planar Coil Array for Stellarator Field Shaping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thea Energy, Inc. is currently developing the "Eos" planar coil stellarator, the Company's first integrated fusion system capable of forming optimized stellarator magnetic fields without complex and costly modular coils. To demonstrate the field shaping capability required to enable Eos, Thea Energy designed, constructed, and tested the "Canis" 3x3 array of high-temperature superconductor (HTS) planar shaping coils after successfully demonstrating a single shaping coil prototype. Through the Canis 3x3 magnet array program, Thea Energy manufactured nine HTS shaping coils and developed the cryogenic test and measurement infrastructure necessary to validate the array's performance. Thea Energy operated the array at 20 K, generating several stellarator-relevant magnetic field shapes and demonstrating closed loop field control of the superconducting magnets to within 1% of predicted field, a margin of error acceptable for operation of an integrated stellarator. The Canis magnet array test campaign provides a proof of concept for HTS planar shaping coils as a viable approach to confining stellarator plasmas.</description>

      <title>Dom, cars don't fly! -- Or do they? In-Air Vehicle Maneuver for High-Speed Off-Road Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When pushing the speed limit for aggressive off-road navigation on uneven terrain, it is inevitable that vehicles may become airborne from time to time. During time-sensitive tasks, being able to fly over challenging terrain can also save time, instead of cautiously circumventing or slowly negotiating through. However, most off-road autonomy systems operate under the assumption that the vehicles are always on the ground and therefore limit operational speed. In this paper, we present a novel approach for in-air vehicle maneuver during high-speed off-road navigation. Based on a hybrid forward kinodynamic model using both physics principles and machine learning, our fixed-horizon, sampling-based motion planner ensures accurate vehicle landing poses and their derivatives within a short airborne time window using vehicle throttle and steering commands. We test our approach in extensive in-air experiments both indoors and outdoors, compare it against an error-driven control method, and demonstrate that precise and timely in-air vehicle maneuver is possible through existing ground vehicle controls.</description>

      <title>A multi-axis Nanopositioner based on Near-Field Acoustic Levitation and Electromagnetic Actuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Positioners based on near-field acoustic levitation (NFAL) offer high positioning resolution and bandwidth, primarily along the Z axis, because of the large acoustic Z-stiffness and squeeze film damping. However, their XY-positioning resolution and bandwidth are several orders of magnitude lower because of the limited acoustic stiffness and damping in these directions. In this paper, we increase the XY-stiffness and damping by using a steady-current-based planar electromagnetic trap and eddy current damping technique, respectively. Specifically, NFAL is used to levitate a magnetic platform, which is then electromagnetically trapped in the XY-plane. Eddy currents generated by a thin copper plate beneath the levitating platform increase in-plane damping by a factor of 52, thereby reducing vibrations inherent in the NFAL technique. Additionally, the planar coil used for electromagnetic trapping provides multi-axis positioning capabilities. We demonstrate 3-axis linear motion with a root mean square (rms) positioning resolution of better than 20 nm along all axes. The in-plane motion range and bandwidth achieved are 1.42 mm and 16 Hz, respectively, while a motion range of 40 micrometers with a positioning bandwidth of 171 Hz is achieved along the Z-axis.</description>

      <title>Optimal Modified Feedback Strategies in LQ Games under Control Imperfections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Game-theoretic approaches and Nash equilibrium have been widely applied across various engineering domains. However, practical challenges such as disturbances, delays, and actuator limitations can hinder the precise execution of Nash equilibrium strategies. This work explores the impact of such implementation imperfections on game trajectories and players' costs within the context of a two-player linear quadratic (LQ) nonzero-sum game. Specifically, we analyze how small deviations by one player affect the state and cost function of the other player. To address these deviations, we propose an adjusted control policy that not only mitigates adverse effects optimally but can also exploit the deviations to enhance performance. Rigorous mathematical analysis and proofs are presented, demonstrating through a representative example that the proposed policy modification achieves up to $61\%$ improvement compared to the unadjusted feedback policy and up to $0.59\%$ compared to the feedback Nash strategy.</description>

      <title>Continual Reinforcement Learning for HVAC Systems Control: Integrating Hypernetworks and Transfer Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Buildings with Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems play a crucial role in ensuring indoor comfort and efficiency. While traditionally governed by physics-based models, the emergence of big data has enabled data-driven methods like Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). However, Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based techniques often suffer from sample inefficiency and limited generalization, especially across varying HVAC systems. We introduce a model-based reinforcement learning framework that uses a Hypernetwork to continuously learn environment dynamics across tasks with different action spaces. This enables efficient synthetic rollout generation and improved sample usage. Our approach demonstrates strong backward transfer in a continual learning setting after training on a second task, minimal fine-tuning on the first task allows rapid convergence within just 5 episodes and thus outperforming Model Free Reinforcement Learning (MFRL) and effectively mitigating catastrophic forgetting. These findings have significant implications for reducing energy consumption and operational costs in building management, thus supporting global sustainability goals.

Abstract: Magnetic navigation offers wireless control over magnetic objects, which has important medical applications, such as targeted drug delivery and minimally invasive surgery. Magnetic navigation systems are categorized into systems using permanent magnets and systems based on electromagnets. Electromagnetic Navigation Systems (eMNSs) are believed to have a superior actuation bandwidth, facilitating trajectory tracking and disturbance rejection. This greatly expands the range of potential medical applications and includes even dynamic environments as encountered in cardiovascular interventions. To showcase the dynamic capabilities of eMNSs, we successfully stabilize a (non-magnetic) inverted pendulum on the tip of a magnetically driven arm. Our approach employs a model-based framework that leverages Lagrangian mechanics to capture the interaction between the mechanical dynamics and the magnetic field. Using system identification, we estimate unknown parameters, the actuation bandwidth, and characterize the system's nonlinearity. To explore the limits of electromagnetic navigation and evaluate its scalability, we characterize the electrical system dynamics and perform reference measurements on a clinical-scale eMNS, affirming that the proposed dynamic control methodologies effectively translate to larger coil configurations. A state-feedback controller stabilizes the inherently unstable pendulum, and an iterative learning control scheme enables accurate tracking of non-equilibrium trajectories. Furthermore, to understand structural limitations of our control strategy, we analyze the influence of magnetic field gradients on the motion of the system. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration to stabilize a 3D inverted pendulum through electromagnetic navigation.</description>

      <title>A Concept for Semi-Automatic Configuration of Sufficiently Valid Simulation Setups for Automated Driving Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19356v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As simulation is increasingly used in scenario-based approaches to test Automated Driving Systems, the credibility of simulation results is a major concern. Arguably, credibility depends on the validity of the simulation setup and simulation models. When selecting appropriate simulation models, a trade-off must be made between validity, often connected to the model's fidelity, and cost of computation. However, due to the large number of test cases, expert-based methods to create sufficiently valid simulation setups seem infeasible. We propose using design contracts in order to semi-automatically compose simulation setups for given test cases from simulation models and to derive requirements for the simulation models, supporting separation of concerns between simulation model developers and users. Simulation model contracts represent their validity domains by capturing a validity guarantee and the associated operating conditions in an assumption. We then require the composition of the simulation model contracts to refine a test case contract. The latter contract captures the operating conditions of the test case in its assumption and validity requirements in its guarantee. Based on this idea, we present a framework that supports the compositional configuration of simulation setups based on the contracts and a method to derive runtime monitors for these simulation setups.</description>

Abstract: Channel turbulence is a formidable obstacle for free-space optical (FSO) communication. Anticipation of turbulence levels is highly important for mitigating disruptions but has not been demonstrated without dedicated, auxiliary hardware. We show that machine learning (ML) can be applied to raw FSO data streams to rapidly predict channel turbulence levels with no additional sensing hardware. FSO was conducted through a controlled channel in the lab under six distinct turbulence levels, and the efficacy of using ML to classify turbulence levels was examined. ML-based turbulence level classification was found to be &gt;98% accurate with multiple ML training parameters. Classification effectiveness was found to depend on the timescale of changes between turbulence levels but converges when turbulence stabilizes over about a one minute timescale.</description>

      <title>Infinite-Horizon Optimal Wireless Control Over Shared State-Dependent Fading Channels for IIoT Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heterogeneous systems consisting of a multiloop wireless control system (WCS) and a mobile agent system (MAS) are ubiquitous in Industrial Internet of Things systems. Within these systems, the positions of mobile agents may lead to shadow fading on the wireless channel that the WCS is controlled over and can significantly compromise its performance, requiring joint coordination between the WCS and MAS. Such coordination introduces different time steps and hybrid state spaces consisting of logical components and continuous components. This paper focuses on the infinite-horizon optimal control of MAS to ensure the performance of WCS while minimizing an average cost for the heterogeneous system subject to safety constraints. A state-dependent fading channel is modeled to capture interference among transmission links, as well as the effects of mobile agents' movements on successful wireless transmission. In order to address the heterogeneous system dynamics, the optimal control problem is formulated as the optimal constrained set stabilization of the MAS by establishing a necessary and sufficient condition for the Lyapunov-like performance of WCS with the expected decay rates. Using the semi-tensor product of matrices, a constrained optimal state transition graph is constructed to encode the constrained system dynamics as well as objective function, which further reduces the problem into a minimum-mean cycle problem for the graph. By studying the properties of the graph, the feasibility is proven, and an effective algorithm is proposed for the construction of optimal input sequences. An illustrative example is provided to demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>A Unified Fault Ride Through Technique for Virtual Oscillator based Grid Forming Controllers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Grid-forming technology has a crucial role in achieving the future all renewable power grid. Among different types of grid-forming controllers, Virtual Oscillator (VO) based Controllers (VOCs) are the most advanced. VOCs outperform the conventional droop-based grid-forming controllers in terms of dynamic performance and synchronization stability by adapting time-domain-based implementation. However, because of the time-domain-based implementation, the same Fault Ride-through (FRT) techniques for droop-based controllers are incompatible with VOCs. Existing literature has successfully incorporated current limiting techniques in VOCs to protect the converters during severe transient conditions. Nevertheless, some very important aspects of FRT requirements are not attended to by the existing literature on VOCs, such as maintaining synchronization with the network during a fault, minimizing power oscillation during a fault, and at the fault clearance. First, this article introduces a unique analytical approach for quantifying the underlying dynamics of VOCs during faults. Next, using the mentioned analysis and in-depth reasoning, the systematic development of a unique FRT control architecture for VOCs is presented. The proposed FRT technique has unified both current and voltage synchronization in the same architecture to work successfully under three-phase and unbalanced faults. The performance of the proposed controller is thoroughly investigated and compared with existing VOCs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive stability results for finite control set and mixed-integer model predictive control and propose a unified theoretical framework. The presentation rests upon the inherent robustness properties of common model predictive control with stabilizing terminal conditions and techniques for solving mixed-integer optimal control problems by continuous optimization. Partial outer convexification and binary relaxation transform mixed-integer problems into common optimal control problems. We derive nominal asymptotic stability for the resulting relaxed system formulation and implement sum-up rounding to restore efficiently integer feasibility. If fast control switching is technically possible and inexpensive, we can approximate the relaxed system behavior in the state space arbitrarily close. We integrate input perturbed model predictive control with practical asymptotic stability. Numerical experiments support our theoretical findings and illustrate practical relevance of fast and systematic control switching.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15552v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive framework for studying and leveraging morphological symmetries in robotic systems. These are intrinsic properties of the robot's morphology, frequently observed in animal biology and robotics, which stem from the replication of kinematic structures and the symmetrical distribution of mass. We illustrate how these symmetries extend to the robot's state space and both proprioceptive and exteroceptive sensor measurements, resulting in the equivariance of the robot's equations of motion and optimal control policies. Thus, we recognize morphological symmetries as a relevant and previously unexplored physics-informed geometric prior, with significant implications for both data-driven and analytical methods used in modeling, control, estimation and design in robotics. For data-driven methods, we demonstrate that morphological symmetries can enhance the sample efficiency and generalization of machine learning models through data augmentation, or by applying equivariant/invariant constraints on the model's architecture. In the context of analytical methods, we employ abstract harmonic analysis to decompose the robot's dynamics into a superposition of lower-dimensional, independent dynamics. We substantiate our claims with both synthetic and real-world experiments conducted on bipedal and quadrupedal robots. Lastly, we introduce the repository MorphoSymm to facilitate the practical use of the theory and applications outlined in this work.</description>

Abstract: Super-Resolution Ultrasound (SRUS) imaging through localising and tracking microbubbles, also known as Ultrasound Localisation Microscopy (ULM), has demonstrated significant potential for reconstructing microvasculature and flows with sub-diffraction resolution in clinical diagnostics. However, imaging organs with large tissue movements, such as those caused by respiration, presents substantial challenges. Existing methods often require breath holding to maintain accumulation accuracy, which limits data acquisition time and ULM image saturation. To improve image quality in the presence of large tissue movements, this study introduces an approach integrating high-frame-rate ultrasound with online precise robotic probe control. Tested on a microvasculature phantom with translation motions up to 20 mm, twice the aperture size of the matrix array used, our method achieved real-time tracking of the moving phantom and imaging volume rate at 85 Hz, keeping majority of the target volume in the imaging field of view. ULM images of the moving cross channels in the phantom were successfully reconstructed in post-processing, demonstrating the feasibility of super-resolution imaging under large tissue motions. This represents a significant step towards ULM imaging of organs with large motion.</description>

      <title>A Rapid Trajectory Optimization and Control Framework for Resource-Constrained Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07413v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a computationally efficient model predictive control formulation that uses an integral Chebyshev collocation method to enable rapid operations of autonomous agents. By posing the finite-horizon optimal control problem and recursive re-evaluation of the optimal trajectories, minimization of the L2 norms of the state and control errors are transcribed into a quadratic program. Control and state variable constraints are parameterized using Chebyshev polynomials and are accommodated in the optimal trajectory generation programs to incorporate the actuator limits and keep-out constraints. Differentiable collision detection of polytopes is leveraged for optimal collision avoidance. Results obtained from the collocation methods are benchmarked against the existing approaches on an edge computer to outline the performance improvements. Finally, collaborative control scenarios involving multi-agent space systems are considered to demonstrate the technical merits of the proposed work.</description>

      <title>Explaining Control Policies through Predicate Decision Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06420</link>

Abstract: Safety-critical controllers of complex systems are hard to construct manually. Automated approaches such as controller synthesis or learning provide a tempting alternative but usually lack explainability. To this end, learning decision trees (DTs) have been prevalently used towards an interpretable model of the generated controllers. However, DTs do not exploit shared decision-making, a key concept exploited in binary decision diagrams (BDDs) to reduce their size and thus improve explainability. In this work, we introduce predicate decision diagrams (PDDs) that extend BDDs with predicates and thus unite the advantages of DTs and BDDs for controller representation. We establish a synthesis pipeline for efficient construction of PDDs from DTs representing controllers, exploiting reduction techniques for BDDs also for PDDs.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Neural Network Transfer-Learning Model for Forecasting Problems with Continuous and Discrete Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study introduces simple yet effective continuous- and discrete-variable quantum neural network (QNN) models as a transfer-learning approach for forecasting tasks. The CV-QNN features a single quantum layer with two qubits to establish entanglement and utilizes a minimal set of quantum gates, including displacement, rotation, beam splitter, squeezing, and a non-Gaussian cubic-phase gate, with a maximum of eight trainable parameters. A key advantage of this model is its ability to be trained on a single dataset, after which the learned parameters can be transferred to other forecasting problems with little to no fine-tuning. Initially trained on the Kurdistan load demand dataset, the model's frozen parameters are successfully applied to various forecasting tasks, including energy consumption, traffic flow, weather conditions, and cryptocurrency price prediction, demonstrating strong performance. Furthermore, the study introduces a discrete-variable quantum model with an equivalent 2- and 4-wire configuration and presents a performance assessment, showing good but relatively lower effectiveness compared to the continuous-variable model.</description>
