      <title>Data driven modeling of multiple interest rates with generalized Vasicek-type models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Vasicek model is a commonly used interest rate model, and there exist many extensions and generalizations of it. However, most generalizations of the model are either univariate or assume the noise process to be Gaussian, or both. In this article, we study a generalized multivariate Vasicek model that allows simultaneous modeling of multiple interest rates while making minimal assumptions. In the model, we only assume that the noise process has stationary increments with a suitably decaying autocovariance structure. We provide estimators for the unknown parameters and prove their consistencies. We also derive limiting distributions for each estimator and provide theoretical examples. Furthermore, the model is tested empirically with both simulated data and real data.</description>

      <title>Distance and Kernel-Based Measures for Global and Local Two-Sample Conditional Distribution Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.08149v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Testing the equality of two conditional distributions is crucial in various modern applications, including transfer learning and causal inference. Despite its importance, this fundamental problem has received surprisingly little attention in the literature, with existing works focusing exclusively on global two-sample conditional distribution testing. Based on distance and kernel methods, this paper presents the first unified framework for both global and local two-sample conditional distribution testing. To this end, we introduce distance and kernel-based measures that characterize the homogeneity of two conditional distributions. Drawing from the concept of conditional U-statistics, we propose consistent estimators for these measures. Theoretically, we derive the convergence rates and the asymptotic distributions of the estimators under both the null and alternative hypotheses. Utilizing these measures, along with a local bootstrap approach, we develop global and local tests that can detect discrepancies between two conditional distributions at global and local levels, respectively. Our tests demonstrate reliable performance through simulations and real data analysis.</description>

      <title>Testing Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Economists are often interested in the mechanisms by which a treatment affects an outcome. We develop tests for the "sharp null of full mediation" that a treatment $D$ affects an outcome $Y$ only through a particular mechanism (or set of mechanisms) $M$. Our approach exploits connections between mediation analysis and the econometric literature on testing instrument validity. We also provide tools for quantifying the magnitude of alternative mechanisms when the sharp null is rejected: we derive sharp lower bounds on the fraction of individuals whose outcome is affected by the treatment despite having the same value of $M$ under both treatments (``always-takers''), as well as sharp bounds on the average effect of the treatment for such always-takers. An advantage of our approach relative to existing tools for mediation analysis is that it does not require stringent assumptions about how $M$ is assigned. We illustrate our methodology in two empirical applications.</description>

      <title>Using Aggregate Relational Data to Infer Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel approach for inferring social network structures using Aggregate Relational Data (ARD), addressing the challenge of limited detailed network data availability. By integrating ARD with variational approximation methods, we provide a computationally efficient and cost-effective solution for network analysis. Our methodology demonstrates the potential of ARD to offer insightful approximations of network dynamics, as evidenced by Monte Carlo Simulations. This paper not only showcases the utility of ARD in social network inference but also opens avenues for future research in enhancing estimation precision and exploring diverse network datasets. Through this work, we contribute to the field of network analysis by offering an alternative strategy for understanding complex social networks with constrained data.</description>
