      <title>The modular properties of $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ torus $1$-point functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformal field theory and its axiomatisation in terms of vertex operator algebras or chiral algebras are most commonly considered on the Riemann sphere. However, an important constraint in physics and an interesting source of mathematics is the fact that conformal field theories are expected to be well defined on any Riemann surface. To this end, a thorough understanding of chiral torus 1-point functions, ideally including explicit formulae, is a prerequisite for a detailed understanding of higher genera. These are distinguished from characters or vacuum torus 1-point functions because the insertion point is explicitly allowed to be labelled by any module over the vertex operator algebra rather than just the vertex operator algebra itself.
  Compellingly, chiral torus 1-point functions exhibit interesting modular properties, which we explore here in the example of the simple affine $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ vertex operator algebras at non-negative integral levels. We determine the dimension of the space spanned by such functions, choose a natural basis to construct vector-valued modular forms and describe the congruence properties of these forms. In particular, we find explicit generators for the spaces of all vector-valued modular forms of dimension at most three, when the insertion comes from a simple module other than the vertex operator algebra. Finally, we use the fact that categories of modules over rational vertex operator algebras are modular tensor categories to give explicit formulae for the action of the modular group on chiral torus 1-point functions entirely in terms of categorical data. The usual modular $\mathsf{S}$ and $\mathsf{T}$ matrices of characters are known not to be complete invariants of modular tensor categories, so these generalised modular data are good candidates for more fine-grained invariants.</description>

      <title>Existence and uniqueness of the Levi-Civita connection on noncommutative differential forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We combine Hilbert module and algebraic techniques to give necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of an Hermitian torsion-free connection on the bimodule of differential one-forms of a first order differential calculus. In the presence of the extra structure of a bimodule connection, we give sufficient conditions for uniqueness. We prove that any $\theta$-deformation of a compact Riemannian manifold admits a unique Hermitian torsion-free bimodule connection and provide an explicit construction of it. Specialising to classical Riemannian manifolds yields a novel construction of the Levi-Civita connection on the cotangent bundle.</description>

      <title>Higher Operations in Perturbation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the role of formal deformation theory in quantum field theories and present various ``higher operations'' which control their deformations, (generalized) OPEs, and anomalies. Particular attention is paid to holomorphic-topological theories where we systematically describe and regularize the Feynman diagrams which compute these higher operations in free and perturbative scenarios, including examples with defects. We prove geometrically that the resulting higher operations satisfy expected ``quadratic axioms,'' which can be interpreted physically as a form of Wess-Zumino consistency condition for BRST symmetry. We discuss a higher-dimensional analogue of Kontsevich's formality theorem, which proves the absence of perturbative corrections in TQFTs with two or more topological directions. We discuss at some length the relation of our work to the theory of factorization algebras and provide an introduction to the subject for physicists.</description>

      <title>Chiral life on a slab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.00038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study chiral algebra in the reduction of 3D $\mathcal{N} = 2 $ supersymmetric gauge theories on an interval with the $\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$ Dirichlet boundary conditions on both ends. By invoking the 3D ``twisted formalism'' and the 2D $\beta\gamma$-description we explicitly find the perturbative $\overline{Q}_+$ cohomology of the reduced theory. It is shown that the vertex algebras of boundary operators are enhanced by the line operators. A full non-perturbative result is found in the abelian case, where the chiral algebra is given by the rank two Narain lattice VOA, and two more equivalent descriptions are provided. Conjectures and speculations on the nonperturbative answer in the non-abelian case are also given.</description>
