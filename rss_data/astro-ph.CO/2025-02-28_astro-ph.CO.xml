      <title>Neutrino Emission and Plasma Heating from Primordial Black Holes: An Improved Approach to $N_\mathrm{eff}$ Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of neutrino emission via Hawking radiation from primordial black holes (PBHs) on the cosmological effective number of neutrino species, $N_{\mathrm{eff}}$, after neutrino decoupling. By comparing this effect with observational limits, we derive bounds on the abundance of light PBHs. Our analysis incorporates two previously unaccounted-for effects: the emission of secondary neutrinos from unstable particles, which increases $N_{\mathrm{eff}}$, and the modification of the neutrino-photon temperature ratio due to particle emission heating the photon plasma, which lowers $N_{\mathrm{eff}}$. Overall, including these effects allows us to impose constraints on PBH masses with initial masses in the range $10^9~{\rm g}\lesssim M_{\rm ini} \lesssim 10^{13}~{\rm g}$. However, our limits remain less stringent than those derived from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis.</description>

      <title>Axion dark matter searches from the standard halo over the tidal stream to the big flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sensitivity of axion dark matter searches depends on the signal
  window that results from the velocity dispersion of axion dark
  matter. Since the ratio of signal windows is about 6500 between the
  standard halo and the big flow axion dark matter, each axion dark
  matter search usually uses a separate data acquisition (DAQ) channel
  with a different frequency resolution bandwidth (RBW).
  In this work, we demonstrate axion dark matter searches covering the
  standard halo, the tidal stream, and the big flow employing a DAQ
  channel starting with a single high resolution RBW, without
  sacrificing the DAQ efficiency, where the DAQ process includes
  online fast Fourier transforms and writing the outputs to disk.
  Assuming the total amount of data is sensitive to
  Dine-Fischler-Srednicki-Zhitnitskii (DFSZ) axion dark matter that
  follows the standard halo model and makes up 100\% of the local dark
  matter density, the same data can also be used for the tidal stream
  and the big flow axion dark matter searches that would be sensitive
  to DFSZ axion dark matter that constitute 19.2\% and 12.4\% of the
  local dark matter densities, respectively, at a 90\% confidence
  level.
  We also report that the filtering of the individual power spectra
  acquired with a relatively high resolution RBW e.g., for the big
  flow search can prevent a possible significant degradation in the
  signal to noise ratio from the searches in the lower resolution
  RBW's, i.e., the standard halo and tidal stream searches.</description>

      <title>Self-similar decomposition of the hierarchical merger tree of dark matter halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the merger tree of dark matter halos is approximately self-similar by investigating the universality of the subhalo peak mass function (PMF) describing the mass distribution of progenitor halos. Using a set of cosmological simulations and identifying subhalos of different merger levels with HBT+, we verify that the level-1 subhalo PMF is close to universal across halo mass, redshift, and cosmology. This approximate self-similarity allows us to analytically derive the subhalo PMF for subhalos accreted at any level (i.e., for sub-sub...halos) through self-convolutions of the level-1 PMF, and the resulting model shows good agreement with simulation measurements. We further derive a number of analytical properties on the hierarchical origin of subhalos, including the level distribution, accretion rate at each level, initial merger ratio distribution, and accretion redshift distribution. We find that higher-level subhalos dominate at progressively lower peak mass in the PMF and are more likely to originate from major mergers than lower-level ones. At a given mass ratio at accretion time, the subhalo accretion rates at each level track the growth rate of the host halo. At a fixed final mass ratio, however, the accretion redshift distribution of subhalos depends on the subhalo level, peak mass, and host mass. Higher-level and higher-mass-ratio subhalos tend to be accreted more recently, and more massive halos also accrete their subhalos more recently. Our model provides a concise summary of simulation results and can serve as a basis for further theoretical understanding of the hierarchical structure formation.</description>

      <title>Linear matter density perturbations in the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model: Examining growth dynamics and addressing the $S_8$ tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate linear matter density perturbations in the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM, in which the $\Lambda$ is replaced by late-time ($z\sim2$) mirror AdS-dS transition, resulting in distinct growth dynamics. We use two complementary approaches: (i) determining the initial density contrast and its evolution rate for a given collapse scale factor, (ii) computing the collapse scale factor for a specified initial density contrast and evolution rate. We derive analytical solutions for the growth rate $f=\Omega_{\rm m}^\gamma$ and growth index $\gamma$ in both models. Prior to the transition, the AdS-like $\Lambda$ reduces cosmic friction, causing linear matter density perturbations to grow more rapidly than in $\Lambda$CDM; this effect is most pronounced just before the transition, with a growth rate around $15\%$ higher than $\Lambda$CDM around $z\sim2$. After the transition, $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM behaves similarly to $\Lambda$CDM but features a larger cosmological constant, leading to higher $H(z)$ and greater cosmic friction that more effectively suppresses growth. Before the transition, $\gamma$ remains below both the $\Lambda$CDM and EdS values ($\gamma\approx6/11$); during the transition, it increases rapidly and then grows gradually, paralleling $\Lambda$CDM while remaining slightly higher in the post-transition era-though overall, it stays near $\gamma\sim0.55$. Using the Planck best-fit values, $\Omega_{\rm m0}=0.28$ for $\Lambda_{\mathrm{s}}$CDM and $\Omega_{\rm m0}=0.32$ for $\Lambda$CDM, we find $f=0.49$ and $f=0.53$, respectively. $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM predicts a value of $f=0.48$, recently obtained from LSS data when $\gamma$ is treated as a free parameter in $\Lambda$CDM. This suggests that $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM may resolve the structure growth anomaly, without deviating from $\gamma \sim 0.55$.</description>

      <title>Causality Bounds on the Primordial Power Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective field theories (EFTs) parametrize our ignorance of the underlying UV theory through their Wilson coefficients. However, not all values of these coefficients are consistent with fundamental physical principles. In this paper, we explore the consequences of imposing causal propagation on the comoving curvature perturbation in the EFT of inflation, particularly its impact on the primordial power spectrum and the effective sound speed $c_s^\text{eff}$. We investigate scenarios where $c_s^\text{eff}$ undergoes a transition, remaining consistent with CMB constraints at early times but later experiencing a drastic change, becoming highly subluminal. Such scenarios allow the primordial power spectrum to grow at small scales, potentially leading to the formation of primordial black holes or the generation of scalar-induced gravitational waves. We find the generic feature that in a causal theory, luminal sound speeds imply a free theory, effectively constraining the dynamics. Additionally, we obtain that when considering natural values for the Wilson coefficients, maintaining the validity of the EFT and the weakly coupled regime, and enforcing causal propagation of the EFT modes, the power spectrum cannot increase drastically. This imposes significant constraints on the parameter space of models aiming to produce such features.</description>

      <title>Sub-GeV dark matter and nano-Hertz gravitational waves from a classically conformal dark sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong first-order phase transitions in a dark sector offer a compelling explanation for the stochastic gravitational wave background in the nano-Hertz range recently detected by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). We explore the possibility that such a phase transition at the same time gives mass to a stable fermion that accounts for the observed dark matter abundance and leads to testable effects in laboratory experiments. Concretely, we consider a classically conformal dark sector with a hidden $U(1)^\prime$ gauge symmetry that couples to the Standard Model via kinetic mixing. Since the PTA signal requires a phase transition in the MeV temperature range, spontaneous symmetry breaking gives rise to a sub-GeV dark matter candidate that couples to the Standard Model via a dark photon mediator and obtains its relic abundance via annihilations into electrons and dark Higgs bosons. Such a scenario is tightly constrained by laboratory searches for dark photons and cosmological constraints on the decays of dark Higgs bosons after the phase transition. We show that viable parameter regions can be found both for the case that the dark Higgs bosons remain in equilibrium with the Standard Model and that they decouple and only decay much later. In the latter case, the parameter regions preferred by the PTA signal and the dark matter relic abundance can be fully explored by future beam-dump experiments searching for missing energy.</description>

      <title>XMAGNET: Velocity structure functions of AGN-driven turbulence in the multiphase intracluster medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Significant theoretical and observational efforts are underway to investigate the properties of turbulence in the hot plasma that pervades galaxy clusters. Spectroscopy has been used to study the projected line-of-sight velocities in both the hot intracluster medium and the cold gas phase using optical and X-ray telescopes. In this paper, we characterize the velocity structure functions of the multiphase intracluster medium in a simulated galaxy cluster core and study the effects of projections on the hot and cold phase of the gas. To do so, we use the fiducial run of the XMAGNET suite, a collection of exascale magneto-hydrodynamical simulations of a cool-core cluster, to compute velocity structure functions. The simulation includes radiative cooling as well as a model for active galactic nuclei feedback. Examining three-dimensional and line-of-sight velocity structure functions, we find no clear correlation between the behavior of the hot ($10^6\, \mathrm{K}\, \leq T \leq 10^8 \, \mathrm{K}$) and cold ($T\leq 10^5$ K) phases VSFs. Assuming a power law model for the VSF, we find that the power law index $m$ of the cold phase varies significantly throughout the 4 Gyr simulation time. We compare our VSFs with observations using mock optical and X-ray images, and conclude that projection effects significantly impact the amplitude and power law index of both the hot and cold phases. In the cold phase, applying a Gaussian smoothing filter to model effects of atmospheric seeing increases significantly the power law index of the projected VSF at scales below the filter's kernel size. Moreover, the VSF amplitude and power law index vary significantly depending on the viewing orientation. We conclude that observational biases such as projection effects, atmospheric seeing and the viewing angle cannot be ignored when interpreting line-of-sight velocity structure of the intracluster medium.</description>

      <title>Axion Portal to Scalar Dark Matter: Unveiling Stabilizing Symmetry Footprints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of an axion-like particle (ALP) as a portal between the dark and visible sectors. Unlike conventional studies, which typically assume fermionic dark matter (DM), we explore the phenomenological implications of scalar DM within this ALP portal framework. A key challenge arises from the fact that the interaction between the ALP spacetime derivative and the spin-one current of the scalar DM can be a redundant operator, which may be removed via a field redefinition. However, this interaction reveals a profound connection to the underlying global symmetry that stabilizes the DM particle. We choose a non-Abelian discrete symmetry, ensuring the persistence of the DM-ALP interactions, and in doing so, unveil a rich phenomenology. Working within a general effective field theory approach, we identify the following hallmark features of our scenario: (i) a relic density determined by semi-annihilations, with an abundance independent of ALP couplings to the visible sector; (ii) direct detection rates naturally suppressed; (iii) indirect detection spectra enriched relative to pure annihilation scenarios, with rates also independent of ALP couplings to visible particles. Lastly, we discuss potential microscopic origins for this framework and highlight the broader implications of our results.</description>

      <title>Rates of Strongly Lensed Tidal Disruption Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the coming years, surveys such as the Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) are expected to increase the number of observed Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) substantially. We employ Monte Carlo integration to calculate the unlensed and lensed TDE rate as a function of limiting magnitude in $u$, $g$, $r$, and $i$-bands. We investigate the impact of multiple luminosity models, black hole mass functions (BHMFs), and flare temperatures on the TDE rate. Notably, this includes a semi-analytical model, which enables the determination of the TDE temperature in terms of black hole (BH) mass. We predict the highest unlensed TDE rate to be in $g$-band. It ranges from $16$ to $5,440\;\mathrm{yr}^{-1}\;(20,000\;\mathrm{deg}^2)^{-1}$ for the Zwicky Transient Facility, being more consistent with the observed rate at the low end. For LSST, we expect a rate in $g$-band between $3,580$ and $82,060\;\mathrm{yr}^{-1}\;(20,000\;\mathrm{deg}^2)^{-1}$. A higher theoretical prediction is understandable, as we do not consider observational effects such as completeness. The unlensed and lensed TDE rates are insensitive to the redshift evolution of the BHMF, even for LSST limiting magnitudes. The best band for detecting lensed TDEs is also $g$-band. Its predicted rates range from $0.43$ to $15\;\mathrm{yr}^{-1}\;(20,000\;\mathrm{deg}^2)^{-1}$ for LSST. The scatter of predicted rates reduces when we consider the fraction of lensed TDEs; that is, a few in ten thousand TDEs will be lensed. Despite the large scatter in the rates of lensed TDEs, our comprehensive considerations of multiple models suggest that lensed TDEs will occur in the $10$-year LSST lifetime, providing an exciting prospect for detecting such events. We expect the median redshift of a lensed TDE to be between $1.5$ and $2$. In this paper, we additionally report on lensed TDE properties, such as the BH mass and time delays.</description>

      <title>The Massive and Distant Clusters of $WISE$ Survey. XII. Exploring X-ray AGN in Dynamically Active Massive Galaxy Clusters at z~1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the cluster X-ray morphology and active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity in nine $z\sim1$ galaxy clusters from the Massive and Distant Clusters of $WISE$ Survey (MaDCoWS) observed with $Chandra$. Using photon asymmetry ($A_{\text{phot}}$) to quantify X-ray morphologies, we find evidence that the four most dynamically disturbed clusters are likely to be mergers. Employing a luminosity cut of $7.6\times10^{42}$ erg/s to identify AGN in the 0.7-7.0 keV, we show that the majority of these clusters host excess AGN compared to the local field. We use the cumulative number-count ($\log N-\log S$) model to predict AGN incidence in cluster isophotes under this luminosity cut. Our analysis finds evidence (at $&gt; 2\sigma$) of a positive correlation between AGN surface densities and photon asymmetry, suggesting that a disturbed cluster environment plays a pivotal role in regulating AGN triggering. Studying AGN incidence in cluster X-ray isophotes equivalent in area to $1.0r_{500}$, we find that the AGN space density inversely scales with cluster mass as $\sim M^{-0.5^{+0.18}_{-0.18}}$ at the 3.18$\sigma$ level. Finally, when we separately explore the cluster mass dependence of excess AGN surface density in disturbed and relaxed clusters, we see tentative evidence that the two morphologically distinct sub-populations exhibit diverging trends, especially near the outskirts, likely due to cluster merger-driven AGN triggering/suppression.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Active Learning for optimised spectroscopic follow-up: Enhancing early SN Ia classification with the Fink broker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current and future surveys rely on machine learning classification to obtain large and complete samples of transients. Many of these algorithms are restricted by training samples that contain a limited number of spectroscopically confirmed events. Here, we present the first real-time application of Active Learning to optimise spectroscopic follow-up with the goal of improving training sets of early type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) classifiers. Using a photometric classifier for early SN Ia, we apply an Active Learning strategy for follow-up optimisation using the real-time FINK broker processing of the ZTF public stream. We perform follow-up observations at the ANU 2.3m telescope in Australia and obtain 92 spectroscopic classified events that are incorporated in our training set. We show that our follow-up strategy yields a training set that, with 25% less spectra, improves classification metrics when compared to publicly reported spectra. Our strategy selects in average fainter events and, not only supernovae types, but also microlensing events and flaring stars which are usually not incorporated on training sets. Our results confirm the effectiveness of active learning strategies to construct optimal training samples for astronomical classifiers. With the Rubin Observatory LSST soon online, we propose improvements to obtain earlier candidates and optimise follow-up. This work paves the way to the deployment of real-time AL follow-up strategies in the era of large surveys.</description>

      <title>Non-interacting holographic dark energy with Torsion via Hubble Radius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We reconstruct a holographic dark energy model with a scalar torsion $\phi$ under the assumption of no interaction between dark energy and dark matter. We show that the accelerating expansion can occur by setting the IR cut-off to the Hubble radius as $L=H^{-1}$ with the Hubble parameter $H$. Motivated by two physical choices based on Friedmann equations and the holographic principle, tellingly, spin-induced torsion at non-zero matter density $\rho_m \neq 0$ and $H$-dependence of torsion in empty space $\rho_m =0$, we propose a time-dependent scalar torsion $\phi(t) = k H(t) ({\rho_{m}(t)}/ \rho_c^0)$ with a dimensionless constant $k$ and the current critical density $\rho_c^0$. As a result, we find minima $(\omega_X^{0})_{min}$ of the current equation of state for dark energy for various values of the free parameter $c$, yielding $-1 &lt; (\omega_X^{0})_{min} &lt; -0.778$ as $c$ changes from $1$ to $0.654$. Also, we get the values of the current dimensionless ratio, $(\phi_0/H_{0})_{min}$ corresponding to the minima $(\omega^{0}_{X})_{min}$, which is consistent with weak torsion assumption $|\phi_0| /H_{0} &lt; 1$, and thus it ensuring model viability.</description>

      <title>Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves in Modified Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves (SIGWs), second-order tensor modes sourced by first-order scalar fluctuations in General Relativity (GR), are expected to contribute to the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background (SGWB) potentially detectable by current and future gravitational wave interferometers. In the framework of GR, this SGWB represents an unavoidable contribution to the gravitational wave spectrum. In this paper, we go beyond GR and we investigate the behavior of SIGWs in f(R) gravity. We explore how the SIGW spectrum is influenced across a broad range of frequencies, from the nano-Hz regime, where the Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) operates, through the milli-Hz band probed by the space-based LISA detector, up to the kilo-Hz frequency range, where the ground-based LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA network is currently operational. Our results indicate that the beyond-GR correction leaves an observational imprint, mainly in the low-frequency part of the spectrum, giving the possibility to use SIGW to constrain GR on scales on which we have limited information.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulations of density perturbation and gravitational wave production from cosmological first-order phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conducted three-dimensional lattice simulations to study the density perturbation and generation of gravitational waves (GWs) through first-order phase transition (FOPTs). Our findings reveal that for the case of $\beta/H = 6$, density perturbations successfully collapse into PBHs. Moreover, smaller values of $\beta/H$ are more conducive to PBH formation, while the strength of the phase transition $\alpha$ has a relatively minor impact on PBH production. We find that for $\alpha &gt; 1$, the dominant contribution to the density perturbation comes from the delay of vacuum decay, whereas for $\alpha &lt; 1$, the bubble walls' moving forward behavior becomes the primary source. Additionally, the power spectrum of density perturbations generated by the phase transition exhibits a slope of $k^3$ at small wavenumbers and $k^{-1.5}$ at large wavenumbers. Furthermore, we calculated the GW power spectra, and the simulation results show a slope of $k^3$ at small wavenumbers and $k^{-2}$ at large wavenumbers. Our numerical simulations confirm that slow PTs can produce PBHs and provide predictions for the GW power spectrum, offering crucial theoretical support for GW detection.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Orbital Chaos: The Wild Heart of Fuzzy Dark Matter Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the behavior of test particles on top of a galactic-type of Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) structure, characterized by the core-halo density profile found in simulations. Our workhorse structure is an anisotropic, time-dependent, virialized core-tail FDM clump resulting from a multicore merger. For our analysis we allow this structure to keep evolving, which implies that the core oscillates and accretes matter from the halo, while the halo dynamics is dominated by its characteristic high kinetic energy. On top of this time-dependent structure that in turn has a time-dependent gravitational potential, we solve the motion equations of test particles with initial conditions associated to circular orbits at different radii. Our results indicate that: 1) no trajectory remains circular, 2) the trajectories are sensitive to initial conditions and 3) the departure of initially near trajectories has always a positive Lyapunov exponent. A qualitative result is that the motion of test particles is more erratic with a bigger Lyapunov exponent within and near the core than in the halo region, which can be understood in terms of the random motion of the core within the core-halo structure. We expect these results warn on the importance of the anisotropic and time-dependent nature of FDM clumps when studying the motion of test particles.</description>

      <title>Stability of multi-state configurations of fuzzy dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the stability properties of multi-state configurations of the Schr\"odinger-Poisson system without self-interaction, with monopolar and first dipolar components $(1,0,0)$+$(2,1,0)$. We show these configurations studied are stable using numerical simulations, and using criteria of stationarity, unitarity and time dependence consistency. The study covers a range of states with monopolar to dipolar mass ratio between 47 and 0.17. The astrophysical implication of this result is that this type of configurations is at least stable and can be considered physically sound in multi-state ultralight bosonic dark matter.</description>

      <title>Calculating Bayesian evidence for inflationary models using CONNECT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bayesian evidence is a standard tool used for comparing the ability of different models to fit available data and is used extensively in cosmology. However, since the evidence calculation involves performing an integral of the likelihood function over the entire space of model parameters this can be prohibitively expensive in terms of both CPU and time consumption. For example, in the simplest $\Lambda$CDM model and using CMB data from the Planck satellite, the dimensionality of the model space is over 30 (typically 6 cosmological parameters and 28 nuisance parameters). Even the simplest possible model requires $\mathcal{O}(10^6)$ calls to an Einstein--Boltzmann solver such as CLASS or CAMB and takes several days.
  Here we present calculations of Bayesian evidence using the CONNECT framework to calculate cosmological observables. We demonstrate that we can achieve results comparable to those obtained using Einstein--Boltzmann solvers, but at a minute fraction of the computational cost. As a test case, we then go on to compute Bayesian evidence ratios for a selection of slow-roll inflationary models.
  In the setup presented here, the total computation time is completely dominated by the likelihood function calculation which now becomes the main bottleneck for increasing computation speed.</description>

      <title>Implications of DES 5YR SNe Dataset for $\Lambda$CDM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06389v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark Energy Survey five-year supernovae data (DES 5YR SNe) in conjunction with Planck CMB and Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) BAO data has detected a strong dynamical dark energy (DE) deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model.Here we shift the focus of DES data to the pressureless matter sector in the $\Lambda$CDM model by studying the matter density parameter $\Omega_m$. Employing primarily frequentist profile likelihoods, supported by complementary Bayesian methods, we demonstrate that $\Omega_m$ increases with effective redshift in the DES data up to a point that there is a $2.5 \sigma$ discrepancy with Planck. We relax the traditional $\Omega_m \leq 1$ prior to demonstrate negative DE densities $\Omega_m &gt; 1$ at the highest effective redshift probed. Nevertheless, the largest discrepancy with Planck occurs for profile likelihoods and posteriors peaked at $\Omega_m &lt; 1$ in the traditional $\Lambda$CDM regime. Our findings corroborate earlier observations in Pantheon and Pantheon+ datasets with an independent SNe dataset with a higher effective redshift. In an appendix, we confirm that curvature $\Omega_k$ decreases with effective redshift disfavouring a flat Universe in higher redshift DES SNe at $&gt; 3 \sigma$. Our choice of $\Omega_k$ prior leads to an underestimation of the tension with a flat Universe.</description>

      <title>Ionospheric effect on the synthetic Epoch of Reionization observations with the SKA1-Low</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The redshifted $21$\,cm signal of neutral hydrogen can be used as a direct probe of the intergalactic medium during Cosmic Dawn\,(CD) and Epoch of Reionization\,(EoR). However, detecting this inherently weak signal has numerous challenges. The major ones include accurate foreground removal from low-frequency radio observations and systematics arising from instrumental effects. The Earth's ionosphere poses a major obstacle at these low radio frequencies. Thus, a systematic study of ionospheric effects on these sensitive low-frequency observations is critical, given that the construction of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA1-Low) is in full progress. We use the end-to-end pipeline, called {\sc 21cme2e}, to study the effect of time-varying ionospheric corruption on the $21$\,cm power spectrum recovery. We use two models: a) a catalogue-based model focused on source position shift due to the refractive effect of the ionosphere and b) a realistic ionospheric condition generated using Kolmogorov's turbulence model. We assess the effect of the imperfections thus generated on the extraction of \HI\ $21$\,cm signal power spectrum. Our study shows that beyond ``median ionospheric offset" ($\theta_{\text{MIO}} \lesssim 0.1''$), the $21$\,cm signal from the EoR is unaffected by residual ionospheric effects. Our study emphasizes the need for the development of efficient ionospheric calibration algorithms for the upcoming SKA1-Low observations to extract the \HI\ $21$\,cm power spectra from the CD/EoR.</description>

      <title>Understanding acoustic scale observations: the one-sided fight against $\Lambda$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cosmic microwave background (CMB) and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) provide precise measurements of the cosmic expansion history through the comoving acoustic scale. The CMB angular scale measurement $\theta_*$ is particularly robust, constraining the ratio of the sound horizon to the angular diameter distance to last scattering independently of the late-time cosmological model. For models with standard early-universe physics, this measurement strongly constrains possible deviations from $\Lambda$CDM at late times. We show that the null energy condition imposes strict inequalities on the BAO observables $D_H(z)$, $D_M(z)$, $D_V(z)$ and $F_{\rm AP}(z)$ relative to $\Lambda$CDM predictions. These inequalities demonstrate that certain deviations from $\Lambda$CDM are impossible for any physical non-interacting dark energy model that respects the null energy condition. We also identify the regions of parameter space in the CPL parameterization $w(a) = w_0 + w_a(1-a)$ that can give predictions consistent with both the null energy condition and the observed CMB scale. While current DESI DR1 BAO measurements exhibit slight joint-constraint parameter tensions with $\Lambda$CDM, this tension only arises in directions that are inconsistent with the null-energy condition, so $\Lambda$CDM is favoured by current acoustic scale measurements unless the null-energy condition is violated.</description>

      <title>SkyReconNet: A Cross-Resolution Contextual Integration Framework for Inpainting with Application to Enhanced CMB Map Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel neural network, SkyReconNet, which combines the expanded receptive fields of dilated convolutional layers along with standard convolutions, to capture both the global and local features for reconstructing the missing information in an image. We implement our network to inpaint the masked regions in a full-sky Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) map. Inpainting CMB maps is a particularly formidable challenge when dealing with extensive and irregular masks, such as galactic masks which can obscure substantial fractions of the sky. The hybrid design of SkyReconNet leverages the strengths of standard and dilated convolutions to accurately predict CMB fluctuations in the masked regions, by effectively utilizing the information from surrounding unmasked areas. During training, the network optimizes its weights by minimizing a composite loss function that combines the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and mean squared error (MSE). SSIM preserves the essential structural features of the CMB, ensuring an accurate and coherent reconstruction of the missing CMB fluctuations, while MSE minimizes the pixel-wise deviations, enhancing the overall accuracy of the predictions. The predicted CMB maps and their corresponding angular power spectra align closely with the targets, achieving the performance limited only by the fundamental uncertainty of cosmic variance. The network's generic architecture enables application to other physics-based challenges involving data with missing or defective pixels, systematic artefacts etc. Our results demonstrate its effectiveness in addressing the challenges posed by large irregular masks, offering a significant inpainting tool not only for CMB analyses but also for image-based experiments across disciplines where such data imperfections are prevalent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gravitational effects of a primordial black hole (PBH) passing through the human body are examined, with the goal of determining the minimum mass necessary to produce significant injury or death. Two effects are examined: the damage caused by a shock wave propagating outward from the black hole trajectory, and the dissociation of brain cells from tidal forces produced by the black hole on its passage through the human body. It is found that the former is the dominant effect, with a cutoff mass for serious injury or death of approximately $M_{PBH} &gt; 1.4 \times 10^{17} {\rm g}$. The number density of primordial black holes with a mass above this cutoff is far too small to produce any observable effects on the human population.</description>

      <title>Revisiting van Citter Zernike correlations in the presence of primordial gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00474v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we present a detailed construction of quantum field theory of interaction between a generic GW background and a spherical electromagnetic (EM) field. This scenario is applicable to the EM emission from furthest stars. After identification of the evolution of the EM field, we show that the background of primordial gravitational waves (PGWs) predicted by the inflationary scenario induces a decrease in the spatial coherence of the EM field propagating over cosmological distances, leading the van Citter-Zernike correlations to become unobservable, an effect called as blurring. Since spatial correlation is observed in VLBI measurements of distant quasars, it imposes a constraint on the level of the primordial gravitational wave background. We evaluate the blurring effect caused by PGWs placed in two-mode squeezed state which is the standard quantum state predicted by the simplest scenario of inflation. As a result of the small coupling strength between GWs and EM probe, the incoherence induced by PGWs is far beyond the coherence length in VLBI measurements, which finally renders the detection of PGWs based on interferometric setups. The main idea of the present study is to promote the use of high-precision VLBI measurement of angular size-redshift of distant sources, as a new possible way of constraining the underlying primordial background, in parallel to other surveys such as the cosmic microwave background. In particular, the present schema can pave the way to search for the effect of scalar curvature perturbations in the VLBI $\theta-z$ measurements.</description>

      <title>FIMP Dark Matter in bulk viscous non-standard cosmologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05590v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the extension of the classical non-standard cosmological model in which dissipative processes are considered through a bulk viscous term in the new field $\phi$, which interacts with the radiation component during the early universe. Specifically, we consider an interaction term of the form $\Gamma_{\phi} \rho_{\phi}$, where $\Gamma_{\phi}$ represents the decay rate of the field and $\rho_{\phi}$ denotes its energy density and a bulk viscosity described by $\xi=\xi_{0}\rho_{\phi}^{1/2}$, within the framework of Eckart's theory. This extended non-standard cosmology is employed to explore the parameter space for the production of Feebly Interacting Massive Particles (FIMPs) as Dark Matter candidates, assuming a constant thermal averaged Dark Matter production cross-section ($\langle\sigma v\rangle$), as well as a preliminary analysis of the non-constant case. In particular, for certain combinations of the model and Dark Matter parameters, namely ($T_\text{end}$,$\kappa$) and $(m_\chi,\langle\sigma v\rangle)$, where $T_\text{end}$ corresponds to the temperature at which $\phi$ decays, $\kappa$ is the ratio between the initial energy density of $\phi$ and radiation, and $m_\chi$ is the Dark Matter mass, we identify extensive new parameter regions where Dark Matter can be successfully established while reproducing the currently observed relic density, in contrast to the predictions of $\Lambda$CDM and classical non-standard cosmological scenarios.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal gravity in a proper tetrad frame: traversable wormholes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18007v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the revised Deser-Woodard model of nonlocal gravity involving four auxiliary scalar fields, introduced to explain the standard cosmological background expansion history without fine-tuning issues. In particular, we simplify the complex field equations within a proper tetrad frame, thereby recasting the original system into a more tractable equivalent differential problem. We show that, by initially postulating the form of the $g_{tt}$ metric component, it is possible to reconstruct the distortion function of the gravitational model. We then describe a step-by-step procedure for solving the vacuum field equations in the case of a static and spherically symmetric spacetime. We apply our technique to find new traversable wormholes supported purely by gravity by employing either analytical, perturbative, or numerical methods. Finally, we discuss the main geometric properties of the obtained solutions. Our results present a feasible avenue for identifying novel compact objects while enhancing the comprehension of nonlocal gravitational theories.</description>

Abstract: Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are found at the centre of every massive galaxy, with their masses tightly connected to their host galaxies through a co-evolution over cosmic time. For massive ellipticals, the SMBH mass ($M_\text{BH}$) strongly correlates with the central stellar velocity dispersion ($\sigma_e$), via the $M_\text{BH}-\sigma_e$ relation. However, SMBH mass measurements have traditionally relied on central stellar dynamics in nearby galaxies ($z &lt; 0.1$), limiting our ability to explore the SMBHs across cosmic time. In this work, we present a self-consistent analysis combining 2D stellar dynamics and lens modelling of the Cosmic Horseshoe gravitational lens system ($z = 0.44$), one of the most massive galaxies ever observed. Using integral-field spectroscopic data from MUSE and high-resolution imaging from HST, we model the radial arc and stellar kinematics, constraining the galaxy's central mass distribution and SMBH mass. Bayesian model comparison yields a $5\sigma$ detection of an ultramassive black hole (UMBH) with $\log_{10}(M_\text{BH}/M_{\odot}) = 10.56^{+0.07}_{-0.08} \pm (0.12)^\text{sys}$, consistent across various systematic tests. Our findings place the Cosmic Horseshoe $\sim$$1.5\sigma$ above the $M_\text{BH}-\sigma_e$ relation, supporting an emerging trend observed in BGCs and other massive galaxies. This suggests a steeper $M_\text{BH}-\sigma_e$ relationship at the highest masses, potentially driven by a different co-evolution of SMBHs and their host galaxies. Future surveys will uncover more radial arcs, enabling the detection of SMBHs over a broader redshift and mass range. These discoveries will further refine our understanding of the $M_\text{BH}-\sigma_e$ relation and its evolution across cosmic time.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the influence of an early matter-dominated era in cosmic history on the dynamics of cosmic strings and the resulting stochastic gravitational waves. Specifically, we examine the case where this era originates from the dark matter dilution mechanism within the framework of the minimal left-right symmetric model. By numerically solving the Boltzmann equations governing the energy densities of the relevant components, we meticulously analyze the modifications to the cosmological scale factor, the number density of cosmic string loops, and the gravitational wave spectrum. Our results reveal that the early matter-dominated era causes a characteristic suppression in the high-frequency regime of the gravitational wave spectrum, providing distinct and testable signatures for future ground-based interferometer experiments.</description>
