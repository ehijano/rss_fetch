      <title>Overview of the TREC 2021 deep learning track</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the third year of the TREC Deep Learning track. As in previous years, we leverage the MS MARCO datasets that made hundreds of thousands of human annotated training labels available for both passage and document ranking tasks. In addition, this year we refreshed both the document and the passage collections which also led to a nearly four times increase in the document collection size and nearly $16$ times increase in the size of the passage collection. Deep neural ranking models that employ large scale pretraininig continued to outperform traditional retrieval methods this year. We also found that single stage retrieval can achieve good performance on both tasks although they still do not perform at par with multistage retrieval pipelines. Finally, the increase in the collection size and the general data refresh raised some questions about completeness of NIST judgments and the quality of the training labels that were mapped to the new collections from the old ones which we discuss in this report.</description>

      <title>Towards Efficient Quantity Retrieval from Text:An Approach via Description Parsing and Weak Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08322v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantitative facts are continually generated by companies and governments, supporting data-driven decision-making. While common facts are structured, many long-tail quantitative facts remain buried in unstructured documents, making them difficult to access. We propose the task of Quantity Retrieval: given a description of a quantitative fact, the system returns the relevant value and supporting evidence. Understanding quantity semantics in context is essential for this task. We introduce a framework based on description parsing that converts text into structured (description, quantity) pairs for effective retrieval. To improve learning, we construct a large paraphrase dataset using weak supervision based on quantity co-occurrence. We evaluate our approach on a large corpus of financial annual reports and a newly annotated quantity description dataset. Our method significantly improves top-1 retrieval accuracy from 30.98 percent to 64.66 percent.</description>

      <title>DS@GT at LongEval: Evaluating Temporal Performance in Web Search Systems and Topics with Two-Stage Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information Retrieval (IR) models are often trained on static datasets, making them vulnerable to performance degradation as web content evolves. The DS@GT competition team participated in the Longitudinal Evaluation of Model Performance (LongEval) lab at CLEF 2025, which evaluates IR systems across temporally distributed web snapshots. Our analysis of the Qwant web dataset includes exploratory data analysis with topic modeling over time. The two-phase retrieval system employs sparse keyword searches, utilizing query expansion and document reranking. Our best system achieves an average NDCG@10 of 0.296 across the entire training and test dataset, with an overall best score of 0.395 on 2023-05.

      <title>CUE-RAG: Towards Accurate and Cost-Efficient Graph-Based RAG via Multi-Partite Graph and Query-Driven Iterative Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of Large Language Models (LLMs), their performance in question answering (QA) remains limited by the lack of domain-specific and up-to-date knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this limitation by incorporating external information, often from graph-structured data. However, existing graph-based RAG methods suffer from poor graph quality due to incomplete extraction and insufficient utilization of query information during retrieval. To overcome these limitations, we propose CUE-RAG, a novel approach that introduces (1) a multi-partite graph index incorporates text Chunks, knowledge Units, and Entities to capture semantic content at multiple levels of granularity, (2) a hybrid extraction strategy that reduces LLM token usage while still producing accurate and disambiguated knowledge units, and (3) Q-Iter, a query-driven iterative retrieval strategy that enhances relevance through semantic search and constrained graph traversal. Experiments on three QA benchmarks show that CUE-RAG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 99.33% higher Accuracy and 113.51% higher F1 score while reducing indexing costs by 72.58%. Remarkably, CUE-RAG matches or outperforms baselines even without using an LLM for indexing. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of CUE-RAG in advancing graph-based RAG systems.</description>

      <title>Improving Korean-English Cross-Lingual Retrieval: A Data-Centric Study of Language Composition and Model Merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing utilization of multilingual text information, Cross-Lingual Information Retrieval (CLIR) has become a crucial research area. However, the impact of training data composition on both CLIR and Mono-Lingual Information Retrieval (IR) performance remains under-explored. To systematically investigate this data-centric aspect, we construct linguistically parallel Korean-English datasets and train retrieval models with various language combinations. Our experiments reveal that the language composition of training data significantly influences IR performance, exhibiting important inter-lingual correlations: CLIR performance improves with specific language pairs, while Mono-Lingual IR performance declines. Our work demonstrates that Model Merging can effectively mitigate this trade-off, achieving strong CLIR results while preserving Mono-Lingual IR capabilities. Our findings underscore the effects of linguistic configuration of training data on both CLIR and Mono-Lingual IR, and present Model Merging as a viable strategy to optimize performance across these tasks.</description>

      <title>Digital gazetteers: review and prospects for place name knowledge bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gazetteers typically store data on place names, place types and the associated coordinates. They play an essential role in disambiguating place names in online geographical information retrieval systems for navigation and mapping, detecting and disambiguating place names in text, and providing coordinates. Currently there are many gazetteers in use derived from many sources, with no commonly accepted standard for encoding the data. Most gazetteers are also very limited in the extent to which they represent the multiple facets of the named places yet they have potential to assist user search for locations with specific physical, commercial, social or cultural characteristics. With a view to understanding digital gazetteer technologies and advancing their future effectiveness for information retrieval, we provide a review of data sources, components, software and data management technologies, data quality and volunteered data, and methods for matching sources that refer to the same real-world places. We highlight the need for future work on richer representation of named places, the temporal evolution of place identity and location, and the development of more effective methods for data integration.</description>

      <title>UniConv: Unifying Retrieval and Response Generation for Large Language Models in Conversations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of conversational search systems revolutionizes how information is accessed by enabling the multi-turn interaction between the user and the system. Existing conversational search systems are usually built with two different models. This separation restricts the system from leveraging the intrinsic knowledge of the models simultaneously, which cannot ensure the effectiveness of retrieval benefiting the generation. The existing studies for developing unified models cannot fully address the aspects of understanding conversational context, managing retrieval independently, and generating responses. In this paper, we explore how to unify dense retrieval and response generation for large language models in conversation. We conduct joint fine-tuning with different objectives and design two mechanisms to reduce the inconsistency risks while mitigating data discrepancy. The evaluations on five conversational search datasets demonstrate that our unified model can mutually improve both tasks and outperform the existing baselines.</description>

      <title>A Versatile Dataset of Mouse and Eye Movements on Search Engine Results Pages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We contribute a comprehensive dataset to study user attention and purchasing behavior on Search Engine Result Pages (SERPs). Previous work has relied on mouse movements as a low-cost large-scale behavioral proxy but also has relied on self-reported ground-truth labels, collected at post-task, which can be inaccurate and prone to biases. To address this limitation, we use an eye tracker to construct an objective ground-truth of continuous visual attention. Our dataset comprises 2,776 transactional queries on Google SERPs, collected from 47 participants, and includes: (1) HTML source files, with CSS and images; (2) rendered SERP screenshots; (3) eye movement data; (4) mouse movement data; (5) bounding boxes of direct display and organic advertisements; and (6) scripts for further preprocessing the data. In this paper we provide an overview of the dataset and baseline experiments (classification tasks) that can inspire researchers about the different possibilities for future work.</description>

      <title>GRASP: Generic Reasoning And SPARQL Generation across Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new approach for generating SPARQL queries on RDF knowledge graphs from natural language questions or keyword queries, using a large language model. Our approach does not require fine-tuning. Instead, it uses the language model to explore the knowledge graph by strategically executing SPARQL queries and searching for relevant IRIs and literals. We evaluate our approach on a variety of benchmarks (for knowledge graphs of different kinds and sizes) and language models (of different scales and types, commercial as well as open-source) and compare it with existing approaches. On Wikidata we reach state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, despite the zero-shot setting. On Freebase we come close to the best few-shot methods. On other, less commonly evaluated knowledge graphs and benchmarks our approach also performs well overall. We conduct several additional studies, like comparing different ways of searching the graphs, incorporating a feedback mechanism, or making use of few-shot examples.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning and Mixup for Fine-Grained Few-Shot Fungi Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate identification of fungi species presents a unique challenge in computer vision due to fine-grained inter-species variation and high intra-species variation. This paper presents our approach for the FungiCLEF 2025 competition, which focuses on few-shot fine-grained visual categorization (FGVC) using the FungiTastic Few-Shot dataset. Our team (DS@GT) experimented with multiple vision transformer models, data augmentation, weighted sampling, and incorporating textual information. We also explored generative AI models for zero-shot classification using structured prompting but found them to significantly underperform relative to vision-based models. Our final model outperformed both competition baselines and highlighted the effectiveness of domain specific pretraining and balanced sampling strategies. Our approach ranked 35/74 on the private test set in post-completion evaluation, this suggests additional work can be done on metadata selection and domain-adapted multi-modal learning.

      <title>Distillation versus Contrastive Learning: How to Train Your Rerankers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training text rerankers is crucial for information retrieval. Two primary strategies are widely used: contrastive learning (optimizing directly on ground-truth labels) and knowledge distillation (transferring knowledge from a larger reranker). While both have been studied in the literature, a clear comparison of their effectiveness for training cross-encoder rerankers under practical conditions is needed.
  This paper empirically compares these strategies by training rerankers of different sizes and architectures using both methods on the same data, with a strong contrastive learning model acting as the distillation teacher. Our results show that knowledge distillation generally yields better in-domain and out-of-domain ranking performance than contrastive learning when distilling from a larger teacher model. This finding is consistent across student model sizes and architectures. However, distilling from a teacher of the same capacity does not provide the same advantage, particularly for out-of-domain tasks. These findings offer practical guidance for choosing a training strategy based on available teacher models. Therefore, we recommend using knowledge distillation to train smaller rerankers if a larger, more powerful teacher is accessible; in its absence, contrastive learning provides a strong and more reliable alternative otherwise.</description>

      <title>Drowning in Documents: Consequences of Scaling Reranker Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rerankers, typically cross-encoders, are computationally intensive but are frequently used because they are widely assumed to outperform cheaper initial IR systems. We challenge this assumption by measuring reranker performance for full retrieval, not just re-scoring first-stage retrieval. To provide a more robust evaluation, we prioritize strong first-stage retrieval using modern dense embeddings and test rerankers on a variety of carefully chosen, challenging tasks, including internally curated datasets to avoid contamination, and out-of-domain ones. Our empirical results reveal a surprising trend: the best existing rerankers provide initial improvements when scoring progressively more documents, but their effectiveness gradually declines and can even degrade quality beyond a certain limit. We hope that our findings will spur future research to improve reranking.</description>

      <title>Generative Retrieval and Alignment Model: A New Paradigm for E-commerce Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional sparse and dense retrieval methods struggle to leverage general world knowledge and often fail to capture the nuanced features of queries and products. With the advent of large language models (LLMs), industrial search systems have started to employ LLMs to generate identifiers for product retrieval. Commonly used identifiers include (1) static/semantic IDs and (2) product term sets. The first approach requires creating a product ID system from scratch, missing out on the world knowledge embedded within LLMs. While the second approach leverages this general knowledge, the significant difference in word distribution between queries and products means that product-based identifiers often do not align well with user search queries, leading to missed product recalls. Furthermore, when queries contain numerous attributes, these algorithms generate a large number of identifiers, making it difficult to assess their quality, which results in low overall recall efficiency.
  To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel e-commerce retrieval paradigm: the Generative Retrieval and Alignment Model (GRAM). GRAM employs joint training on text information from both queries and products to generate shared text identifier codes, effectively bridging the gap between queries and products. This approach not only enhances the connection between queries and products but also improves inference efficiency. The model uses a co-alignment strategy to generate codes optimized for maximizing retrieval efficiency. Additionally, it introduces a query-product scoring mechanism to compare product values across different codes, further boosting retrieval efficiency. Extensive offline and online A/B testing demonstrates that GRAM significantly outperforms traditional models and the latest generative retrieval models, confirming its effectiveness and practicality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10381v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collaborative filtering generates recommendations by exploiting user-item similarities based on rating data, which often contains numerous unrated items. This paper proposes a nonnegative/binary matrix factorization (NBMF) algorithm modified for collaborative filtering and demonstrates that utilizing a low-latency Ising machine in NBMF is advantageous in terms of computation time. While previous studies have primarily applied NBMF to dense data, such as images, this study applies a modified NBMF to sparse data. Results show the benefits of using a low-latency Ising machine to implement the proposed method.</description>

      <title>REGEN: A Dataset and Benchmarks with Natural Language Critiques and Narratives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel dataset REGEN (Reviews Enhanced with GEnerative Narratives), designed to benchmark the conversational capabilities of recommender Large Language Models (LLMs), addressing the limitations of existing datasets that primarily focus on sequential item prediction. REGEN extends the Amazon Product Reviews dataset by inpainting two key natural language features: (1) user critiques, representing user "steering" queries that lead to the selection of a subsequent item, and (2) narratives, rich textual outputs associated with each recommended item taking into account prior context. The narratives include product endorsements, purchase explanations, and summaries of user preferences.
  Further, we establish an end-to-end modeling benchmark for the task of conversational recommendation, where models are trained to generate both recommendations and corresponding narratives conditioned on user history (items and critiques). For this joint task, we introduce a modeling framework LUMEN (LLM-based Unified Multi-task Model with Critiques, Recommendations, and Narratives) which uses an LLM as a backbone for critiquing, retrieval and generation. We also evaluate the dataset's quality using standard auto-rating techniques and benchmark it by training both traditional and LLM-based recommender models. Our results demonstrate that incorporating critiques enhances recommendation quality by enabling the recommender to learn language understanding and integrate it with recommendation signals. Furthermore, LLMs trained on our dataset effectively generate both recommendations and contextual narratives, achieving performance comparable to state-of-the-art recommenders and language models.</description>
