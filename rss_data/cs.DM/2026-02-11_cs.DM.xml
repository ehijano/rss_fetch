      <title>On the complexity of Sandwich Problems for $M$-partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a structural classification of constraint satisfaction problems (CSP) described by reflexive complete $2$-edge-coloured graphs. In particular, this classification extends the structural dichotomy for graph homomorphism problems known as the Hell--Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il theorem (1990). Our classification is also efficient: we can check in polynomial time whether the CSP of a reflexive complete $2$-edge-coloured graph is in P or NP-complete, whereas for arbitrary $2$-edge-coloured graphs, this task is NP-complete. We then apply our main result in the context of matrix partition problems and sandwich problems. Firstly, we obtain one of the few algorithmic solutions to general classes of matrix partition problems. And secondly, we present a P vs. NP-complete classification of sandwich problems for matrix partitions.</description>

      <title>On Euler Paths and the Maximum Degree Growth of Iterated Higher Order Line Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a simple graph $G$, its line graph, denoted by $L(G)$, is obtained by representing each edge of $G$ as a vertex, with two vertices in $L(G)$ adjacent whenever the corresponding edges in $G$ share a common endpoint. By applying the line graph operation repeatedly, we obtain higher order line graphs, denoted by $L^{r}(G)$. In other words, $L^{0}(G) = G$, and for any integer $r \ge 1$, $L^{r}(G) = L(L^{r-1}(G))$.
  Given a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices, we wish to efficiently find out (i) if $L^k(G)$ has an Euler path, (ii) the value of $\Delta(L^k(G))$. Note that the size of a higher order line graph could be much larger than that of $G$.
  For the first question, we show that for a graph $G$ with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges the largest $k$ where $L^k(G)$ has an Euler path satisfies $k = \mathcal O(nm)$. We also design an $\mathcal{O}(n^2m)$-time algorithm to output all $k$ such that $L^k(G)$ has an Euler path.
  For the second question, we study the growth of maximum degree of $L^k(G)$, $k \ge 0$. It is easy to calculate $\Delta(L^k(G))$ when $G$ is a path, cycle or a claw. Any other connected graph is called a prolific graph and we denote the set of all prolific graphs by $\mathcal G$. We extend the works of Hartke and Higgins to show that for any prolific graph $G$, there exists a constant rational number $dgc(G)$ and an integer $k_0$ such that for all $k \ge k_0$, $\Delta(L^k(G)) = dgc(G) \cdot 2^{k-4} + 2$. We show that $\{dgc(G) \mid G \in \mathcal G\}$ has first, second, third, fourth and fifth minimums, namely, $c_1 = 3$, $c_2 = 4$, $c_3 = 5.5$, $c_4 = 6$ and $c_5=7$; the third minimum stands out surprisingly from the other four. Moreover, for $i \in \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$, we provide a complete characterization of $\mathcal G_i = \{dgc(G) = c_i \mid G \in \mathcal G \}$. Apart from this, we show that the set $\{dgc(G) \mid G \in \mathcal G, 7 &lt; dgc(G) &lt; 8\}$ is countably infinite.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Large Clique Number in Tournaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aboulker, Aubian, Charbit, and Lopes (2023) defined the clique number of a tournament to be the minimum clique number of one of its backedge graphs. Here we show that if $T$ is a tournament of sufficiently large clique number, then $T$ contains a subtournament of large clique number from one of two simple families of tournaments. In particular, large clique number is always certified by a bounded-size set. This answers a question of Aboulker, Aubian, Charbit, and Lopes (2023), and gives new insight into a line of research initiated by Kim and Kim (2018) into unavoidable subtournaments in tournaments with large dichromatic number.</description>

      <title>Non-Additive Discrepancy: Coverage Functions in a Beck-Fiala Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent concurrent work by Dupr\'{e} la Tour and Fujii and by Hollender, Manurangsi, Meka, and Suksompong [ITCS'26] introduced a generalization of classical discrepancy theory to non-additive functions, motivated by applications in fair division. As many classical techniques from discrepancy theory seem to fail in this setting, including linear algebraic methods like the Beck-Fiala Theorem [Discrete Appl. Math '81], it remains widely open whether comparable non-additive bounds can be achieved.
  Towards a better understanding of non-additive discrepancy, we study coverage functions in a sparse setting comparable to the classical Beck-Fiala Theorem. Our setting generalizes the additive Beck-Fiala setting, rank functions of partition matroids, and edge coverage in graphs. More precisely, assuming each of the $n$ items covers only $t$ elements across all functions, we prove a constructive discrepancy bound that is polynomial in $t$, the number of colors $k$, and $\log n$.</description>

      <title>Efficient Online Random Sampling via Randomness Recycling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18879v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article studies the fundamental problem of using i.i.d. coin tosses from an entropy source to efficiently generate random variables $X_i \sim P_i$ $(i \ge 1)$, where $(P_1, P_2, \dots)$ is a random sequence of rational discrete probability distributions subject to an \textit{arbitrary} stochastic process. Our method achieves an amortized expected entropy cost within $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ bits of the information-theoretically optimal Shannon lower bound using $O(\log(1/\varepsilon))$ space. This result holds both pointwise in terms of the Shannon information content conditioned on $X_i$ and $P_i$, and in expectation to obtain a rate of $\mathbb{E}[H(P_1) + \dots + H(P_n)]/n + \varepsilon$ bits per sample as $n \to \infty$ (where $H$ is the Shannon entropy). The combination of space, time, and entropy properties of our method improves upon the Knuth and Yao (1976) entropy-optimal algorithm and Han and Hoshi (1997) interval algorithm for online sampling, which require unbounded space. It also uses exponentially less space than the more specialized methods of Kozen and Soloviev (2022) and Shao and Wang (2025) that generate i.i.d. samples from a fixed distribution. Our online sampling algorithm rests on a powerful algorithmic technique called \textit{randomness recycling}, which reuses a fraction of the random information consumed by a probabilistic algorithm to reduce its amortized entropy cost.
  On the practical side, we develop randomness recycling techniques to accelerate a variety of prominent sampling algorithms. We show that randomness recycling enables state-of-the-art runtime performance on the Fisher-Yates shuffle when using a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator, and that it reduces the entropy cost of discrete Gaussian sampling. Accompanying the manuscript is a performant software library in the C programming language.</description>
