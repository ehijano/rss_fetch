      <title>Weak decaying collective-excitation approximation for Yukawa one-component plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the theoretical model of weak decaying collective excitations characteristic of many-particle systems with long-range interaction potentials is developed using the example of one-component strongly coupled Yukawa plasmas. The proposed model is based on the self-consistent relaxation theory of collective dynamics and covers spatial scales from extended hydrodynamics to scales related to the mean interparticle distance. The theoretical model reproduces the dynamic structure factor spectra and the corresponding dispersion characteristics in agreement with molecular dynamics simulation data without using any fitting parameters. In the limit of small wave numbers, the correspondence of the proposed theoretical model with the damped harmonic oscillator model is established. The simple analytical expression for the sound attenuation coefficient of strongly coupled Yukawa plasmas is obtained.</description>

      <title>Bayesian optimisation of poloidal field coil positions in tokamaks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17189v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The tokamak is a world-leading concept for producing sustainable energy via magnetically-confined nuclear fusion. Identifying where to position the magnets within a tokamak, specifically the poloidal field (PF) coils, is a design problem which requires balancing a number of competing economic, physical, and engineering objectives and constraints. In this paper, we show that multi-objective Bayesian optimisation (BO), an iterative optimisation technique utilising probabilistic machine learning models, can effectively explore this complex design space and return several optimal PF coil sets. These solutions span the Pareto front, a subset of the objective space that optimally satisfies the specified objective functions. We outline an easy-to-use BO framework and demonstrate that it outperforms alternative optimisation techniques while using significantly fewer computational resources. Our results show that BO is a promising technique for fusion design problems that rely on computationally demanding high-fidelity simulations.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Velocity-Space Signature of Ion Cyclotron Damping Using Liouville Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ion cyclotron damping is a key mechanism for the dissipation of electromagnetic wave energy in weakly collisional plasmas. This study presents a combined approach using Liouville mapping and the field-particle correlation technique to investigate qualitatively and quantitatively the velocity-space signature of ion cyclotron damping. Liouville mapping offers a computationally efficient way to predict perturbations to the particle velocity distribution function using single-particle trajectories in prescribed electromagnetic fields. One may apply the field-particle correlation technique to these perturbed velocity distributions to reveal the unique velocity-space signatures of the secular energy transfer rate associated with specific wave-particle interactions. We validate this method by reproducing known Landau damping signatures for kinetic Alfv\'en waves, and then we apply this method to ion cyclotron waves where ion cyclotron damping dominates. The resulting velocity-space signature reveals distinct energization features of ion cyclotron damping : (i) a quadrupolar pattern in the perpendicular $(v_x, v_y)$ plane; and (ii) a localized energization near the $n = 1$ resonant velocity in gyrotropic $(v_\parallel, v_\perp)$ velocity-space. The quantitative patterns remain unchanged as the ion plasma beta $\beta_i$ is varied, ultimately showing minimal $v_\perp$ dependence on $\beta_i$ of the velocity-space signature at the $n = 1$ resonant velocity. This work provides a systematic study of how the ion cyclotron damping signature varies with $\beta_i$, offering a practical foundation to identify ion cyclotron damping using kinetic simulation data or spacecraft data.</description>

      <title>100s TeV/m-Level Particle Accelerators Driven by High-density Electron Beams in Micro Structured Carbon Nanotube Forest Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solid-state materials, such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs), have the potential to support ultra-high accelerating fields in the TV/m range for charged particle acceleration. In this study, we explore the feasibility of using nanostructured CNTs forest to develop plasma-based accelerators at the 100 TeV/m-level, driven by high-density, ultra-relativistic electron beams, using fully three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. Two different acceleration mechanisms are proposed and investigated: the surface plasmon leakage field and the bubble wakefield. The leakage field, driven by a relatively low-density beam, can achieve an acceleration field up to TV/m, capable of accelerating both electron and positron beams. In particular, due to the direct acceleration by the driver beam, the positron acceleration is highly efficient with an average acceleration gradient of 2.3 TeV/m. In contrast, the bubble wakefield mechanism allows significantly higher acceleration fields, e.g. beyond 400 TV/m, with a much higher energy transfer efficiency of $66.7\%$. In principle, electrons can be accelerated to PeV energies over distances of several meters. If the beam density is sufficiently high, the CNT target will be completely blown out, where no accelerating field is generated. Its threshold has been estimated. Two major challenges in these schemes are recognised and investigated. Leveraging the ultra-high energy and charge pumping rate of the driver beam, the nanostructured CNTs also offer significant potential for a wide range of advanced applications. This work represents a promising avenue for the development of ultra-compact, high-energy particle accelerators. We also outline conceptual experiments using currently available facilities, demonstrating that this approach is experimentally accessible.</description>
