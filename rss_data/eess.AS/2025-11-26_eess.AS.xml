      <title>BERT-APC: A Reference-free Framework for Automatic Pitch Correction via Musical Context Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic Pitch Correction (APC) enhances vocal recordings by aligning pitch deviations with the intended musical notes. However, existing APC systems either rely on reference pitches, which limits their practical applicability, or employ simple pitch estimation algorithms that often fail to preserve expressiveness and naturalness. We propose BERT-APC, a novel reference-free APC framework that corrects pitch errors while maintaining the natural expressiveness of vocal performances. In BERT-APC, a novel stationary pitch predictor first estimates the perceived pitch of each note from the detuned singing voice. A context-aware note pitch predictor estimates the intended pitch sequence by leveraging a music language model repurposed to incorporate musical context. Finally, a note-level correction algorithm fixes pitch errors while preserving intentional pitch deviations for emotional expression. In addition, we introduce a learnable data augmentation strategy that improves the robustness of the music language model by simulating realistic detuning patterns. Compared to two recent singing voice transcription models, BERT-APC demonstrated superior performance in note pitch prediction, outperforming the second-best model, ROSVOT, by 10.49%p on highly detuned samples in terms of the raw pitch accuracy. In the MOS test, BERT-APC achieved the highest score of $4.32 \pm 0.15$, which is significantly higher than those of the widely-used commercial APC tools, AutoTune ($3.22 \pm 0.18$) and Melodyne ($3.08 \pm 0.18$), while maintaining a comparable ability to preserve expressive nuances. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first APC model that leverages a music language model to achieve reference-free pitch correction with symbolic musical context. The corrected audio samples of BERT-APC are available online.</description>

      <title>It Hears, It Sees too: Multi-Modal LLM for Depression Detection By Integrating Visual Understanding into Audio Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Depression is one of the most prevalent mental health disorders globally. In recent years, multi-modal data, such as speech, video, and transcripts, has been increasingly used to develop AI-assisted depression assessment systems. Large language models have further advanced this field due to their strong language understanding and generalization capabilities. However, conventional LLMs remain text-centric and cannot process the rich non-verbal cues found in audio and visual modalities, which are critical components in mental health evaluation. While multi-modal LLMs offer a promising direction, few are tailored for psychological applications. In this study, we propose a novel multi-modal LLM framework for depression detection. Our approach augments an audio language model with visual understanding and aligns audio-visual features at the timestamp level. This fine-grained alignment improves modeling of temporal dynamics across modalities while reducing the need for extensive training data and computational resources. Experiments on the DAIC-WoZ dataset demonstrate that our model outperforms both single-modality approaches and previous multi-modal methods. Moreover, the proposed framework can be extended to incorporate additional physiological signals, paving the way for broader clinical applications beyond mental health.</description>

      <title>Mispronunciation Detection and Diagnosis Without Model Training: A Retrieval-Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mispronunciation Detection and Diagnosis (MDD) is crucial for language learning and speech therapy. Unlike conventional methods that require scoring models or training phoneme-level models, we propose a novel training-free framework that leverages retrieval techniques with a pretrained Automatic Speech Recognition model. Our method avoids phoneme-specific modeling or additional task-specific training, while still achieving accurate detection and diagnosis of pronunciation errors. Experiments on the L2-ARCTIC dataset show that our method achieves a superior F1 score of 69.60% while avoiding the complexity of model training.</description>

      <title>Lessons Learned from Developing a Privacy-Preserving Multimodal Wearable for Local Voice-and-Vision Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11811v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many promising applications of multimodal wearables require continuous sensing and heavy computation, yet users reject such devices due to privacy concerns. This paper shares our experiences building an ear-mounted voice-and-vision wearable that performs local AI inference using a paired smartphone as a trusted personal edge. We describe the hardware-software co-design of this privacy-preserving system, including challenges in integrating a camera, microphone, and speaker within a 30-gram form factor, enabling wake word-triggered capture, and running quantized vision-language and large-language models entirely offline. Through iterative prototyping, we identify key design hurdles in power budgeting, connectivity, latency, and social acceptability. Our initial evaluation shows that fully local multimodal inference is feasible on commodity mobile hardware with interactive latency. We conclude with design lessons for researchers developing embedded AI systems that balance privacy, responsiveness, and usability in everyday settings.</description>

      <title>PrismAudio: Decomposed Chain-of-Thoughts and Multi-dimensional Rewards for Video-to-Audio Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18833v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Video-to-Audio (V2A) generation requires balancing four critical perceptual dimensions: semantic consistency, audio-visual temporal synchrony, aesthetic quality, and spatial accuracy; yet existing methods suffer from objective entanglement that conflates competing goals in single loss functions and lack human preference alignment. We introduce PrismAudio, the first framework to integrate Reinforcement Learning into V2A generation with specialized Chain-of-Thought (CoT) planning. Our approach decomposes monolithic reasoning into four specialized CoT modules (Semantic, Temporal, Aesthetic, and Spatial CoT), each paired with targeted reward functions. This CoT-reward correspondence enables multidimensional RL optimization that guides the model to jointly generate better reasoning across all perspectives, solving the objective entanglement problem while preserving interpretability. To make this optimization computationally practical, we propose Fast-GRPO, which employs hybrid ODE-SDE sampling that dramatically reduces the training overhead compared to existing GRPO implementations. We also introduce AudioCanvas, a rigorous benchmark that is more distributionally balanced and covers more realistically diverse and challenging scenarios than existing datasets, with 300 single-event classes and 501 multi-event samples. Experimental results demonstrate that PrismAudio achieves state-of-the-art performance across all four perceptual dimensions on both the in-domain VGGSound test set and out-of-domain AudioCanvas benchmark.
