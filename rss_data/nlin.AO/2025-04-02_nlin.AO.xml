      <title>Importance of near- and far-field coupling for the synchronization of organ pipes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The synchronization of coupled organ pipes represents a nonlinear phenomenon with significant implications for both musical acoustics and nonlinear dynamics. This study investigates the coupling mechanisms governing synchronization, employing a theoretical framework based on delay-coupled Van der Pol oscillators. The oscillatory behavior of individual organ pipes is modeled as a self-sustained system driven by an air jet interacting with the pipe resonator. By incorporating experimental data and numerical simulations, we analyze the impact of finite separation between coupled pipes, introducing time-delayed interactions in the coupling function. Our findings reveal that synchronization can enhance pitch stability but may also induce sound attenuation due to destructive interference, particularly in prospect pipes. A key focus of this study is the decomposition of the coupling mechanism into near-field and far-field components, each contributing differently to the overall synchronization dynamics. Through bifurcation analysis and Arnold tongue characterization, we demonstrate how distance-dependent interactions influence the stability and frequency locking of coupled oscillators. The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is employed to extract spectral features from numerical data, ensuring precise comparison with experiments. Our results show strong qualitative agreement between modeled and observed synchronization effects, highlighting the importance of nonlinear coupling in organ pipe acoustics. This investigation advances the understanding of mutual interactions in coupled acoustic oscillators and provides a refined theoretical basis for predicting synchronization phenomena in complex aerodynamically driven systems.</description>

      <title>Reputation in public goods cooperation under double Q-learning protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and resolving cooperation dilemmas are key challenges in evolutionary game theory, which have revealed several mechanisms to address them. This paper investigates the comprehensive influence of multiple reputation-related components on public cooperation. In particular, cooperative investments in public goods game are not fixed but simultaneously depend on the reputation of group organizers and the population's cooperation willingness, hence indirectly impacting on the players' income. Additionally, individual payoff can also be directly affected by their reputation via a weighted approach which effectively evaluates the actual income of players. Unlike conventional models, the reputation change of players is non-monotonic, but may transform abruptly due to specific actions. Importantly, a theoretically supported double Q-learning algorithm is introduced to avoid overestimation bias inherent from the classical Q-learning algorithm. Our simulations reveal a significantly improved cooperation level, that is explained by a detailed Q-value analysis. We also observe the lack of massive cooperative clusters in the absence of network reciprocity. At the same time, as an intriguing phenomenon, some actors maintain moderate reputation and are continuously flipping between cooperation and defection. The robustness of our results are validated by mean-field approximation.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary theory of convective organization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The conceptual landscape of convection has two simple gateways: optimal function and random form. Optimal convection adjusts toward a univariate ideal called neutrality. Convection form involves elements (parcels, bubbles, drafts) whose most parsimonious assumption is random. Between these gates lies a wilderness of realizable flow configurations. The only simple principle is natural selection by fitness, a scalar whose gradient is a local direction in an abstract configuration space. Random or high-entropy patterns occupy most of configuration space and occur spontaneously. With time, convection can discover less facile but more efficient (organized) configurations, by sequential selection. Here two data exercises explore that self-organization process, in shallow and deep moist convection. For shallow convection, causal network postulates are explored in a large set of cyclic-domain large-eddy simulations (LES; the Cloud Botany set). When an evolutionary pathway (mainly layer deepening in these simulations) leads to precipitation, mesoscale patterns blossom rapidly. For deep convection, expanding rings of conditional cell probability around prior cells are estimated from satellite imagery over South America and the South Pacific. In a Monte Carlo model iterating such a conditional probability kernel, hundreds of hourly cells take days to discover a self-sustaining squall configuration the kernel affords. Larger-scale implications include overshoots (redefinition of neutrality) and tens-of-hours timescales to both adjustment and noise (indeterminacy). If functional organization can be inferred from horizontal patterns, the abundance of horizontal texture information in satellite cloud imagery could find quantitative value.</description>
