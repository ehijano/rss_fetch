      <title>Space-time correlations in the 1D Directed Stochastic Sandpile model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sandpile models are known to resist exact results. In this direction, space-time correlations between avalanches have proven to be especially difficult to access. One of the main obstacle to do so comes from taking memory effects in a systematic way along the computation. In this paper, we partially fill this gap and derive recursive relations for the particle filling and avalanche 2-points correlation function in the 1D Directed Stochastic Sandpile. These expressions allow to characterize the sign of the correlations and estimates are provided in the particle filling case. In fact, density correlations are shown to be positively correlated. This behavior is directly related to persistence of the local particle filling. On the other hand, we show that avalanches are anticorrelated in the model. This is interpreted by the fact that avalanches disrupt the system and the damage can only be fully compensated after injecting a sufficiently high number of particles. These results indicate an underlying trade off, between static and dynamic observable, for the system to sit in its stationary state. It appears that this balance is controlled by the conservation of the particle number along the avalanches.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Nonequilibrium Latent Cycles in Unsupervised Generative Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that nonequilibrium dynamics can play a constructive role in unsupervised machine learning by inducing the spontaneous emergence of latent-state cycles. We introduce a model in which visible and hidden variables interact through two independently parametrized transition matrices, defining a Markov chain whose steady state is intrinsically out of equilibrium. Likelihood maximization drives this system toward nonequilibrium steady states with finite entropy production, reduced self-transition probabilities, and persistent probability currents in the latent space. These cycles are not imposed by the architecture but arise from training, and models that develop them avoid the low-log-likelihood regime associated with nearly reversible dynamics while more faithfully reproducing the empirical distribution of data classes. Compared with equilibrium approaches such as restricted Boltzmann machines, our model breaks the detailed balance between the forward and backward conditional transitions and relies on a log-likelihood gradient that depends explicitly on the last two steps of the Markov chain. Hence, this exploration of the interface between nonequilibrium statistical physics and modern machine learning suggests that introducing irreversibility into latent-variable models can enhance generative performance.</description>

      <title>A review on combinatorial approach to aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a combinatorial approach to discrete, finite, and irreversibly aggregating systems has been progressively developed. In this work, we review its achievements up to the present moment, focusing on the practical aspects and discussing its limitations. First, we present the assumptions and combinatorial foundations of the approach, which are based on direct counting of the system states, in contrast to the previous approaches of Smoluchowski and Marcus--Lushnikov. A method to obtain combinatorial expressions for the average number of clusters of a given size and the corresponding standard deviation is described by solving the simplest example of a constant kernel. Then, we extend consideration to a number of kernels (e.g., additive, product, linear--chain, condensation), which were recently solved by explicitly finding the number of internal states of the cluster of a given size. Next, we show that theoretical predictions for any given kernel may be obtained with no need to find an explicit solution but using a recursive expression. We exploit this opportunity to present the use of combinatorial expressions to solve kernels related to the real processes of aerosol growth and planetesimal formation. At this point, a comparison to numerical results appears. Other potential application fields are indicated, including dust agglomeration and polymer growth. Finally, issues related to the varying precision of the theoretical predictions are summarized. In the last section, we propose open problems.</description>

      <title>Exact fluctuation relation for open systems beyond the Zwanzig FEP equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a fluctuation framework to quantify the free energy difference between two equilibrium states connected by nonequilibrium processes under arbitrary dynamics and system-environment coupling. For an open system described by the Hamiltonian of mean force (HMF), we show that the equilibrium free energy difference between two canonical endpoints can be written as exponential averages of the HMF shift, divided by an explicit factor built from the chi-squared divergence between the initial and final system marginals. These relations hold at the endpoint level and, under an asymptotic equilibration postulate, admit trajectory representations for general driving and coupling protocols. A decomposition of the HMF increment along each trajectory separates the work-like contributions associated with changes in $\lambda(t)$ and $C(t)$, the heat-like exchange with the environment, and a feedback-like functional defined with respect to the initial protocol. In the frozen-driving regime with a noninteracting reference, the equalities reduce to new FEP-like expressions involving an environment functional and an explicit overlap correction, with the Zwanzig formula recovered as a limiting case. We validate the approach on an open system coupled to an environment and evolved under overdamped Langevin dynamics, where conventional Zwanzig FEP suffers from poor phase-space overlap and slow numerical convergence, while the present trajectory equality closely matches the exact free energy difference over a broad range of coupling strengths.</description>

      <title>A Single-granule Stirling Heat Engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-particle heat engines at atomic and colloidal scales obey the universal thermodynamic bounds on work and efficiency. Here, we translate these principles to the macroscale by building an athermal Stirling engine whose working medium is a millimeter-sized, vibrofluidized granule confined in a time-dependent magnetic trap. By embedding a rattler within the granule to inject noise, we engineer overdamped, Brownian-like dynamics in an otherwise inertial particle. This design enables independent control over the granule's effective temperature and spatial confinement. Our engine quantitatively reproduces the universal power-efficiency trade-offs of finite-time thermodynamics, achieving the Curzon-Ahlborn efficiency at maximum power. Strikingly, we uncover a control parameter-dependent damping that leads to an unexpected dissipation mechanism - the losses in the compression stroke rival or even exceed those during expansion. Our work establishes an accessible experimental platform to study small-system thermodynamics in intrinsically athermal systems.</description>

      <title>Crystalline Spectral Form Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate crystalline-like behavior of the spectral form factor (SFF) in unitary quantum systems with extremely strong eigenvalue repulsion. Using a low-temperature Coulomb gas as a model of repulsive eigenvalues, we derive the Debye-Waller factor suppressing periodic oscillations of the SFF and estimate the order of its singularities at multiples of the Heisenberg time. We also reproduce this crystalline-like behavior using perturbed permutation circuits and random matrix ensembles associated with Lax matrices. Our results lay a foundation for future studies of quantum systems that exhibit intermediate level statistics between standard random matrix ensembles and permutation circuits.</description>

      <title>Universal and non-universal facets of quantum critical phenomena unveiled along the Schmidt decomposition theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of the spin magnitude $S$ on the quantum Gr\"uneisen parameter $\Gamma^{0\text{K}}_q$ right at critical points (CPs) for the 1D Ising model under a transverse magnetic field. Our findings are fourfold: $\textit{i)}$ for higher $S$, $\Gamma^{0\text{K}}_q$ is increased, but remains finite, reflecting the enhancement of the Hilbert space dimensionality; $\textit{ii)}$ the Schmidt decomposition theorem recovers the extensivity of the nonadditive $q$-entropy $S_q$ only for a $\textit{special}$ value of the entropic index $q$; $\textit{iii)}$ the universality class in the frame of $S_q$ depends only on the symmetry of the system; $\textit{iv)}$ we propose an experimental setup to explore finite size effects in connection with the Hilbert space occupation at CPs. Our findings unveil both universal and non-universal aspects of quantum criticality in terms of $\Gamma^{0\text{K}}_q$ and $S_q$.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-protected topological scar subspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a framework that extends the notion of symmetry-protected topological properties beyond the ground-state paradigm to dynamically isolated subspaces formed by exceptional non-thermal energy eigenstates of non-integrable systems, known as quantum many-body scars (QMBS). We introduce the concept of a symmetry-protected topological (SPT) scar subspace -- a Hilbert subspace stabilized by a restricted spectrum-generating algebra (rSGA) while being protected by on-site, inversion, and time-reversal symmetries. QMBS often admit a non-interacting quasiparticle description, which enables matrix-product representations with small bond dimension. Although individual QMBS do not necessarily retain the protecting symmetries of the Hamiltonian, we show that the subspace formed by the symmetry-connected QMBS does retain them, giving rise to consistently emerging topological properties across the entire scar subspace. Using the spin-$1$ Affleck--Kennedy--Lieb--Tasaki (AKLT) model, we demonstrate that its bimagnon scar subspace reflects the topological properties of the SPT ground state, as evidenced by the appropriate bond-space symmetry representations, the expected topological response, and the numerically verified long-range string order. Our findings indicate that scar subspaces can inherit -- and in inhomogeneous cases systematically modify -- the topological character of the SPT ground state, offering a new and experimentally accessible platform for probing symmetry-protected topology beyond the ground-state regime.</description>

      <title>Heat capacity of dense liquids: A link between two-phase model and melting temperature scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalized Rosenfeld-Tarazona scaling predicts the power-law dependence of the excess heat capacity of simple liquids on temperature. The two-phase model treats a liquid as a superposition of gas- and solid-like components whose relative abundance is quantified by a liquid rigidity parameter. We demonstrate here that the generalized Rosenfeld-Tarazona scaling emerges naturally in the two-phase model from the scale invariance of the liquid rigidity parameter.</description>

      <title>$S = 1$ pyrochlore magnets with competing anisotropies: A tale of two Coulomb phases, $Z_2$ flux confinement and $XY$-like transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that the low-temperature physics of $S=1$ pyrochlore magnets with a predominantly Ising-like easy-axis exchange coupling $J$ that favors the local tetrahedral body diagonals, and a comparably large easy-plane single-ion anisotropy $\Delta =J + \mu$ ($|\mu| \ll J$) that favors the plane perpendicular to these local axes will exhibit interesting new phenomena due to the competition between $J$ and $\Delta$. In the $T/J \rightarrow 0$ limit, we find three low temperature phases as a function of $\mu/T$: a short-range correlated paramagnetic phase, and two topologically-distinct Coulomb liquids separated by a $Z_2$ flux confinement transition. Both Coulomb liquids are described at long-wavelengths by a fluctuating divergence-free polarization field and have characteristic pinch-point singularities in their structure factor. In one Coulomb phase, the flux of this polarization field is confined to {\em even} integers, while it takes on all integer values in the other Coulomb phase. Experimental realizations with $|\mu| \ll J$ and negative are predicted to exhibit signatures of a transition from a flux-deconfined Coulomb phase to the flux-confined Coulomb phase as they are cooled below $T_{c_2} \approx 1.57|\mu|$, while realizations with positive $\mu \ll J$ will show signatures of a transition from a flux-deconfined Coulomb liquid to a short-range correlated paramagnet via a continuous $XY$-like transition at $T_{c_1} \approx 0.98 \mu$.</description>

      <title>Basis dependence of Neural Quantum States for the Transverse Field Ising Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural Quantum States (NQS) are powerful tools used to represent complex quantum many-body states in an increasingly wide range of applications. However, despite their popularity, at present only a rudimentary understanding of their limitations exists. In this work, we investigate the dependence of NQS on the choice of the computational basis, focusing on restricted Boltzmann machines. Considering a family of rotated Hamiltonians corresponding to the paradigmatic transverse-field Ising model, we discuss the properties of ground states responsible for the dependence of NQS performance, namely the presence of ground state degeneracies as well as the uniformity of amplitudes and phases, carefully examining their interplay. We identify that the basis-dependence of the performance is linked to the convergence properties of a cluster or cumulant expansion of multi-spin operators -- providing a framework to directly connect physical, basis-dependent properties, to performance itself. Our results provide insights that may be used to gauge the applicability of NQS to new problems and to identify the optimal basis for numerical computations.</description>

      <title>Current fluctuations for the boundary-driven zero-range process on graphs: microscopic versus macroscopic approach and a theory of non-reversible resistor-like networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the joint large deviation rate functional in the limit of large time for the current flowing through the edges of a finite graph on which a boundary-driven system of stochastic particles evolves with zero-range dynamics.This generalizes one-dimensional results previously obtained with different approaches; our alternative techniques illuminate various connections and complementary perspectives. In particular, we here use a variational approach to derive the rate functional by contraction from a level 2.5 large deviation rate functional. We perform an exact minimization and finally obtain the rate functional as a variational problem involving a superposition of cost functions for each edge. The contributions from different edges are not independent since they are related by the values of a potential function on the nodes of the graph. The rate functional on the graph is a microscopic version of the continuous rate functional predicted by the macroscopic fluctuation theory, and we indeed show a convergence in the scaling limit. If we split the graph into two connected regions by a cutset and are interested just in the current flowing through the cutset, we find that the result is the same as that of an effective system composed of only one effective edge (as happens at macroscopic level and is expected also for other models). The characteristics of this effective edge are related to the ``capacities'' of the graph and can be obtained by a reduction using elementary transformations as in electrical networks; specifically, we treat components in parallel, in series, and in $N$-star configurations (reduced to effective complete $N$-graphs). Our reduction procedure is directly related to the reduction to the trace process and, since the dynamics is in general not reversible, it is also closely connected to the theory of non-reversible electrical networks.</description>

      <title>Analytical results for the distribution of first return times of non-backtracking random walks on configuration model networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present analytical results for the distribution of first return (FR) times of non-backtracking random walks (NBWs) on undirected configuration model networks consisting of $N$ nodes with degree distribution $P(k)$. We focus on the case in which the network consists of a single connected component. Starting from a random initial node $i$ at time $t=0$, an NBW hops into a random neighbor of $i$ at time $t=1$ and at each subsequent step it continues to hop into a random neighbor of its current node, excluding the previous node. We calculate the tail distribution $P ( T_{\rm FR} &gt; t )$ of first return times from a random initial node to itself. It is found that $P ( T_{\rm FR} &gt; t )$ is given by a discrete Laplace transform of the degree distribution $P(k)$. This result exemplifies the relation between structural properties of a network, captured by the degree distribution, and properties of dynamical processes taking place on the network. Using the tail-sum formula, we calculate the mean first return time ${\mathbb E}[ T_{\rm FR} ]$. Surprisingly, ${\mathbb E}[ T_{\rm FR} ]$ coincides with the result obtained from Kac's lemma that applies to simple random walks (RWs). We also calculate the variance ${\rm Var}(T_{\rm FR})$, which accounts for the variability of first return times between different NBW trajectories. We apply this formalism to Erd{\H o}s-R\'enyi networks, random regular graphs and configuration model networks with exponential and power-law degree distributions and obtain closed-form expressions for $P( T_{\rm FR} &gt; t )$ as well as its mean and variance. These results provide useful insight on the advantages of NBWs over simple RWs in network exploration, sampling and search processes.</description>

Abstract: There exists an entire family of universal PDFs of the magnetization mode of the three dimensional Ising model parameterized by $\zeta = \lim_{L,\xi_{\infty}}L/\xi_{\infty}$ which is the ratio of the system size $L$ to the bulk correlation length $\xi_{\infty}$ with both the thermodynamic limit and the critical limit being taken simultaneously at fixed $\zeta$. Recently, the probability distribution functions (PDFs) of the magnetization mode of the three-dimensional Ising model has been computed at one-loop in the $\epsilon=4-d$ expansion [arXiv preprint arXiv:2407.12603 (2024)]. We show how these PDFs or, equivalently, the rate functions which are their logarithm, can be systematically computed at second order of the perturbative expansion. We compute the whole family of universal rate-functions and show that their agreement with the Monte Carlo data improves significantly at this order when compared to their one-loop counterpart.</description>

Abstract: Time crystals are many-body systems whose ground state spontaneously breaks time-translation symmetry and thus exhibits long-range spatiotemporal order and robust periodic motion. Using hydrodynamics, we have recently shown how an $m$th-order external packing field coupled to density fluctuations in driven diffusive fluids can induce the spontaneous emergence of time-crystalline order in the form of $m$ rotating condensates, which can be further controlled and modulated. Here we analyze this phenomenon at the microscopic level in a paradigmatic model of particle diffusion under exclusion interactions, a generalization of the weakly asymmetric simple exclusion process with a configuration-dependent field called the time-crystal lattice gas. Using extensive Monte Carlo simulations, we characterize the nonequilibrium phase transition to these complex time-crystal phases for different values of $m$, including the order parameter, the susceptibility and the Binder cumulant, from which we measure the critical exponents, which turn out to be within the Kuramoto universality class for oscillator synchronization. We also elucidate the condensates density profiles and velocities, confirming along the way a scaling property predicted for the higher-order condensate shapes in terms of first-order ones, discussing also novel possibilities for this promising route to time crystals.</description>

      <title>Universal scaling in one-dimensional non-reciprocal matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unveiling universal non-equilibrium scaling laws has been a central theme in modern statistical physics, with recent attention increasingly directed toward non-equilibrium phases that exhibit rich dynamical phenomena. A striking example arises in non-reciprocal systems, where asymmetric interactions between components lead to inherently dynamic phases and unconventional criticality near a critical exceptional point (CEP), where the criticality arises from the coalescence of collective modes with an existing Nambu-Goldstone mode. However, the universal scaling behavior that emerges in this system with full consideration of many-body effects and stochastic noise remains largely elusive. Here, we establish a dynamical scaling law in a generic one-dimensional (1D) stochastic non-reciprocal $O(2)$-symmetric system. Through large-scale simulations, we uncover a new non-equilibrium scaling in the vicinity of the CEP, distinct from any previously known equilibrium or non-equilibrium universality classes. We report an anomalously large roughening exponent $\alpha_{\rm CEP}=1.35(5)$, which is to be compared with those of simple diffusion $\alpha_{\rm EW}=0.5$. In regimes where the system breaks into domains with opposite chirality and spatiotemporal vortices inevitably emerge, we find that fluctuations are strongly suppressed, leading to a logarithmic scaling as a function of system size $L$ that manifests a short-range correlation. This work elucidates the beyond-mean-field dynamics of non-reciprocal matter, thereby shedding light on the exploration of criticality in non-reciprocal phase transition across diverse physical contexts, from active matter and driven quantum systems to biological pattern formation and non-Hermitian physics.</description>

      <title>A theory of quasiballistic spin transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15756v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recent work [Mierzejewski et al., Phys. Rev. B 107, 045134 (2023)] observed "quasiballistic spin transport" - long-lived and transiently ballistic modes of the magnetization density - in numerical simulations of infinite-temperature XXZ chains with power-law exchange interactions. We develop an analytical theory of such quasiballistic spin transport. Previous work found that this effect was maximized along a specific locus in the space of model parameters, which interpolated smoothly between the integrable Haldane-Shastry and XX models and whose shape was estimated from numerics. We obtain an analytical estimate for the lifetime of the spin current and show that it has a unique maximum along a different locus, which interpolates more gradually between the two integrable points. We further rule out the existence of a conserved two-body operator that protects ballistic spin transport away from these integrable points by proving that a corresponding functional equation has no solutions. We discuss connections between our approach and an integrability-transport conjecture for spin.</description>

Abstract: In this work I revisit the notion of gauge invariance in thermal transport and show, in the simplest and most general possibile terms, why heat conductivity is unaffected by the specific choice of energy density. I provide the minimal and general conditions under which any two energy densities, though differing locally, lead to the same heat conductivity within the Green-Kubo framework. The relevance of gauge invariance in heat-transport simulations performed with machine-trained neural-network potentials is also briefly highlighted.</description>

      <title>Exact nonlinear dynamics of single band metallic systems with dissipation: From optical to dc currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The theory of open quantum systems is one of the most essential tools for the development of quantum technologies. A particular area of interest is in the optical response of solid state systems, where dissipation is introduced phenomenologically through the relaxation time approximation and its effects are usually gauged perturbatively. Analytical exact results for driven systems under this approximation are scarce and tipically pertain only to the stationary regime. Here, we obtain the analytical solution for the current response of general single-band tight-binding system driven by a uniform electric field with generic time-dependence under the relaxation time approximation. We explore the effects of dissipation in two limiting cases: A monochromatic field, where we analytically deduce the effect of dissipation on High Harmonic Generation, and a constant electric field, where a generalization for the Esaki-Tsu equation is presented for any single-band tight-binding system. We specify the results for a simple 2D nearest neighbours tight-binding lattice to emphasize the effect of the scale competition introduced by the two different neighbours in both the monochromatic and constant field cases. Finally, we compare our exact result for the constant field to the one obtained from the usual perturbation theory calculation to probe the validity of the latter.</description>

      <title>Exact fluctuation relation for open systems beyond the Jarzynski equality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive exact fluctuation equalities for open systems that recover free energy differences between two equilibrium endpoints connected by nonequilibrium processes with arbitrary dynamics and coupling. The exponential of the free energy difference is expressed in terms of ensemble averages of the Hamiltonian of mean force (HMF) shift and the chi-squared divergence between the initial and final marginal probability distribution of the open system. A trajectory counterpart of this relation follows from an asymptotic equilibration postulate, which treats relaxation to the final stationary canonical state as a boundary condition rather than as a consequence of constraints on the driven dynamics. In the frozen-coupling regime, the HMF shift reduces to the bare-system Hamiltonian shift, yielding a clear heat-work decomposition. The Jarzynski equality (JE) is recovered under the assumption of Hamiltonian dynamics for the combined system. We validate the theory on a dissipative, phase-space-compressing drive followed by an underdamped Langevin relaxation, where the assumptions underlying the JE break down, whereas our equality reproduces the exact free energy differences.</description>

      <title>Statistical Field Theory of Interacting Nambu Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a statistical field theory for classical Nambu dynamics by employing partially the method of quantum field theory. One of unsolved problems in Nambu dynamics has been to extend it to interacting systems without violating a generalized canonical structure associated with the presence of multiple Hamiltonians, which together govern the dynamics of time evolution on an equal footing. In the present paper, we propose to include interactions from the standpoint of classical statistical dynamics by formulating it as a field theory on Nambu's generalized phase space in an operator formalism. We first construct a general framework for such a field theory and its probabilistic interpretation. Then, on the basis of this new framework, we give a simple model of self-interaction in a many-body Nambu system treated as a closed dynamical system satisfying the H-theorem. It is shown that a generalized micro-canonical ensemble and a generalized canonical ensemble characterized by many temperatures are reached dynamically as equilibrium states, starting with certain classes of initial non-equilibrium states via continuous Markov processes. Compared with the usual classical statistical mechanics on the basis of standard Hamiltonian dynamics, some important new features associated with Nambu dynamics will emerge, with respect to the symmetries underlying dynamics of the non-equilibrium as well as the equilibrium states and also to some conceptual properties, such as a formulation of a generalized KMS-like condition characterizing the generalized canonical equilibrium states and a `relative' nature of the temperatures.</description>

Abstract: The elastic response of mechanical, chemical, and biological systems is often modeled using a discrete arrangement of Hookean springs, either representing finite material elements or even the molecular bonds of a system. However, to date, there is no direct derivation of the relation between a general discrete spring network\blu{, with arbitrary geometry,} and it's corresponding elastic continuum. Furthermore, understanding the network's mechanical response requires simulations that may be expensive computationally. Here we report a method to derive the exact elastic continuum model of any discrete network of springs, requiring network geometry and topology only. We identify and calculate the so-called "non-affine" displacements. Explicit comparison of our calculations to simulations of different crystalline and disordered configurations, shows we successfully capture the mechanics even of auxetic materials. Our method is valid for residually stressed systems with non-trivial geometries, and is an essential step in generalizing active stresses on such discrete systems. It is easily generalizable to other discrete models, and opens the possibility of a rational design of elastic systems.</description>

Abstract: We investigate a model of high-dimensional dynamical variables with all-to-all interactions that are random and non-reciprocal. We characterize its phase diagram and show that the model can exhibit chaotic dynamics. We show that the equations describing the system's dynamics exhibit a number of equilibria that is exponentially large in the dimensionality of the system, and these equilibria are all linearly unstable in the chaotic phase. Solving the effective equations governing the dynamics in the infinite-dimensional limit, we determine the typical properties (magnetization, overlap) of the configurations belonging to the attractor manifold. We show that these properties cannot be inferred from those of the equilibria, challenging the expectation that chaos can be understood purely in terms of the numerous unstable equilibria of the dynamical equations. We discuss the dependence of this scenario on the strength of non-reciprocity in the interactions. These results are obtained through a combination of analytical methods such as Dynamical Mean-Field Theory and the Kac-Rice formalism.</description>

      <title>Phonon-confinement theory of thermal conductivity in ultrathin silicon films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11914v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The thermal properties of solids under nanoscale confinement are currently not understood at the atomic level. Recent numerical studies have highlighted the presence of a minimum in the thermal conductivity as a function of thickness for ultrathin films at a thickness about 1-2 nm, which cannot be described by existing theories. We develop a theoretical description of thin films which predicts a new physical law for heat transfer at the nanoscale. In particular, due to the strong redistribution of phonon momentum states in reciprocal space (with a transition from a spherical Debye surface to a different homotopy group $\mathbb{Z}$ at strong confinement), the low-energy phonon density of states no longer follows Debye's law but rather a cubic law with frequency, which then crosses over to Debye's law at a crossover frequency proportional to the average speed of sound of the material and inversely proportional to the film thickness. Concomitantly, this implies that the phonon population becomes dominated by low-energy phonons as confinement increases, which then leads to a higher thermal conductivity under extreme confinement. The theory is able to reproduce the thermal conductivity minimum in recent molecular simulations data for ultrathin silicon and provides useful guidelines so as to tune the minimum position based on the mechanical properties of the material.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal interactions are prevalent in various complex systems leading to phenomena that cannot be described by traditional equilibrium statistical physics. Although non-reciprocally interacting systems composed of two populations have been closely studied, the physics of non-reciprocal systems with a general number of populations is not well explored despite the relevance to biological systems, active matter, and driven-dissipative quantum materials. In this work, we investigate the generic features of the phases and phase transitions and emerge in $O(2)$ symmetric many-body systems with multiple non-reciprocally coupled populations, applicable to microscopic models such as networks of oscillators, flocking models, and more generally systems where each agent has a phase variable. Using symmetry and topology of the possible orbits, we systematically show that a rich variety of time-dependent phases and phase transitions arise. Examples include multipopulation chiral phases that are distinct from their two-population counterparts that emerge via a phase transition characterized by critical exceptional points, as well as limit cycle saddle-node bifurcation and Hopf bifurcation. Interestingly, we find a phase transition that dynamically restores the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry occurs via a homoclinic orbit bifurcation, where the two $\mathbb{Z}_2$ broken orbits merge at the phase transition point, providing a general route to homoclinic chaos in the order parameter dynamics for $N\geq4$ populations. Our framework provides general principles for understanding non-equilibrium heterogeneous systems and guides experimental exploration into such systems.</description>

      <title>Diffusion as a Signature of Chaos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18617v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While classical chaos is defined via a system's sensitive dependence on its initial conditions (SDIC), this notion does not directly extend to quantum systems. Instead, recent works have established defining both quantum and classical chaos via the sensitivity to adiabatic deformations and measuring this sensitivity using the adiabatic gauge potential (AGP). Building on this formalism, we introduce the ``observable drift" as a probe of chaos in generic, non-Hamiltonian, classical systems. We show that this probe correctly characterizes classical systems that exhibit SDIC as chaotic. Moreover, this characterization is consistent with the measure-theoretic definition of chaos via weak mixing. Thus, we show that these two notions of sensitivity (to changes in initial conditions and to adiabatic deformations) can be probed using the same quantity, and therefore, are equivalent definitions of chaos. Numerical examples are provided via the tent map, the logistic map, and the Chirikov standard map.</description>

Abstract: We give a probabilistic characterization of the set of measures that can be represented by the matrix product ansatz. By suitably enlarging the state space, we show that a probability measure can be described in terms of non negative matrices by the {\it Matrix Product Ansatz}, if and only if it can be written as a mixture of inhomogeneous product measures where the mixing law is a Markov bridge. We give a constructive procedure to identify such probabilistic features. We illustrate the result by examples and show that existing probabilistic representations of the invariant measures of non equilibrium interacting particle systems can be obtained from the matrix product ansatz by this general procedure.</description>

A long-standing question remained on its capacity to tackle deep learning models capturing rich feature learning effects, thus going beyond the narrow networks or kernel methods analysed until now. We positively answer through the study of the supervised learning of a multi-layer perceptron. Importantly, (i) its width scales as the input dimension, making it more prone to feature learning than ultra wide networks, and more expressive than narrow ones or ones with fixed embedding layers; and (ii) we focus on the challenging interpolation regime where the number of trainable parameters and data are comparable, which forces the model to adapt to the task. We consider the matched teacher-student setting. Therefore, we provide the fundamental limits of learning random deep neural network targets and identify the sufficient statistics describing what is learnt by an optimally trained network as the data budget increases. A rich phenomenology emerges with various learning transitions. With enough data, optimal performance is attained through the model's "specialisation" towards the target, but it can be hard to reach for training algorithms which get attracted by sub-optimal solutions predicted by the theory. Specialisation occurs inhomogeneously across layers, propagating from shallow towards deep ones, but also across neurons in each layer. Furthermore, deeper targets are harder to learn. Despite its simplicity, the Bayes-optimal setting provides insights on how the depth, non-linearity and finite (proportional) width influence neural networks in the feature learning regime that are potentially relevant in much more general settings.</description>
