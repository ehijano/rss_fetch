      <title>Finite models for positive combinatorial and exponential algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use high girth, high chromatic number hypergraphs to show that there are finite models of the equational theory of the semiring of nonnegative integers whose equational theory has no finite axiomatisation, and show this also holds if factorial, fixed base exponentiation and operations for binomial coefficients are adjoined. We also derive the decidability of the equational logical entailment operator $\vdash$ for antecedents true on $\mathbb{N}$ by way of a form of the finite model property.
  Two appendices contain additional basic development of combinatorial operations. Amongst the observations are an eventual dominance well-ordering of combinatorial functions and consequent representation of the ordinal $\epsilon_0$ in terms of factorial functions; the equivalence of the equational logic of combinatorial algebra over the natural numbers and over the positive reals; and a candidate list of elementary axioms.</description>

      <title>On ends of degree $\omega_1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that if $ T $ is a semi-special tree that is not special, then there exists a graph $ G $, formed as an inflation of a sparse $ T $-graph, such that for any special tree $ S $, $ G $ is not a subdivision of an inflation of an sparse $ S $-graph. Furthermore $G$ has an end of uncountable degree that has no ray graph. This result provides a consistent negative answer to a problem posed by Stefan Geschke et al. in 2023. Additionally, we introduce and explore a property that generalizes Halin's grid theorem, extending it to ends of degree $ \aleph_1 $, which was originally established for ends of countable degree.</description>

      <title>The finitary partitions with $n$ non-singleton blocks of a set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A partition is finitary if all its blocks are finite. For a cardinal $\mathfrak{a}$ and a natural number $n$, let $\mathrm{fin}(\mathfrak{a})$ and $\mathscr{B}_{n}(\mathfrak{a})$ be the cardinalities of the set of finite subsets and the set of finitary partitions with exactly $n$ non-singleton blocks of a set which is of cardinality~$\mathfrak{a}$, respectively. In this paper, we prove in $\mathsf{ZF}$ (without the axiom of choice) that for all infinite cardinals $\mathfrak{a}$ and all non-zero natural numbers $n$, \[ (2^{\mathscr{B}_{n}(\mathfrak{a})})^{\aleph_0}=2^{\mathscr{B}_{n}(\mathfrak{a})} \] and \[ 2^{\mathrm{fin}(\mathfrak{a})^n}=2^{\mathscr{B}_{2^n-1}(\mathfrak{a})}. \] It is also proved consistent with $\mathsf{ZF}$ that there exists an infinite cardinal $\mathfrak{a}$ such that \[ 2^{\mathscr{B}_{1}(\mathfrak{a})}&lt;2^{\mathscr{B}_{2}(\mathfrak{a})}&lt;2^{\mathscr{B}_{3}(\mathfrak{a})}&lt;\cdots&lt;2^{\mathrm{fin}(\mathrm{fin}(\mathfrak{a}))}. \]</description>

      <title>On a conjecture of Terry and Wolf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper shows that the $\mathrm{VC}_2$-dimension of a subset of $\mathbb{F}_p^n$ known as the 'quadratic Green-Sanders example' is at least 3 and at most 501. The upper bound confirms a conjecture of Terry and Wolf, who introduced this set in their recent work concerning strengthenings of the higher-order arithmetic regularity lemma under certain model-theoretic tameness assumptions. Additionally, the paper presents a simplified proof that the (linear) Green-Sanders example, which has its roots in Ramsey theory, has $\mathrm{VC}$-dimension at most 3.</description>

      <title>A Testable and Progressive Axiom Set for 2-Dimensional Euclidean Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.11333v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper shows that the 4 axioms in the original Euclidean axiom set can be modernized as 5 axioms. The new axiom set introduces each axiom progressively, with no new concept in any of the axioms so that each axiom is testable. One of the new axiom states that Euclidean, spherical, and hyperbolic spaces are all strictly monotonic, which seems to be implied in all existing axiom sets for Euclidean geometry.
  A new implicit measure called local right ratio is introduced to replace parallel postulate, Riemann curvature tensor, or Gaussian curvature, to determine if the surface is locally flat, smooth, and curved at each point. Euclidean is shown to be the only surface to have constant right ratios.</description>

      <title>Inquisitive Neighborhood Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore an inquisitive modal logic designed to reason about neighborhood models. This logic is based on an inquisitive strict conditional operator, which quantifies over neighborhoods, and which can be applied to both statements and questions. In terms of this operator we also define two unary modalities that function respectively as a universal and existential quantifier over neighborhoods. We prove that the expressive power of this logic matches the natural notion of bisimilarity in neighborhood models. We show that certain fragments of the language are invariant under certain modifications of the set of neighborhoods, and use this to show that our conditional modality is not definable from the induced unary modalities, and that questions embedded on the right of this conditional are indispensable. We provide a sound and complete axiomatization of our logic, both in general and in restriction to some salient frame classes, and discuss the relations between our logic and other modal logics interpreted over neighborhood models.</description>

      <title>Bundles of metric structures as left ultrafunctors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We pursue the study of Ultracategories initiated by Makkai and more recently Lurie by looking at properties of Ultracategories of complete metric structures, i.e. coming from continuous model theory, instead of ultracategories of models of first order theories. Our main result is that for any continuous theory $\mathbb{T}$, there is an equivalence between the category of left ultrafunctors from a compact Hausdorff space $X$ to the category of $\mathbb{T}$-models and a notion of bundle of $\mathbb{T}$-models over $X$. The notion of bundle of $\mathbb{T}$-models is new but recovers many classical notions like Bundle of Banach spaces, or (semi)-continuous field of $\mathrm{C}^*$-algebras or Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <title>Small-dimensional normed barrelled spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that every separable Banach space has a barrelled subspace with algebraic dimension $\mathrm{non}(\mathcal M)$, which denotes the smallest cardinality of a non-meager subset of $\mathbb R$. This strengthens a theorem of Sobota. More generally, we prove that every Banach space with density character $\kappa$ contains a barrelled subspace with algebraic dimension $\mathrm{cf}[\kappa]^\omega \cdot \mathrm{non}(\mathcal M)$, and in particular it is consistent with $\mathsf{ZFC}$ that every Banach space with density character $&lt;\!\mathfrak{c}$ has a barrelled subspace with dimension $&lt;\!\mathfrak{c}$.
  We also prove that if the dual of a Banach space contains either $c_0$ or $\ell^p$ for some $p \geq 1$, then that space does not have a barrelled subspace with dimension $&lt;\!\mathrm{cov}(\mathcal N)$, which denotes the smallest cardinality of a collection of Lebesgue null sets covering $\mathbb R$. In particular, it is consistent with $\mathsf{ZFC}$ that no classical Banach spaces contain barrelled subspaces with dimension $\mathfrak{b}$. This partly answers a question of S\'anchez Ruiz and Saxon.</description>
