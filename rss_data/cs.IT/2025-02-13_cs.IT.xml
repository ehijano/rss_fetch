      <title>Age of Information Optimization with Preemption Strategies for Correlated Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine a multi-sensor system where each sensor monitors multiple dynamic information processes and transmits updates over a shared communication channel. These updates may include correlated information across the various processes. In this type of system, we analyze the impact of preemption, where ongoing transmissions are replaced by newer updates, on minimizing the Age of Information (AoI). While preemption is optimal in some scenarios, its effectiveness in multi-sensor correlated systems remains an open question. To address this, we introduce a probabilistic preemption policy, where the source sensor preemption decision is stochastic. We derive closed-form expressions for the AoI and frame its optimization as a sum of linear ratios problem, a well-known NP-hard problem. To navigate this complexity, we establish an upper bound on the iterations using a branch-and-bound algorithm by leveraging a reformulation of the problem. This analysis reveals linear scalability with the number of processes and a logarithmic dependency on the reciprocal of the error that shows the optimal solution can be efficiently found. Building on these findings, we show how different correlation matrices can lead to distinct optimal preemption strategies. Interestingly, we demonstrate that the diversity of processes within the sensors' packets, as captured by the correlation matrix, plays a more significant role in preemption priority than the number of updates.</description>

      <title>Unbiased and Error-Detecting Combinatorial Pooling Experiments with Balanced Constant-Weight Gray Codes for Consecutive Positives Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combinatorial pooling schemes have enabled the measurement of thousands of experiments in a small number of reactions. This efficiency is achieved by distributing the items to be measured across multiple reaction units called pools. However, current methods for the design of pooling schemes do not adequately address the need for balanced item distribution across pools, a property particularly important for biological applications. Here, we introduce balanced constant-weight Gray codes for detecting consecutive positives (DCP-CWGCs) for the efficient construction of combinatorial pooling schemes. Balanced DCP-CWGCs ensure uniform item distribution across pools, allow for the identification of consecutive positive items such as overlapping biological sequences, and enable error detection by keeping the number of tests on individual and consecutive positive items constant. For the efficient construction of balanced DCP-CWGCs, we have released an open-source python package codePub, with implementations of the two core algorithms: a branch-and-bound algorithm (BBA) and a recursive combination with BBA (rcBBA). Simulations using codePub show that our algorithms can construct long, balanced DCP-CWGCs that allow for error detection in tractable runtime.</description>

      <title>Energy and Age-Aware MAC for Low-Power Massive IoT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient multiple access remains a key challenge for emerging Internet of Things (IoT) networks comprising a large set of devices with sporadic activation, thus motivating significant research in the last few years. In this paper, we consider a network wherein IoT sensors capable of energy harvesting (EH) send updates to a central server to monitor the status of the environment or machinery in which they are located. We develop energy-aware ALOHA-like multiple access schemes for such a scenario using the Age of Information (AoI) metric to quantify the freshness of an information packet. The goal is to minimize the average AoI across the entire system while adhering to energy constraints imposed by the EH process. Simulation results show that applying the designed multiple access scheme improves performance from 24% up to 90% compared to previously proposed age-dependent protocols by ensuring low average AoI and achieving scalability while simultaneously complying with the energy constraints considered.</description>

      <title>On the Fundamental Limits of Integrated Sensing and Communications Under Logarithmic Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a unified information-theoretic framework for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC), applicable to both monostatic and bistatic sensing scenarios. Special attention is given to the case where the sensing receiver (Rx) is required to produce a "soft" estimate of the state sequence, with logarithmic loss serving as the performance metric. We derive lower and upper bounds on the capacity-distortion function, which delineates the fundamental tradeoff between communication rate and sensing distortion. These bounds coincide when the channel between the ISAC transmitter (Tx) and the communication Rx is degraded with respect to the channel between the ISAC Tx and the sensing Rx, or vice versa. Furthermore, we provide a complete characterization of the capacity-distortion function for an ISAC system that simultaneously transmits information over a binary-symmetric channel and senses additive Bernoulli states through another binary-symmetric channel. The Gaussian counterpart of this problem is also explored, which, together with a state-splitting trick, fully determines the capacity-distortion-power function under the squared error distortion measure.</description>

      <title>The Art of Misclassification: Too Many Classes, Not Enough Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classification is a ubiquitous and fundamental problem in artificial intelligence and machine learning, with extensive efforts dedicated to developing more powerful classifiers and larger datasets. However, the classification task is ultimately constrained by the intrinsic properties of datasets, independently of computational power or model complexity. In this work, we introduce a formal entropy-based measure of classificability, which quantifies the inherent difficulty of a classification problem by assessing the uncertainty in class assignments given feature representations. This measure captures the degree of class overlap and aligns with human intuition, serving as an upper bound on classification performance for classification problems. Our results establish a theoretical limit beyond which no classifier can improve the classification accuracy, regardless of the architecture or amount of data, in a given problem. Our approach provides a principled framework for understanding when classification is inherently fallible and fundamentally ambiguous.</description>

      <title>Take What You Need: Flexible Multi-Task Semantic Communications with Channel Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing demand for efficient semantic communication systems capable of managing diverse tasks and adapting to fluctuating channel conditions has driven the development of robust, resource-efficient frameworks. This article introduces a novel channel-adaptive and multi-task-aware semantic communication framework based on a masked auto-encoder architecture. Our framework optimizes the transmission of meaningful information by incorporating a multi-task-aware scoring mechanism that identifies and prioritizes semantically significant data across multiple concurrent tasks. A channel-aware extractor is employed to dynamically select relevant information in response to real-time channel conditions. By jointly optimizing semantic relevance and transmission efficiency, the framework ensures minimal performance degradation under resource constraints. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our framework compared to conventional methods in tasks such as image reconstruction and object detection. These results underscore the framework's adaptability to heterogeneous channel environments and its scalability for multi-task applications, positioning it as a promising solution for next-generation semantic communication networks.</description>

      <title>Abstract questionnaires and FS-decision digraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A questionnaire is a sequence of multiple choice questions aiming to collect data on a population. We define an abstract questionnaire as an ordered pair $(N,{\cal M})$, where $N$ is a positive integer and ${\cal M}=(m_0,m_1,\ldots,m_{N-1})$ is an $N$-tuple of positive integers, with $m_i$, for $i \in \{0, 1, \ldots, N-1 \}$, as the number of possible answers to question $i$. An abstract questionnaire may be endowed with a skip-list (which tells us which questions to skip based on the sequence of answers to the earlier questions) and a flag-set (which tells us which sequences of answers are of special interest). An FS-decision tree is a decision tree of an abstract questionnaire that also incorporates the information contained in the skip-list and flag-set. The main objective of this paper is to represent the abstract questionnaire using a directed graph, which we call an FS-decision digraph, that contains the full information of an FS-decision tree, but is in general much more concise. We present an algorithm for constructing a fully reduced FS-decision digraph, and develop the theory that supports it. In addition, we show how to generate all possible orderings of the questions in an abstract questionnaire that respect a given precedence relation.</description>

      <title>Joint Transmit and Pinching Beamforming for PASS: Optimization-Based or Learning-Based?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel pinching antenna system (PASS)-enabled downlink multi-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) framework is proposed. PASS consists of multiple waveguides spanning over thousands of wavelength, which equip numerous low-cost dielectric particles, named pinching antennas (PAs), to radiate signals into free space. The positions of PAs can be reconfigured to change both the large-scale path losses and phases of signals, thus facilitating the novel pinching beamforming design. A sum rate maximization problem is formulated, which jointly optimizes the transmit and pinching beamforming to adaptively achieve constructive signal enhancement and destructive interference mitigation. To solve this highly coupled and nonconvex problem, both optimization-based and learning-based methods are proposed. 1) For the optimization-based method, a majorization-minimization and penalty dual decomposition (MM-PDD) algorithm is developed, which handles the nonconvex complex exponential component using a Lipschitz surrogate function and then invokes PDD for problem decoupling. 2) For the learning-based method, a novel Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)-guided dual learning (KDL) approach is proposed, which enables KKT solutions to be reconstructed in a data-driven manner by learning dual variables. Following this idea, a KDL-Tranformer algorithm is developed, which captures both inter-PA/inter-user dependencies and channel-state-information (CSI)-beamforming dependencies by attention mechanisms. Simulation results demonstrate that: i) The proposed PASS framework significantly outperforms conventional massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO) system even with a few PAs. ii) The proposed KDL-Transformer can improve over 30% system performance than MM-PDD algorithm, while achieving a millisecond-level response on modern GPUs.</description>

      <title>Assessment of the Sparsity-Diversity Trade-offs in Active Users Detection for mMTC with the Orthogonal Matching Pursuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wireless communication systems must increasingly support a multitude of machine-type communications (MTC) devices, thus calling for advanced strategies for active user detection (AUD). Recent literature has delved into AUD techniques based on compressed sensing, highlighting the critical role of signal sparsity. This study investigates the relationship between frequency diversity and signal sparsity in the AUD problem. Single-antenna users transmit multiple copies of non-orthogonal pilots across multiple frequency channels and the base station independently performs AUD in each channel using the orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm. We note that, although frequency diversity may improve the likelihood of successful reception of the signals, it may also damage the channel sparsity level, leading to important trade-offs. We show that a sparser signal significantly benefits AUD, surpassing the advantages brought by frequency diversity in scenarios with limited temporal resources and/or high numbers of receive antennas. Conversely, with longer pilots and fewer receive antennas, investing in frequency diversity becomes more impactful, resulting in a tenfold AUD performance improvement.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Study on Ziv-Zakai Lower Bounds on the MMSE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores Bayesian lower bounds on the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) that belong to the Ziv-Zakai (ZZ) family. The ZZ technique relies on connecting the bound to an M-ary hypothesis testing problem. Three versions of the ZZ bound (ZZB) exist: the first relies on the so-called valley-filling function (VFF), the second omits the VFF, and the third, i.e., the single-point ZZB (SZZB), uses a single point maximization. The first part of this paper provides the most general version of the bounds. First, it is shown that these bounds hold without any assumption on the distribution of the estimand. Second, the SZZB bound is extended to an M-ary setting and a version of it for the multivariate case is provided. In the second part, general properties of the bounds are provided. First, it is shown that all the bounds tensorize. Second, a complete characterization of the high-noise asymptotic is provided, which is used to argue about the tightness of the bounds. Third, the low-noise asymptotic is provided for mixed-input distributions and Gaussian additive noise channels. Specifically, in the low-noise, it is shown that the SZZB is not always tight. In the third part, the tightness of the bounds is evaluated. First, it is shown that in the low-noise regime the ZZB bound without the VFF is tight for mixed-input distributions and Gaussian additive noise channels. Second, for discrete inputs, the ZZB with the VFF is shown to be always sub-optimal, and equal to zero without the VFF. Third, unlike for the ZZB, an example is shown for which the SZZB is tight to the MMSE for discrete inputs. Fourth, sufficient and necessary conditions for the tightness of the bounds are provided. Finally, some examples are shown in which the bounds in the ZZ family outperform other well-known Bayesian bounds, i.e., the Cram\'er-Rao bound and the maximum entropy bound.</description>

      <title>Multiple-Target Detection in Cell-Free Massive MIMO-Assisted ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a distributed implementation for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) backed by a massive multiple input multiple output (CF-mMIMO) architecture without cells. Distributed multi-antenna access points (APs) simultaneously serve communication users (UEs) and emit probing signals towards multiple specified zones for sensing. The APs can switch between communication and sensing modes, and adjust their transmit power based on the network settings and sensing and communication operations' requirements. By considering local partial zero-forcing and maximum-ratio-transmit precoding at the APs for communication and sensing, respectively, we first derive closed-form expressions for the spectral efficiency (SE) of the UEs and the mainlobe-to-average-sidelobe ratio (MASR) of the sensing zones. Then, a joint operation mode selection and power control design problem is formulated to maximize the SE fairness among the UEs, while ensuring specific levels of MASR for sensing zones. The complicated mixed-integer problem is relaxed and solved via successive convex approximation approach. We further propose a low-complexity design, where AP mode selection is designed through a greedy algorithm and then power control is designed based on this chosen mode. Our findings reveal that the proposed scheme can consistently ensure a sensing success rate of $100\%$ for different network setups with a satisfactory fairness among all UEs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the multi-node failure repair challenges for MDS array codes. Presently, two primary models are employed for multi-node repairs: the centralized model where all failed nodes are restored in a singular data center, and the cooperative model where failed nodes acquire data from auxiliary nodes and collaborate amongst themselves for the repair process.This paper focuses on the cooperative model, and we provide explicit constructions of optimal MDS array codes with $d$ helper nodes under this model. The sub-packetization level of our new codes is $(d-k+h)(d-k+1)^{\lceil n/2 \rceil}$ where $h$ is the number of failed nodes, $k$ the number of information nodes and $n$ the code length. This improves upon recent constructions given by Liu \emph{et al.} (IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, Vol. 69, 2023).</description>

      <title>An Exact Theory of Causal Emergence for Linear Stochastic Iteration Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: After coarse-graining a complex system, the dynamics of its macro-state may exhibit more pronounced causal effects than those of its micro-state. This phenomenon, known as causal emergence, is quantified by the indicator of effective information. However, two challenges confront this theory: the absence of well-developed frameworks in continuous stochastic dynamical systems and the reliance on coarse-graining methodologies. In this study, we introduce an exact theoretic framework for causal emergence within linear stochastic iteration systems featuring continuous state spaces and Gaussian noise. Building upon this foundation, we derive an analytical expression for effective information across general dynamics and identify optimal linear coarse-graining strategies that maximize the degree of causal emergence when the dimension averaged uncertainty eliminated by coarse-graining has an upper bound. Our investigation reveals that the maximal causal emergence and the optimal coarse-graining methods are primarily determined by the principal eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the dynamic system's parameter matrix, with the latter not being unique. To validate our propositions, we apply our analytical models to three simplified physical systems, comparing the outcomes with numerical simulations, and consistently achieve congruent results.</description>

Abstract: This work proposes a novel low-complexity digital backpropagation (DBP) method, with the goal of optimizing the trade-off between backpropagation accuracy and complexity. The method combines a split step Fourier method (SSFM)-like structure with a simplified logarithmic perturbation method to obtain a high accuracy with a small number of DBP steps. Subband processing and asymmetric steps with optimized splitting ratio are also employed to further reduce the number of steps required to achieve a prescribed performance. The first part of the manuscript is dedicated to the derivation of a simplified logarithmic-perturbation model for the propagation of signal in an optical fiber, which serves for the development of the proposed coupled-band enhanced split step Fourier method (CB-ESSFM) and for the analytical calculation of the model coefficients. Next, the manuscript presents a DSP algorithm for the implementation of DBP based on a discrete-time version of the model and an overlap-and-save processing strategy. Practical approaches for the optimization of the coefficients used in the algorithm and of the splitting ratio of the asymmetric steps are also discussed. A detailed analysis of the computational complexity is presented. Finally, the performance and complexity of the proposed DBP method are investigated through simulations. In a five-channel 100 GHz-spaced wavelength division multiplexing system over a 15x80 km single-mode-fiber link, the proposed CB-ESSFM achieves a gain of about 1dB over simple dispersion compensation with only 15 steps (corresponding to 681 real multiplications per 2D symbol), with an improvement of 0.9 dB over conventional SSFM and almost 0.4dB over our previously proposed ESSFM. Significant gains and improvements are obtained also at lower complexity. A similar analysis is performed also for longer links, confirming the good performance of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Physical Layer Deception in OFDM Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a promising technology, physical layer security (PLS) enhances security by leveraging the physical characteristics of communication channels. However, it commonly takes the legitimate user more effort to secure its data, compared to that required by the eavesdropper to intercept the communication. To address this imbalance, we propose a physical layer deception (PLD) framework, which applies random deceptive ciphering combined with orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) to deceive eavesdroppers with falsified information, preventing them from wiretapping. While ensuring the same level of confidentiality as traditional PLS methods, the PLD approach additionally introduces a deception mechanism, which remains effective even when the eavesdropper has the same knowledge about the transmitter as the legitimate receiver. Through detailed theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, we prove the superiority of our method over the conventional PLS approach.</description>

      <title>Soft Reverse Reconciliation for Discrete Modulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The performance of the information reconciliation phase is crucial for quantum key distribution (QKD). Reverse reconciliation (RR) is typically preferred over direct reconciliation (DR) because it yields higher secure key rates. However, a significant challenge in continuous-variable (CV) QKD with discrete modulations (such as QAM) is that Alice lacks soft information about the symbol decisions made by Bob. This limitation restricts error correction to hard-decoding methods, with low reconciliation efficiency. This work introduces a reverse reconciliation softening (RRS) procedure designed for CV-QKD scenarios employing discrete modulations. This procedure generates a soft metric that Bob can share with Alice over a public channel, enabling her to perform soft-decoding error correction without disclosing any information to a potential eavesdropper. After detailing the RRS procedure, we investigate how the mutual information between Alice's and Bob's variables changes when the additional metric is shared. We show numerically that RRS improves the mutual information with respect to RR with hard decoding, practically achieving the same mutual information as DR with soft decoding. Finally, we test the proposed RRS for PAM-4 signalling with a rate 1/2 binary LDPC code and bit-wise decoding through numerical simulations, obtaining more than 1dB SNR improvement compared to hard-decoding RR.</description>

      <title>Fault Detection and Monitoring using a Data-Driven Information-Based Strategy: Method, Theory, and Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to detect when a system undergoes an incipient fault is of paramount importance in preventing a critical failure. Classic methods for fault detection (including model-based and data-driven approaches) rely on thresholding error statistics or simple input-residual dependencies but face difficulties with non-linear or non-Gaussian systems. Behavioral methods (e.g., those relying on digital twins) address these difficulties but still face challenges when faulty data is scarce, decision guarantees are required, or working with already-deployed models is required. In this work, we propose an information-driven fault detection method based on a novel concept drift detector, addressing these challenges. The method is tailored to identifying drifts in input-output relationships of additive noise models (i.e., model drifts) and is based on a distribution-free mutual information (MI) estimator. Our scheme does not require prior faulty examples and can be applied distribution-free over a large class of system models. Our core contributions are twofold. First, we demonstrate the connection between fault detection, model drift detection, and testing independence between two random variables. Second, we prove several theoretical properties of the proposed MI-based fault detection scheme: (i) strong consistency, (ii) exponentially fast detection of the non-faulty case, and (iii) control of both significance levels and power of the test. To conclude, we validate our theory with synthetic data and the benchmark dataset N-CMAPSS of aircraft turbofan engines. These empirical results support the usefulness of our methodology in many practical and realistic settings, and the theoretical results show performance guarantees that other methods cannot offer.</description>

      <title>Fast Convergence of $\Phi$-Divergence Along the Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm and Proximal Sampler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the mixing time of two popular discrete-time Markov chains in continuous space, the Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm and the Proximal Sampler, which are discretizations of the Langevin dynamics. We extend mixing time analyses for these Markov chains to hold in $\Phi$-divergence. We show that any $\Phi$-divergence arising from a twice-differentiable strictly convex function $\Phi$ converges to $0$ exponentially fast along these Markov chains, under the assumption that their stationary distributions satisfy the corresponding $\Phi$-Sobolev inequality, which holds for example when the target distribution of the Langevin dynamics is strongly log-concave. Our setting includes as special cases popular mixing time regimes, namely the mixing in chi-squared divergence under a Poincar\'e inequality, and the mixing in relative entropy under a log-Sobolev inequality. Our results follow by viewing the sampling algorithms as noisy channels and bounding the contraction coefficients arising in the appropriate strong data processing inequalities.</description>

      <title>Parsings of Stationary Processes, Stopping Times and the Fundamental Pointwise Convergence Theorems of Ergodic Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02615v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The idea of a parsing of a stationary process according to a collection of words is introduced, and the basic framework required for the asymptotic analysis of these parsings is presented. We demonstrate how the pointwise ergodic theorem and the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman theorem can be deduced from their respective weaker convergence in probability versions combined with our observations regarding parsings, where the parsings are done according to collections that originate in stopping times tailored for that purpose.</description>

      <title>Machine Unlearning via Information Theoretic Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How can we effectively remove or "unlearn" undesirable information, such as specific features or individual data points, from a learning outcome while minimizing utility loss and ensuring rigorous guarantees? We introduce a mathematical framework based on information-theoretic regularization to address both feature and data point unlearning. For feature unlearning, we derive a unified solution that simultaneously optimizes diverse learning objectives, including entropy, conditional entropy, KL-divergence, and the energy of conditional probability. For data point unlearning, we first propose a novel definition that serves as a practical condition for unlearning via retraining, is easy to verify, and aligns with the principles of differential privacy from an inference perspective. Then, we provide provable guarantees for our framework on data point unlearning. By combining flexibility in learning objectives with simplicity in regularization design, our approach is highly adaptable and practical for a wide range of machine learning and AI applications.</description>
