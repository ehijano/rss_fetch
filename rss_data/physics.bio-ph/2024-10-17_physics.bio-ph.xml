      <title>Fabrication of functional 3D nanoarchitectures via atomic layer deposition on DNA origami crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While DNA origami is a powerful bottom-up fabrication technique, the physical and chemical stability of DNA nanostructures is generally limited to aqueous buffer conditions. Wet chemical silicification can stabilise these structures but does not add further functionality. Here, we demonstrate a versatile 3D nanofabrication technique to conformally coat micrometre-sized DNA origami crystals with functional metal oxides via atomic layer deposition (ALD). In addition to depositing homogenous and conformal nanometre-thin ZnO, TiO2, and IrO2 (multi)layers inside SiO2-stablised crystals, we establish a method to directly coat bare DNA crystals with ALD layers while maintaining the crystal integrity, enabled by critical point drying and low ALD process temperatures. As a proof-of-concept application, we demonstrate electrocatalytic water oxidation using ALD IrO2-coated DNA origami crystals, resulting in improved performance relative to planar films. Overall, our coating strategy establishes a tool set for designing custom-made 3D nanomaterials with precisely defined topologies and material compositions, combining the unique advantages of DNA origami and atomically controlled deposition of functional inorganic materials.</description>

      <title>Formation of motile cell clusters in heterogeneous model tumors: the role of cell-cell alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Circulating tumor cell clusters play an important role in the metastatic cascade. These clusters can acquire a migratory and more invasive phenotype, and coordinate their motion to migrate as a collective. Before such clusters can form by collectively detaching from a primary tumor, however, the cluster must first aggregate in the tumor interior. The mechanism of this cluster formation process is still poorly understood. One of the possible ways for cells to cluster is by aligning their direction of motion with their neighboring cells. This work aims to investigate the role of this cell-cell alignment interaction on the formation of motile cell clusters inside the bulk of a tumor using computer simulations. We employ a Cellular Potts model in which we model a two-dimensional heterogeneous confluent layer containing both motile and non-motile cells. Our results indicate that the degree of clustering is governed by two distinct processes: the formation of clusters due to the presence of cell-cell alignment interactions among motile cells, and the suppression of clustering due to the presence of the dynamic cellular environment (comprised of the non-motile cells). We find that the largest motile clusters are formed for intermediate alignment strengths, contrary to what is observed for motile cells in free space (that is, unimpeded by a dense cellular environment), in which case stronger cell-cell alignment always leads to larger clustering. Our findings suggest that the presence of a densely-packed cellular environment and strong cell-cell alignment inhibits the formation of large migratory clusters within the primary tumor, providing physical insight into potential factors at play during the early stages of metastasis.</description>

      <title>Exact computation of Transfer Entropy with Path Weight Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01650v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to quantify the directional flow of information is vital to understanding natural systems and designing engineered information-processing systems. A widely used measure to quantify this information flow is the transfer entropy. However, until now, this quantity could only be obtained in dynamical models using approximations that are typically uncontrolled. Here we introduce a computational algorithm called Transfer Entropy-Path Weight Sampling (TE-PWS), which makes it possible, for the first time, to quantify the transfer entropy and its variants exactly for any stochastic model, including those with multiple hidden variables, nonlinearity, transient conditions, and feedback. By leveraging techniques from polymer and path sampling, TE-PWS efficiently computes the transfer entropy as a Monte-Carlo average over signal trajectory space. We apply TE-PWS to linear and nonlinear systems to reveal how transfer entropy can overcome naive applications of the data processing inequality in the presence of feedback.</description>
