      <title>Solving cold start in news recommendations: a RippleNet-based system for large scale media outlet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a scalable recommender system implementation based on RippleNet, tailored for the media domain with a production deployment in Onet.pl, one of Poland's largest online media platforms. Our solution addresses the cold-start problem for newly published content by integrating content-based item embeddings into the knowledge propagation mechanism of RippleNet, enabling effective scoring of previously unseen items. The system architecture leverages Amazon SageMaker for distributed training and inference, and Apache Airflow for orchestrating data pipelines and model retraining workflows. To ensure high-quality training data, we constructed a comprehensive golden dataset consisting of user and item features and a separate interaction table, all enabling flexible extensions and integration of new signals.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Multimodal Recommendations with Vision-Language Models and Information-Aware Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal recommendation (MMR) have shown that incorporating rich content sources such as images and text can lead to significant gains representation quality. However, existing methods often rely on coarse visual features and uncontrolled fusion, leading to redundant or misaligned representations. As a result, visual encoders often fail to capture salient, item-relevant semantics, limiting their contribution in multimodal fusion. From an information-theoretic perspective, effective fusion should balance the unique, shared, and redundant information across modalities, preserving complementary cues while avoiding correlation bias. This paper presents VLIF, a vision-language and information-theoretic fusion framework that enhances multimodal recommendation through two key components. (i) A VLM-based visual enrichment module generates fine-grained, title-guided descriptions to transform product images into semantically aligned representations. (ii) An information-aware fusion module, inspired by Partial Information Decomposition (PID), disentangles redundant and synergistic signals across modalities for controlled integration. Experiments on three Amazon datasets demonstrate that VLIF consistently outperforms recent multimodal baselines and substantially strengthens the contribution of visual features.</description>

      <title>KGBridge: Knowledge-Guided Prompt Learning for Non-overlapping Cross-Domain Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs), as structured knowledge bases that organize relational information across diverse domains, provide a unified semantic foundation for cross-domain recommendation (CDR). By integrating symbolic knowledge with user-item interactions, KGs enrich semantic representations, support reasoning, and enhance model interpretability. Despite this potential, existing KG-based methods still face major challenges in CDR, particularly under non-overlapping user scenarios. These challenges arise from: (C1) sensitivity to KG sparsity and popularity bias, (C2) dependence on overlapping users for domain alignment and (C3) lack of explicit disentanglement between transferable and domain-specific knowledge, which limit effective and stable knowledge transfer. To this end, we propose KGBridge, a knowledge-guided prompt learning framework for cross-domain sequential recommendation under non-overlapping user scenarios. KGBridge comprises two core components: a KG-enhanced Prompt Encoder, which models relation-level semantics as soft prompts to provide structured and dynamic priors for user sequence modeling (addressing C1), and a Two-stage Training Paradigm, which combines cross-domain pretraining and privacy-preserving fine-tuning to enable knowledge transfer without user overlap (addressing C2). By combining relation-aware semantic control with correspondence-driven disentanglement, KGBridge explicitly separates and balances domain-shared and domain-specific semantics, thereby maintaining complementarity and stabilizing adaptation during fine-tuning (addressing C3). Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that KGBridge consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and remains robust under varying KG sparsity, highlighting its effectiveness in mitigating structural imbalance and semantic entanglement in KG-enhanced cross-domain recommendation.</description>

      <title>Average Precision at Cutoff k under Random Rankings: Expectation and Variance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender systems and information retrieval platforms rely on ranking algorithms to present the most relevant items to users, thereby improving engagement and satisfaction. Assessing the quality of these rankings requires reliable evaluation metrics. Among them, Mean Average Precision at cutoff k (MAP@k) is widely used, as it accounts for both the relevance of items and their positions in the list.
  In this paper, the expectation and variance of Average Precision at k (AP@k) are derived since they can be used as biselines for MAP@k. Here, we covered two widely used evaluation models: offline and online. The expectation establishes the baseline, indicating the level of MAP@k that can be achieved by pure chance. The variance complements this baseline by quantifying the extent of random fluctuations, enabling a more reliable interpretation of observed scores.</description>

      <title>InteracSPARQL: An Interactive System for SPARQL Query Refinement Using Natural Language Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, querying semantic web data using SPARQL has remained challenging, especially for non-expert users, due to the language's complex syntax and the prerequisite of understanding intricate data structures. To address these challenges, we propose InteracSPARQL, an interactive SPARQL query generation and refinement system that leverages natural language explanations (NLEs) to enhance user comprehension and facilitate iterative query refinement. InteracSPARQL integrates LLMs with a rule-based approach to first produce structured explanations directly from SPARQL abstract syntax trees (ASTs), followed by LLM-based linguistic refinements. Users can interactively refine queries through direct feedback or LLM-driven self-refinement, enabling the correction of ambiguous or incorrect query components in real time. We evaluate InteracSPARQL on standard benchmarks, demonstrating significant improvements in query accuracy, explanation clarity, and overall user satisfaction compared to baseline approaches. Our experiments further highlight the effectiveness of combining rule-based methods with LLM-driven refinements to create more accessible and robust SPARQL interfaces.</description>

      <title>Let Multimodal Embedders Learn When to Augment Query via Adaptive Query Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Query augmentation makes queries more meaningful by appending further information to the queries to find relevant documents. Current studies have proposed Large Language Model (LLM)-based embedders, which learn representation for embedding and generation for query augmentation in a multi-task manner by leveraging the generative capabilities of LLM. During inference, these jointly trained embedders have conducted query augmentation followed by embedding, showing effective results. However, augmenting every query leads to substantial embedding latency and query augmentation can be detrimental to performance for some queries. Also, previous methods have not been explored in multimodal environments. To tackle these problems, we propose M-Solomon, a universal multimodal embedder that can adaptively determine when to augment queries. Our approach first divides the queries of the training datasets into two groups at the dataset level. One includes queries that require augmentation and the other includes queries that do not. Then, we introduces a synthesis process that generates appropriate augmentations for queries that require them by leveraging a powerful Multimodal LLM (MLLM). Next, we present adaptive query augmentation. Through this step, M-Solomon can conduct query augmentation only when necessary by learning to generate synthetic augmentations with the prefix /augment for queries that demand them and to generate the simple string /embed for others. Experimental results showed that M-Solomon not only surpassed the baseline without augmentation by a large margin but also outperformed the baseline that always used augmentation, providing much faster embedding latency.</description>

      <title>Relational Deep Dive: Error-Aware Queries Over Unstructured Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unstructured data is pervasive, but analytical queries demand structured representations, creating a significant extraction challenge. Existing methods like RAG lack schema awareness and struggle with cross-document alignment, leading to high error rates. We propose ReDD (Relational Deep Dive), a framework that dynamically discovers query-specific schemas, populates relational tables, and ensures error-aware extraction with provable guarantees. ReDD features a two-stage pipeline: (1) Iterative Schema Discovery (ISD) identifies minimal, joinable schemas tailored to each query, and (2) Tabular Data Population (TDP) extracts and corrects data using lightweight classifiers trained on LLM hidden states. A main contribution of ReDD is SCAPE, a statistically calibrated method for error detection with coverage guarantees, and SCAPE-HYB, a hybrid approach that optimizes the trade-off between accuracy and human correction costs. Experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate ReDD's effectiveness, reducing data extraction errors from up to 30% to below 1% while maintaining high schema completeness (100% recall) and precision. ReDD's modular design enables fine-grained control over accuracy-cost trade-offs, making it a robust solution for high-stakes analytical queries over unstructured corpora.</description>

      <title>Beyond Single Embeddings: Capturing Diverse Targets with Multi-Query Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most text retrievers generate \emph{one} query vector to retrieve relevant documents. Yet, the conditional distribution of relevant documents for the query may be multimodal, e.g., representing different interpretations of the query. We first quantify the limitations of existing retrievers. All retrievers we evaluate struggle more as the distance between target document embeddings grows. To address this limitation, we develop a new retriever architecture, \emph{A}utoregressive \emph{M}ulti-\emph{E}mbedding \emph{R}etriever (AMER). Our model autoregressively generates multiple query vectors, and all the predicted query vectors are used to retrieve documents from the corpus. We show that on the synthetic vectorized data, the proposed method could capture multiple target distributions perfectly, showing 4x better performance than single embedding model. We also fine-tune our model on real-world multi-answer retrieval datasets and evaluate in-domain. AMER presents 4 and 21\% relative gains over single-embedding baselines on two datasets we evaluate on. Furthermore, we consistently observe larger gains on the subset of dataset where the embeddings of the target documents are less similar to each other. We demonstrate the potential of using a multi-query vector retriever and open up a new direction for future work.</description>

      <title>Beyond Contrastive Learning: Synthetic Data Enables List-wise Training with Multiple Levels of Relevance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although synthetic data has changed various aspects of information retrieval (IR) pipelines, the main training paradigm remains: contrastive learning with binary relevance labels, where one positive document is compared against several negatives using the InfoNCE loss. This objective treats all documents that are not explicitly annotated as relevant on an equally negative footing, regardless of their actual degree of relevance, thus missing subtle nuances useful for ranking. To overcome this limitation, in this work, we forgo real documents and annotations and use large language models to directly generate synthetic documents that answer the MS MARCO queries according to several different levels of relevance. We also propose using Wasserstein distance as a more effective loss function for training transformer-based retrievers with graduated relevance labels. Our experiments on MS MARCO and BEIR benchmark show that our proposed approach outperforms conventional training with InfoNCE by a large margin. Without using any real documents, our method significantly improves self-supervised retrievers and is more robust to distribution shift compared to contrastive learning using real data. Our method also successfully integrates existing real data into the synthetic ranking context, further boosting the performance. Overall, we show that generating multi-level ranking contexts is a better approach to synthetic data generation for IR than just generating the standard positive and negative documents.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Generative Recommendation with Continuous Tokens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12007v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in generative artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), have opened new opportunities for enhancing recommender systems (RecSys). Most existing LLM-based RecSys approaches operate in a discrete space, using vector-quantized tokenizers to align with the inherent discrete nature of language models. However, these quantization methods often result in lossy tokenization and suboptimal learning, primarily due to inaccurate gradient propagation caused by the non-differentiable argmin operation in standard vector quantization. Inspired by the emerging trend of embracing continuous tokens in language models, we propose ContRec, a novel framework that seamlessly integrates continuous tokens into LLM-based RecSys. Specifically, ContRec consists of two key modules: a sigma-VAE Tokenizer, which encodes users/items with continuous tokens; and a Dispersive Diffusion module, which captures implicit user preference. The tokenizer is trained with a continuous Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) objective, where three effective techniques are adopted to avoid representation collapse. By conditioning on the previously generated tokens of the LLM backbone during user modeling, the Dispersive Diffusion module performs a conditional diffusion process with a novel Dispersive Loss, enabling high-quality user preference generation through next-token diffusion. Finally, ContRec leverages both the textual reasoning output from the LLM and the latent representations produced by the diffusion model for Top-K item retrieval, thereby delivering comprehensive recommendation results. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that ContRec consistently outperforms both traditional and SOTA LLM-based recommender systems. Our results highlight the potential of continuous tokenization and generative modeling for advancing the next generation of recommender systems.</description>

      <title>Simple and Behavior-Driven Augmentation for Recommendation with Rich Collaborative Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) has been widely used for enhancing the performance of graph collaborative filtering (GCF) for personalized recommendation. Since data augmentation plays a crucial role in the success of CL, previous works have designed augmentation methods to remove noisy interactions between users and items in order to generate effective augmented views. However, the ambiguity in defining ''noisiness'' presents a persistent risk of losing core information and generating unreliable data views, while increasing the overall complexity of augmentation. In this paper, we propose Simple Collaborative Augmentation for Recommendation (SCAR), a novel and intuitive augmentation method designed to maximize the effectiveness of CL for GCF. Instead of removing information, SCAR leverages collaborative signals extracted from user-item interactions to generate pseudo-interactions, which are then either added to or used to replace existing interactions. This results in more robust representations while avoiding the pitfalls of overly complex augmentation modules. We conduct experiments on four benchmark datasets and show that SCAR outperforms previous CL-based GCF methods as well as other state-of-the-art self-supervised learning approaches across key evaluation metrics. SCAR exhibits strong robustness across different hyperparameter settings and is particularly effective in sparse data scenarios.</description>

Abstract: Generative retrieval (GR) has gained significant attention as an effective paradigm that integrates the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). It generally consists of two stages: constructing discrete semantic identifiers (IDs) for documents and retrieving documents by autoregressively generating ID tokens. The core challenge in GR is how to construct document IDs (DocIDS) with strong representational power. Good IDs should exhibit two key properties: similar documents should have more similar IDs, and each document should maintain a distinct and unique ID. However, most existing methods ignore native category information, which is common and critical in E-commerce. Therefore, we propose a novel ID learning method, CAtegory-Tree Integrated Document IDentifier (CAT-ID$^2$), incorporating prior category information into the semantic IDs. CAT-ID$^2$ includes three key modules: a Hierarchical Class Constraint Loss to integrate category information layer by layer during quantization, a Cluster Scale Constraint Loss for uniform ID token distribution, and a Dispersion Loss to improve the distinction of reconstructed documents. These components enable CAT-ID$^2$ to generate IDs that make similar documents more alike while preserving the uniqueness of different documents' representations. Extensive offline and online experiments confirm the effectiveness of our method, with online A/B tests showing a 0.33% increase in average orders per thousand users for ambiguous intent queries and 0.24% for long-tail queries.</description>

      <title>Osprey: A Scalable Framework for the Orchestration of Agentic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coordinating workflows across complex systems remains a central challenge in safety-critical environments such as scientific facilities. Language-model-driven agents offer a natural interface for these tasks, but existing approaches often lack scalability, reliability, and human oversight. We introduce the Osprey Framework, a domain-agnostic, production-ready architecture for scalable agentic systems that integrate conversational context with robust tool orchestration across safety-critical domains. Our framework provides: (i) dynamic capability classification to select only relevant tools; (ii) plan-first orchestration with explicit dependencies and optional human approval; (iii) context-aware task extraction that combines dialogue history with external memory and domain resources; and (iv) production-ready execution with checkpointing, artifact management, and modular deployment. We demonstrate its versatility through two case studies: a deployment at the Advanced Light Source particle accelerator and a tutorial-style wind farm monitoring example. These results establish Osprey as a reliable and transparent framework for agentic systems across diverse high-stakes domains.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Legal Agents: A Canonical Primitive API for Auditable Reasoning over Temporal Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06002v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For autonomous legal agents to operate safely in high-stakes domains, they require a foundation of absolute determinism and auditability-guarantees that standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks cannot provide. When interacting with temporal knowledge graphs that model the complex evolution of legal norms, agents must navigate versioning, causality, and hierarchical structures with precision, a task for which black-box vector search is ill-suited. This paper introduces a new architectural pattern to solve this: a formal Primitive API designed as a secure execution layer for reasoning over such graphs. Instead of a monolithic query engine, our framework provides a library of canonical primitives-atomic, composable, and auditable primitives. This design empowers planner-guided agents to decompose complex legal questions into transparent execution plans, enabling critical tasks with full verifiability, including: (i) precise point-in-time version retrieval, (ii) robust causal lineage tracing, and (iii) context-aware hybrid search. Ultimately, this architecture transforms opaque retrieval into auditable reasoning, turning the agent's internal process from a black box into a verifiable log of deterministic primitives and providing a blueprint for building the next generation of trustworthy legal AI.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Hierarchical Organization for Medical Multi-document Summarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Medical multi-document summarization (MDS) is a complex task that requires effectively managing cross-document relationships. This paper investigates whether incorporating hierarchical structures in the inputs of MDS can improve a model's ability to organize and contextualize information across documents compared to traditional flat summarization methods. We investigate two ways of incorporating hierarchical organization across three large language models (LLMs), and conduct comprehensive evaluations of the resulting summaries using automated metrics, model-based metrics, and domain expert evaluation of preference, understandability, clarity, complexity, relevance, coverage, factuality, and coherence. Our results show that human experts prefer model-generated summaries over human-written summaries. Hierarchical approaches generally preserve factuality, coverage, and coherence of information, while also increasing human preference for summaries. Additionally, we examine whether simulated judgments from GPT-4 align with human judgments, finding higher agreement along more objective evaluation facets. Our findings demonstrate that hierarchical structures can improve the clarity of medical summaries generated by models while maintaining content coverage, providing a practical way to improve human preference for generated summaries.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Tongyi DeepResearch, an agentic large language model, which is specifically designed for long-horizon, deep information-seeking research tasks. To incentivize autonomous deep research agency, Tongyi DeepResearch is developed through an end-to-end training framework that combines agentic mid-training and agentic post-training, enabling scalable reasoning and information seeking across complex tasks. We design a highly scalable data synthesis pipeline that is fully automatic, without relying on costly human annotation, and empowers all training stages. By constructing customized environments for each stage, our system enables stable and consistent interactions throughout. Tongyi DeepResearch, featuring 30.5 billion total parameters, with only 3.3 billion activated per token, achieves state-of-the-art performance across a range of agentic deep research benchmarks, including Humanity's Last Exam, BrowseComp, BrowseComp-ZH, WebWalkerQA, xbench-DeepSearch, FRAMES and xbench-DeepSearch-2510. We open-source the model, framework, and complete solutions to empower the community.</description>
