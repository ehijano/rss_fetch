      <title>LLM-Meta-SR: Learning to Evolve Selection Operators for Symbolic Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized algorithm development, yet their application in symbolic regression, where algorithms automatically discover symbolic expressions from data, remains constrained and is typically designed manually by human experts. In this paper, we propose a learning-to-evolve framework that enables LLMs to automatically design selection operators for evolutionary symbolic regression algorithms. We first identify two key limitations in existing LLM-based algorithm evolution techniques: code bloat and a lack of semantic guidance. Bloat results in unnecessarily complex components, and the absence of semantic awareness can lead to ineffective exchange of useful code components, both of which can reduce the interpretability of the designed algorithm or hinder evolutionary learning progress. To address these issues, we enhance the LLM-based evolution framework for meta symbolic regression with two key innovations: bloat control and a complementary, semantics-aware selection operator. Additionally, we embed domain knowledge into the prompt, enabling the LLM to generate more effective and contextually relevant selection operators. Our experimental results on symbolic regression benchmarks show that LLMs can devise selection operators that outperform nine expert-designed baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance. This demonstrates that LLMs can exceed expert-level algorithm design for symbolic regression.</description>

      <title>Machine Psychophysics: Cognitive Control in Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cognitive control refers to the ability to flexibly coordinate thought and action in pursuit of internal goals. A standard method for assessing cognitive control involves conflict tasks that contrast congruent and incongruent trials, measuring the ability to prioritize relevant information while suppressing interference. We evaluate 108 vision-language models on three classic conflict tasks and their more demanding "squared" variants across 2,220 trials. Model performance corresponds closely to human behavior under resource constraints and reveals individual differences. These results indicate that some form of human-like executive function have emerged in current multi-modal foundational models.</description>

      <title>Adapting Novelty towards Generating Antigens for Antivirus systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that anti-malware scanners depend on malware signatures to identify malware. However, even minor modifications to malware code structure results in a change in the malware signature thus enabling the variant to evade detection by scanners. Therefore, there exists the need for a proactively generated malware variant dataset to aid detection of such diverse variants by automated antivirus scanners. This paper proposes and demonstrates a generic assembly source code based framework that facilitates any evolutionary algorithm to generate diverse and potential variants of an input malware, while retaining its maliciousness, yet capable of evading antivirus scanners. Generic code transformation functions and a novelty search supported quality metric have been proposed as components of the framework to be used respectively as variation operators and fitness function, for evolutionary algorithms. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework in generating diverse variants and the generated variants have been shown to evade over 98% of popular antivirus scanners. The malware variants evolved by the framework can serve as antigens to assist malware analysis engines to improve their malware detection algorithms.</description>

      <title>Recurrent Self-Attention Dynamics: An Energy-Agnostic Perspective from Jacobians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theoretical understanding of self-attention (SA) has been steadily progressing. A prominent line of work studies a class of SA layers that admit an energy function decreased by state updates. While it provides valuable insights into inherent biases in signal propagation, it often relies on idealized assumptions or additional constraints not necessarily present in standard SA. Thus, to broaden our understanding, this work aims to relax these energy constraints and provide an energy-agnostic characterization of inference dynamics by dynamical systems analysis. In more detail, we first consider relaxing the symmetry and single-head constraints traditionally required in energy-based formulations. Next, to investigate more general SA architectures capable of oscillatory dynamics without necessarily admitting an energy function, we analyze the Jacobian matrix of the state. We reveal that normalization layers effectively normalize the Jacobian's complex eigenvalues, forcing the dynamics close to a critical state. This significantly enhances inference performance. Furthermore, we utilize the Jacobian perspective to develop regularization methods for training and a pseudo-energy for monitoring inference dynamics.</description>

      <title>GPU-Accelerated Rule Evaluation and Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01821v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative approach to boost the efficiency and scalability of Evolutionary Rule-based machine Learning (ERL), a key technique in explainable AI. While traditional ERL systems can distribute processes across multiple CPUs, fitness evaluation of candidate rules is a bottleneck, especially with large datasets. The method proposed in this paper, AERL (Accelerated ERL) solves this problem in two ways. First, by adopting GPU-optimized rule sets through a tensorized representation within the PyTorch framework, AERL mitigates the bottleneck and accelerates fitness evaluation significantly. Second, AERL takes further advantage of the GPUs by fine-tuning the rule coefficients via back-propagation, thereby improving search space exploration. Experimental evidence confirms that AERL search is faster and more effective, thus empowering explainable artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Memetic Search for Electric Vehicle Routing with Time Windows, Simultaneous Pickup-Delivery, and Partial Recharges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With growing environmental concerns, electric vehicles for logistics have gained significant attention within the computational intelligence community in recent years. This work addresses an emerging and significant extension of the electric vehicle routing problem (EVRP), namely EVRP with time windows, simultaneous pickup-delivery, and partial recharges (EVRP-TW-SPD), which has widespread real-world applications. We propose a hybrid memetic algorithm (HMA) for solving EVRP-TW-SPD. HMA incorporates two novel components: a parallel-sequential station insertion (PSSI) procedure for handling partial recharges that can better avoid local optima compared to purely sequential insertion, and a cross-domain neighborhood search (CDNS) that explores solution spaces of both electric and non-electric problem domains simultaneously. These components can also be easily applied to various EVRP variants. To bridge the gap between existing benchmarks and real-world scenarios, we introduce a new, large-scale EVRP-TW-SPD benchmark set derived from real-world applications, containing instances with many more customers and charging stations than existing benchmark instances. Extensive experiments demonstrate the significant performance advantages of HMA over existing algorithms across a wide range of problem instances. Both the benchmark set and HMA are to be made open-source to facilitate further research in this area.</description>

      <title>Faster and Stronger: When ANN-SNN Conversion Meets Parallel Spiking Calculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Network (SNN), as a brain-inspired and energy-efficient network, is currently facing the pivotal challenge of exploring a suitable and efficient learning framework. The predominant training methodologies, namely Spatial-Temporal Back-propagation (STBP) and ANN-SNN Conversion, are encumbered by substantial training overhead or pronounced inference latency, which impedes the advancement of SNNs in scaling to larger networks and navigating intricate application domains. In this work, we propose a novel parallel conversion learning framework, which establishes a mathematical mapping relationship between each time-step of the parallel spiking neurons and the cumulative spike firing rate. We theoretically validate the lossless and sorting properties of the conversion process, as well as pointing out the optimal shifting distance for each step. Furthermore, by integrating the above framework with the distribution-aware error calibration technique, we can achieve efficient conversion towards more general activation functions or training-free circumstance. Extensive experiments have confirmed the significant performance advantages of our method for various conversion cases under ultra-low time latency. To our best knowledge, this is the first work which jointly utilizes parallel spiking calculation and ANN-SNN Conversion, providing a highly promising approach for SNN supervised training. Code is available at https://github.com/hzc1208/Parallel_Conversion.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Reset Mechanisms in Spiking Neural Networks for Sequential Modeling: Specialized Discretization for Binary Activated RNN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17751v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the field of image recognition, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have achieved performance comparable to conventional artificial neural networks (ANNs). In such applications, SNNs essentially function as traditional neural networks with quantized activation values. This article focuses on an another alternative perspective,viewing SNNs as binary-activated recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for sequential modeling tasks. From this viewpoint, current SNN architectures face several fundamental challenges in sequence modeling: (1) Traditional models lack effective memory mechanisms for long-range sequence modeling; (2) The biological-inspired components in SNNs (such as reset mechanisms and refractory period applications) remain theoretically under-explored for sequence tasks; (3) The RNN-like computational paradigm in SNNs prevents parallel training across different timesteps. To address these challenges, this study conducts a systematic analysis of the fundamental mechanisms underlying reset operations and refractory periods in binary-activated RNN-based SNN sequence models. We re-examine whether such biological mechanisms are strictly necessary for generating sparse spiking patterns, provide new theoretical explanations and insights, and ultimately propose the fixed-refractory-period SNN architecture for sequence modeling.</description>

      <title>Graph-Supported Dynamic Algorithm Configuration for Multi-Objective Combinatorial Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been widely used for dynamic algorithm configuration, particularly in evolutionary computation, which benefits from the adaptive update of parameters during the algorithmic execution. However, applying DRL to algorithm configuration for multi-objective combinatorial optimization (MOCO) problems remains relatively unexplored. This paper presents a novel graph neural network (GNN) based DRL to configure multi-objective evolutionary algorithms. We model the dynamic algorithm configuration as a Markov decision process, representing the convergence of solutions in the objective space by a graph, with their embeddings learned by a GNN to enhance the state representation. Experiments on diverse MOCO challenges indicate that our method outperforms traditional and DRL-based algorithm configuration methods in terms of efficacy and adaptability. It also exhibits advantageous generalizability across objective types and problem sizes, and applicability to different evolutionary computation methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00449v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fully tensorial theory of hypercomplex neural networks is given. It allows neural networks to use arithmetic based on arbitrary algebras. The key point is to observe that algebra multiplication can be represented as a rank three tensor and use this tensor in every algebraic operation. This approach is attractive for neural network libraries that support effective tensorial operations. It agrees with previous implementations for four-dimensional algebras.</description>

      <title>Lean and Mean Adaptive Optimization via Subset-Norm and Subspace-Momentum with Convergence Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07120v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce two complementary techniques for efficient optimization that reduce memory requirements while accelerating training of large-scale neural networks. The first technique, Subset-Norm step size, generalizes AdaGrad-Norm and AdaGrad(-Coordinate) through step-size sharing. Subset-Norm (SN) reduces AdaGrad's memory footprint from $O(d)$ to $O(\sqrt{d})$, where $d$ is the model size. For non-convex smooth objectives under coordinate-wise sub-gaussian noise, we show a noise-adapted high-probability convergence guarantee with improved dimensional dependence of SN over existing methods. Our second technique, Subspace-Momentum, reduces the momentum state's memory footprint by restricting momentum to a low-dimensional subspace while performing SGD in the orthogonal complement. We prove a high-probability convergence result for Subspace-Momentum under standard assumptions. Empirical evaluation on pre-training and fine-tuning LLMs demonstrates the effectiveness of our methods. For instance, combining Subset-Norm with Subspace-Momentum achieves Adam's validation perplexity for LLaMA 1B in approximately half the training tokens (6.8B vs 13.1B) while reducing Adam's optimizer-states memory footprint by more than 80\% with minimal additional hyperparameter tuning.</description>

      <title>Perception-Informed Neural Networks: Beyond Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article introduces Perception-Informed Neural Networks (PrINNs), a framework designed to incorporate perception-based information into neural networks, addressing both systems with known and unknown physics laws or differential equations. Moreover, PrINNs extend the concept of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and their variants, offering a platform for the integration of diverse forms of perception precisiation, including singular, probability distribution, possibility distribution, interval, and fuzzy graph. In fact, PrINNs allow neural networks to model dynamical systems by integrating expert knowledge and perception-based information through loss functions, enabling the creation of modern data-driven models. Some of the key contributions include Mixture of Experts Informed Neural Networks (MOEINNs), which combine heterogeneous expert knowledge into the network, and Transformed-Knowledge Informed Neural Networks (TKINNs), which facilitate the incorporation of meta-information for enhanced model performance. Additionally, Fuzzy-Informed Neural Networks (FINNs) as a modern class of fuzzy deep neural networks leverage fuzzy logic constraints within a deep learning architecture, allowing online training without pre-training and eliminating the need for defuzzification. PrINNs represent a significant step forward in bridging the gap between traditional physics-based modeling and modern data-driven approaches, enabling neural networks to learn from both structured physics laws and flexible perception-based rules. This approach empowers neural networks to operate in uncertain environments, model complex systems, and discover new forms of differential equations, making PrINNs a powerful tool for advancing computational science and engineering.</description>

      <title>Learning to Program Quantum Measurements for Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancements in quantum computing (QC) and machine learning (ML) have sparked significant interest, driving extensive exploration of quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms to address a wide range of complex challenges. The development of high-performance QML models requires expert-level expertise, presenting a key challenge to the widespread adoption of QML. Critical obstacles include the design of effective data encoding strategies and parameterized quantum circuits, both of which are vital for the performance of QML models. Furthermore, the measurement process is often neglected-most existing QML models employ predefined measurement schemes that may not align with the specific requirements of the targeted problem. We propose an innovative framework that renders the observable of a quantum system-specifically, the Hermitian matrix-trainable. This approach employs an end-to-end differentiable learning framework, enabling simultaneous optimization of the neural network used to program the parameterized observables and the standard quantum circuit parameters. Notably, the quantum observable parameters are dynamically programmed by the neural network, allowing the observables to adapt in real time based on the input data stream. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed method effectively programs observables dynamically within variational quantum circuits, achieving superior results compared to existing approaches. Notably, it delivers enhanced performance metrics, such as higher classification accuracy, thereby significantly improving the overall effectiveness of QML models.</description>
