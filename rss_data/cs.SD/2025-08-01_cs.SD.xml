      <title>Balancing Information Preservation and Disentanglement in Self-Supervised Music Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in self-supervised learning (SSL) methods offer a range of strategies for capturing useful representations from music audio without the need for labeled data. While some techniques focus on preserving comprehensive details through reconstruction, others favor semantic structure via contrastive objectives. Few works examine the interaction between these paradigms in a unified SSL framework. In this work, we propose a multi-view SSL framework for disentangling music audio representations that combines contrastive and reconstructive objectives. The architecture is designed to promote both information fidelity and structured semantics of factors in disentangled subspaces. We perform an extensive evaluation on the design choices of contrastive strategies using music audio representations in a controlled setting. We find that while reconstruction and contrastive strategies exhibit consistent trade-offs, when combined effectively, they complement each other; this enables the disentanglement of music attributes without compromising information integrity.</description>

      <title>"I made this (sort of)": Negotiating authorship, confronting fraudulence, and exploring new musical spaces with prompt-based AI music generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I reflect on my experience creating two music albums centered on state-of-the-art prompt-based AI music generation platforms. The first album explicitly poses the question: What happens when I collide my junk mail with these platforms? The second album is a direct response to the first, and toys with the inability of state-of-the-art prompt-based AI music generation platforms to generate music that is not ``practiced'', ``polished'', and ``produced''. I seed a large language model (LLM) with information about these albums and have it interview me, which results in the exploration of several deeper questions: To what extent am I the author? Where am I in the resulting music? How is my musical identity changing as I am faced with machines that are in some ways far more talented than I? What new musical spaces does my work open, for me or anyone/thing else? I conclude by reflecting on my reflections, as well as LLM-mediated self-reflection as method.</description>

      <title>Identifying Hearing Difficulty Moments in Conversational Audio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Individuals regularly experience Hearing Difficulty Moments in everyday conversation. Identifying these moments of hearing difficulty has particular significance in the field of hearing assistive technology where timely interventions are key for realtime hearing assistance. In this paper, we propose and compare machine learning solutions for continuously detecting utterances that identify these specific moments in conversational audio. We show that audio language models, through their multimodal reasoning capabilities, excel at this task, significantly outperforming a simple ASR hotword heuristic and a more conventional fine-tuning approach with Wav2Vec, an audio-only input architecture that is state-of-the-art for automatic speech recognition (ASR).</description>

      <title>Exploring Dynamic Parameters for Vietnamese Gender-Independent ASR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamic characteristics of speech signal provides temporal information and play an important role in enhancing Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). In this work, we characterized the acoustic transitions in a ratio plane of Spectral Subband Centroid Frequencies (SSCFs) using polar parameters to capture the dynamic characteristics of the speech and minimize spectral variation. These dynamic parameters were combined with Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) in Vietnamese ASR to capture more detailed spectral information. The SSCF0 was used as a pseudo-feature for the fundamental frequency (F0) to describe the tonal information robustly. The findings showed that the proposed parameters significantly reduce word error rates and exhibit greater gender independence than the baseline MFCCs.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Invertibility of Multimodal Latent Spaces: Limitations of Optimization-Based Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the inverse capabilities and broader utility of multimodal latent spaces within task-specific AI (Artificial Intelligence) models. While these models excel at their designed forward tasks (e.g., text-to-image generation, audio-to-text transcription), their potential for inverse mappings remains largely unexplored. We propose an optimization-based framework to infer input characteristics from desired outputs, applying it bidirectionally across Text-Image (BLIP, Flux.1-dev) and Text-Audio (Whisper-Large-V3, Chatterbox-TTS) modalities.
  Our central hypothesis posits that while optimization can guide models towards inverse tasks, their multimodal latent spaces will not consistently support semantically meaningful and perceptually coherent inverse mappings. Experimental results consistently validate this hypothesis. We demonstrate that while optimization can force models to produce outputs that align textually with targets (e.g., a text-to-image model generating an image that an image captioning model describes correctly, or an ASR model transcribing optimized audio accurately), the perceptual quality of these inversions is chaotic and incoherent. Furthermore, when attempting to infer the original semantic input from generative models, the reconstructed latent space embeddings frequently lack semantic interpretability, aligning with nonsensical vocabulary tokens.
  These findings highlight a critical limitation. multimodal latent spaces, primarily optimized for specific forward tasks, do not inherently possess the structure required for robust and interpretable inverse mappings. Our work underscores the need for further research into developing truly semantically rich and invertible multimodal latent spaces.</description>

      <title>Moravec's Paradox: Towards an Auditory Turing Test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research work demonstrates that current AI systems fail catastrophically on auditory tasks that humans perform effortlessly. Drawing inspiration from Moravec's paradox (i.e., tasks simple for humans often prove difficult for machines, and vice versa), we introduce an auditory Turing test comprising 917 challenges across seven categories: overlapping speech, speech in noise, temporal distortion, spatial audio, coffee-shop noise, phone distortion, and perceptual illusions. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art audio models including GPT-4's audio capabilities and OpenAI's Whisper reveals a striking failure rate exceeding 93%, with even the best-performing model achieving only 6.9% accuracy on tasks that humans solved at 7.5 times higher success (52%). These results expose focusing failures in how AI systems process complex auditory scenes, particularly in selective attention, noise robustness, and contextual adaptation. Our benchmark not only quantifies the human-machine auditory gap but also provides insights into why these failures occur, suggesting that current architectures lack fundamental mechanisms for human-like auditory scene analysis. The traditional design of audio CAPTCHAs highlights common filters that humans evolved but machines fail to select in multimodal language models. This work establishes a diagnostic framework for measuring progress toward human-level machine listening and highlights the need for novel approaches integrating selective attention, physics-based audio understanding, and context-aware perception into multimodal AI systems.</description>

      <title>Feature Importance across Domains for Improving Non-Intrusive Speech Intelligibility Prediction in Hearing Aids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given the critical role of non-intrusive speech intelligibility assessment in hearing aids (HA), this paper enhances its performance by introducing Feature Importance across Domains (FiDo). We estimate feature importance on spectral and time-domain acoustic features as well as latent representations of Whisper. Importance weights are calculated per frame, and based on these weights, features are projected into new spaces, allowing the model to focus on important areas early. Next, feature concatenation is performed to combine the features before the assessment module processes them. Experimental results show that when FiDo is incorporated into the improved multi-branched speech intelligibility model MBI-Net+, RMSE can be reduced by 7.62% (from 26.10 to 24.11). MBI-Net+ with FiDo also achieves a relative RMSE reduction of 3.98% compared to the best system in the 2023 Clarity Prediction Challenge. These results validate FiDo's effectiveness in enhancing neural speech assessment in HA.</description>

      <title>CUHK-EE Systems for the vTAD Challenge at NCMMSC 2025</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the Voice Timbre Attribute Detection (vTAD) systems developed by the Digital Signal Processing &amp; Speech Technology Laboratory (DSP&amp;STL) of the Department of Electronic Engineering (EE) at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) for the 20th National Conference on Human-Computer Speech Communication (NCMMSC 2025) vTAD Challenge. The proposed systems leverage WavLM-Large embeddings with attentive statistical pooling to extract robust speaker representations, followed by two variants of Diff-Net, i.e., Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFN) and Squeeze-and-Excitation-enhanced Residual FFN (SE-ResFFN), to compare timbre attribute intensities between utterance pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that the WavLM-Large+FFN system generalises better to unseen speakers, achieving 77.96% accuracy and 21.79% EER, while the WavLM-Large+SE-ResFFN model excels in the 'Seen' setting with 94.42% accuracy and 5.49% EER. These findings highlight a trade-off between model complexity and generalisation, and underscore the importance of architectural choices in fine-grained speaker modelling. Our analysis also reveals the impact of speaker identity, annotation subjectivity, and data imbalance on system performance, pointing to future directions for improving robustness and fairness in timbre attribute detection.</description>

      <title>Real-time Generation of Various Types of Nodding for Avatar Attentive Listening System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In human dialogue, nonverbal information such as nodding and facial expressions is as crucial as verbal information, and spoken dialogue systems are also expected to express such nonverbal behaviors. We focus on nodding, which is critical in an attentive listening system, and propose a model that predicts both its timing and type in real time. The proposed model builds on the voice activity projection (VAP) model, which predicts voice activity from both listener and speaker audio. We extend it to prediction of various types of nodding in a continuous and real-time manner unlike conventional models. In addition, the proposed model incorporates multi-task learning with verbal backchannel prediction and pretraining on general dialogue data. In the timing and type prediction task, the effectiveness of multi-task learning was significantly demonstrated. We confirmed that reducing the processing rate enables real-time operation without a substantial drop in accuracy, and integrated the model into an avatar attentive listening system. Subjective evaluations showed that it outperformed the conventional method, which always does nodding in sync with verbal backchannel. The code and trained models are available at https://github.com/MaAI-Kyoto/MaAI.</description>

      <title>MECAT: A Multi-Experts Constructed Benchmark for Fine-Grained Audio Understanding Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While large audio-language models have advanced open-ended audio understanding, they still fall short of nuanced human-level comprehension. This gap persists largely because current benchmarks, limited by data annotations and evaluation metrics, fail to reliably distinguish between generic and highly detailed model outputs. To this end, this work introduces MECAT, a Multi-Expert Constructed Benchmark for Fine-Grained Audio Understanding Tasks. Generated via a pipeline that integrates analysis from specialized expert models with Chain-of-Thought large language model reasoning, MECAT provides multi-perspective, fine-grained captions and open-set question-answering pairs. The benchmark is complemented by a novel metric: DATE (Discriminative-Enhanced Audio Text Evaluation). This metric penalizes generic terms and rewards detailed descriptions by combining single-sample semantic similarity with cross-sample discriminability. A comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art audio models is also presented, providing new insights into their current capabilities and limitations. The data and code are available at https://github.com/xiaomi-research/mecat</description>

      <title>DMF2Mel: A Dynamic Multiscale Fusion Network for EEG-Driven Mel Spectrogram Reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07526v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decoding speech from brain signals is a challenging research problem. Although existing technologies have made progress in reconstructing the mel spectrograms of auditory stimuli at the word or letter level, there remain core challenges in the precise reconstruction of minute-level continuous imagined speech: traditional models struggle to balance the efficiency of temporal dependency modeling and information retention in long-sequence decoding. To address this issue, this paper proposes the Dynamic Multiscale Fusion Network (DMF2Mel), which consists of four core components: the Dynamic Contrastive Feature Aggregation Module (DC-FAM), the Hierarchical Attention-Guided Multi-Scale Network (HAMS-Net), the SplineMap attention mechanism, and the bidirectional state space module (convMamba). Specifically, the DC-FAM separates speech-related "foreground features" from noisy "background features" through local convolution and global attention mechanisms, effectively suppressing interference and enhancing the representation of transient signals. HAMS-Net, based on the U-Net framework,achieves cross-scale fusion of high-level semantics and low-level details. The SplineMap attention mechanism integrates the Adaptive Gated Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (AGKAN) to combine global context modeling with spline-based local fitting. The convMamba captures long-range temporal dependencies with linear complexity and enhances nonlinear dynamic modeling capabilities. Results on the SparrKULee dataset show that DMF2Mel achieves a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.074 in mel spectrogram reconstruction for known subjects (a 48% improvement over the baseline) and 0.048 for unknown subjects (a 35% improvement over the baseline).Code is available at: https://github.com/fchest/DMF2Mel.</description>

      <title>Towards Inclusive ASR: Investigating Voice Conversion for Dysarthric Speech Recognition in Low-Resource Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14874v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) for dysarthric speech remains challenging due to data scarcity, particularly in non-English languages. To address this, we fine-tune a voice conversion model on English dysarthric speech (UASpeech) to encode both speaker characteristics and prosodic distortions, then apply it to convert healthy non-English speech (FLEURS) into non-English dysarthric-like speech. The generated data is then used to fine-tune a multilingual ASR model, Massively Multilingual Speech (MMS), for improved dysarthric speech recognition. Evaluation on PC-GITA (Spanish), EasyCall (Italian), and SSNCE (Tamil) demonstrates that VC with both speaker and prosody conversion significantly outperforms the off-the-shelf MMS performance and conventional augmentation techniques such as speed and tempo perturbation. Objective and subjective analyses of the generated data further confirm that the generated speech simulates dysarthric characteristics.</description>

      <title>Conan: A Chunkwise Online Network for Zero-Shot Adaptive Voice Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14534v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Zero-shot online voice conversion (VC) holds significant promise for real-time communications and entertainment. However, current VC models struggle to preserve semantic fidelity under real-time constraints, deliver natural-sounding conversions, and adapt effectively to unseen speaker characteristics. To address these challenges, we introduce Conan, a chunkwise online zero-shot voice conversion model that preserves the content of the source while matching the voice timbre and styles of reference speech. Conan comprises three core components: 1) a Stream Content Extractor that leverages Emformer for low-latency streaming content encoding; 2) an Adaptive Style Encoder that extracts fine-grained stylistic features from reference speech for enhanced style adaptation; 3) a Causal Shuffle Vocoder that implements a fully causal HiFiGAN using a pixel-shuffle mechanism. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that Conan outperforms baseline models in subjective and objective metrics. Audio samples can be found at https://aaronz345.github.io/ConanDemo.</description>
