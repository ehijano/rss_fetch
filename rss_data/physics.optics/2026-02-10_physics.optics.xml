      <title>High-resolution spectroscopy of Pr3+ions in YAl3(BO3)4:Pr3+. Crystal-field, hyperfine,and electron-deformation interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical transmission spectra of YAl3(BO3)4 crystals doped with the Pr3+ ions in concentrations 1 and 2.5 at. % were studied by high-resolution (up to 0.05 cm-1) Fourier spectroscopy, including in magnetic field parallel to the trigonal c axis of the crystal. The g factors of several crystal-field doublets of Pr3+ were determined. The crystal-field calculations performed using the exchange-charge model and high-resolution spectroscopy data allowed us to obtain a physically reasonable set of crystal-field parameters. The observed splitting of a number of doublets in zero magnetic field is explained by the presence of random lattice deformations. Simulation of the profiles of observed deformational doublets was carried out taking into account both hyperfine and electron-deformation interactions. The width of the distribution function of random strains was estimated. The main sources of random strains in YAl3(BO3)4:Pr3+ crystals are discussed.</description>

      <title>Miniaturised multi-plane light converters via laser-written geometric phase holograms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-plane light converters (MPLCs) are an emerging 3D beam shaping technology capable of deterministically mapping a basis of input spatial light modes to a new basis of output modes. The ability to perform such spatial reformatting operations has many future applications in both classical and quantum photonics, spanning from optical communications to photonic computing and imaging. MPLCs are intricate optical systems consisting of a cascade of inverse-designed diffractive optical elements, typically separated by free-space. In this work we investigate the fabrication of miniaturised fully-encapsulated transmissive MPLCs within a glass chip using single-step direct laser writing. Our approach relies on the formation of femto-second laser induced birefringent nanogratings with a spatially controllable fast axis orientation. The glass chip is internally patterned with layers of these nanogratings to create multiple geometric phase holograms which imprint controllable phase patterns onto circularly polarised light propagating through them. We experimentally demonstrate two proof-of-concept glass-embedded 700x700x2000 micrometer cubed MPLCs: a 3-mode and a 10-mode Hermite-Gaussian mode sorter. We discuss the fabrication challenges and future improvements of these devices. Our work plots a path towards the rapid prototyping of robust monolithic MPLC technology.</description>

      <title>Visible dual-comb spectroscopy across more than 100 THz with lithium niobate nanophotonic waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Broadband and high-resolution spectroscopy in the visible and ultraviolet is central to advances in multiple fields, including fundamental quantum physics, biology, atmospheric science and astronomy. Traditionally, these measurements are performed with grating or Fourier-transform spectrometers using incoherent light sources. Leveraging coherent light enables powerful frequency-comb-based techniques, but is limited by the technical complexity of efficiently generating broad spectral bandwidths from relatively narrowband and spectrally distant laser sources. Current visible dual-comb spectrometers require implicit compromises between optical bandwidth, experimental simplicity, and acquisition speed. In this work, we introduce a simple and efficient dual-comb spectrometer that converts robust Er:fiber frequency combs from the near-infrared to the ultraviolet and visible with thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) nanophotonic waveguides. Using real-time signal processing, we retrieve coherently averaged dual-comb spectra over nearly 120 THz of simultaneous bandwidth in the visible with 100 MHz spectral resolution. With these capabilities, we measure the broadband absorption spectrum of molecular iodine (I2), demonstrating the broadest visible spectral coverage of a dual-comb spectrometer to date. Additional measurements of NO2, atomic rubidium, and atomic sodium further illustrate the achievable combination of spectroscopic bandwidth, resolution, and intrinsic frequency accuracy. Our results demonstrate the powerful integration of low-power frequency combs, nonlinear nanophotonics, and digital signal processing to enable a compact, efficient and versatile approach to high-resolution mapping of complex absorption spectra across 500 THz in the UV-visible and near-infrared spectral regions for multiple applications beyond the research lab</description>

      <title>High-Throughput In-Situ Fabrication of Fibrous Membranes Enables Scalable Passive Radiative Cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deploying fibrous membranes for passive daytime radiative cooling (PDRC) on large and irregular surfaces is highly desirable but remains challenging, owing to the slow deposition rates and the need for electrically conductive substrates in conventional electrospinning. Here, we demonstrate a high-throughput in-situ strategy for fabricating nanocomposite PDRC fibrous membranes via solution blow spinning. This method achieves deposition rates 8-12 times faster than electrospinning and can be applied directly onto nonplanar, nonconductive objects. The resulting membranes, composed of styrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene (SEBS) fibers embedded with Y2O3 nanoparticles, achieve sub-ambient cooling of up to 7.0 {\deg}C outdoors, effectively delaying ice melting. Moreover, they are fully recyclable through simple cleaning, dissolution, and reprocessing. This scalable and sustainable fabrication route provides a versatile and practical platform for integrating PDRC fibrous membranes across diverse surfaces, paving the way toward real-world thermal management applications.</description>

      <title>Broadband terahertz comb with sub-Hz comb linewidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) frequency combs are increasingly essential for spectroscopy, metrology, and quantum science. However, generating a dense array of evenly spaced ultra-narrow THz comb lines is challenging. Here, we demonstrate broadband THz comb generation using a photoconductive antenna that transfers a noise-suppressed near-infrared electro-optical (EO) comb into the THz domain. Our noise-suppression strategy, leveraging soliton self-frequency shift and spectral filtering, effectively suppresses EO comb phase noise without requiring active stabilization. The resulting THz comb exhibits broad spectral coverage (0.05-4 THz), narrow comb linewidths (0.3 Hz at the Fourier-transform limit), and excellent frequency stability (8.6*10^-14 at 1-second integration). We further demonstrate asynchronous THz time-domain spectroscopy, resolving ~36,000 comb lines with 50 MHz spacing. Crucially, the inherent frequency agility of the EO comb enables rapid and wide-range tuning of the THz comb line spacing. These attributes position our THz comb as a versatile tool for high-resolution molecular spectroscopy and precision THz metrology.</description>

      <title>Optical beam propagation inside a graded-index fiber with saturable nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study theoretically the spatial evolution of optical beams inside a graded-index fiber exhibiting saturable nonlinearity. Utilizing an approach based on the variational principle, we identify the existence of bistable spatial solitons inside such a nonlinear medium, whose stability, analyzed through a linear stability analysis, is due to the saturating nature of the nonlinearity. Spatial solitons adhere to a specific amplitude-width relationship. Any deviation from this relationship leads to oscillating-type solutions with a period that increases with saturation level of the nonlinearity. Theoretically calculated values of this period agree well with numerical findings.</description>

      <title>Stroboscopic nonlinear dynamics: a time-independent theoretical framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments have demonstrated the ability to manipulate nonlinear interactions via time modulation, giving rise to the so-called stroboscopic nonlinearity. To date, however, this phenomenon has not been subjected to a rigorous theoretical analysis. In this work, we elucidate the physical mechanism underlying stroboscopic nonlinear dynamics and establish an effective time-independent model under suitable modulation conditions. The proposed model almost exactly reproduces the full time-dependent dynamics in the quasi-steady state and significantly outperforms empirical descriptions used previously. Our results provide a clear physical picture of stroboscopic nonlinear dynamics and establish a general framework for engineering nonlinear interactions through temporal modulation.</description>

      <title>Short mode-locked pulses from planarized Y-coupled THz lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Short THz pulses are highly attractive both for fundamental research and practical applications in this underdeveloped region of the electromagnetic spectrum. Typically, THz pulses are generated using nonlinear optical methods, starting from a high-power visible or near-IR mode-locked source, but usually suffer from low conversion efficiencies. Here, we present a direct on-chip THz source of coherent short pulse trains based on active mode-locking of an inverse-designed planarized Y-coupled THz quantum cascade laser. By employing quasi-resonant microwave modulation of the asymmetric laser cavity, mode-locked pulses as short as 2.3 ps are generated, with emission bandwidths spanning 500 and 700 GHz at a central frequency of 2.9 THz.</description>

      <title>Terahertz multispectral polarimetric imaging based on intensity measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A compact terahertz (THz) polarimetric spectrometer and imaging system is demonstrated using polarization-sensitive frequency-selective surfaces (PS-FSS) and rapid, intensity-based detection. Real-time Stokes parameter extraction enables angle-of-linear-polarization (AoLP) measurements and quantitative retrieval of the birefringence of a 1-mm-thick x-cut quartz crystal, used here as a benchmark anisotropic sample. The extracted birefringence is in good agreement with THz time domain spectroscopy-based measurements, validating the accuracy of the proposed THz polarimetric approach. Signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) up to 87 dB across 0.23-0.41 THz ensure reliable discrimination of the measured spectral components above the noise floor. Extending this approach to raster-scanned THz imaging using distinct PS-FSS orientations (0{\deg}, 45{\deg}, 90{\deg}, and 135{\deg}) enables simultaneous mapping of frequency-dependent Stokes parameters. The resulting degree of linear polarization (DoLP) and AoLP maps exhibit well-resolved polarimetric contrast, consistent with numerical simulations and independent visible polarimetric measurements. Operating entirely without field-resolved detection or mechanical delay stages, the system provides a robust and compact platform for THz polarimetric spectroscopy and imaging of anisotropic materials.</description>

      <title>Terahertz Synthetic FM Triplet for Distortion-Free Stabilization and Lamb-Dip Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a distortion-free terahertz frequency stabilization technique using a "synthetic FM triplet" to overcome modulation sideband interference associated with high-density spectral lines in molecular clocks. By applying this method to the rotational transitions of acetonitrile (CH$_3$CN), we successfully generated clean derivative waveforms free from inter-line interference, achieving a fractional frequency instability of $1 \times 10^{-9}$ at an averaging time of $1~\mathrm{s}$. Furthermore, we report the observation of Lamb-dips using this high-fidelity approach. Our results establish acetonitrile as a promising candidate for high-agility molecular clocks and provide a robust solution for precision spectroscopy of molecules with complex hyperfine structures.</description>

      <title>Overcoming sensitivity-bandwidth trade-off in mid-infrared spectroscopy by a microresonator-anchored swept laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical frequency combs have revolutionized high-precision spectroscopy, yet an intrinsic trade-off between spectroscopic signal-to-noise ratio (sSNR) and measurement bandwidth ($B$) fundamentally constrains sensitive, broadband measurements. While broadband swept lasers offer a potential solution, generating broadband, ultrafast and linearly sweeping lasers with a narrow linewidth remains a significant challenge, particularly in the fingerprint mid-infrared (mid-IR) band. Here we overcome this limitation by using a microresonator-anchored ultrafast sweeping Fourier domain mode-locked (FDML) laser for mid-IR spectroscopy. We introduce a dual-microresonator-anchor approach: a microcomb provides frequency calibration and a high-Q microresonator resolves the instantaneous FDML lasing lineshape. The strategy enables accurate correction of the FDML laser's sweep nonlinearity and broad linewidth in the near-IR, allowing the FDML laser to function as a high-fidelity mid-IR light via difference frequency generation. The system achieves a record sSNR$\times$$B$ of 1.3$\times$10$^5$ THz$\cdot \sqrt{\rm Hz}$ and methane sensing precision of 9 ppb$\cdot$m$\cdot$$\sqrt{\rm s}$, while retaining GHz resolution to distinguish methane isotope. We further demonstrate broadband, coherent swept laser phase spectroscopy in the mid-IR, tolerating losses up to 78 dB. This work leverages advances in integrated photonics to overcome the fundamental limitations of precision spectroscopy, paving the way for next-generation, broadband, and ultra-sensitive mid-IR spectroscopic sensing systems.</description>

      <title>Systematic Analysis of Ferroelectric Domain Dynamics in Periodically Poled Lithium Niobate Waveguides Using Two-Photon Microscopy and Digital Imaging Processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a characterization and analysis methodology suitable for volume production for characterizing and optimizing x-cut thin-film periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) devices using two-photon (2P) microscopy with quantitative image processing. This method enables direct extraction of key structural parameters, such as duty cycle, phase-matching behavior, and domain uniformity, across large device sets in a non-destructive manner. By correlating 2P microscopy-derived structural metrics with systematic variations in poling conditions, we establish a scalable, image-driven approach for evaluating and improving PPLN fabrication. The resulting workflow supports wafer-level process development and accelerates the manufacturing and packaging of lithium niobate photonic integrated circuits (PICs).</description>

      <title>Origin of Experimental Realization of Vector Beams by Superposition Technique: Geometric Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical vector beam generation based on the superposition technique [Phys. Rev. Lett. 107(5), 053601 (2011)] has attracted significant interest in both fundamental and applied optics due to its simplicity and cost-effectiveness. In this approach, the superposed modes exist in orthogonal polarization states and therefore do not interfere with each other. When optical gadgets are employed for characterization, the corresponding polarization distribution can be observed. In this work, we report that the characteristic (non-uniform) polarization distribution of vector beams is not inherently present in their field distribution. Instead, the observed polarization features arise during characterization as a consequence of the geometric phase difference introduced between the superposed modes by the optical gadgets. This analysis opens a new direction in the understanding of various classes of vector beams and offers potential advances in the field of structured beam optics.</description>

      <title>Topological photonics in one-dimensional settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade, topological photonics has emerged as a vibrant field, attracting significant attention and witnessing remarkable advancements. This growth can be attributed to its fundamental appeal and the unique opportunities it offers for unconventional control of light, promising innovations in next-generation photonic devices. At the heart of topological photonics lies the one-dimensional (1D) SSH model. Originally conceived to elucidate the physics of a molecular chain of polyacetylene, this model has found widespread applications in exploring a wide range of topological phenomena in photonics and beyond. In this chapter, we aim to provide an overview of topological photonics in one-dimensional (1D) settings. After briefly introducing paradigmatic 1D models, including the SSH, Rice-Mele, and AAH models, we review recent advances in experimental studies and applications of topological photonics based on 1D platforms. Our discussion highlights demonstrated examples, such as the nonlinear tuning of topological states in both Hermitian and non-Hermitian photonic SSH lattices, as well as nonlinear harmonic generation and topological lasing in SSH-type photonic microstructures. We further discuss characteristic topological phenomena in other representative 1D settings, including Floquet systems, topological pumping, quasicrystals, and synthetic non-Hermitian systems. Finally, we examine selected examples of two-dimensional (2D) photonic topological crystalline insulators that are closely linked to the SSH model. Towards the end, we summarize the chapter and provide a list of key contributions, together with an outlook on possible future directions in 1D topological photonics. While this review focuses specifically on 1D topological photonics, it is not intended to be comprehensive or exhaustive.</description>

Abstract: Characterizing the micromechanical properties of cells and extracellular matrices is critical in mechanobiology. To meet this need, Brillouin light scattering (BLS) has emerged as a noncontact, high-resolution elastography tool that probes the GHz-frequency longitudinal modulus of materials. This longitudinal modulus reflects both elastic and viscous behavior at microscopic scales. However, interpreting Brillouin spectra in biological specimens is challenging: in highly hydrated samples the Brillouin shift is dominated by water dynamics, and the GHz longitudinal modulus does not directly equate to conventional low-frequency stiffness measures (e.g. Young's or shear moduli). Debates remain about how hydration and polymer relaxation influence the Brillouin signal, and how to relate it to macroscopic biomechanics. In particular, the longitudinal viscosity measured by Brillouin scattering includes a contribution from bulk viscosity, which is absent in standard shear rheology and often overlooked. To address these issues, we used different hydrogel systems and solvent mixtures to show Brillouin spectra are modulated but not dominated by hydration. By varying gelatin concentration, we demonstrated that Brillouin shifts can either positively or negatively correlate with water content, depending on the underlying mechanical response. Measurements on ethanol water mixtures further clarify this behavior. Although the Brillouin shift varies strongly with composition, it does not follow water content monotonically and instead reflects changes in the mixture's mechanical properties. By comparing longitudinal, bulk, and shear viscosities, we also showed that bulk viscous dissipation plays a significant role in the Brillouin response. These results established a mechanical framework for interpreting Brillouin spectrum in hydrated and biomolecular systems.</description>

      <title>Amplified up-conversion of electromagnetic waves using time-varying metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-varying metamaterials and photonic time crystals offer a powerful route to wave amplification through temporal modulation of material parameters. Here, we experimentally demonstrate amplified up-conversion of free-space electromagnetic waves in the microwave regime, with conversion efficiency exceeding the limits imposed by the Manley-Rowe relations as a result of a cascaded amplification process. Using a time-varying metasurface composed of an array of varactor-loaded coupled split-ring resonators, we investigate parametric amplification, frequency up-conversion and wave generation. Direct measurements in both non-degenerate and degenerate regimes show that the Manley-Rowe limits can be surpassed near integer multiples of the incident wave frequency when the pump frequency is approximately twice that of the incident wave. These results establish time-varying metasurfaces as an efficient platform for amplification, generation, and frequency conversion of electromagnetic waves in the microwave and terahertz bands, with potential extension to optical frequencies via ultrafast modulation techniques.</description>

      <title>2.5D co-packaged optical I/O chipsets on a SiON/Si interposer for 4 $\times$ 100G optical interconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical I/O technologies have emerged as a potential industrial solution for high-performance data interconnection in AI/ML computing acceleration. While optical I/Os are deployed at the edge of computational chips by co-packaged optics (CPO), flexible and high-performance integration architectures need to be explored to address system-level challenges. In this work, we present and experimentally demonstrate a SiON/Si-based optical interposer that integrates high-bandwidth and energy-efficient optical I/O chipsets. High-performance photonic and electronic components are co-packaged on the interposer, leading to low-loss, signal-integrity-friendly, and thermally efficient characteristics. The optical interposer incorporates low-loss SiON photonic circuits to realize scalable waveguide routing and wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) with polarization-insensitive operation and high fabrication tolerance, while supporting flip-chip integration with InP-based active devices, including electro-absorption modulated lasers (EMLs) and photodetectors (PDs). Based on this architecture, a 400-Gb/s single-fiber optical transceiver is implemented and experimentally evaluated. Clear eye diagrams and high receiver sensitivity demonstrate reliable high-speed data transmission, which offers scalable, high-bandwidth optical I/Os in future high-performance computational clusters.</description>

      <title>Room Temperature Collective Blinking and Photon Bunching from CsPbBr3 Quantum Dot Superlattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Development of quantum light sources and search for quantum systems capable of supporting collective many-body states are crucial for further progress of modern quantum technologies. Metal halide perovskite quantum dots (QDs) have emerged as a promising candidate for quantum light sources, as individual QDs are reliable single photon emitters even at room temperature. However, photon bunching, a key signature of collective many-body states, has been so far largely observed at cryogenic temperatures in perovskite materials, limiting their applications under ambient conditions. Here, we report the observation of collective blinking and photon bunching in perovskite QD superlattices at room temperature. Sub-wavelength-sized (100 - 500 nm) CsPbBr3 QD superlattices, fabricated via a self-assembly process, exhibit an unusual two-level blinking behavior similar to that of single QDs, and demonstrate photon bunching with a degree of up to 2.75. Time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) measurements and super-resolution imaging reveal that the superlattices have a significantly longer PL lifetime than individual QDs and that their emission is spatially confined to regions tens of nanometers in size. These observations suggest long-range exciton migration to a localized energy trap within the superlattice. Excitation power dependent degree of bunching and analysis of the bunching dynamics indicate that the photon bunching originates from exciton-biexciton cascade emission, a key mechanism for generating entangled photons. These findings establish perovskite QD superlattices as a promising platform for room-temperature collective optical phenomena and quantum light generation, advancing scalable quantum photonic technologies.</description>

      <title>Wide-angle emission in cylindrical moir\'e lattices enabled by rolling origami</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted photonic lattices that form moir\'e superlattices have attracted significant attention owing to their unique properties, such as strong field confinement and high-quality factors, in which the localized optical modes can serve as efficient light sources. However, in conventional moir\'e lattices, the emission direction of confined modes is typically fixed, and achieving a broad range of emission angles through simple modulation remains a significant challenge. Here, we design and fabricate single-layer moir\'e photonic lattices into cylindrical geometries using a nanomembrane origami technique. This approach enables wide-angle localized-mode emission while maintaining stable single-mode operation and excellent spectral uniformity. The moir\'e supercells support localized flat-band modes under various effective twist angles, resulting in the observation of periodic localized-mode emission over a wide range of azimuthal angles. Our research provides an approach for developing moir\'e light sources on curved surfaces, offering significant potential in applications that demand spatial light control, including three dimensional imaging, light detection and ranging, and topological states manipulation.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Spectral Prediction in MXene-Based Metasurfaces Through Multi-Channel Spectral Refinement and Savitzky-Golay Smoothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prediction of electromagnetic spectra for MXene-based solar absorbers is a computationally intensive task, traditionally addressed using full-wave solvers. This study introduces an efficient deep learning framework incorporating transfer learning, multi-channel spectral refinement (MCSR), and Savitzky-Golay smoothing to accelerate and enhance spectral prediction accuracy. The proposed architecture leverages a pretrained MobileNetV2 model, fine-tuned to predict 102-point absorption spectra from $64\times64$ metasurface designs. Additionally, the MCSR module processes the feature map through multi-channel convolutions, enhancing feature extraction, while Savitzky-Golay smoothing mitigates high-frequency noise. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms baseline Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and deformable CNN models, achieving an average root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.0245, coefficient of determination \( R^2 \) of 0.9578, and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 32.98 dB. The proposed framework presents a scalable and computationally efficient alternative to conventional solvers, positioning it as a viable candidate for rapid spectral prediction in nanophotonic design workflows.</description>

      <title>CSPR-Net: Self-supervised Curved Surface Projection Rectification Network for Geometric Distortion Correction in Non-planar Projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Projecting images onto non-planar surfaces inevitably introduces geometric distortions that degrade visual quality. Traditional correction methods often require tedious manual calibration or structured light sequences to establish pixel-wise correspondences. In this paper, we develop the Curved Surface Projection Rectification Network (CSPR-Net), a self-supervised deep learning framework for automated distortion correction. Our approach employs dual coordinate-based neural networks to learn the bi-directional mapping between the projector and camera spaces. By enforcing a robust cycle-consistency constraint, CSPR-Net autonomously resolves complex geometric transformations without requiring ground-truth deformation fields. Furthermore, a gradient-based loss function is introduced to mitigate the impact of complex ambient light interference and accurately capture high-frequency geometric variations. Quantitative evaluations in physical experimental scenarios demonstrate that CSPR-Net achieves a 20.7% improvement in end-to-end fidelity (SSIM) and outperforms the polynomial baseline by 3.8% and 5.4% in forward and inverse mapping in terms of SSIM respectively, effectively generating high-precision pre-warped images for seamless projection.</description>

      <title>Topological beam stirring in a multicore fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multicore fibers (MCF) are perspective media for telecommunications, sensing, imaging and laser technologies. Here, the effect of beam stirring between weakly coupled cores is observed for sub-nanosecond transform-limited pulses of several kW peak power propagating in ~10 m long 7-core fiber, for the first time to our knowledge. In contrast to low-power domain where the output power distribution in the cores is random with large fluctuations sensitive to fiber disturbances, at high power of the input pulse injected in the central core the output power becomes equalized between the cores with fluctuations reduced to &lt;5% being insensitive to disturbances. Similar behavior is observed in cut-back experiments showing that equi-partition is approached at a distance of ~5 m. The performed modeling describes well the experimental results and clarifies mechanisms of the new effect reasoned by a large nonlinear phase shift changing along the pulse and thereby resulting in statistical averaging over the pulse length of multidirectional power transfer processes between cores, thus leading to the robust equilibrium (equi-partitition for hexagonal MCF topology). At the same time, the combined output beam measured in a far field takes a stable bell-shaped profile instead of speckled beam at low powers, similar to the beam self-cleaning effect in multimode fibers.</description>

      <title>Compact linearly uncoupled resonators for efficient spontaneous parametric downconversion via angular phase matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an integrated platform for efficient second-order nonlinear interactions based on linearly uncoupled resonators and angular phase matching. The proposed architecture confines phase control to a limited section of the device, maximizing field enhancement and effective nonlinear interaction length while simultaneously reducing the overall footprint. As an example we show the results for an AlGaAs-on-insulator structure demonstrating a photon-pair generation rate of 3.16 GHz/mW in the continuous-wave regime and 5.89 MHz under pulsed pumping. The generated biphoton state exhibits a Schmidt number K=1.02, indicating nearly uncorrelated photon pairs. The compact and reconfigurable nature of this approach, together with its independence from material-specific poling techniques, makes it applicable to a broad class of integrated $\chi_2$ nonlinear platforms.</description>

      <title>Enhanced third harmonic response of the PtTe$_2$ transition metal dichalcogenide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the third harmonic response of platinum ditelluride (PtTe$_2$), a Dirac semimetal belonging to the transition metal dichalcogenides class. Due to its topological properties, this material has drawn a lot of attention, particularly because it hosts type-II (super-critically tilted) Dirac fermions in the $\rm A-\Gamma-\rm A$ high symmetry direction. Adopting a low-energy model fitted directly from density functional theory band structure simulations, we calculate analytically the nonlinear conductivity. We observe that third-order optical nonlinearities are efficiently modulated by the cones tilting, which produces a significant enhancement of the nonlinear susceptibility. Our results, besides shedding light on topological transitions of platinum ditelluride, are relevant for future nanophotonic devices exploiting the tunable nonlinear properties of type-II Dirac fermions.</description>

      <title>Chiral phase memory of twisted light through multiple scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiroptical signals, optical responses sensitive to molecular handedness, are rapidly suppressed by multiple scattering, fundamentally limiting their use in turbid media. Here we show that coupling molecular chirality to the topological structure of twisted light generates a protected phase observable that survives strong scattering. When Laguerre-Gaussian beams carrying orbital angular momentum propagate through chiral media, spin-orbit interaction converts circular birefringence into an azimuthal rotation of the helical wavefront. Remarkably, this chiral phase memory persists at scattering strengths that fully depolarize conventional beams, with the rotation magnitude preserved quantitatively between transparent solutions and strongly scattering tissue. The sign of the azimuthal rotation encodes molecular handedness: opposite enantiomers produce mirror-symmetric phase maps even after multiple scattering. Differential measurements between conjugate topological charges isolate the chiral contribution while cancelling achiral background, enabling the resolution of refractive-index changes of order 10-6. These results establish topological phase observables as robust carriers of weak chiral light-matter interactions in complex media, opening new routes for chiroptical spectroscopy and sensing beyond the ballistic-photon regime.</description>

      <title>Impact of crystallinity on the circular and linear dichroism signals in chiral perovskite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral perovskites owing to their broken mirror symmetry exhibit selective absorption of circularly polarized light manifesting a strong circular dichroism (CD). CD spectroscopy has been a key technique to understand chiral perovskites and how these semiconductors achieve chirality at the molecular level. However, there is a debate on whether the observed CD is intrinsic to the chiral crystal structures or is modulated by extrinsic phenomena particularly linear dichroism (LD) and linear birefringence (LB) effects. This work investigates the chiroptical properties of $(R-/S-\text{MBA})_2\mathrm{CuCl}_4$ (MBA = Methylbenzyl ammonium) series by thoroughly studying the contribution from LD and LB to the observed CD signals. The comparison of highly oriented and randomly oriented films exhibits notable LD and LB contributions to the observed CD, which are caused by orientation-dependent electric-field interactions and local anisotropy. Both randomly and highly oriented films exhibit distinct CD responses, with LD--LB effects largely dominating the CD in highly oriented films. This has been revealed by the obvious shift in the observed CD signals to the below-absorption-edge ($\sim 430$ nm) regime and broadening of features. Our findings demonstrate that careful consideration of crystal orientation and structural effects is necessary for appropriate interpretation of CD spectra in chiral perovskite thin films.</description>

      <title>The continuous spectrum of bound states in expulsive potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On the contrary to the common intuition that a steep expulsive potential makes quantum states widely delocalized, we demonstrate that one- and two-dimensional (1D and 2D) Schr\"{o}dinger equations, which include expulsive potentials that are \emph{steeper than the quadratic} (anti-harmonic-oscillator) ones, give rise to \emph{normalizable} (effectively localized) eigenstates. These states constitute full continuous spectra in the 1D and 2D cases alike. In 1D, these are spatially even and odd eigenstates. The 2D states may carry any value of the vorticity (alias magnetic quantum number). Asymptotic approximations for wave functions of the 1D and 2D eigenstates, valid far from the center, are derived analytically, demonstrating excellent agreement with numerically found counterparts. Special exact solutions for vortex states are obtained in the 2D case. These findings suggest an extension of the concept of bound states in the continuum, in quantum mechanics and paraxial photonics. Gross-Pitaevskii equations are considered as the nonlinear extension of the 1D and 2D settings. In 1D, the cubic nonlinearity slightly deforms the eigenstates, maintaining their stability. On the other hand, the quintic self-focusing term, which occurs in the photonic version of the 1D model, initiates the dynamical collapse of states whose norm exceeds a critical value.</description>

      <title>Squeezing-enhanced dual-channel interference for ground-state cooling of a levitated micromagnet with low quality factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cooling the center-of-mass (CM) motion of a macroscopic oscillator to its quantum ground state is a fundamental prerequisite for testing quantum mechanics at macroscopic scales. However, achieving this goal is currently hindered by the stringent requirement for an ultrahigh mechanical quality factor ($Q_c$). Here, we propose a dual-channel cooling scheme based on squeezing-enhanced quantum interference within a hybrid levitated cavity-magnomechanical system to overcome this limitation.
  By synergizing squeezing effects with quantum interference between the magnon-CM and cavity-CM channels, our scheme simultaneously suppresses Stokes (heating) scattering while enhancing anti-Stokes (cooling) scattering.~We demonstrate that this cooling mechanism reduces the critical $Q_c$ required for ground-state cooling by three orders of magnitude, making it achievable in the experimentally accessible regime of $Q_c \sim 10^4$. Furthermore, the net cooling rate is enhanced by nearly 180-fold compared to that of conventional single-channel cooling. This improvement is accompanied by a two orders of magnitude reduction in both the steady-state CM occupancy and the cooling time. Importantly, this enhanced performance remains robust even deep within the unresolved-sideband regime. Our results provide a feasible path toward preparing macroscopic quantum states by actively controlling the cooling dynamics, thereby relaxing the constraints on intrinsic material properties.</description>

Abstract: Optical fibers are crucial for guiding light in various sensing applications. Especially for quantum sensors such as the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond, they enable light control and device miniaturization. However, fluorescence and scattering within the fiber, often referred to as fiber background, autofluorescence, or autoluminescence, can overlap spectrally with the NV centers' fluorescence, degrading the signal-to-noise ratio and thus limiting sensor sensitivity. Here, we investigate the optical spectra of standard optical fibers, considering material dependencies, physical influences, and their fluorescence scaling with excitation power and wavelength. Our results identify spectral components and fiber types with minimal unwanted background signals, guiding the selection of optimal fibers for NV-based quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Geometry-Enabled Radiation from Structured Paraxial Electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a microscopic calculation of spontaneous photon emission by twisted (paraxial) electrons propagating through inhomogeneous, axisymmetric magnetic fields. We construct exact electron states that incorporate transverse mode structure and wavefront curvature by combining the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation with a geometric framework based on Lewis-Ermakov invariants and metaplectic transformations. We show that the evolution of such structured states corresponds to an open path in the space of quadratic forms, giving rise to a geometric contribution to the emission amplitude that cannot be eliminated by gauge choice or adiabatic arguments. The inverse radius of curvature of the electron wavefront emerges as an effective geometric field that enables radiation even in regions where the external magnetic field vanishes locally. This mechanism generalizes Landau-level radiation to nonasymptotic, structured electron states and establishes a direct connection between noncyclic geometric evolution and photon emission.</description>

      <title>Three-frequency helical undulator as a source of photons in composite twisted states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The properties of radiation from a three-frequency helical undulator are thoroughly investigated. It is shown that such undulators can be employed for generating photons in the so-called composite twisted states -- the states that are linear superpositions of modes with definite projections of the total angular momentum, amplitudes, relative phases, and polarizations. We find the explicit expressions and the selection rules for these parameters and establish that they can be governed in a predictable way by adjusting the parameters of the multifrequency helical undulator. In particular, the phases of three arbitrary modes admissible by selection rules in the composite state with definite energy can be made arbitrary by tuning the phases of one-frequency undulators comprising the three-frequency one. By solving Diophantine equations, we obtain simple expressions for the complex amplitude of coherent state of photons emitted by a three-frequency helical undulator and for the average number of radiated twisted photons in the case when the ratios of frequencies of the three-frequency undulator are rational numbers. The development of resonances and the control of composite states of radiated photons are studied numerically confirming the theoretical conclusions.</description>

      <title>Full Schmidt characterization of spatiotemporally entangled states produced from spontaneous parametric down-conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The full Schmidt decomposition of spatiotemporally entangled states generated from spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) has not been carried out until now due to the immense computational complexity arising from the large dimensionalities of the states. In this Letter, we utilize the rotational symmetry of the states to reduce the complexity by at least four orders of magnitude and carry out the decomposition to reveal the precise forms of the spatiotemporal Schmidt modes and the Schmidt spectrum spanning over 10^4 modes. We show that the Schmidt modes have a phase profile with a transverse spatial vortex structure that endows them with orbital angular momentum at all frequencies. In the high-gain regime, these Schmidt modes broaden and the Schmidt spectrum narrows with increasing pump strength. Our work can spur novel applications at the intersection of quantum imaging and spectroscopy that utilize entangled states produced from SPDC.</description>

      <title>Azimuthally polarized terahertz radiation generation using radially polarized laser pulse in magnetized plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An analytical formulation of a radially polarized laser pulse propagating in a homogeneous, magnetized plasma is presented using Lorentz force, continuity and Maxwells equations. Perturbation technique and quasi-static approximation (QSA) have been used to study the generated fields in nonlinear regime. The generated slow, oscillating, transverse electric and magnetic fields having equal amplitude, constitute a radiation field having frequency in the terahertz (THz) range. Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation code FBPIC is used to validate analytical findings. Simulation studies also show that the generated THz radiation field propagates beyond the plasma boundary, indicating coherent electromagnetic radiation emission. Furthermore, the field amplitude scales nonlinearly with plasma density and increases linearly with external magnetic field strength, highlighting the role of these parameters in controlling radiation amplitude.</description>

      <title>A building block of quantum repeaters for scalable quantum networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum networks, integrating quantum communication, quantum metrology, and distributed quantum computing, could provide secure and efficient information transfer, high-resolution sensing, and an exponential speed-up in information processing. Deterministic entanglement distribution over long distances is a prerequisite for scalable quantum networks, enabling the utilization of device-independent quantum key distribution (DI-QKD) and quantum teleportation to achieve secure and efficient information transfer. However, the exponential photon loss in optical fibres prohibits efficient and deterministic entanglement distribution. Quantum repeaters, incorporating entanglement swapping and entanglement purification with quantum memories, offer the most promising means to overcome this limitation in fibre-based quantum networks. Despite numerous pioneering efforts toward realizing quantum repeaters, a critical bottleneck remains, as remote memory-memory entanglement suffers from decoherence more rapidly than it can be established and purified over long distances. We overcome this by developing long-lived trapped-ion memories, an efficient telecom interface, and a high-visibility single-photon entanglement protocol. This allows us to establish and maintain memory-memory entanglement over a 10 km fibre within the average entanglement establishment time for the same distance. As a direct application, we demonstrate metropolitan-scale DI-QKD, distilling 1,917 secret keys out of 4.05*10^5 Bell pairs over 10 km. We further report a positive key rate over 101 km in the asymptotic limit, extending the achievable distance by more than two orders of magnitude. Our work provides a critical building block for quantum repeaters and marks an important step toward scalable quantum networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic methodology for realizing accurate asymmetric all-angle transmission in nonlocal metasurfaces. As a representative example, we derive closed-form susceptibility conditions for exact first-order spatial differentiation of unity numerical aperture, clarifying the role of each underlying balance. We provide rigorous and detailed designs of physically meaningful structures that directly feature such susceptibilities: a conceptual local meta-atom and a realistic nonlocal multilayered printed circuit board (PCB). Importantly, the latter leverages an intricate system of nearfield coupling beyond standard homogenization. Validated in simulations, our results provide a general and modular route to high-resolution asymmetric nonlocal metasurfaces for optical analog processing.</description>

      <title>Test-retest Reliability of Psychophysical Tasks Using Structured Light-Induced Entoptic Phenomena</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structured light (SL)-induced polarization perception presents a promising method for the early detection of macular diseases such as age-related macular degeneration. We investigated the test-retest reliability of a psychophysical task using SL-based stimuli to induce entoptic patterns in individuals with healthy vision. Twenty-eight participants underwent thorough eye examinations to confirm they had healthy eyes and good vision (logMAR BCVA ~0.00). Of these, 25 participants (n=50 eyes) aged 21 to 75 completed two identical tasks separated by 1 to 14 days. Using SL-based stimuli that produced a rotating entoptic pattern containing 22 azimuthal brushes, we measured the retinal eccentricity threshold $R_T$ at which participants could reliably identify the direction of rotation by varying the size of a central obstruction. This threshold reflects the visual angle of the pattern for each participant. We calculated the reliability coefficient (intraclass correlation coefficient, ICC) using a two-way mixed-effects model and conducted a Bland-Altman analysis to assess test-retest reliability. The ICC was 0.83 [95% CI: 0.62 - 0.93] for right eyes (RE) and 0.93 [95% CI: 0.84 - 0.97] for left eyes (LE), indicating good reliability. The Bland-Altman analysis showed a mean difference of -0.32{\deg} (SD: 1.51) and -0.12{\deg} (SD: 1.03) for RE and LE respectively between the first and second sessions, with limits of agreement ranging from -3.28{\deg} to 2.64{\deg} and -2.14{\deg} to 1.89{\deg} for RE and LE respectively, confirming strong agreement and no significant bias. These results demonstrate that SL-based psychophysical tasks are a reliable method for assessing polarization perception, potentially improving screening for diseases affecting macular health.</description>

      <title>Two-color harmonic spectroscopy of ultrafast Dirac electron dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-harmonic generation (HHG), the hallmark effect of attosecond science, is a nonperturbative nonlinear process leading to the emission of high-harmonic light from gases and solids. In gases, extreme driving laser pulse intensities can deplete the ground state, suppressing harmonic emission during the trailing edge of the pulse. Here, we report a similar effect, pronounced ultrafast carrier saturation dynamics and harmonic emission suppression during nonperturbative harmonic generation (NPHG) in a gapless Dirac semimetal -- highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG). Remarkably, HOPG supports NPHG at laser intensities as low as $\sim 10^{10}$ W cm$^{-2}$, facilitated by its vanishing bandgap. Ultrafast carrier saturation strongly modulates the interplay between interband and intraband currents, a key characteristic of NPHG in Dirac materials. Using two-color spectroscopy, we reveal the excitation dynamics of Dirac electron-hole pairs as it affects the emission of harmonics during the presence of the driving laser pulse. The excitation of out-of-equilibrium hot carriers and the concomitant saturation near the Dirac points leads to a marked suppression of interband harmonics and induces measurable temporal shifts. These observations are supported by simulations based on semiconductor Bloch equations. Our finding reveal that field-driven carrier saturation plays a critical role in gapless solid NPHG. We demonstrate the potential of NPHG and HHG as a sensitive, all-optical probe of ultrafast carrier dynamics, offering novel opportunities for ultrafast optoelectronics in Dirac materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the free-space propagation of products of displaced Laguerre--Gaussian beams. Each displaced factor admits an exact representation as a superposition of standard Laguerre--Gaussian beam modes through the optical analog of displaced number states. We reduce the resulting product to a single modal expansion with closed-form weight coefficients and explicit azimuthal selection rules. Working in the reference frame defined by the centroid of the transverse displacements, we evaluate the net orbital angular momentum directly from the modal weights, which provides a criterion to predict transverse rotation. We identify three propagation regimes: no transverse rotation for zero net orbital angular momentum, rigid rotation for products of identical factors with zero radial index, and nonrigid rotation with intensity redistribution otherwise. Our framework enables engineering structured light beams whose transverse rotation encodes propagation information, relevant to depth-sensitive optical microscopy, imaging, and tracking.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the generation of helical electromagnetic radiation in a microwave cavity resonator, achieved by introducing mirror asymmetry, i.e., chirality, through a controlled geometric twist of the conducting boundary conditions. The emergence of electromagnetic helicity is attributed to a nonzero spatial overlap between the electric and magnetic mode eigenvectors, quantified by $\text{Im}\left[\vec{\mathbf{E}}_i(\vec{r})\cdot{\vec{\mathbf{H}}}_i^*(\vec{r})\right]$, a feature not observed in conventional cavity resonators. This phenomenon originates from magnetoelectric coupling between nearly degenerate transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) modes, resulting in a measurable frequency shift of the resonant modes as a function of the twist angle, $\phi$. In addition to the bulk helicity induced by global geometric twist, internal helical corrugations break structural symmetry on the surface, introducing an effective surface chirality $\kappa_{\text{eff}}$, which perturbs the resonant conditions and contributes to asymmetric frequency tuning. By dynamically varying $\phi$, we demonstrate real-time, macroscopic manipulation of both electromagnetic helicity and resonant frequency. Furthermore, we investigate the underlying mode-coupling dynamics of the system, highlighting strong photon-photon interactions.</description>

Abstract: Fraunhofer diffraction plays a vital role in experimental physics not only because it accurately describes the behaviour of light in the usual propagation limit, but also because it links the diffracted light with the scattering object through one of the most important mathematical transformations in physics: the Fourier transform. Acting as a probe in material characterisation as well as used as a tool for particle trapping or sensing, the pattern of interference maxima resulting from the Fraunhofer diffraction through periodic scattering is an ubiquitous routine. In this paper we analyse the Fraunhofer diffraction resulting from the much less studied aperiodic scatter of the light. We provide general conditions for the experimental observation of the peaks of interference maxima featured into patterns that display periodic structures on a number of distance scales. Our theoretical analysis is supported by thorough experimental demonstrations.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate the distribution of single-photon-level pulses from a mode-locked laser source over a phase-stable fiber link, achieving an optical timing jitter of less than 100 as over 10 minutes of data accumulation. This stability enables a fidelity greater than 0.998 between two stabilized 2.1 km long deployed fiber links. Building on time and frequency metrology techniques traditionally used for high-stability optical atomic clock signal distribution, we use time and frequency multiplexing to achieve an isolation of quantum and classical channels of $8 \times 10^{10}$. Our results mark a necessary step towards scalable, high-rate quantum networks with a provable quantum advantage.</description>

Abstract: Tensor network methods strike a middle ground between fully-fledged quantum computing and classical computing, as they take inspiration from quantum systems to significantly speed up certain classical operations. Their strength lies in their compressive power and the wide variety of efficient algorithms that operate within this compressed space. In this work, we focus on applying these methods to fundamental problems in image compression and processing and classical optics such as wave-front propagation and optical image formation, by using directly or indirectly parallels with quantum mechanics and computation. These quantum-inspired methods are expected to yield faster algorithms with applications ranging from astronomy and earth observation to microscopy and classical imaging more broadly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15670v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of geometric phase was applied to initiate the geometric-phase portrayal of electromagnetic scattering by a three-dimensional object in free space. Whereas the incident electromagnetic field is that of an arbitrarily polarized plane wave, the direction-dependent far-zone scattering amplitude is used to define direction-dependent Stokes parameters for the scattered field. Both symmetric and asymmetric Poincar\'e spinors are formulated to characterize the polarization states of incident plane wave and the far-zone scattering amplitude, and two different geometric phases are defined therefrom. Density plots of both geometric phases were calculated for six different homogeneous isotropic spheres with different linear constitutive properties and boundary conditions: dielectric-magnetic spheres (non-dissipative and dissipative), impedance spheres, perfect electrically conducting spheres, charged dielectric-magnetic spheres, dielectric-magnetic spheres with topologically insulating surface states, and isotropic chiral spheres. The incident plane waves were taken to be linearly and circularly polarized, for the sake of illustration. Numerical results revealed that geometric-phase density plots possess significantly richer features than their counterparts for the differential scattering efficiency. The geometric-phase portrayals exhibit enhanced sensitivity to changes in the size and composition of the scatterer, the boundary conditions, and the incident polarization state, suggesting promise for inverse-scattering problems.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Sensitivity to Blackbody Radiation in Spintronic Poisson Bolometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12490v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-sensitivity long-wave infrared (LWIR) detection is crucial for observing weak thermal radiation. Recently, the Poisson bolometer is proposed as a fundamentally new platform for uncooled infrared detection. In contrast to traditional analog detectors, where signal and noise are continuous currents or voltages, the Poisson bolometer has both signal and noise governed by Poissonian counting statistics regardless of the light source. In this work, uncooled infrared detection is advanced toward cryogenic-level sensitivity through the integration of spintronic materials and plasmonic materials. Specifically, a plasmonic absorber optimized for broadband LWIR absorption is experimentally integrated with a spintronic Poisson bolometer to enhance thermal coupling and temperature rise in the sensing layer. The plasmonic absorber exhibits an absorptance exceeding 60\% across the LWIR spectrum, matching the peak of room-temperature blackbody radiation. The device achieves a noise-equivalent temperature difference (NEDT) of 35 mK at a 50 Hz frame rate and multiple results close to or below 100 mK, demonstrating room-temperature performance comparable to the most sensitive uncooled LWIR detectors reported to date. This work opens up pathways to high-sensitivity LWIR detection and imaging applications, including remote sensing, high-speed imaging, and industrial monitoring, while eliminating bulky and expensive cooling requirements.</description>

      <title>A Concept of Two-Point Propagation Field of a Single Photon: A Way to Picometer X-ray Displacement Sensing and Nanometer Resolution 3D X-ray Micro-Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the two-point propagation field (TPPF), a real-valued, phase-sensitive quantity defined as the functional derivative of the single-photon detection probability with respect to an infinitesimal opaque perturbation placed between source and detection slits. The TPPF is analytically derived and shown to exhibit a stable, high-frequency sinusoidal structure (6.7 nm period) near the detection slit. This structure enables shot-noise-limited displacement sensing at ~15 pm precision using routinely available synchrotron fluxes and practical nanofabricated slit/comb geometries, requiring mechanical stability only over the final 0.5 mm. The same principle provides a foundation for future nanometer-resolution 3D X-ray microtomography of bulk samples, potentially resulting in a reduced radiation dose. Two conceptual strategies, a central blocker and off-axis multi-slit arrays, are estimated to lower the required incident fluence by more than one order of magnitude each, yielding combined reductions of two to three orders of magnitude with near-term detector development. The TPPF concept, originally developed in a perturbative study of single-particle propagation, thus bridges fundamental quantum measurement questions with practical high-resolution X-ray metrology and imaging.</description>

      <title>Sub-nanometer 3D morphometric precision of polarisation-resolved wide-field optical extinction microscopy determines the roundness of individual gold nanospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantitative polarisation-resolved optical extinction microscopy of individual plasmonic nanoparticles has recently been introduced as a powerful tool to characterise the nanoparticle's morphology with a precision comparable to electron microscopy, while using a simple optical microscope [Nanoscale 12, 16215 (2020)]. Here we provide a step change by adding measurements for radial polarisation in the condenser back focal plane, probing plasmonic resonances polarised in axial direction. The combined linear and radial polarisation measurements provide a significantly enhanced precision of the retrieved 3D morphology, as we show on defect-free ultra-uniform gold nanospheres of 30 nm nominal diameter characterised by transmission electron microscopy. The measured cross-sections are modelled for an ellipsoidal particle, determining the three semi-axes and rotation angles by fitting the measurements. The material permittivity and surface damping providing the best fit are found. The particle aspect ratio is determined with a precision better than 5%, and the size with an impressive precision of 0.1 nm. Notably, corrections to the Rayleigh-Gans ellipsoid model due to retardation are significant even though the particle diameters are more than an order of magnitude smaller than the wavelength in the medium. Taking them into account improves the shape accuracy.</description>

      <title>Adaptive information-maximization encoding for ghost imaging--A general Bayesian framework under experimental physical constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ghost imaging (GI) has demonstrated diverse imaging capabilities enabled by its encoding-decoding-based computational imaging mechanism. Accordingly, information-theoretic studies have emerged as a promising avenue for probing the fundamental performance bounds of of GI and related computational imaging paradigms. However, the design of information-theoretically optimal encoding strategies remains largely unexplored, primarily due to the intractability of the prior probability density function (PDF) of an unknown scene. Here, by leveraging the ability of recursively estimating the PDF of the object to be imaged via Bayesian filtering, we propose to establish an adaptive information-maximization encoding (AIME) design framework. Based on the adaptively estimated posterior PDF from previously acquired measurements, the expected information gain of subsequent detections is evaluated and maximized to design the corresponding encoding patterns in a closed-loop manner. Within this framework, the theoretical form of the information-optimal encoding under representative physical constraints is analytically derived. Corresponding experimental results show that, GI systems employing information-optimal encoding achieve markedly improved imaging performance compared with conventional fixed point-to-point imaging without relying on additional heuristic regularization schemes, particularly in low signal-to-noise ratio regimes. Moreover, the proposed strategy consistently enables significantly enhanced information acquisition capability compared with existing encoding strategies, leading to substantially improved imaging quality. These results establish a principled information-theoretic foundation for optimal encoding design in computational imaging paradigms,provided that the forward model can be accurately characterized.</description>

      <title>Probing Cosmic Neutrino Background through Parametric Fluorescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We point out that relic neutrinos from the Big Bang may induce the parametric fluorescence in atomic or molecular systems, which offers a novel way to discover cosmic neutrino background. By coherently scattering with molecular energy levels, a massive neutrino can spontaneously ``decay" into a lighter neutrino and an infrared signal photon, i.e., $\nu^{}_{i} + M \to \nu^{}_{j} + \gamma^{}_{\rm S} + M$, where the molecular state $M$ remains unchanged after the scattering. Because the amplitudes of different radiants are matched in phase, the rate is coherently enhanced and proportional to the squared density of ambient dipoles. When the energy transfer from neutrinos coincides with the energy-level difference, the fluorescence will be on resonance. Near the resonance, the rate is proportional to the square of the coherence time $T^{}_{\rm c}$ of the ensemble. For a nominal target volume of $5~{\rm m^3}$ (or $5~{\rm cm^3}$), the signal rate can reach $1~{\rm yr}^{-1}$ for $T^{}_{\rm c} = 10~{\rm ns}$ (or $T^{}_{\rm c} = 10~{\rm \mu s}$). This event rate appears to be very promising in consideration of an even longer coherence time that is achievable in solid systems.</description>

      <title>Radiation of twisted photons in elliptical multifrequency undulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of radiation of twisted photons in elliptical multifrequency undulators is developed. It is shown that helical multifrequency undulators can be employed as a bright and versatile source of photons in the states that are superpositions of the modes with definite projection of total angular momentum (TAM), amplitude, and relative phase. All these parameters of the state are readily controlled by the undulator design. The explicit expression for the amplitude of radiation of a twisted photon from a charged particle in the multifrequency undulator is derived. The energy spectrum of radiation and the selection rules for the TAM projection of radiated photons are described. The symmetry properties of the spectrum with respect to the TAM projection are established. The interpretation to the energy spectrum and to the selection rules is given in terms of virtual photons mediating between the charged particle and the undulator. The results obtained are also applicable to radiation of twisted photons produced by ultrarelativistic charged particles moving in plane multifrequency electromagnetic waves.</description>

      <title>Zero Indirect Band Gap in Non-Hermitian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Zero indirect gaps in band models are typically viewed as unstable and achievable only through fine-tuning. Recent works, however, have revealed robust semimetallic phases in Hermitian systems where the indirect gap remains pinned at zero over a finite parameter range. Here, we extend this paradigm to non-Hermitian lattice models by studying a one-dimensional diamond-like system with gain and loss. We show that the zero indirect band gap in the real part of the spectrum remains stable in the presence of non-Hermitian perturbations and identify the parameter regime in which this robustness persists. We find that the appearance of the zero indirect gap coincides with the suppression of the non-Hermitian skin effect. Our results reveal new connections between indirect gaps, exceptional points and non-Hermitian skin effect, opening avenues for experimental realizations.</description>

      <title>Quantum-memory-assisted on-demand microwave-optical transduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18834v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Microwave-optical transducers and quantum memories are fundamental components of quantum repeaters, essential for developing a quantum internet in which solid-state quantum computers serve as nodes interconnected by optical fibers for data transmission. Although both technologies have made significant advancements, the integration of microwave-optical conversion and quantum memory functionalities remains a challenge. Here, we theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate a memoryenhanced quantum microwave-optical transduction using a Rydberg ensemble. By utilizing a cascaded electromagnetically induced transparency process, we store microwave photons in a highly excited collective state and subsequently convert them into optical photons during the retrieval process. Taking advantage of the optical depth with order of millions for microwave photons in Rydberg ensemble, combined with a minimal storage dephasing rate at the single-photon level, the transducer achieves an areanormalized storage efficiency greater than 90%, a bandwidth of 2.1 MHz, and a noise equivalent temperature as low as 26 K, even in cavity-free conditions. Our findings pave the way for the practical implementation of quantum repeaters based on atomic ensembles in quantum information processing.</description>
