      <title>Attractors and their dimensions for the 3D Fractional Navier--Stokes--Voigt Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dimensions of the attractors for the fractional Navier--Stokes--Voigt equations. These equations, which include a fractional order of the Stokes operator applied to the time derivative, serve as natural extensions and regularizations of the classical Navier--Stokes equations. We give a comprehensive analysis of the upper bounds for the fractal dimensions of the attractor in terms of the relevant physical parameters based on the advanced spectral inequalities such as Lieb--Thirring and Cwikel--Lieb--Rosenblum inequalities. These results extend previous works on the classical Navier--Stokes--Voigt system to the fractional setting and give an essential improvement of the estimates known before for the non-fractional case as well.</description>

      <title>The strongly nonlocal Allen-Cahn problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the sharp interface limit of the fractional Allen-Cahn equation $$ \varepsilon \partial_t u^{\varepsilon} = \mathcal{I}^s_n [u^{\varepsilon}] -\frac{1}{\varepsilon ^{2s}} W'(u^\varepsilon) \quad \hbox{in}~(0,\infty)\times\mathbb{R}^n, ~n \geq 2, $$ where $\varepsilon &gt;0$, $\mathcal{I}^s_n=-c_{n,s}(-\Delta )^s$ is the fractional Laplacian of order $2s\in(0,1)$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$, and $W$ is a smooth double-well potential with minima at 0 and 1. We focus on the singular regime $s\in(0,\frac{1}{2})$, corresponding to strongly nonlocal diffusion. For suitably prepared initial data, we prove that the solution
  $ u^\varepsilon $ converges, as $\varepsilon\to0$, to the minima of $W$ with the interface evolving by fractional mean curvature flow.
  This establishes the first rigorous convergence result in this regime, complementing and completing previous work for $s\geq \frac{1}{2}$.</description>

      <title>Fractional Schr\"odinger-Poisson-Slater equations in Coulomb-Sobolev spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove existence and multiplicity results for the fractional Schroedinger--Poisson--Slater equation $(-\Delta)^s u + (I_\alpha * u^2)u = f(|x|,u)$ in $\mathbb{R}^N$, where $0&lt;s&lt;1$ and $\alpha \in (1,N)$. We seek solutions in a fractional Coulomb-Sobolev space and employ new tools in critical point theory that link the behavior of $f$ at zero and at infinity to the scaling properties of the left-hand side. For several regimes of $f$, we establish compactness for an associated action functional and obtain multiple solutions as critical points, with the number governed by the interaction of $f$ with a sequence of eigenvalues $\{\lambda_k\}$ defined via the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ cohomological index of Fadell and Rabinowitz (rather than the classical Krasnosel'skii genus). In this fractional setting we also prove new regularity results and necessary conditions for the existence of solutions.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of the Energy-Critical Nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger System in ${\mathbb R}^{4}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of radial solutions at threshold energy for a 3-component Schr\"{o}dinger system with cubic nonlinearity in four dimensions. The main difference from the cases previously addressed in the literature is that, in our system, the kernel of the imaginary part $L_I$ of the linearized operator $-i{\mathcal L}=L_{R}+iL_{I}$ has dimension 2. To overcome this difficulty, we carry out a detailed study of the coercivity properties of these operators. We also introduce a new modulation parameter associated with the additional eigenfunction in the kernel of the operator $L_{I}$, which enables us to perform the modulation analysis and establish the uniqueness of exponentially decaying solutions to the linearized equation.</description>

      <title>Waterborne epidemics via a new coupled SIR--Pathogen--Navier-Stokes system: Mathematical modeling, nonlinear analysis and numerical simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water-borne diseases are still a major public health concern, as there are circumstances under which water could act as a carrier of the pathogen, extending their modeling beyond direct contact between hosts. In the present work, we introduce a new mathematical framework, coupling epidemiological dynamics with fluid motion, in order to understand the spatial spread of such an infection. Our model couples the classical Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model with the Navier-Stokes equations describing the motion of fluids, which enhances the existing literature by simultaneously taking into account two aspects: the pathogen being transported by the water currents and the dependence of the effective viscosity of the fluid on the pathogen concentration. We apply the Faedo-Galerkin method and compactness arguments to prove the existence of a global, biologically feasible solution to the coupled SIR--Pathogen--Navier-Stokes (SIRPNS) system. Additionally, we investigate the uniqueness of such solutions in the two-dimensional case. Finally, by constructing a numerical scheme based on the semi-implicit scheme in time and the finite element method in space, we run several numerical simulations to show how infection dispersal, environmental contamination, and hydrodynamic feedback together govern the spatial dynamics, persistence, and eventual decline of waterborne epidemics.</description>

      <title>Representation formula, regularity, and decay of solutions for sub-diffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study regularity and decay properties for the solutions of the Cauchy problem for time-fractional partial differential equations, with tempered initial data, belonging to suitable (weighted) Sobolev spaces, associated with a differential operator on space variables with polynomially bounded coefficients. We obtain a representation formula for the solution, modulo time-regular functions, smooth and rapidly decreasing with respect to the space variables. By means of the representation formula, the (decay and smoothness) singularities of the solution of the homogeneous Cauchy problem can be controlled, in terms of (global) wavefront sets of the initial data.</description>

      <title>Positive solutions of elliptic systems with superlinear nonlinearities on the boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider elliptic systems with superlinear and subcritical boundary conditions and a bifurcation parameter as a multiplicative factor. By combining the rescaling method with degree theory and elliptic regularity theory, we prove the existence of a connected branch of positive weak solutions that bifurcates from infinity as the parameter approaches zero. Furthermore, under additional conditions on the nonlinearities near zero, we obtain a global connected branch of positive solutions bifurcating from zero, which possesses a unique bifurcation point from infinity when the parameter is zero. Finally, we analyze the behavior of this branch and discuss the number of positive weak solutions with respect to the parameter using bifurcation theory, degree theory, and sub- and super-solution methods.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Stability of Solutions to the Forced Higher-order Degenerate Parabolic Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of fourth-order quasilinear degenerate parabolic equations under both time-dependent and time-independent inhomogeneous forces, modeling non-Newtonian thin-film flow over a solid surface in the "complete wetting" regime. Using regularity theory for higher-order parabolic equations and energy methods, we establish the global existence of positive weak solutions and characterize their long-time behavior.
  Specifically, for power-law thin-film problem with the time-dependent force $f(t,x)$, we prove that the weak solution converges to $ \bar{u}_0 + \frac{1}{|\Omega|}\int_{0}^t \int_{\Omega} f(s,x) \, {\rm d}x \, {\rm d}s$, and provide the convergence rate, where $\bar{u}_0$ is the spatial average of the initial data. Compared with the homogeneous case in \cite{JJCLKN} (Jansen et al., 2023), this result clearly demonstrates the influence of the inhomogeneous force on the convergence rate of the solution. For the time-independent force $f(x)$, we prove that the difference between the weak solution and the linear function $\bar{u}_0 + \frac{t}{|\Omega|}\int_\Omega f(x)\, {\rm d}x$ is uniformly bounded. For the constant force $f_0$, we show that in the case of shear thickening, the weak solution coincides exactly with $\bar{u}_0 + tf_0$ in a finite time. In both shear-thinning and Newtonian cases, the weak solution approaches $\bar{u}_0 + tf_0$ at polynomial and exponential rates, respectively. Later, for the Ellis law thin-film problem, we find that its solutions behave like those of Newtonian fluids.
  Finally, we conduct numerical simulations to confirm our main analytical results.</description>

      <title>Jump problem for generalized Lam\'e-Navier systems in $\mathbb{R}^m$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to study a fundamental system of equations in Linear Elasticity Theory: the famous Lam\'e-Navier system. The Clifford algebra language allows us to rewrite this system in terms of the Euclidean Dirac operator, which at the same time suggests a very natural generalization involving the so-called structural sets. Our interest lies mainly in the jump problem for these elastic systems. A generalized Teodorescu transform, to be introduced here, provides the means for obtaining the explicit solution of the jump problem for a very wide classes of regions, including those with a fractal boundary.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness for phaseless inverse elastic scattering problem for periodic structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes uniqueness results of inverse elastic scattering problem with phaseless near-field data in periodic structures in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and periodic/biperiodic structures in $\mathbb{R}^3$. We use a superposition of two point sources in each periodic unit with different positions as the incident field, and measures the phaseless near-field data on a line parallel to $x_1$-axis in 2D, or on a plane parallel to $(x_1,x_2)$-plane in 3D. We first calculate the explicit formula of quasi-periodic/biperiodic Green's functions of Lam\'{e} system in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Then, to establish the uniqueness results, the reciprocity relations for point sources, scattered fields, and total fields are derived. Finally, with the help of Rayleigh's expansion, the uniqueness results are proved. The quasi-periodic/biperiodic Green's functions of Lam\'{e} system in $\mathbb{R}^3$, the reciprocity relations, and Rayleigh's expansion in $\mathbb{R}^3$ are novel results as important by-products in the proof process.</description>

      <title>Inverse problem of determining a time-dependent coefficient in the time-fractional subdiffusion equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the forward and inverse problems for a fractional subdiffusion equation characterized by time-dependent diffusion and reaction coefficients. Initially, the forward problem is examined, and its unique solvability is established. Subsequently, the inverse problem of identifying an unknown time-dependent reaction coefficient is addressed, with rigorous proofs of the existence and uniqueness of its solution. Both problems' existence and uniqueness are demonstrated using Banach's contraction mapping theorem. Notably, this work is the first to investigate direct and inverse problems for such equations with time-dependent coefficients.</description>

      <title>On global regular axially-symmetric solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations in a cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the axisymmetric Navier-Stokes equations in a finite cylinder $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^3$. We assume that $v_r$, $v_\varphi$, $\omega_\varphi$ vanish on the lateral part of boundary $\partial\Omega$ of the cylinder, and that $v_z$, $\omega_\varphi$, $\partial_zv_\varphi$ vanish on the top and bottom parts of the boundary $\partial\Omega$, where we used standard cylindrical coordinates, and we denoted by $\omega= {\rm curl}\, v$ the vorticity field. Our aim is to derive the estimate $$ \left\|\frac{\omega_{r}}{r}\right\|_{V\left(\Omega\times (0,t)\right)}+\left\|\frac{\omega_{\varphi}}{r}\right\|_{V\left(\Omega\times (0,t)\right)} \leq \phi(\operatorname{data}),$$ where $\phi$ is an increasing positive function and $\|\ \|_{V\left(\Omega\times (0,t)\right)}$ is the energy norm. We are not able to derive any global type estimate for nonslip boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Variational models of robust optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces two variational formulations for a model of robust optimal transport, that is, the problem of designing optimal transport networks that are resilient to potential damages, balancing construction costs against the benefit of maintaining partial functionality when parts of the network are damaged. We propose a Eulerian formulation, where the network is modeled by a rectifiable measure and recovery plans are represented by 1-dimensional normal currents. This framework allows for changes in the direction of the transportation in response to damages but restricts damages to be characteristic functions of closed sets. We also propose a Lagrangian formulation, where the network is a traffic plan (that is, a measure on the space of Lipschitz curves) and recovery plans are sub-traffic plans. This approach prescribes the network's orientation but allows for a wider class of damages. We prove existence of minimizers in both settings. The two models are compared through examples that illustrate their main differences: the Eulerian formulation's necessity for an unoriented network to achieve existence, the Lagrangian formulation's ability to handle general damages and its requirement for a positive distance between the supports of the source and target measures.</description>

      <title>Regularized Reconstruction of Scalar Parameters in Subdiffusion with Memory via a Nonlocal Observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper, we propose an analytical and numerical approach to identify scalar parameters (coefficients, orders of fractional derivatives) in the multi-term fractional differential operator in time, $\mathbf{D}_t$. To this end, we analyze inverse problems with an additional nonlocal observation related to a linear subdiffusion equation $\mathbf{D}_{t}u-\mathcal{L}_{1}u-\mathcal{K}*\mathcal{L}_{2}u=g(x,t),$ where $\mathcal{L}_{i}$ are the second order elliptic operators with time-dependent coefficients, $\mathcal{K}$ is a summable memory kernel, and $g$ is an external force. Under certain assumptions on the given data in the model, we derive explicit formulas for unknown parameters. Moreover, we discuss the issues concerning to the uniqueness and the stability in these inverse problems. At last, by employing the Tikhonov regularization scheme with the quasi-optimality approach, we give a computational algorithm to recover the scalar parameters from a noisy discrete measurement and demonstrate the effectiveness (in practice) of the proposed technique via several numerical tests.</description>

Abstract: A simple Markov process is considered involving a diffusion in one direction and a transport in a transverse direction. Quantitative mixing rate estimates are obtained with limited assumptions about the transport field, which might be highly irregular and/or highly degenerate, in particular quite far from satisfying an hypoellipticity type assumption.</description>

      <title>A time-fractional Fisher-KPP equation for tumor growth: Analysis and numerical simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a time-fractional Fisher-KPP equation involving a Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative acting on the diffusion term, as derived by Angstmann and Henry (Entropy, 22:1035, 2020). The model captures memory effects in diffusive population dynamics and serves as a framework for tumor growth modeling. We first establish local well-posedness of weak solutions. The analysis combines a Galerkin approximation with a refined a priori estimate based on a Bihari-Henry-Gronwall inequality, addressing the nonlinear coupling between the fractional diffusion and the reaction term. For small initial data, we further prove global well-posedness and asymptotic stability. A numerical method based on a nonuniform convolution quadrature scheme is then proposed and validated. Simulations demonstrate distinct dynamical behaviors compared to conventional formulations, emphasizing the physical consistency of the present model in describing tumor progression.</description>

      <title>Existence and weak-strong uniqueness of measure solutions to Euler-alignment/Aw--Rascle--Zhang model of collective behaviour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the multi-dimensional Euler-alignment system with a matrix-valued communication kernel, motivated by models of anticipation dynamics in collective behaviour. A key feature of this system is its formal equivalence to a nonlocal variant of the Aw--Rascle--Zhang (ARZ) traffic model, in which the desired velocity is modified by a nonlocal gradient interaction. We prove the global-in-time existence of measure solutions to both formulations, obtained via a single degenerate pressureless Navier--Stokes approximation. Furthermore, we establish a weak-strong uniqueness principle adapted to the pressureless setting and to nonlocal alignment forces. As a consequence, we rigorously justify the formal correspondence between the nonlocal ARZ and Euler-alignment models: they arise from the same inviscid limit, and the weak-strong uniqueness property ensures that, whenever a classical solution exists, both formulations coincide with it.</description>

      <title>Extreme internal waves: gravity currents and overturning fronts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrodynamic bores are front-type traveling wave solutions to the two-layer free boundary Euler equations in two dimensions. The velocity field in each layer is assumed to be incompressible and irrotational, and it limits to distinct laminar flows upstream and downstream. Rigid horizontal boundaries confine the fluids from above and below. A constant gravitational force acts on the waves, but surface tension is neglected. It was recently shown by the authors that there exist two large-amplitude families of hydrodynamic bores: a curve of depression bores and a curve of elevation bores. We now prove that in the limit along the elevation bore family, the solutions must overturn: the interface separating the layers develops a vertical tangent. This type of behavior was first observed over 45 years ago in numerical computations of internal gravity waves and gravity water waves with vorticity. Despite considerable progress over the past decade in constructing families of water waves that potentially overturn, a proof that overturning definitively occurs has been stubbornly elusive. We further show that in the limit along the depression bore family, either overturning occurs or the solutions converge to a gravity current: the free boundary contacts the upper wall and the relative velocity in the upper fluid is stagnant. We also determine the contact angle between the interface and the rigid barrier for the limiting gravity current, giving the first rigorous confirmation of a conjecture of von K\'arm\'an. The resolutions of these questions in the specific case of hydrodynamic bores is accomplished through the use of novel geometric analysis techniques, including bounds on the decay of the velocity field near a hypothetical double stagnation point. These ideas may have broader applications to bifurcation theoretic studies of large-amplitude waves.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of initial boundary value problems for 2D compressible MHD equations in domains with corners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the well-posedness is studied for the initial boundary value problem of the two-dimensional compressible ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations in bounded perfectly conducting domains with corners. The presence of corners yields intrinsic analytic obstacles: the lack of smooth tangential vectors to the boundary prevents the use of classical anisotropic Sobolev spaces, and due to the coupling of normal derivatives near corners, one can not follow the usual way to estimate the normal derivatives of solutions from the equations. To overcome these difficulties, a new class of anisotropic Sobolev spaces $H^m_*(\Omega)$ is introduced to treat corner geometries. Within this framework, the well-posedness theory is obtained for both linear and nonlinear problems of the compressible ideal MHD equations with the impermeable and perfectly conducting boundary conditions. The associated linearized problem is studied in several steps: first one deduces the existence of weak solutions by using a duality argument in high order tangential spaces, then verifies that it is indeed a strong solution by several smoothing procedures preserving traces to get a weak-strong uniqueness result, afterwards the estimates of normal derivatives are obtained by combining the structure of MHD equations with the Helmholtz-type decomposition for both of velocity and magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>The higher-order fractional Schr\"odinger equation with nonlinear local perturbations: Uniqueness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the higher-order fractional Schr\"odinger equation with local nonlinear perturbations and investigate both the forward and inverse problems. We establish both the Sobolev $H^s$ and H\"older $C^s$ estimates for the well-posedness of the nonlinear problem, based on the corresponding estimates derived for the linear fractional Schr\"odinger equation. For the inverse problem, we show that the local nonlinear perturbations can be uniquely determined from the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map, by using the higher-order linearization and the unique continuation property of the fractional Laplace operator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Delaunay metrics form a family of conformally flat, constant fractional Q-curvature metrics on a twice-punctured sphere. They are all (after a M\"obius transformation) rotationally symmetric and periodic, and admit several elegant variational descriptions. We prove that, when s is close to but less than 1, any complete, conformally flat constant Q-curvature metric on a twice-punctured sphere is a Delaunay metric. Along the way, we prove a sharp a priori bound for the conformal factor of these metrics, which may be of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the null controllability of nonlinear wave systems. Initially, we employ a combination of the Galerkin method and a fixed point theorem to establish the null controllability for semi-linear wave equations with nonlinear functions that are dependent on velocities, under the geometric control condition. Subsequently, utilizing a novel iterative method, we demonstrate the null controllability for a class of quasi-linear wave systems in a constructive manner. Lastly, we present a control result for a class of fully nonlinear wave systems, serving as an application.</description>

      <title>Balanced Dynamics in Strongly Coupled Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many mathematical models of interacting agents assume that individual interactions scale down in proportion to the network size, ensuring that the combined input received from the network does not diverge. In theoretical neuroscience, Sompolinsky and Van Vreeswijk proposed in 1996 that, should these scalings be violated (and under appropriate conditions), the system may not diverge but rather approach a balanced state where the inputs to each neuron compensate each other (in neuroscience, where inhibitory currents compensate the excitatory ones). We come back to this observation and formulate here a mathematical conjecture for the occurrence of such behaviors in general stochastic systems of interacting agents. From a mathematical viewpoint, this conjecture can be viewed as a double-limit problem in the space of probability measures, which we discuss in detail, as it provides several possible mathematical avenues for proving this result. We provide some numerical and theoretical explorations of the conjecture in classical models of neuronal networks. Moreover, we provide a complete proof of an asymptotic result consistent with one of the double-limit problems in a one-dimensional model with separable coupling inspired by models of chemically-coupled neurons. This proof relies on asymptotic methods, and particularly desingularization techniques used in some PDEs, that we apply here to the mean-field limit of the network as the coupling is made to diverge. From the applications viewpoint, this theory provides an alternative, minimalistic explanation for the widely observed balance of excitation and inhibition in the cerebral cortex not requiring the assumption of the existence of complex regulatory mechanisms.</description>

Abstract: Given $p\in[1,\infty)$, we provide sufficient and necessary conditions on the non-negative measurable kernels $(\rho_t)_{t\in(0,1)}$ ensuring convergence of the associated Bourgain-Brezis-Mironescu (BBM) energies $(\mathscr{F}_{t,p})_{t\in(0,1)}$ to a variant of the $p$-Dirichlet energy on $\mathbb R^N$ as $t\to0^+$ both in the pointwise and in the $\Gamma$-sense. We also devise sufficient conditions on $(\rho_t)_{t\in(0,1)}$ yielding local compactness in $L^p(\mathbb R^N)$ of sequences with bounded BBM energy. Moreover, we give sufficient conditions on $(\rho_t)_{t\in(0,1)}$ implying pointwise and $\Gamma$-convergence and compactness of $(\mathscr{F}_{t,p})_{t\in(0,1)}$ when the limit $p$-energy is of non-local type. Finally, we apply our results to provide asymptotic formulas in the pointwise and $\Gamma$-sense for heat content-type energies both in the local and non-local settings.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we study the quenching phenomena occurring in a non-local diffusion system of two equations with intertwined singular absorption terms of the type $u^{-p}$. We prove that there exists a range of multiplicative parameters for which every solution presents quenching, while outside this range there are both global and quenching solutions. We also characterize in terms of the exponents of the absorption terms when the quenching is simultaneous or non-simultaneous and obtain the quenching rates.</description>

Abstract: We study the following zero-mass Schr{\"o}dinger-Poisson-Slater equation \[ - \Delta u + \left( \frac{1}{4 \pi | x |} \ast u^2 \right) u = f (| x |, u) \text{,} \qquad u \in \mathcal{D}^{1, 2} (\mathbb{R}^3) \text{} \] with nonlinearity subscaled near zero in the sense that $f (| x |, t) \approx a | t |^{p - 2} t$ as $| t | \rightarrow 0$ for some $p\in\big(\frac{18}{7},3\big)$. A nonzero solution is obtained via Morse theory when the nonlinearity is asymptotically scaled at infinity. For this purpose we prove an abstract result on the critical groups at infinity for functionals satisfying the geometric assumptions of the scaled saddle point theorem of Mercuri \&amp; Perera [arXiv:2411.15887]. For the case that $f (| x |, \cdot)$ is odd, a sequence of solutions are obtained via a version of Clark's theorem due to Kajikiya [J.\ Funct.\ Anal.\ 225 (2005) 352--370].</description>

      <title>Sharp remainder terms and stability of weighted Hardy-Poincar\'e and Heisenberg-Pauli-Weyl inequalities related to the Baouendi-Grushin operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16380v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain sharp remainder terms for the Hardy-Poincar\'e inequalities with general non-radial weights in the setting of Baouendi-Grushin vector fields (see Theorem 2.5). It is worth emphasizing that all of our results are new both in the Baouendi-Grushin and standard Euclidean settings. The method employed allows us to not only unify, but also improve the results of Kombe and Yener [KY18] for any $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$ while holding true for complex-valued functions and providing explicit constants (Corollary 2.7). As a result, we are able to obtain sharp remainder terms to many known weighted Hardy-type inequalities (see Section 3.1). Aside from weighted Hardy-type inequalities, we also recover a sharp remainder formula for the $L^{p}$-Poincar\'e inequality (Corollary 3.5). In the special case of radial weights, we are naturally able to introduce the notion of Baouendi-Grushin $p$-Bessel pairs (see Definition 2.9). Finally, we apply the technique to establish the sharp remainder term of the Heisenberg-Pauli-Weyl inequality in $L^{p}$ for $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$ (Corollary 3.13), which includes the sharp constant. This makes it possible to obtain the $L^{p}$-analogue for $2\leq p &lt; n$ (Theorem 3.17) of a stability result by Cazacu, Flynn, Lam and Lu [CFLL24].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is a growing mechanics literature concerning the macroscopic properties of mechanism-based mechanical metamaterials. This amounts mathematically to a homogenization problem involving nonlinear elasticity. A key goal is to identify the "soft modes" of the metamaterial. We achieve this goal using methods from homogenization for some specific 2D examples -- including discrete models of the Rotating Squares metamaterial and the Kagome metamaterial -- whose soft modes are compressive conformal maps. The innovation behind this achievement is a new technique for bounding the effective energy from below, which takes advantage of the metamaterial's structure and symmetry.</description>

Abstract: We prove integrated local energy decay for solutions of the damped wave equation with time-dependent damping satisfying an appropriate generalization of the geometric control condition on asymptotically flat, stationary space-times. We first obtain a high frequency estimate, which we prove via a positive commutator estimate using an escape function explicitly constructed in terms of the damping around individual space-time trajectories. We combine the high frequency estimate with low and medium frequency results for the undamped problem, then we handle the damping term as a perturbation to obtain local energy decay.</description>

      <title>The weighted isoperimetric inequality and Sobolev inequality outside convex sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a weighted capillary isoperimetric inequality outside convex sets using the $\lambda_w$-ABP method. The weight function $w$ is assumed to be positive, even, and homogeneous of degree $\alpha$, such that $w^{1/\alpha}$ is concave on $\R^n$.
  Based on the weighted isoperimetric inequality, we develop a technique of capillary Schwarz symmetrization outside convex sets, and establish a weighted P\'{o}lya-Szeg\"{o} principle and a sharp weighted capillary Sobolev inequality outside convex domain. Our result can be seen as an extension of the weighted Sobolev inequality in the half-space established by Ciraolo-Figalli-Roncoroni in \cite{CFR}.</description>

      <title>Classical Euler flows generate the strong Guderley imploding shock wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that Guderley's self-similar imploding shock solution for the compressible Euler equations with ideal--gas law ($\gamma&gt;1$) arises from classical, radially symmetric, shock--free data. For such data prescribed at initial time $\mathrm{T_{in}} &lt; 0$, we prove that the flow remains smooth up to a first singular time $t=\mathrm{T}_* \in (\mathrm{T_{in}}, 0)$, where a preshock forms with a $C^{1/3}$ cusp in the fast acoustic variable. From this preshock a unique, initially weak, regular shock is born, whose strength can be made arbitrarily large on a controlled time interval; the front then deforms onto the Guderley shock and implodes at the origin at the collapse time $t=0$. There exists a matching time $t=\mathrm{T_{fin}} \in (\mathrm{T}_*,0)$ such that on $[\mathrm{T_{fin}},0)$ the solution coincides exactly with the classical Guderley self--similar profile, and at $t=\mathrm{T_{fin}}$ the shock trajectory matches the self--similar front to all orders. As $t \to 0^-$, the Euler solution implodes at the center, and continues for $t&gt;0$ as a reflected blast wave, providing a global-in-time unique Euler solution which evolves from regular initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Criticality, splitting theorems under spectral Ricci bounds and the topology of stable minimal hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12631v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we prove general criticality criteria for operators $\Delta + V$ on manifolds with more than one end, where $V$ bounds the Ricci curvature, and a related spectral splitting theorem extending Cheeger-Gromoll's one. Our results give new insight on Li-Wang's theory of manifolds with a weighted Poincar\'e inequality. We apply them to study stable and $\delta$-stable minimal hypersurfaces in manifolds with non-negative bi-Ricci or sectional curvature, in ambient dimension up to $5$ and $6$, respectively. In the special case where the ambient space is $\mathbb{R}^4$, we prove that a $1/3$-stable minimal hypersurface must either have one end or be a catenoid, and that proper, $\delta$-stable minimal hypersurfaces with $\delta &gt; 1/3$ must be hyperplanes.</description>

      <title>Analysis and numerical analysis of the Helmholtz-Korteweg equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10771v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse the nematic Helmholtz-Korteweg equation, a variant of the classical Helmholtz equation that describes time-harmonic wave propagation in calamitic fluids in the presence of nematic order. A prominent example is given by nematic liquid crystals, which can be modeled as nematic Korteweg fluids - that is, fluids whose stress tensor depends on density gradients and on a nematic director describing the orientation of the anisotropic molecules. These materials exhibit anisotropic acoustic properties that can be tuned by external electromagnetic fields, making them attractive for potential applications such as tunable acoustic resonators. We prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions to this equation in two and three dimensions for suitable (nonresonant) wave numbers and propose a convergent discretisation for its numerical solution. The discretisation of this problem is nontrivial as it demands high regularity and involves unfamiliar boundary conditions; we address these challenges by using high-order conforming finite elements and enforcing the boundary conditions with Nitsche's method. We illustrate our analysis with numerical simulations in two dimensions.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent equations and quantum diffusion for the Anderson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Anderson tight-binding model on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, $d\geq 2$, with Gaussian noise and at low disorder $\lambda&gt;0$. We derive a diffusive scaling limit for the entries of the resolvent $R(z)$ at imaginary part $\operatorname*{Im} z\sim\lambda^{2+\kappa_d}$, $\kappa_d&gt;0$, with high probability. As consequences, we establish quantum diffusion (in a time-averaged sense) for the Schr\"{o}dinger propagator at the longest timescale known to date and improve the best available lower bounds on the localization length of eigenfunctions. Our results for $d=2$ are the first quantum diffusion results for the Anderson model on $\mathbb{Z}^2$. The proof avoids the use of diagrammatic expansions and instead proceeds by analyzing certain self-consistent equations for $R(z)$. This is facilitated by new estimates for $\|R(z)\|_{\ell^p\rightarrow \ell^q}$ that control the recollisions.</description>
