      <title>Unveiling baryon charge carriers through charge stopping in isobar collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing a comprehensive (3+1)D relativistic hydrodynamic framework with multiple conserved charge currents and charge-dependent Lattice-QCD-based equation of state, we study the baryon and electric charge number deposition at mid rapidity in isobar Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr collisions at the center of mass energy $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=200$ GeV. Comparing our predictions with upcoming experimental data from the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider will shed light on the existence of baryon junctions.</description>

      <title>Factorized Approximation to the IMSRG(3)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe an approximation to the in-medium similarity renormalization group (IMSRG) method in which we include the effects of intermediate three-body operators arising within nested commutators. As an initial step, we present the relevant equations for two nested commutators, all of which can be factorized so that the method scales like the standard IMSRG(2) approximation, enabling large-scale calculations. We test the accuracy of this approximation scheme, and apply it to the isotopic chains of carbon, sulfur and nickel isotopic chains. We obtain an improved description of spectroscopy, and a reduced dependence on the choice of the valence space. In addition, we provide an explanation of the relative importance of the diagram topologies included, with an eye toward assessing the impact of remaining omitted terms.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the global behavior of equation of state by explicit finite nuclei constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain posterior distribution of equations of state (EOSs) across a broad range of density by imposing explicitly the constraints from precisely measured fundamental properties of finite nuclei, in combination with the experimental data from heavy-ion collisions and the astrophysical observations of radius, tidal deformability and minimum-maximum mass of neutron stars. The acquired EOSs exhibit a distinct global behavior compared to those usually obtained by imposing the finite nuclei constraints implicitly through empirical values of selected key parameters describing symmetric nuclear matter and symmetry energy in the vicinity of the saturation density. The explicit treatment of finite nuclei constraints yields softer EOSs at low densities which eventually become stiffer to meet the maximum mass criteria. The Kullback-Leibler divergence has been used to perform a quantitative comparison of the distributions of neutron star properties resulting from the EOSs obtained from implicit and explicit finite nuclei constraints.</description>

      <title>The unexpected uses of a bowling pin: anisotropic flow in fixed-target $^{208}$Pb+$^{20}$Ne collisions as a probe of quark-gluon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The System for Measuring Overlap with Gas (SMOG2) at the LHCb detector enables the study of fixed-target ion-ion collisions at relativistic energies ($\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}\sim100$ GeV in the centre-of-mass). With input from \textit{ab initio} calculations of the structure of $^{16}$O and $^{20}$Ne, we compute 3+1D hydrodynamic predictions for the anisotropic flow of Pb+Ne and Pb+O collisions, to be tested with upcoming LHCb data. This will allow the detailed study of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formation as well as experimental tests of the predicted nuclear shapes. Elliptic flow ($v_2$) in Pb+Ne collisions is greatly enhanced compared to the Pb+O baseline due to the shape of $^{20}$Ne, which is deformed in a bowling-pin geometry. Owing to the large $^{208}$Pb radius, this effect is seen in a broad centrality range, a unique feature of this collision configuration. Larger elliptic flow further enhances the quadrangular flow ($v_4$) of Pb+Ne collisions via non-linear coupling, and impacts the sign of the kurtosis of the elliptic flow vector distribution ($c_2\{4\}$). Exploiting the shape of $^{20}$Ne proves thus an ideal method to investigate the formation of QGP in fixed-target experiments at LHCb, and demonstrates the power of SMOG2 as a tool to image nuclear ground states.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical aspects of $^{12}$C$(p,{\gamma})^{13}$N reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Carbon-Nitrogen-Oxygen (CNO) cycle is fundamental to the process of hydrogen burning in stars, serving as a pivotal mechanism. At its core, the primary reaction involves the radiative capture of a proton by $^{12}$C, crucially influencing the isotopic ratio of $^{12}$C to $^{13}$C observed in celestial bodies, including our Solar System. We have addressed this reaction mechanism by extrapolating to low-energy cross sections and S-factors with the aid of astrophysical R-matrix. Our investigation aims to shed light on its implications for nuclear reaction rates, thus influencing the abundance ratio of $^{12}$C to $^{13}$C in the cosmic environment.</description>

      <title>Nonperturbative Effects in Energy Correlators: From Characterizing Confinement Transition to Improving $\alpha_s$ Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energy correlators provide a powerful observable to study fragmentation dynamics in QCD. We demonstrate that the leading nonperturbative corrections for projected $N$-point energy correlators are described by the same universal parameter for any $N$, which has already been determined from other event shape fits. Including renormalon-free nonperturbative corrections substantially improves theoretical predictions of energy correlators, notably the transition into the confining region at small angles. Nonperturbative corrections are shown to have a significant impact on $\alpha_s$ extractions.</description>

      <title>Hard processes in multi-TeV ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the ion-collision program at the Large Hadron Collider, plans for its high-luminosity upgrade, and on-going discussions for multi-TeV future hadron colliders, we systematically investigate hard-scattering, Standard Model processes in many-TeV ion-ion collisions. We focus on the symmetric beam configurations $^{208}$Pb-$^{208}$Pb, $^{131}$Xe-$^{131}$Xe, $^{12}$C-$^{12}$C, and $pp$, and we catalog total and fiducial cross sections for dozens of processes, ranging from associated-Higgs and multiboson production to associated-top pair production, at next-to-leading order in QCD for nucleon-nucleon collision energies from $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=1$ to $100$ TeV. We report the residual scale uncertainties at this order as well as the uncertainties originating from fits of nuclear parton densities. We also discuss the propagation of nuclear dynamics (as encoded in nuclear parton densities) into parton luminosities, and ultimately into predictions for cross sections. Finally, we report on the emergence of trends and the reliability of extrapolating cross sections across different nuclei.</description>

      <title>Dihadron correlations in small-$x$ DIS at NLO: transverse momentum dependent fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute inclusive dihadron cross-section in Deep Inelastic Scattering at next-to-leading order (NLO) and small $x$ in the Color Glass Condensate. We focus on the kinematic limit where the hadrons are produced at forward rapidities (in the direction of the virtual photon) and back-to-back in the transverse plane. Our calculation demonstrates that the coefficient of the Sudakov double logarithm for this process is $-\frac{\alpha_s}{2\pi}\left[C_F+\frac{N_c}{2}\right]$ instead of $-\frac{\alpha_s N_c}{4\pi}$ when back-to-back jets are measured in the final state. To preserve the universality of the Sudakov soft factor associated with the Weizs\"{a}cker-Williams transverse momentum dependent (TMD) gluon distribution, we promote the collinear fragmentation functions into TMD fragmentation functions. We then perform the resummation of the Sudakov logarithms through Collins-Soper-Sterman evolution of the TMD fragmentation functions and the Weizs\"{a}cker-Williams TMD gluon distribution. Finally, analytic expressions are obtained for the NLO coefficient functions in the $\overline{\rm MS}$-scheme. These results pave the way towards numerically calculating dihadron correlations at small $x$ at the future Electron-Ion Collider with full NLO accuracy.</description>

      <title>Supernova Electron-Neutrino Interactions with Xenon in the nEXO Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electron-neutrino charged-current interactions with xenon nuclei were modeled in the nEXO neutrinoless double-beta decay detector (~5-tonne, 90% ${}^{136}$Xe, 10% ${}^{134}$Xe) to evaluate its sensitivity to supernova neutrinos. Predictions for event rates and detectable signatures were modeled using the MARLEY event generator. We find good agreement between MARLEY's predictions and existing theoretical calculations of the inclusive cross sections at supernova neutrino energies. The interactions modeled by MARLEY were simulated within the nEXO simulation framework and were run through an example reconstruction algorithm to determine the detector's efficiency for reconstructing these events. The simulated data, incorporating the detector response, were used to study the ability of nEXO to reconstruct the incident electron-neutrino spectrum and these results were extended to a larger xenon detector of the same isotope enrichment. We estimate that nEXO will be able to observe electron-neutrino interactions with xenon from supernovae as far as 5 to 8 kpc from earth, while the ability to reconstruct incident electron-neutrino spectrum parameters from observed interactions in nEXO is limited to closer supernovae.</description>

      <title>Causal fermion states in magnetic field in relativistic rotating frame and electromagnetic radiation by rapidly rotating charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the Dirac field uniformly rotating with angular velocity $\Omega$ and also subject to the constant magnetic field $B$ directed along the rotation axis. The causal states are constrained to the interior of the light cylinder of radius $c/\Omega$. When this radius is smaller than the system size, as in the quark-gluon plasma, the effect of the boundary on the fermion spectrum is critical. We derive the fermion spectrum and study its properties. We compute the intensity of the electromagnetic radiation emitted due to transitions between the fermion states. We study its dependence on energy and angular momentum for different values of the angular velocity and the magnetic field. Rotation has enormous impact on the electromagnetic radiation by the quark-gluon plasma with or without the magnetic field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Utilizing the large quantity of hyperons and antihyperons produced by the decay of 10 billion $J/\psi$ and 2.7 billion $\psi(3686)$ collected at BESIII, the cross sections of several specific elastic or inelastic (anti-)hyperon-nucleus/nucleon rections have been measured via the scattering between the (anti-)hyperons and the nucleus in the dense objects of BESIII detector. The novel method developed in these works extends the research field and opens a new era for the experiments at $e^+ e^-$ colliders. The results of such measurements will definitely benefit a lot the precise probe of the (anti-)hyperon-nucleus/nucleon interactions and provide constraints for the studies of the potential of strong interaction, the origin of color confinement, the unified model for baryon-baryon interactions, and the internal structure of neutron stars. The desirable prospects of corresponding studies in the future Super Tau-Charm Factory (STCF) are also discussed in this report.</description>

      <title>Detailed nuclear structure calculations for coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Any discovery of `new physics' in the neutrino sector first requires a precise prediction of the expected Standard Model cross section. Currently, Coherent Elastic neutrino-Nucleus Scattering (CEvNS) experiments are statistics limited. However, as new and future experiments scale up, it will be necessary to improve the theoretical predictions. Here we review the calculation of the CEvNS cross section in a consistent theory of hadronic currents and compute the relevant nuclear form factors using the nuclear shell model. The uncertainty on the form factors is explored by repeating the calculation for various shell model interactions and with Skyme-Hartree-Fock evaluations of the Weak-charge radii. We then refine the Standard Model predictions for the recent experimental results of the COHERENT experiment. We find that our cross sections are in good agreement with previous predictions, but with significantly smaller uncertainties - by up to a factor of 10. Near-future CEvNS experiments will meaningfully benefit from improved predictions through an increased sensitivity to new-physics signals.</description>

      <title>Love-C relations for elastic hybrid stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars (NSs) provide a unique laboratory to study matter under extreme densities. Recent observations from gravitational and electromagnetic waves have enabled constraints on NS properties, such as tidal deformability (related to the tidal Love number) and stellar compactness. Although each of these two NS observables depends strongly on the stellar internal structure, the relation between them (called the Love-C relation) is known to be equation-of-state insensitive. In this study, we investigate the effects of a possible crystalline phase in the core of hybrid stars (HSs) on the mass-radius and Love-C relations, where HSs are a subclass of NS models with a quark matter core and a nuclear matter envelope with a sharp phase transition in between. We find that both the maximum mass and the corresponding radius increase as one increases the stiffness of the quark matter core controlled by the speed of sound, while the density discontinuity at the nuclear-quark matter transition effectively softens the equations of state. Deviations of the Love-C relation for elastic HSs from that of fluid NSs become more pronounced with a larger shear modulus, lower transition pressure, and larger density gap and can be as large as 60%. These findings suggest a potential method for testing the existence of distinct phases within HSs, though deviations are not large enough to be detected with current measurements of the tidal deformability and compactness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Stimulated Raman Adiabatic Passage (STIRAP) is applied to a system coupled to a bath made of fully-interacting two-level systems, whose dynamics is studied exploiting the generalized Cluster Correlation Expansion (gCCE) theory. We specialize our analysis to a negatively charged silicon vacancy (SiV-1) in non-purified 4H-SiC to assess the possibility of transferring population between two states of the ground manifold, also taking into account the interaction with a spherical nuclear spin bath formed by nuclei of 29Si and 13C. For this system, it is demonstrated that the presence of a small/medium sized bath has no effect on the protocol, finding in particular a set of parameter values for an efficient STIRAP process.</description>

We consider the pNRQCD Lagrangian valid up to the order $\frac{r}{M^0}=r$ and $\frac{r^0}{M}=\frac{1}{M}$ in the double power counting. By considering the Markovian condition and applying the Wigner transformation upon the diagonal spin components of the quarkonium density matrix with the semiclassical expansion, we systematically derive the Boltzmann transport equation for quarkonia with polarization dependence in the quantum optical limit. Unlike the spin-independent collision terms governed by certain chromoelectric field correlators, new gauge invariant correlators of chromomagnetic fields determine the recombination and dissociation terms with polarization dependence at the order we are working. We also derive a Lindblad equation describing the in-medium transitions between spin-singlet and spin-triplet heavy quark-antiquark pairs in the quantum Brownian motion limit. The Lindblad equation is governed by new transport coefficients defined in terms of the chromomagnetic field correlators. Our formalism is generic and valid for both weakly-coupled and strongly-coupled quark gluon plasmas. It can be further applied to study spin alignment of vector quarkonia in heavy ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Unstable Anisotropic Neutron Stars: Probing the Limits of Gravitational Collapse</title>

Abstract: Neutron stars (NSs) are incredibly versatile for studying various important aspects of high-energy and compact-object physics. These celestial objects contain extreme matter at incredibly high densities in their interiors, leading to the risk of instabilities that may cause them to collapse into a black hole (BH). This paper focuses on exploring the stability and gravitational collapse of NSs. For a more realistic approach we have considered the pressure to be locally anisotropic. We utilize the BL-Model to describe the anisotropy inside the NS. The presence of quarks in the core of an NS can heavily affect its stability. Hence, along with pure hadronic EOSs, we have also considered Hadron-Quark phase transition (HQPT) EOSs for this paper's analysis. We subject the anisotropic NSs to radial perturbations to study their stability against radial oscillations. NSs exhibiting imaginary eigen-frequencies are identified as unstable, and their inevitable destiny is gravitational collapse, resulting in the formation of a BH. We consider the interior of these unstable anisotropic NSs to be a non-ideal fluid in a non-adiabatic background in order to study its dynamical evolution during the collapse. We examine the temporal evolution of key properties of NSs, such as mass, density, heat flux, and anisotropy during the process of gravitational collapse. We present an innovative and viable approach to detect such high-energy gravitational collapse events, providing valuable insights into the properties of the static NS before its collapse.</description>

      <title>An Infra-Red Fixed-Point in QCD with a Dilaton in Nuclear Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07339v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The possible consequence of an IR fixed point in QCD for $N_f=2, 3$ in nuclear matter is discussed. It is shown in terms of d(ilaton)-$\chi$ effective field theory (d$\chi$EFT) incorporated in a generalized effective field theory (G$n$EFT) implemented with hidden local symmetry and hidden scale symmetry that the recently measured superallowed Gamow-Teller transition in the doubly-magic-shell nucleus $^{100}$Sn indicates a surprisingly large anomaly-induced quenching (AIQ) of $g_A$ from the free-space value of 1.276 to $\approx 0.8 $. Combined with the quenching expected from strong nuclear correlations, the effective coupling in nuclei, $g_A^{\rm eff}$ would come to $\sim 1/2$. If this result were reconfirmed, it would impact not only nuclear structure and dense compact-star matter -- where $g_A$ figures in $\pi$-N coupling via the Goldberger-Treiman relation -- but also in search for physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM), e.g. $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay, where 4th power of $g_A$ figures.</description>

      <title>Impacts of the $^{12}\rm{C}\left({\alpha},{\gamma}\right)^{16}\!\rm{O}$ reaction rate on $^{56}{\rm Ni}$ nucleosynthesis in pair-instability supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01682</link>

Abstract: Nuclear reactions are key to our understanding of stellar evolution, particularly the $^{12}\rm{C}\left({\alpha},{\gamma}\right)^{16}\!\rm{O}$ rate, which is known to significantly influence the lower and upper ends of the black hole (BH) mass distribution due to pair-instability supernovae (PISNe). However, these reaction rates have not been sufficiently determined. We use the $\texttt{MESA}$ stellar evolution code to explore the impact of uncertainty in the $^{12}\rm{C}\left({\alpha},{\gamma}\right)^{16}\!\rm{O}$ rate on PISN explosions, focusing on nucleosynthesis and explosion energy by considering the high resolution of the initial mass. Our findings show that the mass of synthesized radioactive nickel ($^{56}{\rm Ni}$) and the explosion energy increase with $^{12}\rm{C}\left({\alpha},{\gamma}\right)^{16}\!\rm{O}$ rate for the same initial mass, except in the high-mass edge region. With a high (about twice the $\texttt{STARLIB}$ standard value) rate, the maximum amount of nickel produced falls below 70 $M_\odot$, while with a low rate (about half of the standard value) it increases up to 83.9 $M_\odot$. These results highlight that carbon "preheating" plays a crucial role in PISNe by determining core concentration when a star initiates expansion. Our results also suggest that the onset of the expansion, which means the end of compression, competes with collapse caused by helium photodisintegration, and the maximum mass that can lead to an explosion depends on the $^{12}\rm{C}\left({\alpha},{\gamma}\right)^{16}\!\rm{O}$ reaction rate.</description>

      <title>Zeno Effect Suppression of Gauge Drift in Quantum Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories is a promising tool for the study of many complicated problems including ones with real-time dynamics. For gauge theories, however, there is a major challenge in maintaining gauge invariance during time evolution. Such theories have a full Hilbert space that is larger than the physical space -- the set of states which are gauge invariant or equivalently respect the Gauss law. While an exact implementation of Hamiltonian dynamics starting in the physical Hilbert space will keep the system in the physical space, various types of errors will inevitably produce components outside of it. This work proposes a method of suppressing this gauge drift via the Zeno effect. As in the standard picture of the Zeno effect, our method relies on frequent projection onto the physical subspace. Additionally, a technique is discussed to reduce the speed of the gauge drift, which helps to reduce the required frequency of projections. We demonstrate our method on a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory toy model.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic moments of the odd-mass nickel isotopes $^{59-67}$Ni</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The magnetic dipole and the spectroscopic quadrupole moments of the nuclear ground states in the odd-mass nickel isotopes $^{59-67}$Ni have been determined using collinear laser spectroscopy at the CERN-ISOLDE facility. They are compared to ab initio valence-space in-medium similarity renormalization group (VS-IMSRG) calculations including contributions of two-body currents as well as to shell-model calculations. The two-body-current contributions significantly improve the agreement with experimental data, reducing the mean-square deviation from the experimental moments by a factor of 3 to 5, depending on the employed interaction. For all interactions, the largest contributions are obtained for the $5/2^-$ ($7/2^-$) isotopes $^{65}$Ni ($^{55}$Ni), which is ascribed to the high angular momentum of the $f$ orbitals. Our results demonstrate that the inclusion of two-body-current contributions to the magnetic moment in an isotopic chain of complex nuclei can be handled by the VS-IMSRG and can outperform phenomenological shell-model calculations using effective $g$-factors in the nickel region.</description>
