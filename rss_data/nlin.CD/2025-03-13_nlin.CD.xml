      <title>Towards High Precision Mass Measurements of Two Sub-Neptunes in the K2-266 Planetary System Through Transit Timing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sub-Neptunes have been found to be one of the most common types of exoplanets, yet their physical parameters and properties are poorly determined and in need of further investigation. In order to improve the mass measurement and parameter determination of two sub-Neptunes, K2-266 d and K2-266 e, we present new transit observations obtained with CHaracterising ExOPlanets Satellite (CHEOPS) and Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), increasing the baseline of transit data from a few epochs to 165 epochs for K2-266 d, and to 121 epochs for K2-266 e. Through a two-stage fitting process, it is found that the masses of K2-266 d and K2-266 e are 6.01$\pm$0.43 $M_\oplus$ and 7.70$\pm$0.58 $M_\oplus$, respectively. With these updated values and one order of magnitude better precision, we confirm the planets to belong to the population of planets that has been determined to be volatile-rich. Finally, we present the results of dynamical simulations, showing that the system is stable, the orbits are not chaotic, and that these two planets are close to but not in 4:3 mean motion resonance.</description>

      <title>Large-scale multifractality and lack of self-similar decay for Burgers and 3D Navier-Stokes turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study decaying turbulence in the 1D Burgers equation (Burgulence) and 3D Navier-Stokes (NS) turbulence. We first investigate the decay in time $t$ of the energy $E(t)$ in Burgulence, for a fractional Brownian initial potential, with Hurst exponent $H$, and demonstrate rigorously a self-similar time-decay of $E(t)$, previously determined heuristically. This is a consequence of the nontrivial boundedness of the energy for any positive time. We define a spatially forgetful \textit{oblivious fractional Brownian motion} (OFBM), with Hurst exponent $H$, and prove that Burgulence, with an OFBM as initial potential $\varphi_0(x)$, is not only intermittent, but it also displays, a hitherto unanticipated, large-scale bifractality or multifractality; the latter occurs if we combine OFBMs, with different values of $H$. This is the first rigorous proof of genuine multifractality for turbulence in a nonlinear hydrodynamical partial differential equation. We then present direct numerical simulations (DNSs) of freely decaying turbulence, capturing some aspects of this multifractality. For Burgulence, we investigate such decay for two cases: (A) $\varphi_0(x)$ a multifractal random walk that crosses over to a fractional Brownian motion beyond a crossover scale $\mathcal{L}$, tuned to go from small- to large-scale multifractality; (B) initial energy spectra $E_0(k)$, with wavenumber $k$, having one or more power-law regions, which lead, respectively, to self-similar and non-self-similar energy decay. Our analogous DNSs of the 3D NS equations also uncover self-similar and non-self-similar energy decay. Challenges confronting the detection of genuine large-scale multifractality, in numerical and experimental studies of NS and MHD turbulence, are highlighted.</description>

      <title>The pseudo-analytical density solution to parameterized Fokker-Planck equations via deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficiently solving the Fokker-Planck equation (FPE) is crucial for understanding the probabilistic evolution of stochastic particles in dynamical systems, however, analytical solutions or density functions are only attainable in specific cases. To speed up the solving process of parameterized FPEs with several system parameters, we introduce a deep learning-based method to obtain the pseudo-analytical density (PAD). Unlike previous numerical methodologies that necessitate solving the FPE separately for each set of system parameters, the PAD simultaneously addresses all the FPEs within a predefined continuous range of system parameters during a single training phase. The approach utilizes a Gaussian mixture distribution (GMD) to represent the stationary probability density, the solution to the FPE. By leveraging a deep residual network, each system parameter configuration is mapped to the parameters of the GMD, ensuring that the weights, means, and variances of the Gaussian components adaptively align with the corresponding true density functions. A grid-free algorithm is further developed to effectively train the residual network, resulting in a feasible PAD obeying necessary normalization and boundary conditions. Extensive numerical studies validate the accuracy and efficiency of our method, promising significant acceleration in the response analysis of multi-parameter, multi-dimensional stochastic nonlinear systems.</description>

      <title>Emergent active turbulence and intermittency in dense algal suspensions of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03834v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active-fluid turbulence has been found in bacterial suspensions, but not so far in their algal counterparts. We present the first experimental evidence for turbulence in dense algal suspensions of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. We carry out a detailed analysis of the statistical properties of the flow present in these cell suspensions and show that they are quantitatively distinct from their counterparts in two-dimensional fluid and bacterial turbulence. Both kinetic-energy and density spectra of the fluid flow in algal turbulence show power-law regimes with unique scaling exponents. The fluid velocity probability distribution function (PDF) is strongly non-Gaussian and the length dependence of the PDF of fluid-velocity increments indicates small-scale intermittency. We compare and contrast our results with recent theoretical predictions for active-scalar turbulence and active glasses. Overall, our results highlight that active turbulence can arise, even in absence of orientational instabilities, so it is not limited to bacterial suspensions but it can also be found in many biological systems with free-swimming micro-organisms.</description>
