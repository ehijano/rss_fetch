      <title>Randomized Geodesic Flow on Hyperbolic Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by Gromov's geodesic flow problem on hyperbolic groups $G$, we develop in this paper an analog using random walks. This leads to a notion of a harmonic analog $\Theta$ of the Bowen-Margulis-Sullivan measure on $\partial^2 G$. We provide three different but related constructions of $\Theta$: 1) by moving the base-point along a quasigeodesic ray 2) by moving the base-point along random walk trajectories 3) directly as a push-forward under the boundary map to $\partial^2 G$ of a measure inherited from studying all bi-infinite random walk trajectories (with no restriction on base-point) on $G^{\mathbb{Z}}$.
  Of these, the third construction is the most involved and needs new techniques. It relies on developing a framework where we can treat bi-infinite random walk trajectories as analogs of bi-infinite geodesics on complete simply connected negatively curved manifolds. Geodesic flow on a hyperbolic group is typically not well-defined due to non-uniqueness of geodesics. We circumvent this problem in the random walk setup by considering \emph{all} trajectories. We thus get a well-defined \emph{discrete flow} given by the $\mathbb{Z}-$shift on bi-infinite random walk trajectories. The $\mathbb{Z}-$shift is the random analog of the time one map of the geodesic flow. As an analog of ergodicity of the geodesic flow on a closed negatively curved manifold, we establish ergodicity of the $G$-action on $(\partial^2G, \Theta)$.</description>

      <title>Locally moving groups and laminar actions on the line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.14678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.14678v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove various results that, given a sufficiently rich subgroup $G$ of the group of homeomorphisms on the real line, describe the structure of the other possible actions of $G$ on the line, and address under which conditions such actions must be semi-conjugate to the natural defining action of $G$. The main assumption is that $G$ should be locally moving, meaning that for every open interval the subgroup of elements fixing pointwise its complement, acts on it without fixed points. We show that when $G$ is a locally moving group, every $C^1$ action of $G$ on the real line is semi-conjugate to its standard action or to a non-faithful action. The situation is much wilder when considering actions by homeomorphisms: for a large class of groups, we describe uncountably many conjugacy classes of faithful minimal actions. Next, we prove structure theorems for $C^0$ actions, based on the study of laminar actions, which are actions on the line preserving a lamination. When $G$ is a group of homeomorphisms of the line acting minimally, and with a non-trivial compactly supported element, then any faithful minimal action of $G$ on the line is either laminar or conjugate to its standard action. Moreover, when $G$ is a locally moving group with a suitable finite generation condition, for any faithful minimal laminar action there is a map from the lamination to the line, called a horograding, which is equivariant with respect to the action on the lamination and the standard one, and with some extra suitable conditions. This establishes a tight relation between all minimal actions on the line of such groups, and their standard actions. Finally, based on an analysis of the space of harmonic actions, we show that for a large class of locally moving groups, the standard action is locally rigid, in the sense that sufficiently small perturbations in the compact-open topology give semi-conjugate actions.</description>

      <title>Conjugacy in finite classical groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a classical group defined over a finite field. We consider the following fundamental problems concerning conjugacy in $G$:
  1. List a representative for each conjugacy class of $G$.
  2. Given $x \in G$, describe the centralizer of $x$ in $G$, by giving its group structure and a generating set.
  3. Given $x,y \in G$, establish whether $x$ and $y$ are conjugate in $G$ and, if so, then find explicit $z \in G$ such that $z^{-1}xz = y$.
  We present comprehensive theoretical solutions to all three problems, and use our solutions to formulate practical algorithms. In parallel to our theoretical work, we have developed in Magma complete implementations of our algorithms. They form a critical component of various general algorithms in computational group theory - for example, computing character tables and solving conjugacy problems in arbitrary finite groups.</description>

      <title>CAT(0) cube complexes and asymptotically rigid mapping class groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we study the asymptotically rigid mapping class groups of infinitely-punctured surfaces obtained by thickening planar trees. We present a family of CAT(0) cube complexes on which the latter groups act. Along the way, we determine in which cases the cube complexes introduced earlier by Genevois, Lonjou and Urech are CAT(0).</description>

      <title>Measurable splittings and the measured group theoretic structure of wreath products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11754v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a countable group that admits an essential measurable splitting (for instance, any group measure equivalent to a free product of nontrivial groups).
  We show: (1) for any two nontrivial countable groups $B$ and $C$ that are measure equivalent, the wreath product groups $B\wr\Gamma$ and $C\wr\Gamma$ are measure equivalent (in fact, orbit equivalent) -- this is interesting even in the case when the groups $B$ and $C$ are finite; and (2) the groups $B\wr \Gamma$ and $(B\times\mathbf{Z})\wr\Gamma$ are measure equivalent (in fact, orbit equivalent) for every nontrivial countable group $B$.
  On the other hand, we show that certain wreath product actions are not even stably orbit equivalent if $\Gamma$ is instead assumed to be a sofic icc group that is Bernoulli superrigid, and $B$ and $C$ have different cardinalities.</description>

      <title>On the Iwasawa theory of Cayley graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores Iwasawa theory from a graph theoretic perspective, focusing on the algebraic and combinatorial properties of Cayley graphs. Using representation theory, we analyze Iwasawa-theoretic invariants within $\mathbb{Z}_\ell$-towers of Cayley graphs, revealing connections between graph theory, number theory, and group theory. Key results include the factorization of associated Iwasawa polynomials and the decomposition of $\mu$- and $\lambda$-invariants. Additionally, we apply these insights to complete graphs, establishing conditions under which these invariants vanish.</description>
