      <title>A Field-Mill Proxy Climatology for the Lightning Launch Commit Criteria at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and NASA Kennedy Space Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lightning Launch Commit Criteria (LLCC) are a set of complex rules to avoid natural and rocket-triggered lightning strikes to in-flight space launch vehicles. The LLCC are the leading source of scrubs and delays to space launches from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS) and NASA Kennedy Space Center (KSC). An LLCC climatology would be useful for designing launch concept of operations, mission planning, long-range forecasting, training, and setting LLCC improvement priorities. Unfortunately, an LLCC climatology has not been available for CCAFS/KSC. Attempts have been made to develop such a climatology, but they have not been entirely successful. The main shortfall has been the lack of a long continuous record of LLCC evaluations. Even though CCAFS/KSC is the world's busiest spaceport, the record of LLCC evaluations is not detailed enough to create the climatology. As a potential solution, the research in this study developed a proxy climatology of LLCC violations by using the long continuous record of surface electric field mills at CCAFS/KSC.</description>

      <title>Capturing the Variability of the Nocturnal Boundary Layer through Localized Perturbation Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A single-column model is used to investigate regime transitions within the stable atmospheric boundary layer, focusing on the role of small-scale fluctuations in wind and temperature dynamics and of turbulence intermittency as triggers for these transitions. Previous studies revealed abrupt near-surface temperature inversion transitions within a limited wind speed range. However, representing these transitions in numerical weather prediction (NWP) and climate models is a known difficulty. To shed light on boundary layer processes that explain these abrupt transitions, the Ekman layer height and its correlation with regime shifts are analyzed. A sensitivity study is performed with several types of perturbations of the wind and temperature tendencies, as well as with the inclusion of intermittent turbulent mixing through a stochastic stability function, to quantify the effect of small fluctuations of the dynamics on regime transitions. The combined results for all tested perturbation types indicate that small-scale phenomena can drive persistent regime transitions from very to weakly stable regimes, but for the opposite direction, no evidence of persistent regime transitions was found. The inclusion of intermittency prevents the model from getting trapped in the very stable regime, thus preventing the so-called "runaway cooling", an issue for commonly used short-tail stability functions. The findings suggest that using stochastic parameterizations of boundary layer processes, either through stochastically perturbed tendencies or parameters, is an effective approach to represent sharp transitions in the boundary layer regimes and is, therefore, a promising avenue to improve the representation of stable boundary layers in NWP and climate models.</description>

      <title>Modulational instability of nonuniformly damped, broad-banded waves: applications to waves in sea-ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper sets out to explore the modulational (or Benjamin-Feir) instability of a monochromatic wave propagating in the presence of damping such as that induced by sea-ice on the ocean surface. The fundamental wave motion is modelled using the spatial Zakharov equation, to which either uniform or non-uniform (frequency dependent) damping is added. By means of mode truncation the spatial analogue of the classical Benjamin-Feir instability can be studied analytically using dynamical systems techniques. The formulation readily yields the free surface envelope, giving insight into the physical implications of damping on the modulational instability. The evolution of an initially unstable mode is also studied numerically by integrating the damped, spatial Zakharov equation, in order to complement the analytical theory. This sheds light on the effects of damping on spectral broadening arising from this instability.</description>

      <title>Topological Signature of Stratospheric Poincare -- Gravity Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12191v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rotation of the earth breaks time-reversal and reflection symmetries in an opposite sense north and south of the equator, leading to a topological origin for certain atmospheric and oceanic equatorial waves. Away from the equator the rotating shallow water and stably stratified primitive equations exhibit Poincare inertio-gravity waves that have nontrivial topology as evidenced by their strict superinertial timescale and a phase singularity in frequency-wavevector space. This non-trivial topology then predicts, via the principle of bulk-interface correspondence, the existence of two equatorial waves along the equatorial interface, the Kelvin and Yanai waves. To directly test the nontrivial topology of Poincare-gravity waves in observations, we examine ERA5 reanalysis data and study cross-correlations between the wind velocity and geopotential height of the mid-latitude stratosphere at the 50 hPa height. We find the predicted vortex and anti-vortex in the relative phase of the geopotential height and velocity at the high frequencies of the waves. By contrast, lower-frequency planetary waves are found to have trivial topology also as expected from theory. These results demonstrate a new way to understand stratospheric waves, and provide a new qualitative tool for the investigation of waves in other components of the climate system.</description>
