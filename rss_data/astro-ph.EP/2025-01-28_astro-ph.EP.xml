      <title>Monte Carlo post-processing for radiation hydro simulations of accreting planets in protoplanetary disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is part of a series investigating the observational appearance of planets accreting from their nascent protoplanetary disk (PPD). We evaluate the differences between gas temperature distributions determined in our radiation hydrodynamical (RHD) simulations and those recalculated via post-processing with a Monte Carlo (MC) radiative transport (RT) scheme. Our MCRT simulations were performed for global PPD models, each composed of a local 3D high-resolution RHD model embedded in an axisymmetric global disk simulation. We report the level of agreement between the two approaches and point out several caveats that prevent a perfect match between the temperature distributions with our respective methods of choice. Overall, the level of agreement is high, with a typical discrepancy between the RHD and MCRT temperatures of the high-resolution region of only about 10 percent. The largest differences were found close to the disk photosphere, at the transition layer between optically dense and thin regions, as well as in the far-out regions of the PPD, occasionally exceeding values of 40 percent. We identify several reasons for these discrepancies, which are mostly related to general features of typical radiative transfer solvers used in hydrodynamical simulations (angle- and frequency-averaging and ignored scattering) and MCRT methods (ignored internal energy advection and compression and expansion work). This provides a clear pathway to reduce systematic temperature inaccuracies in future works. Based on MCRT simulations, we finally determined the expected error in flux estimates, both for the entire PPD and for planets accreting gas from their ambient disk, independently of the amount of gas piling up in the Hill sphere and the used model resolution.</description>

      <title>SPOCK 2.0: Update to the FeatureClassifier in the Stability of Planetary Orbital Configurations Klassifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Stability of Planetary Orbital Configurations Klassifier (SPOCK) package collects machine learning models for predicting the stability and collisional evolution of compact planetary systems. In this paper we explore improvements to SPOCK's binary stability classifier (FeatureClassifier), which predicts orbital stability by collecting data over a short N-body integration of a system. We find that by using a system-specific timescale (rather than a fixed $10^4$ orbits) for the integration, and by using this timescale as an additional feature, we modestly improve the model's AUC metric from 0.943 to 0.950 (AUC=1 for a perfect model). We additionally discovered that $\approx 10\%$ of N-body integrations in SPOCK's original training dataset were duplicated by accident, and that $&lt;1\%$ were misclassified as stable when they in fact led to ejections. We provide a cleaned dataset of 100,000+ unique integrations, release a newly trained stability classification model, and make minor updates to the API.</description>

      <title>Novel Dark Matter Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Celestial observations often exhibit inexplicable planetary dependencies when the timing of an observable is projected onto planetary heliocentric positions. This is possible only for incident, non-relativistic streams. Notably, the celebrated dark matter (DM) in the Universe can form streams in our vicinity with speeds of about 240 km/s. Since gravitational impact scales with $1/(\text{velocity})^2$, all solar system objects, including the Sun and the Moon, act as strong gravitational lenses, with their focal planes located within the solar system. Even the Moon can focus penetrating particles toward the Earth at speeds of up to approximately 400 km/s, covering a large portion of the phase space of DM constituents. Consequently, the unexpected planetary dependencies of solar system observables may provide an alternative to Zwicky's tension regarding the overestimated visible cosmic mass. In this work, an overlooked but unexpected planetary dependency of any local observable serves as an analogue to Zwicky's cosmic measurements, particularly if a similar mysterious behavior has been previously noted. Thus, a persistent, unexpected planetary dependency represents a new tension between observation and expectation. The primary argument supporting DM in line with Zwicky's paradigm is this planetary dependency, which, on a local scale, constitutes the novel tension between observation and expectation. In particular, the recurrent planetary dependency of diverse observables mirrors Zwicky's cosmic tension with the overestimated visible mass. No other approach accounts for so many otherwise striking and mysterious observations in physics and medicine.</description>

      <title>The influence of dust growth on the observational properties of circumplanetary discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dust growth is often indirectly inferred observationally in star-forming environments, theoretically predicted to produce mm-sized particles in circumstellar discs, and also presumably witnessed by the predecessors of the terrestrial meteoritic record. For those reasons it is believed that young gas giants under formation in protoplanetary discs with putative circumplanetary discs (CPDs) surrounding them, such as PDS 70c, should be containing mm-sized particles. We model the spectra of a set of CPDs, which we obtained from radiation hydrodynamic simulations at varying Rosseland opacities kappa_R. The kappa_R from the hydrodynamic simulations are matched with consistent opacity sets of ISM-like composition, but grown to larger sizes. Our high kappa_R hydro data nominally corresponds to 10 mum-sized particles, and our low kappa_R-cases correspond to mm-sized particles. We investigate the resulting broad spectral features at first while keeping the overall optical depth in the planetary envelope constant. Dust growth to size distributions dominated by millimeter particles generally results in broad, featureless spectra with black-body like slopes in the far-infrared, while size distributions dominated by small dust develop steeper slopes in the far-infrared and maintain some features stemming from individual minerals. We find that significant dust growth from microns to millimeters can explain the broad features of the PDS 70c data, when upscaling the dust masses from our simulations by x100. Furthermore our results indicate that the spectral range of 30-500 mum is an ideal hunting ground for broadband features arising from the CPD, but that longer wavelengths observed with ALMA can also be used for massive circumplanetary discs</description>

      <title>Characterization of of (98943) 2001 CC$_{21}$, the target of Hayabusa2$\#$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The near-Earth asteroid (98943) Torifune, previously designated 2001 CC$_{21}$, is the flyby target of the Hayabusa2 extended mission, nicknamed Hayabusa2$\#$ (SHARP: Small Hazardous Asteroid Reconnaissance Probe). The ground-based telescope observations offer a key science input for the mission's scientific investigation. During 2022 - 2024 this asteroid was at visible apparent magnitudes brighter than 18.5, allowing for a detailed characterization using ground-based telescope observations. We determined its rotation period $P~=~5.021516\pm0.000106$ h and its absolute magnitude H = 18.78 $\pm$ 0.14 and. The large number of lightcurves allows to estimate its axes ratio, its convex shape and its pole orientation $\lambda = 301^{\circ} \pm 35^{\circ}$, $\beta = {89^{+1}_{-6}}^{\circ}$ and $\epsilon = 5^{\circ} \pm 3^{\circ}$ which indicate a prograde rotation. We report the semi-axis of the equivalent ellipsoid, $a$ = 0.42$^{+0.08}_{0.06}$ km, $b$ = 0.16$^{+0.05}_{0.04}$ km, and $c$ = $0.17\pm0.03$ km. Consequently, the volume equivalent diameter is $D_{eq}$ = $0.44 \pm 0.06$ km . Using observations conducted simultaneously with four broadband filters, we determined $(g-r) = 0.663 \pm 0.022$ mag, $(r-i) = 0.177 \pm 0.012$ mag, and $(i-z_s) = -0.061 \pm 0.032$ mag. Additionally, we found that Torifune exhibits no detectable large-scale heterogeneity. We classified the object using a high signal-to-noise ratio spectrum (over the visible and near-infrared region) as Sq-type in the Bus-DeMeo taxonomy. We estimate a mineralogy similar to LL/L ordinary chondrites, with an ol/(ol+px) = 0.60, a Fa content of 28.5 mol$\%$, and a Fs content of 23.4 mol$\%$. The spectral data indicate a surface affected by moderate space weathering effects.</description>

      <title>The Ophiuchus DIsk Survey Employing ALMA (ODISEA): Complete Size Distributions for the 100 Brightest Disks Across Multiplicity and SED Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The size of a protoplanetary disk is a fundamental property, yet most remain unresolved, even in nearby star-forming regions (d $\sim$ 140-200 pc). We present the complete continuum size distribution for the $105$ brightest protoplanetary disks (M$_{\text{dust}}$ $\gtrsim$ 2 M$_{\oplus}$) in the Ophiuchus cloud, obtained from ALMA Band 8 (410 GHz) observations at 0.05$^{\prime\prime}$ (7 au) to 0.15$^{\prime\prime}$ (21 au) resolution. This sample includes 54 Class II and 51 Class I and Flat Spectrum sources, providing a comprehensive distribution across evolutionary stages. We measure the Half Width at Half Maximum (HWHM) and the radius encircling $68\%$ of the flux ($R_{68\%}$) for most non-binary disks, yielding the largest flux-limited sample of resolved disks in any star-forming region. The distribution is log-normal with a median value of $\sim$14 au and a logarithmic standard deviation $\sigma_{\log} = 0.46$ (factor of 2.9 in linear scale). Disks in close binary systems ($&lt;$ 200 au separation) have smaller radii, with median value of $\sim$5 au, indicating efficient radial drift as predicted by dust evolution models. The size distribution for young embedded objects (SED Class I and Flat Spectrum, age $\lesssim$ 1 Myr) is similar to that of Class II objects (age $\sim$ a few Myr), implying that pressure bumps must be common at early disk stages to prevent mm-sized particle migration at au scales.</description>

      <title>Effects of Thermodynamics on the Concurrent Accretion and Migration of Gas Giants in Protoplanetary Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accretion and migration usually proceeds concurrently for giant planet formation in the natal protoplanetary disks. Recent works indicate that the concurrent accretion onto a giant planet imposes significant impact on the planetary migration dynamics in the isothermal regime. In this work, we carry out a series of 2D global hydrodynamical simulations with Athena++ to explore the effect of thermodynamics on the concurrent accretion and migration process of the planets in a self-consistent manner. The thermodynamics effect is modeled with a thermal relaxation timescale using a $\beta$-cooling prescription. Our results indicate that radiative cooling has a substantial effect on the accretion and migration processes of the planet. As cooling timescales increase, we observe a slight decrease in the planetary accretion rate, and a transition from the outward migrating into inward migration. This transition occurs approximately when the cooling timescale is comparable to the local dynamical timescale ($\beta\sim1$), which is closely linked to the asymmetric structures from the circumplanetary disk (CPD) region. The asymmetric structures in the CPD region which appear with an efficient cooling provide a strong positive torque driving the planet migrate outward. However, such a positive torque is strongly suppressed, when the CPD structures tend to disappear with a relatively long cooling timescale ($\beta\gtrsim10$). Our findings may also be relevant to the dynamical evolution of accreting stellar-mass objects embedded in disks around active galactic nuclei.</description>

      <title>Mass of particles released by comet 12P/Pons-Brooks during 2023-2024 outbursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During its most recent return, comet 12P/Pons-Brooks experienced 14 well-documented outbursts, observed between June 13, 2023, and April 2024, at heliocentric distances ranging from $4.26\,$au to $0.85\,$au. After perihelion, the comet experienced two additional outbursts between June and August 31, 2024, at heliocentric distances of $1.20\,$au and $2.26\,$au, respectively. Using observational data, we developed a numerical model to estimate the mass ejected during these events, focusing on the sublimation of ice through the porous cometary nucleus. The key factors affecting ejected mass estimates are the outburst amplitude and the active surface area during both quiet sublimation and the outburst phases. Pogson's law was used to express outburst magnitude, incorporating scattering cross-sections of cometary agglomerates. The model iteratively determined the mass ejected in observed outbursts, considering various ice types (H$_{2}$O and CO$_{2}$) controlling sublimation activity. Our results indicate that the mass ejected during these outbursts ranges from 10$^{10}$ to 10$^{13}$ kg. Our findings highlight the significant role of surface morphology and thermodynamic conditions in cometary outbursts, providing insights into the mechanisms driving these phenomena and their implications for cometary evolution and dust trail formation. Based on the analysis of observational data, we propose a six-level classification system for cometary outbursts.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Impact of the Dust Torque on the Migration of Low-mass Planets II: The Role of Pebble Accretion in Planet Growth within a Global Planet Formation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although dust constitutes only about 1% of the mass of a protoplanetary disk, recent studies demonstrate that it can exert a significant torque on low- and intermediate-mass planetary cores. We compute and quantify for the first time the influence of the dust torque on the evolution of growing planetary embryos as they move in a protoplanetary disk while growing via gas and pebble accretion. Our global model evolves the gaseous disk via viscous accretion and X-ray photoevaporation, while accounting for dust growth and evolution including coagulation, drift, and fragmentation. Our research indicates that dust torque significantly influences planetary migration, particularly driving substantial outward migration for planets forming within the water ice-line. This effect occurs due to an increased dust-to-gas mass ratio in the inner disk, resulting from inward pebble drift from outer regions. In contrast, for planets initially located beyond the water ice-line, the dust torque mitigates inward migration but does not significantly alter their paths, as the dust-to-gas ratio diminishes rapidly due to rapid pebble drift and the brief timescales of planet formation in these areas. These findings underscore the pivotal role of dust torque in shaping the migration patterns of low- and intermediate-mass planets, especially when enhanced dust concentrations in the inner disk amplify its effects</description>

      <title>Completion of Lunar Magma Ocean Solidification at 4.43 Ga</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystallization of the lunar magma ocean yielded a chemically unique liquid residuum named KREEP. This component is expressed as a large patch on the near side of the Moon, and a possible smaller patch in the northwest portion of the Moon's South Pole-Aitken basin on the far side. Thermal models estimate that the crystallization of the lunar magma ocean (LMO) could have spanned from 10 and 200 Myr, while studies of radioactive decay systems have yielded inconsistent ages for the completion of LMO crystallization covering over 160 Myr. Here, we show that the Moon achieved over 99 percent crystallization at 4429+/-76 Myr, indicating a lunar formation age of 4450 Myr or possibly older. Using the 176Lu-176Hf decay system (t1/2=37 Gyr), we found that the initial 176Hf/177Hf ratios of lunar zircons with varied U-Pb ages are consistent with their crystallization from a KREEP-rich reservoir with a consistently low 176Lu/177Hf ratio of 0.0167 that emerged ~140 Myr after solar system formation. The previously proposed younger model age of 4.33 Ga for the source of mare basalts (240 Myr after solar system formation) might reflect the timing of a large impact. Our results demonstrate that lunar magma ocean crystallization took place while the Moon was still battered by planetary embryos and planetesimals leftover from the main stage of planetary accretion. Study of Lu-Hf model ages for samples brought back from the South Pole-Aitken basin will help to assess the lateral continuity of KREEP and further understand its significance in the early history of the Moon.</description>

      <title>A Data-Driven M Dwarf Model and Detailed Abundances for $\sim$17,000 M Dwarfs in SDSS-V</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cool temperatures of M dwarf atmospheres enable complex molecular chemistry, making robust characterization of M dwarf compositions a long-standing challenge. Recent modifications to spectral synthesis pipelines have enabled more accurate modeling of M dwarf atmospheres, but these methods are too slow for characterizing more than a handful of stars at a time. Data-driven methods such as The Cannon are viable alternatives, and can harness the information content of many M dwarfs from large spectroscopic surveys. Here, we train The Cannon on M dwarfs with FGK binary companions from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-V/Milky Way Mapper (SDSS-V/MWM), with spectra from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE). The FGK-M pairs are assumed to be chemically homogeneous and span $-$0.56 $&lt;$ [Fe/H] $&lt;$ 0.31 dex. The resulting model is capable of inferring M dwarf $T_{\textrm{eff}}$ and elemental abundances for Fe, Mg, Al, Si, C, N, O, Ca, Ti, Cr, and Ni with median uncertainties of 13 K and 0.018$-$0.029 dex, respectively. We test the model by verifying that it reproduces reported abundance values of M dwarfs in open clusters and benchmark M dwarf datasets, as well as expected metallicity trends from stellar evolution. We apply the model to 16,590 M dwarfs in SDSS-V/MWM and provide their detailed abundances in our accompanying catalog.</description>

      <title>Redistribution of ices between grain populations in protostellar envelopes. Only the coldest grains get ices</title>

Abstract: Context. Matter that falls onto a protoplanetary disk (PPD) from a protostellar envelope is heated before it cools again. This induces sublimation and subsequent re-adsorption of ices that accumulated during the prestellar phase. Aims. We explore the fate of ices on multiple-sized dust grains in a parcel of infalling matter. Methods. A comprehensive kinetic chemical model using five grain-size bins with different temperatures was applied for an infalling parcel. The parcel was heated to 150 K and then cooled over a total timescale of 20 kyr. Effects on ice loss and re-accumulation by the changed gas density, the maximum temperature, the irradiation intensity, the size-dependent grain temperature trend, and the distribution of the ice mass among the grain-size bins were investigated. Results. A massive selective redistribution of ices exclusively onto the surface of the coldest grain-size bin occurs in all models. The redistribution starts already during the heating stage, where ices that are sublimated from warmer grains re-adsorb onto colder grains before complete sublimation. During the cooling stage, the sublimated molecules re-freeze again onto the coldest grains. In the case of full sublimation, this re-adsorption is delayed and occurs at lower temperatures because a bare grain surface has lower molecular desorption energies in our model. Conclusions. Most protostellar envelope grains enter the PPD ice poor (bare). Ices are carried by a single coldest grain-size bin, here representing 12 % of the total grain surface area. This bare ice-grain dualism can affect the rate of the grain coagulation. The ice components are stratified on the grains according to their sublimation temperatures.</description>

      <title>Disks around young free-floating planetary-mass objects: Ultradeep Spitzer imaging of IC348</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protoplanetary disks have been found around free-floating objects with masses comparable to those of giant planets. The frequency and properties of these disks around planetary-mass objects are still debated. Here we present ultradeep mid-infrared images for the young cluster IC348, obtained through stacking of time series images from Spitzer. We measure fluxes at 3.6 and 4.5 microns for known free-floating planetary-mass objects (FFPMOs, spectral type M9 or later) in this cluster. By comparing the observed infrared spectral energy distributions with photospheric templates, we identify six planetary-mass objects with disks, plus three which may or may not have a disk. This corresponds to a disk fraction of 46% (34-59%). The disk fraction among planetary-mass objects is comparable to more massive brown dwarfs. We show the disk fraction among free-floating planetary-mass objects as a function of age, demonstrating that these objects retain disks for several million years, similar to low-mass stars and brown dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Will nanodust reappear in STEREO/WAVES data?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanodust particles produced near the Sun by collisional breakup of larger grains are accelerated in the magnetised solar wind and reach high speeds outwards of 1 AU. Vaporisation and ionisation of fast dust grains impacting a spacecraft produce voltage pulses on wave instruments that enable them to act as dust detectors. Wave instruments on STEREO and on Cassini during its cruise phase detected a highly variable flux of fast nanodust. Both detections took place when the orientation of the solar magnetic dipole produced an interplanetary electric field that focused nanoparticles towards the heliospheric current sheet (HCS) - a geometry that is recurring because of the periodicity of solar activity.</description>

      <title>The JWST Early Release Science Program for Direct Observations of Exoplanetary Systems III: Aperture Masking Interferometric Observations of the star HIP 65426 at 3.8 um</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11508v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present aperture masking interferometry (AMI) observations of the star HIP 65426 at $3.8\,\rm{\mu m}$ as a part of the JWST Direct Imaging Early Release Science (ERS) program obtained using the Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (NIRISS) instrument. This mode provides access to very small inner working angles (even separations slightly below the Michelson limit of $0.5\lambda/D$ for an interferometer), which are inaccessible with the classical inner working angles of the JWST coronagraphs. When combined with JWST's unprecedented infrared sensitivity, this mode has the potential to probe a new portion of parameter space across a wide array of astronomical observations. Using this mode, we are able to achieve a $5\sigma$ contrast of $\Delta m{\sim}7.62{\pm}0.13$ mag relative to the host star at separations ${\gtrsim}0.07{"}$, and the contrast deteriorates steeply at separations ${\lesssim}0.07{"}$. However, we detect no additional companions interior to the known companion HIP 65426 b (at separation ${\sim}0.82{"}$ or, $87^{+108}_{-31}\,\rm{au}$). Our observations thus rule out companions more massive than $10{-}12\,\rm{M_{Jup}}$ at separations ${\sim}10{-}20\,\rm{au}$ from HIP 65426, a region out of reach of ground or space-based coronagraphic imaging. These observations confirm that the AMI mode on JWST is sensitive to planetary mass companions at close-in separations (${\gtrsim}0.07{"}$), even for thousands of more distant stars at $\sim$100 pc, in addition to the stars in the nearby young moving groups as stated in previous works. This result will allow the planning and successful execution of future observations to probe the inner regions of nearby stellar systems, opening an essentially unexplored parameter space.</description>
