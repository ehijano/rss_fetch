      <title>First 2D electron density measurements using Coherence Imaging Spectroscopy in the MAST-U Super-X divertor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 2D profiles of electron density and neutral temperature are inferred from multi-delay Coherence Imaging Spectroscopy data of divertor plasmas using a non-linear inversion technique. The inference is based on imaging the spectral line-broadening of Balmer lines and can differentiate between the Doppler and Stark broadening components by measuring the fringe contrast at multiple interferometric delays simultaneously. The model has been applied to images generated from simulated density profiles to evaluate its performance. Typical mean absolute errors of 30 percent are achieved, which are consistent with Monte Carlo uncertainty propagation accounting for noise, uncertainties in the calibrations, and in the model inputs. The analysis has been tested on experimental data from the MAST-U Super-X divertor, where it infers typical electron densities of 2-3 $10^{19}$ m$^{-3}$ and neutral temperatures of 0-2 eV during beam-heated L-mode discharges. The results are shown to be in reasonable agreement with the other available diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Scale Separation Effects on Simulations of Plasma Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding plasma turbulence requires a synthesis of experiments, observations, theory, and simulations. In the case of kinetic plasmas such as the solar wind, the lack of collisions renders the fluid closures such as viscosity meaningless and one needs to resort to higher order fluid models or kinetic models. Typically, the computational expense in such models is managed by simulating artificial values of certain parameters such as the ratio of the Alfv\'en speed to the speed of light ($v_A/c$) or the relative mass ratio of ions and electrons ($m_i/m_e$). Although, typically care is taken to use values as close as possible to realistic values within the computational constraints, these artificial values could potentially introduce unphysical effects. These unphysical effects could be significant at sub-ion scales, where kinetic effects are the most important. In this paper, we use the ten-moment fluid model in the Gkeyll framework to perform controlled numerical experiments, systematically varying the ion-electron mass ratio from a small value down to the realistic proton-electron mass ratio. We show that the unphysical mass ratio has a significant effect on the kinetic range dynamics as well as the heating of both the plasma species. The dissipative process for both ions and electrons become more compressive in nature, although the ions remain nearly incompressible in all cases. The electrons move from being dominated by incompressive viscous like heating/dissipation, to very compressive heating/dissipation dominated by compressions/rarefactions. While the heating change is significant for the electrons, a mass ratio of $m_i/m_e \sim 250$ captures the asymptotic behaviour of electron heating.</description>

      <title>Saturation of the compression of two interacting magnetic flux tubes evidenced in the laboratory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactions between magnetic fields advected by matter play a fundamental role in the Universe at all possible scales. A crucial role these interactions play is in making turbulent fields highly anisotropic, leading to observed ordered fields. These in turn, are important evolutionary factors for all the systems within and around. Despite scant evidence, due to the difficulty in measuring even near-Earth events, the magnetic field compression factor in these interactions, measured at very varied scales, is limited to a few. However, compressing matter in which a magnetic field is embedded, results in compression up to several thousands. Here we show, using laboratory experiments and matching three-dimensional hybrid simulations, that there is indeed a very effective saturation of the compression when two independent magnetic fields are advected by plasmas encounter. We found that the observed saturation is linked to a build-up of the magnetic pressure at the inflows encounter point, which decelerates them and thereby stops further compression. Moreover, the growth of an electric field, induced by the incoming flows and the magnetic field, acts in redirecting the inflows transversely, further hampering field compression.</description>

      <title>Directional intense terahertz radiation driven by abruptly autofocusing lasers in air</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-color laser induced plasma filamentation in air could serve as tabletop sources of broadband terahertz (THz) pulses. Ubiquitous air in the earth facilitates its widespread utilities, particularly, in wireless communication and remote sensing, exploiting the unique advantage of the air-based scheme that the THz sources can be delivered over standoff distances via the pump laser propagation in air. However, the THz emission pattern inevitably has a conical angular profile with a dip in the propagation axis, therefore, THz energy concentration, propagation directionality, and accuracy of signal demodulation are significantly impaired, greatly limiting its direct applications. Here, we successfully eliminate the unfavorable conical profile by experiments and meanwhile enhance THz directionality and intensity by 17 folds by use of abruptly-autofocusing laser beams. Our theory and simulations show that these observations are attributed to efficient suppression of the dephasing effect appearing in previous investigations with ordinary Gaussian laser beams. This scheme is easily accessible since the abruptly-autofocusing beam can be achieved by imposing a spatial light modulator on the input Gaussian beam. This study solves a long-standing problem in the two-color laser scheme and clarifies the underlying physics of the conical angular profile formation.</description>

      <title>Calibration of hydrogen atoms measurement by femtosecond two-photon laser induced fluorescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new calibration method for H-fs-TALIF is proposed, and the ratio of two-photon absorption cross-sections $\sigma^{(2)}$ for atomic hydrogen (H) and krypton (Kr) is determined for the broadband emission of a femtosecond laser system. The obtained estimate of the ratio of two-photon absorption cross-sections $\sigma^{(2)}$ for H and Kr $\sigma^{(2)}$(Kr)/$\sigma^{(2)}$(H) = $0.034\pm 0.006$, which is almost twenty times lower than the values previously obtained using narrowband nanosecond lasers. This difference is explained by the significantly different spectral width of the excitation line, and demonstrates the need for independent calibration of the TALIF measurements in the femtosecond range.</description>
