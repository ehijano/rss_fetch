      <title>Optimizaci\'on del sistema de iluminaci\'on y proyecci\'on para un sensor multiparam\'etrico acusto-\'optico</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In previous works we presented a novel multiparametric sensor to simultaneously measure the refractive index and the speed of sound in a liquid by means of the acousto-optic effect. The sensor requires an illumination system that expands the laser beam so that it interacts effectively with the liquid under study. Also, a projection system is necessary in order to adequately capture the diffraction pattern at the cell exit. In this article, we present the optimization of the sensor illumination and projection system using the optical design computational tool Zemax OpticStudio. The considered range of refractive indices of the liquid samples is between 1.33 and 1.51. The results show a correct expansion of the incident beam on the cell, and the projection system achieves an image with very few aberrations and an adequate angular separation between the maxima of the diffraction pattern. From the resulting dimensions of the sensor after the illumination and projection system optimization, we affirm that it is compact and portable.</description>

      <title>On-Chip Vectorial Structured Light Manipulation via Inverse Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On-chip structured light, with potentially infinite complexity, has emerged as a linchpin in the realm of integrated photonics. However, the realization of arbitrarily tailoring a multitude of light field dimensions in complex media remains a challenge1, Through associating physical light fields and mathematical function spaces by introducing a mapping operator, we proposed a data-driven inverse design method to precisely manipulate between any two structured light fields in the on-chip high-dimensional Hilbert space. To illustrate, light field conversion in on-chip topological photonics was achieved. High-performance topological coupling devices with minimal insertion loss and customizable topological routing devices were designed and realized. Our method provides a new paradigm to enable precise manipulation over the on-chip vectorial structured light and paves the way for the realization of complex photonic functions.</description>

      <title>Gate-Tunable Multi-Band van der Waals Photodetector and Polarization Sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A single photodetector with tunable detection wavelengths and polarization sensitivity can potentially be harnessed for diverse optical applications ranging from imaging and sensing to telecommunications. Such a device will require the combination of multiple material systems with different structures, bandgaps, and photoelectrical responses, which is extremely difficult to engineer using traditional epitaxial films. Here, we develop a multi-functional and high-performance photosensor using all van der Waals materials. The device features a gate-tunable spectral response that is switchable between near-infrared/visible and short-/mid-wave infrared, as well as broadband operation, at room temperature. The linear polarization sensitivity in the telecommunications O-band can also be directly modulated between horizontal, vertical, and nonpolarizing modes. These effects originate from the balance of photocurrent generation in two of the active layers that can be manipulated by an electric field. The photodetector features high detectivity (&gt;109 cmHz1/2W-1) together with fast operation speed (~ 1 MHz) and can be further exploited for dual visible and infrared imaging.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial structuring of materials at subwavelength scales underlies the concept of metamaterials possessing exotic properties beyond those of the constituent media. Temporal modulation of material parameters enables further functionalities. Here, we show that high-frequency oscillations of spatially uniform magnetization generate an effective dynamic axion field embedding the amplitude and phase of magnetization oscillations. This allows one to map ultrafast magnetization dynamics using a probe signal with much lower frequency.</description>

      <title>Asymmetrical estimator for training grey-box deep photonic neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physical neural networks (PNNs) are emerging paradigms for neural network acceleration due to their high-bandwidth, in-propagation analogue processing. Despite the advantages of PNN for inference, training remains a challenge. The imperfect information of the physical transformation means the failure of conventional gradient-based updates from backpropagation (BP). Here, we present the asymmetrical training (AT) method, which treats the PNN structure as a grey box. AT performs training while only knowing the last layer output and neuron topological connectivity of a deep neural network structure, not requiring information about the physical control-transformation mapping. We experimentally demonstrated the AT method on deep grey-box PNNs implemented by uncalibrated photonic integrated circuits (PICs), improving the classification accuracy of Iris flower and modified MNIST hand-written digits from random guessing to near theoretical maximum. We also showcased the consistently enhanced performance of AT over BP for different datasets, including MNIST, fashion-MNIST, and Kuzushiji-MNIST. The AT method demonstrated successful training with minimal hardware overhead and reduced computational overhead, serving as a robust light-weight training alternative to fully explore the advantages of physical computation.</description>

      <title>Biclustering a dataset using photonic quantum computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biclustering is a problem in machine learning and data mining that seeks to group together rows and columns of a dataset according to certain criteria. In this work, we highlight the natural relation that quantum computing models like boson and Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) have to this problem. We first explore the use of boson sampling to identify biclusters based on matrix permanents. We then propose a heuristic that finds clusters in a dataset using Gaussian boson sampling by (i) converting the dataset into a bipartite graph and then (ii) running GBS to find the densest sub-graph(s) within the larger bipartite graph. Our simulations for the above proposed heuristics show promising results for future exploration in this area.</description>

      <title>Ponderomotive electron physics captured in single-fluid extended MHD model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The well-known ponderomotive force, arising from the interaction of matter and light, has critical implications across a broad range of fields from laser fusion and astrophysics to laser diagnostics and even pulsed-power experiments. This pseudo-potential pushes electrons, which through coulomb forces causes ion density modulations that can steepen with profound implications. When used intentionally, density modulations can be used for plasma gratings, which are essential for optical components operating in extreme conditions for next generation lasers. They can also be important for plasma confinement and particle trapping, which can even impact magnetic confinement in fusion devices. The ponderomotive potential also leads to laser self-focusing, complicating laser diagnostics. In laser fusion, the force exacerbates challenges posed by stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) and crossed beam energy transfer (CBET), both of which destabilize the fusion process. It even plays an astrophysical role in the filamentation of fast radio bursts in the relativistic winds of magnetars. Since the ponderomotive force primarily effects electron dynamics, multi-fluid/particle codes or additional ansatz are required to include its effects. This paper demonstrates that by including electron effects on an ion timescale with a 1-fluid, 2-energy extended magnetohydrodynamics (XMHD) model, ponderomotive effects are also naturally present. We introduce the theory for these dynamics and demonstrate their presence with 1-D pencil-like simulations.</description>

      <title>Quantum Optimal Control of Squeezing in Cavity Optomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Squeezing is a non-classical feature of quantum states that is a useful resource, for example in quantum sensing of mechanical forces. Here, we show how to use optimal control theory to maximize squeezing in an optomechanical setup with two external drives and determine how fast the mechanical mode can be squeezed. For the autonomous drives considered here, we find the inverse cavity decay to lower-bound the protocol duration. At and above this limit, we identify a family of protocols leveraging a two-stage control strategy, where the mechanical mode is cooled before it is squeezed. Identification of the control strategy allows for two important insights - to determine the factors that limit squeezing and to simplify the time-dependence of the external drives, making our protocol readily applicable in experiments.</description>

      <title>Bound State in the Continuum Supported Asymmetric Dome-shaped Dielectric Metasurface: Crossing and Avoided Crossing of Transmission with Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work examines a symmetry-protected bound state in the continuum (BIC) supported unique all-dielectric dome-shaped metasurface (MS). The simple unit MS is made up of four dome-shaped nanobars of silicon in the top layer and silica glass as the substrate. Two strong transmission dips denoted as an electric dipole (ED) and magnetic dipole (MD) quasi-BIC with a high Q-factor that surpasses the value of 104 are observed after the symmetry between the nanobars is broken by a small angle from their initial position. A crossover between the ED and MD resonances is noticed when the periodicity of the MS is changed in the y direction. In addition, transmission spectra show the avoided-crossing phenomenon of dipole quasi-BIC resonances when the superstrate's refractive index (RI) is reduced from its initial value. Other widely used dielectric materials are additionally employed in dome-shaped nanobars to evaluate their performances in terms of sharpness and near-zero transmission. Moreover, Other forms of symmetry breakdown such as diagonal width and length asymmetry have been investigated for their impact on the Q-factor. Finally, we have demonstrated two significant applications, including refractometric glucose sensing and third harmonic generation (THG). Our dome-shaped MS is roughly 300 times more efficient at generating third harmonics than a flat rectangular silicon film MS. Our proposed BIC and q-BIC-facilitated MS may provide a method for enhancing the functionality of biological sensors, multimodal lasing, optical switches, and nonlinear optics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08814v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Open systems with balanced gain and loss, described by parity-time PT-symmetric Hamiltonians have been deeply explored over the past decade. Most explorations are limited to finite discrete models (in real or reciprocal spaces) or continuum problems in one dimension. As a result, these models do not leverage the complexity and variability of two-dimensional continuum problems on a compact support. Here, we investigate eigenvalues of the Schrodinger equation on a disk with zero boundary condition, in the presence of constant, PT-symmetric, gain-loss potential that is confined to two mirror-symmetric disks. We find a rich variety of exceptional points, re-entrant PT-symmetric phases, and a non-monotonic dependence of the PT-symmetry breaking threshold on the system parameters. By comparing results of two model variations, we show that this simple model of a multi-core fiber supports propagating modes in the presence of gain and loss.</description>

Abstract: Space-time wave packets (STWPs) are a new class of pulsed optical beams with many unique and intriguing attributes, including propagation invariance and tunable group velocity in linear optical media. STWPs are a form of spatiotemporally structured light, so their synthesis poses challenges that are not shared by conventional monochromatic structured light fields. We present here a detailed description of the synthesis of STWPs that are localized along one transverse dimension and uniform along the other; i.e., space-time light sheets. We also describe the main characterization schemes needed for benchmarking the unique properties of space-time light sheets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the fundamental principles of light-matter interaction are well-understood and drive countless technologies, the world of multiphoton processes remains a fascinating puzzle, holding the potential to drastically alter our understanding of how light interacts with matter at its most basic level. This rich interplay of light and matter unveils novel phenomena that can be harnessed for sensing with exceptional precision, as exemplified by multiphoton quantum sensing. This thesis delves into the applications of multiphoton quantum protocols, particularly in imaging, communication, and plasmonic sensing, to surpass classical limitations and achieve enhanced sensitivity. We explore the potential of multiphoton quantum processes, particularly in the nanoscale regime and within subsystems of macroscopic systems, where novel and ultra-sensitive sensing methodologies emerge. Subsequent chapters of this thesis demonstrate the transformative potential of multiphoton quantum sensing, elucidating the design, implementation, and experimental results of specific sensing protocols tailored to diverse applications. Our analysis combines experimental observations and theoretical predictions to assess the sensitivity and performance of these protocols. Additionally, the thesis discusses potential future directions and advancements in the field, envisioning applications in biomolecule detection, environmental monitoring, and fundamental studies of light-matter interactions at the nanoscale. Concluding reflections highlight the implications of multiphoton quantum sensing across scientific disciplines and lay the groundwork for future research endeavors.</description>

      <title>Phase Noise in Real-World Twin-Field Quantum Key Distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08621v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The impact of noise sources in real-world implementations of Twin-Field Quantum Key Distribution (TF-QKD) protocols is investigated, focusing on phase noise from photon sources and connecting fibers. This work emphasizes the role of laser quality, network topology, fiber length, arm balance, and detector performance in determining key rates. Remarkably, it reveals that the leading TF-QKD protocols are similarly affected by phase noise despite different mechanisms. This study demonstrates duty cycle improvements of over a factor of two through narrow-linewidth lasers and phase-control techniques, highlighting the potential synergy with high-precision time/frequency distribution services. Ultrastable lasers, evolving toward integration and miniaturization, offer promise for agile TF-QKD implementations on existing networks. Properly addressing phase noise and practical constraints allows for consistent key rate predictions, protocol selection, and layout design, crucial for establishing secure long-haul links for the Quantum Communication Infrastructures under development in several countries.</description>

      <title>Tunneling-like wave transmission in non-Hermitian lattices with mirrored nonreciprocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a peculiar tunneling phenomenon that occurs in lattices with nonreciprocal inter-site couplings. The nonreciprocity holds for an inner portion of the lattice, constituting a non-Hermitian interface between outer Hermitian sections. The couplings are mirrored about the interface center, with the smaller strength directed outwards. As a standalone system that was widely studied in recent years, each section of the interface supports the non-Hermitian skin effect, in which modes are accumulated at the boundary of the weaker coupling. Here, we investigate what happens to a wave that propagates along the lattice and hits the interface. The skin mode accumulation, which effectively constitutes a barrier, forbids wave penetration into the interface, but surprisingly, under certain conditions the wave is transmitted to the other side, keeping the interface dark, as if the wave invisibly tunneled through it. Remarkably, the tunneling is independent of the interface length. We derive the phenomenon both for quantum and classical systems, and realize it experimentally in an active topoelectric metamaterial. Our study fosters the research of wave tunneling through other types of non-Hermitian interfaces, which may also include nonlinearities, time-dependence and more.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional quantum key distribution using a multi-plane light converter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional quantum key distribution (QKD) offers higher information capacity and stronger resilience to noise compared to its binary counterpart. However, these advantages are often hindered by the difficulty of realizing the required high-dimensional measurements and transformations. Here, we implement a large-scale multi-plane light converter (MPLC) and program it as a high-dimensional mode sorter of spatial modes for QKD. Using the MPLC, we demonstrate five-dimensional QKD with six mutually unbiased bases and 25-dimensional QKD with two mutually unbiased bases in the same experimental setup. Furthermore, we propose a construction of pairs of mutually unbiased bases that are robust to experimental errors, with measurement complexity scaling only with the square root of the encoded dimension. This approach paves the way for QKD implementations in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Novel Signatures of Radiation Reaction in Electron-Laser Sidescattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07455v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we investigate novel signatures of radiation reaction via the angular deflection of an electron beam colliding at 90 degrees with an intense laser pulse. Due to the radiation reaction effect, the electrons can be deflected towards the beam axis for plane wave backgrounds, which is not possible in the absence of radiation reaction effects. The magnitude and size of the deflection angle can be controlled by tailoring the laser pulse shapes. The effect is first derived analytically using the Landau-Lifshitz equation, which allows to determine the important scaling behavior with laser intensity and particle energy. We then move on to full scale 3D Monte Carlo simulations to verify the effect is observable with present day laser technology. We investigate the opportunities for an indirect observation of laser depletion in such side scattering scenarios.</description>

Abstract: We study the classical dynamics of a system comprising a pair of Kerr-Duffing nonlinear oscillators, which are coupled through a nonlinear interaction and subjected to a parametric drive. Using the rotating wave approximation (RWA), we analyze the steady-state solutions for the amplitudes of the two oscillators. For the case of almost identical oscillators, we investigate separately the cases in which only one oscillator is parametrically driven and in which both oscillators are simultaneously driven. In the latter regime, we demonstrate that even when the parametric drives acting on the two oscillators are identical, the system can transition from a stable symmetric solution to a broken-symmetry solution as the detuning is varied.</description>
