      <title>A novel ultrasonic device for monitoring implant condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Every year more than 2.3 million joint replacement is performed worldwide. Around 10% of these replacements fail those results in revisions at a cost of $8 billion per year. In particular patients younger than 55 years of age face higher risks of failure due to greater demand on their joints. The long-term failure of joint replacement such as implant loosening significantly decreases the life expectancy of replacement. One of the main challenges in understanding and treatment of implant loosening is lack of a low-cost screening device that can detect or predict loosening at very early stages. In this work we are proposing a novel method of screening implant condition via ultrasonic signals. In this method we are applying ultrasonic signals to the joint via several piezoresistive discs while reading signals with several other piezoresistive sensors. We are introducing a new approachin interpreting ultrasonic signals and we prove in a finite element environment that our method can be used to assess replacement condition. We show how our new concept can detect and distinguish between different implant fixation failure types sizes and even locate the position of the failure. We believe this work can be a foundation for development of a new generation of ultrasonic diagnosis wearable devices.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Framework for Forward and Inverse Problem in Guided Waves Based Structural Healthy Monitoring Under Varying Environmental and Operating Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, guided wave-based techniques have garnered increased attention from researchers in the field of Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) for damage detection and quantification. Extracting features that are sensitive to changes in structural conditions has become a critical step. Guided waves, being one of the most widely used techniques, are highly responsive to structural changes caused by various types of damage. However, due to disturbances from environmental and operational conditions (EOCs) and waveforms reflected from boundaries and damage in complex systems, manually extracting features related to the system state is challenging. To address this, various neural networks, capable of automatically deriving features, have been developed and applied to system identification tasks. Among these, Convolutional Autoencoders (CAEs) have proven effective as damage detectors, projecting data efficiently into a latent space. However, existing CAE-based models for damage diagnosis often overlook the influence of EOCs, which can significantly impact model performance. In this work, a scheme that provides accurate damage level classification while estimating EOCs, such as loading conditions, making the model adaptable to varying external factors is introduced. By restructuring and combining the CAE with feedforward neural networks (FFNNs), the proposed scheme also enables signal reconstruction, a potentially valuable feature when data is limited. The method has been validated on an aluminum plate with various damage levels under different loading conditions, achieving near-perfect state classification and low-error signal reconstruction. The framework has also been tested on incomplete datasets to verify its robustness.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Semantic-Shannon Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic communications are considered a promising beyond-Shannon/bit paradigm to reduce network traffic and increase reliability, thus making wireless networks more energy efficient, robust, and sustainable. However, the performance is limited by the efficiency of the semantic transceivers, i.e., the achievable "similarity" between the transmitted and received signals. Under strict similarity conditions, semantic transmission may not be applicable and bit communication is mandatory. In this paper, for the first time in the literature, we propose a multi-carrier Hybrid Semantic-Shannon communication system where, without loss of generality, the case of text transmission is investigated. To this end, a joint semantic-bit transmission selection and power allocation optimization problem is formulated, aiming to minimize two transmission delay metrics widely used in the literature, subject to strict similarity thresholds. Despite their non-convexity, both problems are decomposed into a convex and a mixed linear integer programming problem by using alternating optimization, both of which can be solved optimally. Furthermore, to improve the performance of the proposed hybrid schemes, a novel association of text sentences to subcarriers is proposed based on the data size of the sentences and the channel gains of the subcarriers. We show that the proposed association is optimal in terms of transmission delay. Numerical simulations verify the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid semantic-bit communication scheme and the derived sentence-to-subcarrier association, and provide useful insights into the design parameters of such systems.</description>

      <title>Overpredictive Signal Analytics in Federated Learning: Algorithms and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Edge signal processing facilitates distributed learning and inference in the client-server model proposed in federated learning. In traditional machine learning, clients (IoT devices) that acquire raw signal samples can aid a data center (server) learn a global signal model by pooling these distributed samples at a third-party location. Despite the promising capabilities of IoTs, these distributed deployments often face the challenge of sensitive private data and communication rate constraints. This necessitates a learning approach that communicates a processed approximation of the distributed samples instead of the raw signals. Such a decentralized learning approach using signal approximations will be termed distributed signal analytics in this work. Overpredictive signal approximations may be desired for distributed signal analytics, especially in network demand (capacity) planning applications motivated by federated learning. In this work, we propose algorithms that compute an overpredictive signal approximation at the client devices using an efficient convex optimization framework. Tradeoffs between communication cost, sampling rate, and the signal approximation error are quantified using mathematical analysis. We also show the performance of the proposed distributed algorithms on a publicly available residential energy consumption dataset.</description>

      <title>Optimal One- and Two-Sided Multi-level ASK Modulation or RIS-Assisted Noncoherent Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the performance of one- and two-sided amplitude shift keying (ASK) modulations in single-input single-output wireless communication aided by a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). Two scenarios are considered for the channel conditions: a blocked direct channel between the transmitter and the receiver, and an unblocked one. For the receiver, a noncoherent maximum likelihood detector is proposed, which detects the transmitted data signal based on statistical knowledge of the channel. The system's performance is then evaluated by deriving the symbol error probability (SEP) for both scenarios using the proposed noncoherent receiver structures. We also present a novel optimization framework to obtain the optimal one- and two-sided ASK modulation schemes that minimize the SEP under constraints on the available average transmit power for both the blocked and unblocked direct channel scenarios. Our extensive numerical investigations showcase that the considered RIS-aided communication system achieves superior error performance with both derived SEP-optimal ASK modulation schemes as compared to respective traditional ASK modulation. It is also demonstrated that, between the two proposed modulation schemes, the two-sided one yields the best SEP. The error performance is further analyzed for different system parameters, providing a comprehensive performance investigation of RIS-assisted noncoherent wireless communication systems.</description>

      <title>Jamming Detection in MIMO-OFDM ISAC Systems Using Variational Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel unsupervised jamming detection framework designed specifically for monostatic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) radar systems. The framework leverages echo signals captured at the base station (BS) and employs the latent data representation learning capability of variational autoencoders (VAEs). The VAE-based detector is trained on echo signals received from a real target in the absence of jamming, enabling it to learn an optimal latent representation of normal network operation. During testing, in the presence of a jammer, the detector identifies anomalous signals by their inability to conform to the learned latent space. We assess the performance of the proposed method in a typical integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)-enabled 5G wireless network, even comparing it with a conventional autoencoder.</description>

      <title>On the topology and geometry of population-based SHM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Population-Based Structural Health Monitoring (PBSHM), aims to leverage information across populations of structures in order to enhance diagnostics on those with sparse data. The discipline of transfer learning provides the mechanism for this capability. One recent paper in PBSHM proposed a geometrical view in which the structures were represented as graphs in a metric "base space" with their data captured in the "total space" of a vector bundle above the graph space. This view was more suggestive than mathematically rigorous, although it did allow certain useful arguments. One bar to more rigorous analysis was the absence of a meaningful topology on the graph space, and thus no useful notion of continuity. The current paper aims to address this problem, by moving to parametric families of structures in the base space, essentially changing points in the graph space to open balls. This allows the definition of open sets in the fibre space and thus allows continuous variation between fibres. The new ideas motivate a new geometrical mechanism for transfer learning in data are transported from one fibre to an adjacent one; i.e., from one structure to another.</description>

      <title>Graph-based Scalable Sampling of 3D Point Cloud Attributes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D Point clouds (PCs) are commonly used to represent 3D scenes. They can have millions of points, making subsequent downstream tasks such as compression and streaming computationally expensive. PC sampling (selecting a subset of points) can be used to reduce complexity. Existing PC sampling algorithms focus on preserving geometry features and often do not scale to handle large PCs. In this work, we develop scalable graph-based sampling algorithms for PC color attributes, assuming the full geometry is available. Our sampling algorithms are optimized for a signal reconstruction method that minimizes the graph Laplacian quadratic form. We first develop a global sampling algorithm that can be applied to PCs with millions of points by exploiting sparsity and sampling rate adaptive parameter selection. Further, we propose a block-based sampling strategy where each block is sampled independently. We show that sampling the corresponding sub-graphs with optimally chosen self-loop weights (node weights) will produce a sampling set that approximates the results of global sampling while reducing complexity by an order of magnitude. Our empirical results on two large PC datasets show that our algorithms outperform the existing fast PC subsampling techniques (uniform and geometry feature preserving random sampling) by 2dB. Our algorithm is up to 50 times faster than existing graph signal sampling algorithms while providing better reconstruction accuracy. Finally, we illustrate the efficacy of PC attribute sampling within a compression scenario, showing that pre-compression sampling of PC attributes can lower the bitrate by 11% while having minimal effect on reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Meta Learning Based Adaptive Cooperative Perception in Nonstationary Vehicular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To accommodate high network dynamics in real-time cooperative perception (CP), reinforcement learning (RL) based adaptive CP schemes have been proposed, to allow adaptive switchings between CP and stand-alone perception modes among connected and autonomous vehicles. The traditional offline-training online-execution RL framework suffers from performance degradation under nonstationary network conditions. To achieve fast and efficient model adaptation, we formulate a set of Markov decision processes for adaptive CP decisions in each stationary local vehicular network (LVN). A meta RL solution is proposed, which trains a meta RL model that captures the general features among LVNs, thus facilitating fast model adaptation for each LVN with the meta RL model as an initial point. Simulation results show the superiority of meta RL in terms of the convergence speed without reward degradation. The impact of the customization level of meta models on the model adaptation performance has also been evaluated.</description>

      <title>Development of a Platform to Enable Real Time, Non-disruptive Testing and Early Fault Detection of Critical High Voltage Transformers and Switchgears in High Speed-rail</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Partial discharge (PD) incidents can occur in critical components of high-speed rail electric systems, such as transformers and switchgears, due to localized insulation defects that cannot withstand electric stress, leading to potential flashovers. These incidents can escalate over time, resulting in breakdowns, downtime, and safety risks. Fortunately, PD activities emit radio frequency (RF) signals, allowing for the development of a hardware platform for real-time, non-invasive PD detection and monitoring. The system uses an RF antenna and high-speed data acquisition to scan signals across a configurable frequency range (100MHz to 3GHz), utilizing intermediate frequency modulation and sliding frequency windows for detailed analysis. When signals exceed a threshold, the system records the events, capturing both raw signal data and spectrum snapshots. Real-time data is streamed to a cloud server, offering remote access through a dedicated smartphone application, enabling maintenance teams to monitor and respond promptly. Laboratory testing has confirmed the system's ability to accurately capture RF signals and provide real-time PD monitoring, enhancing the reliability and safety of high-speed rail infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Building a real-time physical layer labeled data logging facility for 6G research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work describes the architecture and vision of designing and implementing a new test infrastructure for 6G physical layer research at KU Leuven. The Testbed is designed for physical layer research and experimentation following several emerging trends, such as cell-free networking, integrated communication, sensing, open disaggregated Radio Access Networks, AI-Native design, and multiband operation. The software is almost entirely based on free and open-source software, making contributing and reusing any component easy. The open Testbed is designed to provide real-time and labeled data on all parts of the physical layer, from raw IQ data to synchronization statistics, channel state information, or symbol/bit/packet error rates. Real-time labeled datasets can be collected by synchronizing the physical layer data logging with a positioning and motion capture system. One of the main goals of the design is to make it open and accessible to external users remotely. Most tests and data captures can easily be automated, and experiment code can be remotely deployed using standard containers (e.g., Docker or Podman). Finally, the paper describes how the Testbed can be used for our research on joint communication and sensing, over-the-air synchronization, distributed processing, and AI in the loop.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper serves as a correction to the conference version. In this work, we explore uplink communication in cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MaMIMO) systems, employing semi-blind transmission structures to mitigate pilot contamination. We propose a simplified, decentralized method based on Expectation Propagation (EP) for semi-blind channel estimation. By utilizing orthogonal pilots, we preprocess the received signals to establish a simplified equivalent factorization scheme for the transmission process. Moreover, this study integrates Central Limit Theory (CLT) with EP, eliminating the need to introduce new auxiliary variables in the factorization scheme. We also refine the algorithm by assessing the variable scales involved. Finally, a decentralized approach is proposed to significantly reduce the computational demands on the Central Processing Unit (CPU).</description>

      <title>Enhancing User Fairness in Wireless Powered Communication Networks with STAR-RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) assisted wireless powered communication network (WPCN) is proposed, where two energy-limited devices first harvest energy from a hybrid access point (HAP) and then use that energy to transmit information back. To fully eliminate the doubly-near-far effect in WPCNs, two STAR-RIS operating protocol-driven transmission strategies, namely energy splitting non-orthogonal multiple access (ES- NOMA) and time switching time division multiple access (TS- TDMA) are proposed. For each strategy, the corresponding optimization problem is formulated to maximize the minimum throughput by jointly optimizing time allocation, user transmit power, active HAP beamforming, and passive STAR-RIS beamforming. For ES-NOMA, the resulting intractable problem is solved via a two-layer algorithm, which exploits the one-dimensional search and block coordinate descent methods in an iterative manner. For TS-TDMA, the optimal active beamforming and passive beamforming are first determined according to the maximum-ratio transmission beamformer. Then, the optimal solution of the time allocation variables is obtained by solving a standard convex problem. Numerical results show that: 1) the STAR-RIS can achieve considerable performance improvements for both strategies compared to the conventional RIS; 2) TS- TDMA is preferred for single-antenna scenarios, whereas ES- NOMA is better suited for multi-antenna scenarios; and 3) the superiority of ES-NOMA over TS-TDMA is enhanced as the number of STAR-RIS elements increases.</description>

      <title>Newton Meets Marchenko-Pastur: Massively Parallel Second-Order Optimization with Hessian Sketching and Debiasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent advances in serverless cloud computing, in particular the "function as a service" (FaaS) model, we consider the problem of minimizing a convex function in a massively parallel fashion, where communication between workers is limited. Focusing on the case of a twice-differentiable objective subject to an L2 penalty, we propose a scheme where the central node (server) effectively runs a Newton method, offloading its high per-iteration cost -- stemming from the need to invert the Hessian -- to the workers. In our solution, workers produce independently coarse but low-bias estimates of the inverse Hessian, using an adaptive sketching scheme. The server then averages the descent directions produced by the workers, yielding a good approximation for the exact Newton step. The main component of our adaptive sketching scheme is a low-complexity procedure for selecting the sketching dimension, an issue that was left largely unaddressed in the existing literature on Hessian sketching for distributed optimization. Our solution is based on ideas from asymptotic random matrix theory, specifically the Marchenko-Pastur law. For Gaussian sketching matrices, we derive non asymptotic guarantees for our algorithm which are essentially dimension-free. Lastly, when the objective is self-concordant, we provide convergence guarantees for the approximate Newton's method with noisy Hessians, which may be of independent interest beyond the setting considered in this paper.</description>

      <title>A Smart Chair for Health Monitoring in Daily Life</title>

Abstract: Recent research has focused on the risks associated with poor sitting posture and the impact of sitting on biological parameters, such as heart rate because prolonged sitting is common across all ages and professions. In this work, we propose a novel approach that can display simultaneously posture and heart rate in real-time. In this device, pressure sensors are embedded into a flexible separate cushion easily put on any chair to provide sitting behaviours and a smartwatch-like PPG module is worn on the user's wrist. Regarding posture classification, pressure figures of ten pressure sensors under the seat bottom are inputs of four machine learning models, giving a high accuracy of 99 per cent. Besides, the Electrocardiography recording module is illustrated with the same results as a commercial device called DFRobot. Another advantage of this smart chair is that it not only simultaneously displays both sitting postures and heart rates on external devices like laptops, mobile phones, or televisions through microcontrollers but also offers the relationship between them to help people adjust their sitting behaviours, avoiding influencing heart rate. The smart chair is expected to be useful equipment for people with a sedentary lifestyle, especially office workers.</description>

      <title>Task-Oriented Edge-Assisted Cooperative Data Compression, Communications and Computing for UGV-Enhanced Warehouse Logistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Only the chairs can edit This paper explores the growing need for task-oriented communications in warehouse logistics, where traditional communication Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)-such as latency, reliability, and throughput-often do not fully meet task requirements. As the complexity of data flow management in large-scale device networks increases, there is also a pressing need for innovative cross-system designs that balance data compression, communication, and computation. To address these challenges, we propose a task-oriented, edge-assisted framework for cooperative data compression, communication, and computing in Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV)-enhanced warehouse logistics. In this framework, two UGVs collaborate to transport cargo, with control functions-navigation for the front UGV and following/conveyance for the rear UGV-offloaded to the edge server to accommodate their limited on-board computing resources. We develop a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based two-stage point cloud data compression algorithm that dynamically and collaboratively adjusts compression ratios according to task requirements, significantly reducing communication overhead. System-level simulations of our UGV logistics prototype demonstrate the framework's effectiveness and its potential for swift real-world implementation.</description>

      <title>Design of Convolutional Codes for Varying Constraint Lengths</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the design of convolutional codes for varying constraint lengths, focusing on their role in error correction in digital communication systems. Convolutional codes are essential in achieving reliable data transmission across noisy channels. The constraint length, which determines the memory of the encoder, plays a critical role in the performance of convolutional codes. This study investigates the effect of varying constraint lengths on coding performance, including code rate, complexity, and decoding accuracy. Simulation results and theoretical analysis illustrate the trade-offs between constraint length and decoding efficiency.</description>

      <title>Frequency-Dependent F-Numbers Suppress Grating Lobes and Improve the Lateral Resolution in Line-by-Line Scanning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Line-by-line scanning with linear arrays is a standard image formation method in clinical ultrasound. This method examines progressively a given region of interest by conducting focused pulse-echo measurements with dynamic transmit and receive apertures. Such apertures widen with the focal length as a function of a given F-number and improve the image quality by extending the depth of field (DOF) and suppressing grating lobes. Fixed F-numbers, however, limit the lateral resolution. Herein, frequency dependence of the F-number is incorporated into both the transmit and the receive focusing to widen the apertures for low frequencies and improve the lateral resolution. Frequency-dependent transmit and receive F-numbers are proposed. These F-numbers, which can be expressed in closed form, maximize the lateral resolution under constraints on the DOF and the grating lobes. A phantom experiment showed that the proposed F-numbers eliminate grating lobe artifacts and improve both image uniformity and contrast to a similar extent as fixed F-numbers. These metrics, compared to the usage of the full apertures, improved by up to 14.1 % and 8.3 %, respectively. The proposed F-numbers, however, improved the lateral resolution by up to 24 % compared to the fixed F-numbers.</description>

      <title>SAFE: Semantic Adaptive Feature Extraction with Rate Control for 6G Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most current Deep Learning-based Semantic Communication (DeepSC) systems are designed and trained exclusively for particular single-channel conditions, which restricts their adaptability and overall bandwidth utilization. To address this, we propose an innovative Semantic Adaptive Feature Extraction (SAFE) framework, which significantly improves bandwidth efficiency by allowing users to select different sub-semantic combinations based on their channel conditions. This paper also introduces three advanced learning algorithms to optimize the performance of SAFE framework as a whole. Through a series of simulation experiments, we demonstrate that the SAFE framework can effectively and adaptively extract and transmit semantics under different channel bandwidth conditions, of which effectiveness is verified through objective and subjective quality evaluations.</description>

      <title>A Novel Framework of Horizontal-Vertical Hybrid Federated Learning for EdgeIoT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This letter puts forth a new hybrid horizontal-vertical federated learning (HoVeFL) for mobile edge computing-enabled Internet of Things (EdgeIoT). In this framework, certain EdgeIoT devices train local models using the same data samples but analyze disparate data features, while the others focus on the same features using non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data samples. Thus, even though the data features are consistent, the data samples vary across devices. The proposed HoVeFL formulates the training of local and global models to minimize the global loss function. Performance evaluations on CIFAR-10 and SVHN datasets reveal that the testing loss of HoVeFL with 12 horizontal FL devices and six vertical FL devices is 5.5% and 25.2% higher, respectively, compared to a setup with six horizontal FL devices and 12 vertical FL devices.</description>

      <title>Empirical Validation of a Class of Ray-Based Fading Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15467v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As new wireless standards are developed, the use of higher operation frequencies comes in hand with new use cases and propagation effects that differ from the well-established state of the art. Numerous stochastic fading models have recently emerged under the umbrella of generalized fading conditions, to provide a fine-grain characterization of propagation channels in the mmWave and sub-THz bands. For the first time in literature, this work carries out an experimental validation of a class of such ray-based models, in a wide range of propagation conditions (anechoic, reverberation and indoor) at mmWave bands. We show that the independently fluctuating two-ray (IFTR) model has good capabilities to recreate rather dissimilar environments with high accuracy. We also put forth that the key limitations of the IFTR model arise in the presence of reduced diffuse propagation, and also due to a limited phase variability for the dominant specular components.</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning Method for Beat-Level Risk Analysis and Interpretation of Atrial Fibrillation Patients during Sinus Rhythm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac arrhythmia. Many AF patients experience complications such as stroke and other cardiovascular issues. Early detection of AF is crucial. Existing algorithms can only distinguish ``AF rhythm in AF patients'' from ``sinus rhythm in normal individuals'' . However, AF patients do not always exhibit AF rhythm, posing a challenge for diagnosis when the AF rhythm is absent. To address this, this paper proposes a novel artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm to distinguish ``sinus rhythm in AF patients'' and ``sinus rhythm in normal individuals'' in beat-level. We introduce beat-level risk interpreters, trend risk interpreters, addressing the interpretability issues of deep learning models and the difficulty in explaining AF risk trends. Additionally, the beat-level information fusion decision is presented to enhance model accuracy. The experimental results demonstrate that the average AUC for single beats used as testing data from CPSC 2021 dataset is 0.7314. By employing 150 beats for information fusion decision algorithm, the average AUC can reach 0.7591. Compared to previous segment-level algorithms, we utilized beats as input, reducing data dimensionality and making the model more lightweight, facilitating deployment on portable medical devices. Furthermore, we draw new and interesting findings through average beat analysis and subgroup analysis, considering varying risk levels.</description>

      <title>Variational Signal Separation for Automotive Radar Interference Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14319v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Algorithms for mutual interference mitigation and object parameter estimation are a key enabler for automotive applications of frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar. In this paper, we introduce a signal separation method to detect and estimate radar object parameters while jointly estimating and successively canceling the interference signal. The underlying signal model poses a challenge, since both the coherent radar echo and the non-coherent interference influenced by individual multipath propagation channels must be considered. Under certain assumptions, the model is described as a superposition of multipath channels weighted by parametric interference chirp envelopes. Inspired by sparse Bayesian learning (SBL), we employ an augmented probabilistic model that uses a hierarchical Gamma-Gaussian prior model for each multipath channel. Based on this, an iterative inference algorithm is derived using the variational expectation-maximization (EM) methodology. The algorithm is statistically evaluated in terms of object parameter estimation accuracy and robustness, indicating that it is fundamentally capable of achieving the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) with respect to the accuracy of object estimates and it closely follows the radar performance achieved when no interference is present.</description>

Abstract: Digital Twin has emerged as a promising paradigm for accurately representing wireless communication electromagnetic environments. The resulting virtual representation of reality facilitates comprehensive insights into the propagation environment, empowering multi-layer decision-making processes at the physical communication level. This paper investigates the impact of ray-based model simulation within real-time Digital Twins. A benchmark for ray-based propagation simulations is presented to evaluate computational time, considering two urban scenarios characterized by different mesh complexity, single and multiple wireless link configurations, and simulations with/without diffuse scattering. Exhaustive empirical analyses are performed showing the behavior of different ray-based solutions. By offering standardized simulations and scenarios, this work provides a technical benchmark for practitioners involved in the implementation of real-time Digital Twins and optimization of ray-based propagation models.</description>

Abstract: The Fifth-Generation (5G) wireless communications networks introduced native support for Machine-Type Communications (MTC) use cases. Nevertheless, current 5G networks cannot fully meet the very stringent requirements regarding latency, reliability, and number of connected devices of most MTC use cases. Industry and academia have been working on the evolution from 5G to Sixth Generation (6G) networks. One of the main novelties is adopting Distributed Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (D-MIMO) networks. However, most works studying D-MIMO consider antenna arrays with no movement capabilities, even though some recent works have shown that this could bring substantial performance improvements. In this work, we propose the utilization of Access Points (APs) equipped with Rotary Uniform Linear Arrays (RULAs) for this purpose. Considering a spatially correlated Rician fading model, the optimal angular position of the RULAs is jointly computed by the central processing unit using particle swarm optimization as a function of the location of the active devices. Considering the impact of imperfect location estimates, our numerical results show that the RULAs's optimal rotation brings substantial performance gains in terms of mean per-user spectral efficiency. The improvement grows with the strength of the line-of-sight components of the channel vectors. Given the total number of antenna elements, we study the trade-off between the number of APs and the number of antenna elements per AP, revealing an optimal number of APs for the cases of APs equipped with static ULAs and RULAs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal language modeling constitutes a recent breakthrough which leverages advances in large language models to pretrain capable multimodal models. The integration of natural language during pretraining has been shown to significantly improve learned representations, particularly in computer vision. However, the efficacy of multimodal language modeling in the realm of functional brain data, specifically for advancing pathology detection, remains unexplored. This study pioneers EEG-language models trained on clinical reports and 15000 EEGs. We extend methods for multimodal alignment to this novel domain and investigate which textual information in reports is useful for training EEG-language models. Our results indicate that models learn richer representations from being exposed to a variety of report segments, including the patient's clinical history, description of the EEG, and the physician's interpretation. Compared to models exposed to narrower clinical text information, we find such models to retrieve EEGs based on clinical reports (and vice versa) with substantially higher accuracy. Yet, this is only observed when using a contrastive learning approach. Particularly in regimes with few annotations, we observe that representations of EEG-language models can significantly improve pathology detection compared to those of EEG-only models, as demonstrated by both zero-shot classification and linear probes. In sum, these results highlight the potential of integrating brain activity data with clinical text, suggesting that EEG-language models represent significant progress for clinical applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a GPU-accelerated prototype implementation of a portable ultrasound imaging pipeline on an Nvidia CLARA AGX development kit. The raw data is acquired with nonsteered plane wave transmit using a programmable handheld open platform that supports 128-channel transmit and 64-channel receive. The received signals are transferred to the Nvidia CLARA AGX developer platform through a host system for accelerated imaging. GPU-accelerated implementation of the conventional delay and sum (DAS) beamformer along with two adaptive nonlinear beamformers and two Fourier-based techniques was performed. The feasibility of the complete pipeline and its imaging performance was evaluated with in-vitro phantom imaging experiments and the efficacy is demonstrated with preliminary in-vivo scans. The image quality quantified by the standard contrast and resolution metrics was comparable with that of the CPU implementation. The execution speed of the implemented beamformers was also investigated for different sizes of imaging grids and a significant speedup as high as 180 times that of the CPU implementation was observed. Since the proposed pipeline involves Nvidia CLARA AGX, there is always the potential for easy incorporation of online/active learning approaches.</description>

      <title>Training-Free Message Passing for Learning on Hypergraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05569v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hypergraphs are crucial for modelling higher-order interactions in real-world data. Hypergraph neural networks (HNNs) effectively utilise these structures by message passing to generate informative node features for various downstream tasks like node classification. However, the message passing module in existing HNNs typically requires a computationally intensive training process, which limits their practical use. To tackle this challenge, we propose an alternative approach by decoupling the usage of hypergraph structural information from the model learning stage. This leads to a novel training-free message passing module, named TF-MP-Module, which can be precomputed in the data preprocessing stage, thereby reducing the computational burden. We refer to the hypergraph neural network equipped with our TF-MP-Module as TF-HNN. We theoretically support the efficiency and effectiveness of TF-HNN by showing that: 1) It is more training-efficient compared to existing HNNs; 2) It utilises as much information as existing HNNs for node feature generation; and 3) It is robust against the oversmoothing issue while using long-range interactions. Experiments based on seven real-world hypergraph benchmarks in node classification and hyperlink prediction show that, compared to state-of-the-art HNNs, TF-HNN exhibits both competitive performance and superior training efficiency. Specifically, on the large-scale benchmark, Trivago, TF-HNN outperforms the node classification accuracy of the best baseline by 10% with just 1% of the training time of that baseline.</description>

      <title>Broadening Target Distributions for Accelerated Diffusion Models via a Novel Analysis Approach</title>

Abstract: Accelerated diffusion models hold the potential to significantly enhance the efficiency of standard diffusion processes. Theoretically, these models have been shown to achieve faster convergence rates than the standard $\mathcal O(1/\epsilon^2)$ rate of vanilla diffusion models, where $\epsilon$ denotes the target accuracy. However, current theoretical studies have established the acceleration advantage only for restrictive target distribution classes, such as those with smoothness conditions imposed along the entire sampling path or with bounded support. In this work, we significantly broaden the target distribution classes with a novel accelerated stochastic DDPM sampler. In particular, we show that it achieves accelerated performance for three broad distribution classes not considered before. Our first class relies on the smoothness condition posed only to the target density $q_0$, which is far more relaxed than the existing smoothness conditions posed to all $q_t$ along the entire sampling path. Our second class requires only a finite second moment condition, allowing for a much wider class of target distributions than the existing finite-support condition. Our third class is Gaussian mixture, for which our result establishes the first acceleration guarantee. Moreover, among accelerated DDPM type samplers, our results specialized for bounded-support distributions show an improved dependency on the data dimension $d$. Our analysis introduces a novel technique for establishing performance guarantees via constructing a tilting factor representation of the convergence error and utilizing Tweedie's formula to handle Taylor expansion terms. This new analytical framework may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Optimization of End-to-End AoI in Edge-Enabled Vehicular Fog Systems: A Dueling-DQN Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02815</link>

Abstract: In real-time status update services for the Internet of Things (IoT), the timely dissemination of information requiring timely updates is crucial to maintaining its relevance. Failing to keep up with these updates results in outdated information. The age of information (AoI) serves as a metric to quantify the freshness of information. The Existing works to optimize AoI primarily focus on the transmission time from the information source to the monitor, neglecting the transmission time from the monitor to the destination. This oversight significantly impacts information freshness and subsequently affects decision-making accuracy. To address this gap, we designed an edge-enabled vehicular fog system to lighten the computational burden on IoT devices. We examined how information transmission and request-response times influence end-to-end AoI. As a solution, we proposed Dueling-Deep Queue Network (dueling-DQN), a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithm and compared its performance with DQN policy and analytical results. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed dueling-DQN algorithm outperforms both DQN and analytical methods, highlighting its effectiveness in improving real-time system information freshness. Considering the complete end-to-end transmission process, our optimization approach can improve decision-making performance and overall system efficiency.</description>

      <title>Rapid Gyroscope Calibration: A Deep Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-cost gyroscope calibration is essential for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of gyroscope measurements. Stationary calibration estimates the deterministic parts of measurement errors. To this end, a common practice is to average the gyroscope readings during a predefined period and estimate the gyroscope bias. Calibration duration plays a crucial role in performance, therefore, longer periods are preferred. However, some applications require quick startup times and calibration is therefore allowed only for a short time. In this work, we focus on reducing low-cost gyroscope calibration time using deep learning methods. We propose a deep-learning framework and explore the possibilities of using multiple real and virtual gyroscopes to improve the calibration performance of single gyroscopes. To train and validate our approach, we recorded a dataset consisting of 169 hours of gyroscope readings, using 24 gyroscopes of two different brands. We also created a virtual dataset consisting of simulated gyroscope readings. The two datasets were used to evaluate our proposed approach. One of our key achievements in this work is reducing gyroscope calibration time by up to 89% using three low-cost gyroscopes.</description>

      <title>Design and In-training Optimization of Binary Search ADC for Flexible Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flexible Electronics (FE) offer distinct advantages, including mechanical flexibility and low process temperatures, enabling extremely low-cost production. To address the demands of applications such as smart sensors and wearables, flexible devices must be small and operate at low supply voltages. Additionally, target applications often require classifiers to operate directly on analog sensory input, necessitating the use of Analog to Digital Converters (ADCs) to process the sensory data. However, ADCs present serious challenges, particularly in terms of high area and power consumption, especially when considering stringent area and energy budget. In this work, we target common classifiers in this domain such as MLPs and SVMs and present a holistic approach to mitigate the elevated overhead of analog to digital interfacing in FE. First, we propose a novel design for Binary Search ADC that reduces area overhead 2X compared with the state-of-the-art Binary design and up to 5.4X compared with Flash ADC. Next, we present an in-training ADC optimization in which we keep the bare-minimum representations required and simplifying ADCs by removing unnecessary components. Our in-training optimization further reduces on average the area in terms of transistor count of the required ADCs by 5X for less than 1% accuracy loss.</description>
