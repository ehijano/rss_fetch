      <title>A Reidemeister Theorem for Solid Ribbon Torus Links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A complete Reidemeister characterisation of welded links is a long-standing open problem. We present a Reidemeister Theorem for a related class of four-dimensional links, solid ribbon torus links: immersed solid tori in R4 with only ribbon singularities, considered up to generalised ribbon isotopy.</description>

      <title>The Signed Goldman-Iwahori Space and Real Tropical Linear Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Goldman-Iwahori space of seminorms on a finite-dimensional vector space over a non-Archimedean field is a non-Archimedean analogue of a symmetric space. If, in addition, $K$ is real closed, we define a signed analogue of the Goldman-Iwahori space consisting of signed seminorms. This new space can be seen as the linear algebraic version of the real analytification of projective space over $K$. We study this space with methods from real tropical geometry by constructing natural real tropicalization maps from the signed Goldman-Iwahori space to all real tropicalized linear spaces. We prove that this space is the limit of all real tropicalized linear embeddings. We give a combinatorial interpretation of this result by showing that the signed Goldman-Iwahori space is the real tropical linear space associated to the universal realizable oriented matroid. In the constant coefficient case for $K = \mathbb{R}$, we describe this space explicitly and relate it to real Bergman fans.</description>

      <title>Deformation Cohomology for Braided Commutativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Braided algebras are algebraic structures consisting of an algebra endowed with a Yang-Baxter operator, satisfying some compatibility conditions. Yang-Baxter Hochschild cohomology was introduced by the authors to classify infinitesimal deformations of braided algebras, and determine obstructions to quadratic deformations. Several examples of braided algebras satisfy a weaker version of commutativity, which is called braided commutativity and involves the Yang-Baxter operator of the algebra. We extend the theory of Yang-Baxter Hochschild cohomology to study braided commutative deformations of braided algebras. The resulting cohomology theory classifies infinitesimal deformations of braided algebras that are braided commutative, and provides obstructions for braided commutative quadratic deformations. We consider braided commutativity for Hopf algebras in detail, and obtain some classes of nontrivial examples.</description>

      <title>Automorphisms, cohomology and extensions of symmetric quandles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that the cohomology of symmetric quandles generates robust cocycle invariants for unoriented classical and surface links. Expanding on the recently introduced module-theoretic generalized cohomology for symmetric quandles, we derive a four-term exact sequence that relates 1-cocycles, second cohomology, and a specific group of automorphisms associated with the extensions of symmetric quandles. This exact sequence shows that the obstruction to lifting and extending automorphisms is found in the second symmetric quandle cohomology. Additionally, some general aspects of dynamical cocycles and extensions are discussed.</description>

      <title>Section conjectures over $\mathbb{C}$ and Kodaira fibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we propose and study topological and Hodge theoretic analogues of Grothendieck's section conjecture over the complex numbers. We study these questions in the context of family of curves, in particular Kodaira fibrations, and in the context of the family of Jacobians associated to a Kodaira fibration. We showed that in the case of family of curves, both the topological and Hodge-theoretic analogues of the injectivity part of the section conjecture holds, and that in the case of family of Jacobians, the topological analogue of the surjectivity part of the section conjecture does not hold in general. For family of curves, we also reduce the topological analogue of the surjectivity part of the section conjecture to the case where the families have no algebraic sections.</description>

      <title>Lattices, Gates, and Curves: GKP codes as a Rosetta stone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes are a promising candidate for implementing fault tolerant quantum computation in quantum harmonic oscillator systems such as superconducting resonators, optical photons and trapped ions, and in recent years theoretical and experimental evidence for their utility has steadily grown. It is known that logical Clifford operations on GKP codes can be implemented fault tolerantly using only Gaussian operations, and several theoretical investigations have illuminated their general structure. In this work, we explain how GKP Clifford gates arise as symplectic automorphisms of the corresponding GKP lattice and show how they are identified with the mapping class group of suitable genus $n$ surfaces. This correspondence introduces a topological interpretation of fault tolerance for GKP codes and motivates the connection between GKP codes (lattices), their Clifford gates, and algebraic curves, which we explore in depth. For a single-mode GKP code, we identify the space of all GKP codes with the moduli space of elliptic curves, given by the three sphere with a trefoil knot removed, and explain how logical degrees of freedom arise from the choice of a level structure on the corresponding curves. We discuss how the implementation of Clifford gates corresponds to homotopically nontrivial loops on the space of all GKP codes and show that the modular Rademacher function describes a topological invariant for certain Clifford gates implemented by such loops. Finally, we construct a universal family of GKP codes and show how it gives rise to an explicit construction of fiber bundle fault tolerance as proposed by Gottesman and Zhang for the GKP code. On our path towards understanding this correspondence, we introduce a general algebraic geometric perspective on GKP codes and their moduli spaces, which uncovers a map towards many possible routes of future research.</description>

      <title>Prime geodesic theorem and closed geodesics for large genus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.10415v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{M}_g$ be the moduli space of hyperbolic surfaces of genus $g$ endowed with the Weil-Petersson metric. In this paper, we show that for any $\epsilon&gt;0$, as $g\to \infty$, for a generic surface in $\mathcal{M}_g$, the error term in the Prime Geodesic Theorem is bounded from above by $g\cdot t^{\frac{3}{4}+\epsilon}$, up to a uniform constant multiplication. The expected value of the error term in the Prime Geodesic Theorem over $\mathcal{M}_g$ is also studied. As an application, we show that as $g\to \infty$, on a generic hyperbolic surface in $\mathcal{M}_g$ most closed geodesics of length significantly less than $\sqrt{g}$ are simple and non-separating, and most closed geodesics of length significantly greater than $\sqrt{g}$ are not simple, which confirms a conjecture of Lipnowski-Wright.
  A novel effective upper bound for intersection numbers on $\mathcal{M}_{g,n}$ is also established, when certain indices are large compared to $\sqrt{g+n}$.</description>

      <title>Diameter of Compact Riemann Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.10844v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diameter is one of the most basic properties of a geometric object, while Riemann surfaces are one of the most basic geometric objects. Surprisingly, the diameter of compact Riemann surfaces is known exactly only for the sphere and the torus. For higher genuses, only very general but loose upper and lower bounds are available. The problem of calculating the diameter exactly has been intractable since there is no simple expression for the distance between a pair of points on a high-genus surface. Here we prove that the diameters of a class of simple Riemann surfaces known as generalized Bolza surfaces of any genus greater than $1$ are equal to the radii of their fundamental polygons. This is the first exact result for the diameter of a compact hyperbolic manifold.</description>

      <title>Growth tightness and genericity for word metrics from injective spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mapping class groups are known to admit geometric (proper, cobounded) actions on injective spaces. Starting with such an action, and relying only on geometric arguments, we show that all finite generating sets resulting from taking large enough balls (as in the \v{S}varc-Milnor lemma) in the respective injective space yield word metrics where pseudo-Anosov maps are exponentially generic. We also show that growth tightness holds true for the Cayley graphs corresponding to these finite generating sets, providing a positive answer to a question by Arzhantseva, Cashen and Tao, who asked if any of the mapping class group's Cayley graphs is growth tight. To achieve the above results, we consider the space of all geometric actions of a mapping class group, and for any injective metric space in this collection, we construct a sequence of word metrics that converges to it and show that all large enough terms of the converging sequence inherit many desirable properties from the limiting injective space.</description>
