      <title>Commutator calculus and symbolic differentiation of matrix functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a functional calculus which allows one to apply functions to the matrix anti-commutator/commutator operator. The calculus is introduced in a straightforward manner if the operators are acting on symmetric matrices, and it leads to a coordinate-free version of Dalecki\u{\i}--Kre\u{\i}n formula. In this sense the proposed calculus provides symbolic formulae for the derivatives of matrix valued functions which are explicit and easy to use. We discuss several applications of the newly introduced calculus in continuum mechanics (viscoelastic fluids, hypoelasticity) and in theory of partial differential equations.</description>

      <title>Singular Damped Twist Waves in Chromonic Liquid Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chromonics are special classes of nematic liquid crystals, for which a quartic elastic theory seems to be more appropriate than the classical quadratic Oseen-Frank theory. The relaxation dynamics of twist director profiles are known to develop a shock wave in finite time in the inviscid case, where dissipation is neglected. This paper studies the dissipative case. We give a sufficient criterion for the formation of shocks in the presence of dissipation and we estimate the critical time at which these singularities develop. Both criterion and estimate depend on the initial director profile. We put our theory to the test on a class of initial kink profiles and we show how accurate our estimates are by comparing them to the outcomes of numerical solutions.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Production Planning with Regime Switching: Numerical and Sensitivity Analysis, Optimal Control, and Python Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates a stochastic production planning problem with regime-switching parameters, inspired by economic cycles impacting production and inventory costs. The model considers types of goods and employs a Markov chain to capture probabilistic regime transitions, coupled with a multidimensional Brownian motion representing stochastic demand dynamics. The production and inventory cost optimization problem is formulated as a quadratic cost functional, with the solution characterized by a regime-dependent system of elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs). Numerical solutions to the PDE system are computed using a monotone iteration algorithm, enabling quantitative analysis. Sensitivity analysis and model risk evaluation illustrate the effects of regime-dependent volatility, holding costs, and discount factors, revealing the conservative bias of regime-switching models when compared to static alternatives. Practical implications include optimizing production strategies under fluctuating economic conditions and exploring future extensions such as correlated Brownian dynamics, non-quadratic cost functions, and geometric inventory frameworks. This research bridges the gap between theoretical modeling and practical applications, offering a robust framework for dynamic production planning.</description>

      <title>Sub-exponential tails in biased run and tumble equations with unbounded velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Run and tumble equations are widely used models for bacterial chemotaxis. In this paper, we are interested in the long time behaviour of run and tumble equations with unbounded velocities. We show existence, uniqueness and quantitative convergence towards a steady state. In contrast to the bounded velocity case, the equilibrium has sub-exponential tails and we have sub-exponential rate of convergence to equilibrium. This produces additional technical challenges. We are able to successfully adapt both Harris' type and $\sfL^2-$ hypocoercivity \textit{a la} Dolbeault-Mouhot-Schmeiser techniques.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behavior toward viscous shocks for the outflow problem of barotropic Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the large-time asymptotic stability of viscous shock profile to the outflow problem of barotropic Navier-Stokes equations on a half line. We consider the case when the far-field state as a right-end state of 2-Hugoniot shock curve belongs to the subsonic region or transonic curve. We employ the method of $a$-contraction with shifts, to prove that if the strength of viscous shock wave is small and sufficiently away from the boundary, and if a initial perturbation is small, then the solution asymptotically converges to the viscous shock up to a dynamical shift. We also prove that the speed of time-dependent shift decays to zero as times goes to infinity, the shifted viscous shock still retains its original profile time-asymptotically.
  Since the outflow problem in the Lagrangian mass coordinate leads to a free boundary value problem due to the absence of a boundary condition for the fluid density, we consider the problem in the Eulerian coordinate instead. Although the $a$-contraction method is technically more complicated in the Eulerian coordinate than in the Lagrangian one, this provides a more favorable framework by avoiding the difficulty arising from a free boundary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, the Cauchy problem for the Langevin-type time-fractional equation $D_t^\beta(D_t^\alpha u(t))+D_t^\beta(Au(t))=f(t),(0&lt;t\leq T)$ is studied. Here $\alpha,\beta \in(0,1)$, $D_t^\alpha, D_t^\beta$ is the Caputo derivative and $A$ is an unbounded self-adjoint operator in a separable Hilbert space. Under certain conditions, we establish the existence and uniqueness of the solution and provide an explicit representation of it using eigenfunction expansions.</description>

      <title>Global existence for a Leibenson type equation with reaction on Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show a global existence result for a doubly nonlinear porous medium type equation of the form $$u_t = \Delta_p u^m +\, u^q$$ on a complete and non-compact Riemannian manifold $M$ of infinite volume. Here, for $1&lt;p&lt;N$, we assume $m(p-1)\ge1$, $m&gt;1$ and $q&gt;m(p-1)$. In particular, under the assumptions that $M$ supports the Sobolev inequality, we prove that a solution for such a problem exists globally in time provided $q&gt;m(p-1)+\frac pN$ and the initial datum is small enough; namely, we establish an explicit bound on the $L^\infty$ norm of the solution at all positive times, in terms of the $L^1$ norm of the data. Under the additional assumption that a Poincar\'e-type inequality also holds in $M$, we can establish the same result in the larger interval, i.e. $q&gt;m(p-1)$. This result has no Euclidean counterpart, as it differs entirely from the case of a bounded Euclidean domain due to the fact that $M$ is non-compact and has infinite measure.</description>

      <title>Unified approach to classical equations of inverse problem theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The boundary control (BC-) method is an approach to inverse problems based upon their deep relations to control and system theory. We show that the classical integral equations of inverse problem theory (Gelfand-Levitan, Krein and Marchenko equations) can be derived in the framework of the BC-method in a unified way. Namely, to solve each of these equations is in fact to solve a relevant boundary control problem, whereas its solution is determined by the inverse data.</description>

Abstract: We study the inverse dynamic problem of recoverying the potential in the one-dimensional dynamical system with memory. The Gelfand--Levitan equations are derived for the kernel of the integral operator which is inverse to the control operator of the system.

      <title>Input-to-state type Stability for Simplified Fluid-Particle Interaction System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the well-posedness and the input-to-state type stability of a one-dimensional fluid-particle interaction system. A distinctive feature, not yet considered in the ISS literature, is that our system involves a free boundary. More precisely, the fluid is described by the viscous Burgers equation, and the motion of the particle obeys Newton second law. The point mass is subject to both a feedback control and an open-loop control. We first establish the well-posedness of the system for any open-loop input in the L2(0, infinity) space. Assuming the input also belongs to the L1(0,infinity) space, we prove that the particle's position remains uniformly bounded and that the system is input-to-state type stable. The proof is based on the construction of a Lyapunov functional derived from a special test function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim to study nonnegative, global solutions to a general class of nonlocal parabolic equations with bounded measurable coefficients. First, we prove a Widder-type theorem. Such a result has previously been studied only for certain translation invariant operators, and new ideas are needed in our general setting. Second, we establish sharp two-sided bounds for the fundamental solution via purely variational techniques, entirely bypassing tools from semigroup theory, Dirichlet forms, and stochastic analysis. Third, we derive sharp Harnack-type estimates that are novel even for the fractional heat equation.</description>

      <title>Analytic Fourier Integral Operators and a Problem from Seismic Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a general result about the recovery of the analytic wavefront set of a distribution from the analytic wavefront set of its transform coming from a classical elliptic analytic Fourier integral operator (FIO) satisfying some conditions including the Bolker condition. Furthermore, we give a simple explicit analytic parametrix in the form of a classical elliptic analytic FIO for general analytic second order hyperbolic differential operators. Finally, we apply these results together with microlocal analytic continuation and a layer stripping argument to a problem from seismic inversion to prove the injectivity of a linearized operator in the analytic setting. It is the use of wave packet techniques that allows us to give the precise relation how the FIOs under consideration transform the analytic wavefront set, whereas the explicit analytic parametrix comes from a reformulation of the parametrix construction of Hadamard and H\"ormander.</description>

      <title>Determining evolutionary equations by a single passive boundary observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a comprehensive study of inverse boundary problems for evolutionary equations with a single passive boundary observation, focusing on hyperbolic and parabolic equations. We establish unique identifiability results for simultaneously determining several key parameters, including the wave/diffusion speed $c$, causal sources $f$ and $h$, and conductivity tensor $\sigma$, under generic conditions. As a central application, we provide a complete resolution to the joint reconstruction problem in thermoacoustic and photoacoustic tomography (TAT/PAT), proving for the first time that both the initial pressure distribution $f$ and the heterogeneous sound speed $c$ can be uniquely and simultaneously determined from just a single, passive, partial boundary observation. We develop a novel state-of-the-art framework by exploiting the full spectral content of the wavefield, combining both low-frequency and high-frequency asymptotics. Our approach avoids artificial decoupling assumptions and extends to general domain geometries and general evolutionary equations. This result resolves a long-standing open problem in coupled-physics imaging and provides a rigorous mathematical framework for addressing similar inverse problems in more sophisticated evolutionary setups.</description>

We focus on general perturbations, which may be large and of low regularity, including singular configurations such as point vortices, and show that the vorticity asymptotically approaches a constant multiple of the fundamental solution of the corresponding linearized vorticity equation after a long-time evolution determined by the relative Reynolds number.</description>

      <title>An Existence Result for a Stochastic Stefan Problem With Mushy Region and Turbulent Transport Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is devoted to the proof of the existence of a martingale solution for a complex version of the stochastic Stefan problem. This particular formulation incorporates two important features: a mushy region and turbulent transport within the liquid phase. While our approach bears similarities to porous media equations, it differs in a crucial aspect. Instead of using the typical framework for such equations, we have chosen to work within an L2 space. This choice is motivated by the nature of the operator that characterizes the turbulent noise in our model. The L2 space provides a more natural and appropriate setting for handling this specific operator, allowing us to better capture and analyze the turbulent transport phenomena in the liquid phase of the Stefan problem.</description>

      <title>Convergence and Wave Propagation for a System of Branching Rank-Based Interacting Brownian Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study a branching particle system of diffusion processes on the real line interacting through their rank in the system. Namely, each particle follows an independent Brownian motion, but only K $\ge$ 1 particles on the far right are allowed to branch with constant rate, whilst the remaining particles have an additional positive drift of intensity $\chi$ &gt; 0. This is the so called Go or Grow hypothesis, which serves as an elementary hypothesis to model cells in a capillary tube moving upwards a chemical gradient. Despite the discontinuous character of the coefficients for the movement of particles and their demographic events, we first obtain the limit behavior of the population as K $\rightarrow$ $\infty$ by weighting the individuals by 1/K. Then, on the microscopic level when K is fixed, we investigate numerically the speed of propagation of the particles and recover a threshold behavior according to the parameter $\chi$ consistent with the already known behavior of the limit. Finally, by studying numerically the ancestral lineages we categorize the traveling fronts as pushed or pulled according to the critical parameter $\chi$.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical defect measures of magnetic Laplacians on hyperbolic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On a closed hyperbolic surface, we investigate semiclassical defect measures associated with the magnetic Laplacian in the presence of a constant magnetic field. Depending on the energy level where the eigenfunctions concentrate, three distinct dynamical regimes emerge. In the low-energy regime, we show that any invariant measure of the magnetic flow in phase space can be obtained as a semiclassical measure. At the critical energy level, we establish Quantum Unique Ergodicity, together with a quantitative rate of convergence of eigenfunctions to the Liouville measure. In the high-energy regime, we prove a Shnirelman-type result: a density-one subsequence of eigenfunctions becomes equidistributed with respect to the Liouville measure.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how the lowest eigenvalue of a magnetic Laplacian depends on the geometry of a planar domain with a disk shaped hole, where the magnetic field is generated by a singular flux. Under Dirichlet boundary conditions on the inner boundary and Neumann boundary conditions on the outer boundary, we show that this eigenvalue is maximized when the domain is an annulus, for a fixed area and magnetic flux. As consequences, we establish geometric inequalities for eigenvalues in settings with both singular and localized magnetic fields. We also propose a conjecture for a general optimality result and establish its validity for large magnetic fluxes.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness and stability of the Lagrange representation of the n-D wave equation via boundary triples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Lagrange representation of the wave equation with generalized Laplacian $\operatorname{div} T \nabla$. We allow the coefficients -- the Young modulus $T$ and the density $\rho$ -- to be $\mathrm{L}^{\infty}$ or even nonlocal operators. Moreover, the Lipschitz boundary of the domain $\Omega$ can be split into several parts admitting Dirichlet, Neumann and/or Robin-boundary conditions of displacement, velocity and stress. We show well-posedness of this classical model of the wave equation utilizing boundary triple theory for skew-adjoint operators. In addition we show semi-uniform stability of solutions under slightly stronger assumptions by means of a spectral result.</description>

      <title>Global exponential stability of stationary profiles in a thin film equation with second-order diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study existence and long-time behavior of weak solutions to a thin-film equation with a confinement potential and a second-order degenerate diffusion term. It is known that in absence of second order effects, solutions for general initial data converge at an exponential rate in time to the unique stationary profile. Our main result is that if the strength of the additional forces is sufficiently small, this global exponential equilibration behavior persists, at a slightly smaller rate. Our proof uses the formulation of the equation as a Wasserstein gradient flow, and an auxiliary lower-order Lyapunov functional.</description>

      <title>Critical point localization and multiplicity results in Banach spaces via Nehari manifold technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper, results on the existence of critical points in annular subsets of a cone are obtained with the additional goal of obtaining multiplicity results. Compared to other approaches in the literature based on the use of Krasnoselskii's compression-extension theorem or topological index methods, our approach uses the Nehari manifold technique in a surprising combination with the cone version of Birkhoff-Kellogg's invariant-direction theorem. This yields a simpler alternative to traditional methods involving deformation arguments or Ekeland variational principle. The new method is illustrated on a boundary value problem for p-Laplacian equations, and we believe that it will be useful for proving the existence, localization, and multiplicity of solutions for other classes of problems with variational structure.</description>

      <title>Uniformly boundedness of finite Morse index solutions to semilinear elliptic equations with rapidly growing nonlinearities in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Gelfand problem with rapidly growing nonlinearities in the two-dimensional bounded strictly convex domains. In this paper, we prove the uniformly boundedness of finite Morse index solutions. As a result, we show that there exists a solution curve having infinitely many bifurcation/turning points. These results are recently proved by the present author for supercritical nonlinearities when the domain is the unit ball via an ODE argument. Instead of the ODE argument, we apply a new method focusing on the interaction between the growth condition of the nonlinearities and the shape of the fundamental solution. As a result, we clarify the bifurcation structure for general convex domains.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the $\Gamma$-limits of Ambrosio-Tortorelli-type functionals, for maps $u$ defined on an open bounded set $\Omega\subset\mathbb R^n$ and taking values in the unit circle $\mathbb S^1\subset\mathbb R^2$. Depending on the domain of the functional, two different $\Gamma$-limits are possible, one of which is nonlocal, and related to the notion of jump minimizing lifting, i.e., a lifting of a map $u$ whose measure of the jump set is minimal. The latter requires ad hoc compactness results for sequences of liftings which, besides being interesting by themselves, also allow to deduce existence of a jump minimizing lifting.</description>

      <title>A comparison principle for nonlinear parabolic equations with nonlocal source and gradient absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the initial-boundary value problem for a nonlinear parabolic equation involving the $p$-Laplacian operator, nonlocal source terms, gradient absorption, and various nonlinearities: \[ \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} - \text{div}(|\nabla u|^{p-2} \nabla u ) = \alpha |u|^{k-1}u \int_\Omega |u|^s \, dx - \beta |u|^{l-1}u |\nabla u|^q + \gamma u^m + \mu |\nabla u|^r - \nu |u|^{\sigma-1}u, \] where $ \Omega $ is a bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^N$, $N \geq 1$, with a smooth boundary $\partial \Omega$. The parameters satisfy $ \alpha, l, \sigma &gt; 0 $, $ \beta, \nu \geq 0 $, $ k, m, s \geq 1 $, $ r \geq p - 1 \geq \frac{p}{2}$, and $\gamma, \mu \in \mathbb{R}$.
  We establish a comparison principle for this problem. Using this principle, we derive blow-up results as well as global-in-time boundedness of solutions. Our results extend and unify previous studies in the literature.</description>

      <title>Exact closed-form solutions for Lamb's problem (II): a moving point load</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we report on an exact closed-form solution for the displacement in an elastic homogeneous half-space elicited by a downward vertical point source moving with constant velocity over the surface of the medium. The problem considered here is an extension to Lamb's problem. Starting with the integral solutions of Bakker \textit{et al.}, we followed the method developed in Feng and Zhang, which focuses on the displacement triggered by a fixed point source observed on the free surface, to obtain the final solution in terms of elementary algebraic functions as well as elliptic integrals of the first, second and third kind. Our closed-form results agree perfectly with the numerical results of Bakker \textit{et al.}, which confirms the correctness of our formulas. The solution obtained in this article may lay a solid foundation for further consideration of the response of an actual physical moving load, such as a high-speed rail train.</description>

      <title>$SU(2)$ Yang-Mills-Higgs functional with Higgs self-interaction on $3$-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fixing a constant $\lambda&gt;0$, for any parameter $\varepsilon&gt;0$ we study critical points of the Yang--Mills--Higgs energy \[ \mathcal{Y}_{\varepsilon}(\nabla,\Phi) = \int_M \varepsilon^2|F_{\nabla}|^2 + |\nabla\Phi|^2 + \frac{\lambda}{4\varepsilon^2}(1-|\Phi|^2)^2, \] defined for pairs $(\nabla,\Phi)$, where $\nabla$ is a connection on an $SU(2)$-bundle over an oriented Riemannian $3$-manifold $(M^3, g)$, and $\Phi$ a section of the associated adjoint bundle. When $M$ is closed, we use a $2$-parameter min-max construction to produce, for $\varepsilon\ll_M 1$, non-trivial critical points in the energy regime \[ 1 \lesssim_{\lambda}\varepsilon^{-1}\mathcal{Y}_{\varepsilon}(\nabla_{\varepsilon},\Phi_{\varepsilon}) \lesssim_{\lambda, M} 1. \] When $b_1(M)=0$, these critical points are irreducible: $\nabla_{\varepsilon}\Phi_{\varepsilon}\neq 0$. Next, assuming $M$ has bounded geometry (not necessarily compact), and given critical points with $\varepsilon^{-1}\mathcal{Y}_{\varepsilon}(\nabla_{\varepsilon}, \Phi_{\varepsilon})$ uniformly bounded, we show that as $\varepsilon\to 0$, the energy measures $\varepsilon^{-1}e_{\varepsilon}(\nabla_{\varepsilon}, \Phi_{\varepsilon}) vol_{g}$ converge subsequentially to \[ |h|^2 vol_g + \sum_{x \in S}\Theta(x)\delta_{x}, \] where $h$ is an $L^2$ harmonic $1$-form, $S$ a finite set and each $\Theta(x)$ equals the energy of a finite collection of $\mathcal{Y}_{1}$-critical points on $\mathbb{R}^3$. Finally, the estimates involved also lead to an energy gap for critical points on $3$-manifolds with bounded geometry. As a byproduct of our results, we deduce the existence of non-trivial $\mathcal{Y}_{1}$-critical points over $\mathbb{R}^3$ for any $\lambda&gt;0$.</description>

Abstract: We establish a direct symmetric (log)-epiperimetric inequality for harmonic maps with analytic target and we leverage on this result to achieve a new proof of Simon's celebrated uniqueness of tangents with isolated singularity for energy minimizing harmonic maps. Moreover, we show that tangents at infinity of energy minimizing harmonic maps with suitably controlled energy growth are always unique, by exploiting the lower bound entailed in the symmetric (log)-epiperimetric inequality.</description>

      <title>Extremising eigenvalues of the GJMS operators in a fixed conformal class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(M,g)$ be a closed Riemannian manifold of dimension $n\geq 3$. If $s$ is a positive integer satisfying $2s&lt;n$, we let $P_g^s$ be the GJMS operator of order $2s$ in $M$. We investigate in this paper the extremal values taken by fixed eigenvalues of $P_h^s$ as $h$ runs though the whole conformal class $[g]$. Due to the conformal covariance of $P_g^s$ we need only consider two variational problems: maximising negative eigenvalues of $P_h^s$ and minimising positive eigenvalues of $P_h^s$ when $h \in [g]$. These extremal values are conformal invariants of $(M,g)$ and optimisers for these problems, when they exist, are known to not be smooth metrics in general. To overcome this we define and investigate eigenvalues for singular conformal metrics, that we call \emph{generalised eigenvalues}. We develop a new variational framework for renormalised eigenvalues of any index over the set of admissible (singular) conformal factors: we obtain semi-continuity results and Euler-Lagrange equations for local extremals. Using this framework we prove, under mild assumptions on $(M,g)$ and $s$, several new (non)-existence results for extremals of renormalised eigenvalues over $[g]$. These include, among other results, a maximisation result for negative eigenvalues, the minimisation of the principal eigenvalue of $P_g^s$ and the analysis of several invariants of the round sphere $(\mathbb{S}^n, g_0)$. We also establish a strong connection between the existence of optimisers and (nodal) solutions of prescribed $Q$-curvature equations. Our analysis covers the case of any order $s \ge 1$ and allows $P_g^s$ to have kernel. When $s=1$ and $P_g^1$ is the conformal Laplacian, this problem was previously investigated when $k=1, 2$. Our work strongly generalises previous results to eigenvalues of any index.</description>

      <title>A nonlocal-to-local approach to aggregation-diffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past decades, nonlocal models have been widely used to describe aggregation phenomena in biology, physics, engineering, and the social sciences. These are often derived as mean-field limits of attraction-repulsion agent-based models, and consist of systems of nonlocal partial differential equations. Using differential adhesion between cells as a biological case study, we introduce a novel local model of aggregation-diffusion phenomena. This system of local aggregation-diffusion equations is fourth-order, resembling thin-film or Cahn-Hilliard type equations. In this framework, cell sorting phenomena are explained through relative surface tensions between distinct cell types. The local model emerges as a limiting case of short-range interactions, providing a significant simplification of earlier nonlocal models, while preserving the same phenomenology. This simplification makes the model easier to implement numerically and more amenable to calibration to quantitative data. Additionally, we discuss recent analytical results based on the gradient-flow structure of the model, along with open problems and future research directions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the derivative-free global optimization algorithm Consensus-Based Optimization (CBO), establishing uniform-in-time propagation of chaos as well as an almost uniform-in-time stability result for the microscopic particle system. The proof of these results is based on a novel stability estimate for the weighted mean and on a quantitative concentration inequality for the microscopic particle system around the empirical mean. Our propagation of chaos result recovers the classical Monte Carlo rate, with a prefactor that depends explicitly on the parameters of the problem. Notably, in the case of CBO with anisotropic noise, this prefactor is independent of the problem dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Viscosity solutions of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation were introduced by Lions and Crandall. For Tonelli Hamiltonians, these solutions are generated by the Lax-Oleinik operator. It is known that this operator converges in the autonomous framework, but this convergence fails in the general cases. In this paper, we introduce a method to construct smooth, recurrent, non-periodic viscosity solutions on fixed compact manifolds $M$ of dimension 2 or higher. Additionally, we provide a detailed description of the non-wandering set of the Lax-Oleinik operator and identify its action on various omega-limit sets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04118v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a novel stability estimate in $L^\infty _t (L^p _x)$ between the regular Lagrangian flow of a Sobolev vector field and a piecewise affine approximation of such flow. This approximation of the flow is obtained by a (sort of) explicit Euler method, and it is the crucial tool to prove approximation results for the solution of the continuity equation by using the representation of the solution as the push-forward via the regular Lagrangian flow of the initial datum. We approximate the solution in two ways, one probabilistic and one deterministic, using different approximations for both the flow and the initial datum.</description>

      <title>An Overdetermined Neumann boundary value problem with a general driving force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07063v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the existence of a family of non trivial compact subdomains $\O$ in the manifold $\mathcal{M}=\R^N\times \R/2\pi\Z, N\geq 2$ for which the overdetermined Neumann boundary value problem
  \begin{align}\label{Neumann1}
  \left \{
  \begin{aligned}
  $-\D w&amp;=\mu g(w) &amp;&amp; \qquad \text{in $ \Omega$,}$
  \frac{\partial w}{\partial\eta} &amp;=0 &amp;&amp;\qquad \text{on $\partial \Omega,$}
  w&amp;=c\ne 0 &amp;&amp;\qquad \text{on $\partial \Omega$,}
  \end{aligned}
  \right. \end{align}
  admits solutions for some $\mu &gt; 0$ and a $C^{1, \alpha}$ function $g:\R \rightarrow \R.$ The domains we construct have nonconstant principal curvature, and therefore are not isoparametric nor homogeneous. The argument we develop applies for both linear and non-linear functions $g$. By this, we generalise a recent result obtained by Fall, Weth and the first named author in \cite{Fall-MinlendI-Weth4}, where the overdetermined Neumann eigenvalue problem for the Laplacian was considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish new Harnack estimates that defy the waiting-time phenomenon for global solutions to nonlocal parabolic equations. Our technique allows us to consider general nonlocal operators with bounded measurable coefficients. Moreover, we show that a waiting-time is required for the nonlocal parabolic Harnack inequality when local solutions are considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply our idea, which previously we used in the analysis of the pure power NLS, consisting in spitting the virial inequality method into a large energy inequality combined with Kato smoothing, to the case of generalized Korteweg--De Vries pure power equations. We assume that a solution remains for all positive times very close to a soliton and then we prove an asymptotic stability result for $t\to +\infty$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electronic Schr\"odinger equation describes the motion of $N$ electrons under Coulomb interaction forces in a field of clamped nuclei. It is proved that its solutions for eigenvalues below the essential spectrum lie in the spectral Barron spaces $\mathcal{B}^s(\mathbb{R}^{3N})$ for $s&lt;1$. The example of the hydrogen ground state shows that this result cannot be improved.</description>

      <title>Well-posed geometric boundary data in General Relativity, I: Conformal-mean curvature boundary data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the local in time well-posedness of the initial boundary value problem (IBVP) for the vacuum Einstein equations in general relativity with geometric boundary conditions. For conformal-mean curvature boundary conditions, consisting of the conformal class of the boundary metric and mean curvature of the boundary, well-posedness does not hold without imposing additional angle data at the corner. When the corner angle is included as corner data, we prove well-posedness of the linearized problem in $C^{\infty}$, where the linearization is taken at any smooth vacuum Einstein metric.</description>

      <title>Regularity estimates for quasilinear elliptic PDEs in non-divergence form with Hamiltonian terms and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we investigate regularity estimates for a class of quasilinear elliptic equations in the non-divergence form that may exhibit degenerate behavior at critical points of their gradient. The prototype equation under consideration is $$ |\nabla u(x)|^{\theta}\left( \Delta_{p}^{\mathrm{N}} u(x) + \langle\mathfrak{B}(x), \nabla u\rangle \right) + \varrho(x) |\nabla u(x)|^{\sigma} = f(x) \quad \text{in} \quad B_1, $$ where $\theta &gt; 0$, $\sigma \in (\theta, \theta + 1)$, and $p \in (1, \infty)$. The coefficients $\mathfrak{B}$ and $\varrho$ are bounded continuous functions, and the source term $f \in \mathrm{C}^{0}(B_1) \cap L^{\infty}(B_1)$. We establish interior $\mathrm{C}^{1,\alpha}_{\text{loc}}$ regularity for some $\alpha \in (0,1)$, along with sharp quantitative estimates at critical points of existing solutions. Additionally, we prove a non-degeneracy property and establish both a Strong Maximum Principle and a Hopf-type lemma. In the final part, we apply our analytical framework to study existence, uniqueness, improved regularity, and non-degeneracy estimates for H\'{e}non-type models in the non-divergence form. These models incorporate strong absorption terms and linear/sublinear Hamiltonian terms and are of independent mathematical interest. Our results partially extend (for the non-variational quasilinear setting) the recent work by the second author in collaboration with Nornberg [Calc. Var. Partial Differential Equations 60 (2021), no. 6, Paper No. 202, 40 pp.], where sharp quantitative estimates were established for the fully nonlinear uniformly elliptic setting with Hamiltonian terms.</description>

      <title>Ground States of the Nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger Equation on the Tadpole Graph with a Repulsive Delta Vertex Condition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the stationary nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equation set on a tadpole graph with a repulsive delta vertex condition between the loop and the tail of the tadpole. We establish the existence of an action ground state when the size of the loop is either very small or very large. Our analysis relies on variational arguments, such as profile decomposition. When it exists, we study the shape of the ground state using ordinary differential equations arguments, such as the study of period functions. The theoretical results are completed with a numerical study.</description>

      <title>A new flow solving the LYZ equation in K\"ahler geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2105.13576v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduced a new flow to the LYZ equation on a compact K\"ahler manifold. We first show the existence of the longtime solution of the flow. We then show that under the Collins-Jacob-Yau's condition on the subsolution, the longtime solution converges to the solution of the LYZ equation, which was solved by Collins-Jacob-Yau [5] by the continuity method. Moreover, as an application of the flow, we show that on a compact K\"ahler surface, if there exists a semi-subsolution of the LYZ equation, then our flow converges smoothly to a singular solution to the LYZ equation away from a finite number of curves of negative self-intersection. Such a solution can be viewed as a boundary point of the moduli space of the LYZ solutions for a given K\"ahler metric.</description>

      <title>Volume preserving spacetime mean curvature flow and foliations of initial data sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12971v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a volume preserving curvature evolution of surfaces in an asymptotically Euclidean initial data set with positive ADM-energy. The speed is given by a nonlinear function of the mean curvature which generalizes the spacetime mean curvature recently considered by Cederbaum-Sakovich (Calc. Var. PDE, 2021). Following a classical approach by Huisken-Yau (Invent. Math., 1996), we show that the flow starting from suitably round initial surfaces exists for all times and converges to a constant (spacetime) curvature limit. This provides an alternative construction of the CSTMC foliation by Cederbaum-Sakovich and has applications in the definition of center of mass of an isolated system in General Relativity.</description>

      <title>Degree of freedom count in linear gauge invariant PDE systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider not necessarily Lagrangian partial linear differential equations (PDE) with constant coefficients. Einstein proposed a definition of the"strength" of such a field theory that defines its degree of freedom (DoF). Einsteinian strength is based on the asymptotic number of free Taylor series coefficients of bounded degree in the general solution of the PDE system. The direct count of DoF in this way is a complex and technically demanding process. Proceeding from Einsteinian strength of equations and making use of commutative algebra tools, we deduce another DoF count recipe which is formulated in terms of orders of the field equations, their gauge symmetries and gauge identities. This DoF count recipe covers the case of reducible gauge field theories, and it is easy to use. We begin with interpreting the matrix of the system as a linear map between polynomial modules. First, proceeding from Einsteinian definition, we derive an explicit formula for DoF as the multiplicity of a certain extension module. Second, we prove another explicit formula for DoF in terms of orders of equations and gauge generators. A notable consequence of this formula is that two Hermitian conjugate systems have identical DoF. Every classical field theory defines the BRST complex which has the natural grading known as the ghost number. We equip this complex with another grading, which we call differential order. This grading is 1 for every space time-derivative, while all thefields, ghosts, and antifields are assigned with this degree in a certain way, depending on their ghost number and the orders of equations and gauge generators. We compute the Euler characteristic of the BRST complex with respect to this new grading. This provides homological interpretation of DoF for linear gauge system as minus the residue at infinity of the logarithmic derivative of the Euler characteristics for its BRST complex.</description>

      <title>Contraction and concentration of measures with applications to theoretical neuroscience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic behavior of probability measures associated with stochastic dynamical systems featuring either globally contracting or $B_{r}$-contracting drift terms. While classical results often assume constant diffusion and gradient-based drifts, we extend the analysis to spatially inhomogeneous diffusion and non-integrable vector fields. We establish sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of stationary measures under global contraction, showing that convergence is preserved when the contraction rate dominates diffusion inhomogeneity. For systems contracting only outside of a compact set and with constant diffusion, we demonstrate mass concentration near the minima of an associated non-convex potential, like in multistable regimes. The theoretical findings are illustrated through Hopfield networks, highlighting implications for memory retrieval dynamics in noisy environments.</description>
