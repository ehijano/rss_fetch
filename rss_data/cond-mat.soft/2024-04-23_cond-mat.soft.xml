      <title>3D characterization of kinematic fields and poroelastic swelling near the tip of a propagating crack in a hydrogel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In fracture mechanics, polyacrylamide hydrogels have been widely used as a model material for experiments, benefited from its optical transparency, fracture brittleness, and low Rayleigh wave velocity. To describe the brittle fracture in the hydrogels, linear elastic fracture mechanics comes as the first choice. However, in soft materials such as hydrogels, the crack opening can be extremely large, leading to substantial geometric nonlinearity and material nonlinearity at the crack tip. Furthermore, poroelasticity may also modify the local mechanical state within the polymer network. Direct characterization of the kinematic fields and poroelastic effect at the crack tip is lacking. Here, based on a hybrid method of digital image correlation and particle tracking technique, we retrieved high-resolution 3D particle trajectories near the tip of a slowly propagating crack and measured the near-tip 3D kinematic fields, including the displacement fields, rotation fields, stretch fields, and swelling fields. Results confirmed the complex multi-axial stretching near the crack tip and the substantial geometric nonlinearity, particularly on the two wakes of the crack where rotation exceeds 30$^{\deg}$. Significant swelling, due to the poroelastic solvent migration, is also observed, with a strong correlation to the local stretch. Our experimental method, without any assumption of the material properties, can be readily extended to study 3D crack tips in a huge varieties of materials, and our results can shed light on the fundamental fracture mechanics and the development of material models for soft materials undergoing large multi-axial loading and substantial swelling.</description>

      <title>The Stokes-Einstein-Debye relation in ortho-terphenyl liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Stokes-Einstein-Debye (SED) relation is proposed to be breakdown in supercooled liquids by many studies. However, the conclusions are usually drawn by testing some variants of the SED relation rather than its original form. In this work, the rationality of the SED relation and its variants is examined by performing molecular dynamics simulations with the Lewis-Wahnstrom model of ortho-terphenyl (OTP). The results indicate the original SED relation is valid for OTP but the three variants are all breakdown. The inconsistency between SED relation and its variants is attributed to the adopted assumptions and approximations, heterogeneous dynamics and the interactions among molecules. Therefore, care should be taken when employing its variants to judge the validity of the SED relation in supercooled liquids.</description>

      <title>A Variational Approach to Trap Macromolecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trapping macromolecules is impoartant for the study of their conformations, interactions, dynamics and kinetic processes. Here, we develop a variational approach which self-consistently introduces a mean force that controls the center-of-mass position and a self-adjustable harmonic potential that counters the center-of-mass fluctuation. The effectiveness and versatility of our approach is verified in three classical yet not fully understood problems in polymer physics: (1) single-chain conformation in the entire solvent regimes, (2) globule-pearl necklace-coil transition of a polyelectrolyte and (3) inter-chain interaction by simultaneously trapping two polymers. The scaling relationships and $\theta$ behaviors are well captured. Conformations with large shape anisotropy appearing in charged polymers are clearly depicted. Our theoretical predictions are in quantitative agreement with experimental results reported in the literature.</description>

      <title>P\'eclet dependent Interactions of Self-Propelled Droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactions among biologically active agents is facilitated by their self-generated chemical and hydrodynamic fields. In order to elucidate the pair-wise interactions between such micro-organisms, we employ active droplets as a model system, capable of self-generating chemical and hydrodynamic fields. We demonstrate that the solute P\'eclet number ($Pe$), characterizing the relative strength of its convective to diffusive transport, plays a crucial role in determining how the chemical and hydrodynamic fields impact their interactions. Our findings reveal that at low $Pe$, the interaction is predominantly governed by chemo-repulsive effects, leading to droplets avoiding physical contact. Conversely, at elevated $Pe$, hydrodynamic interactions become more influential, leading to physical engagement. However, irrespective of $Pe$, the interaction of a droplet with the chemical trail of another droplet is always governed by chemo-repulsive effects. Furthermore, our results establish that the chemo-repulsive deflection/rebounding of droplets is influenced by the droplets' inherent chemical polarity, as determined by its $Pe$, independent of their approach orientation. Our findings offer a methodology for tuning the outcomes of binary interactions among chemically active droplets, laying the groundwork for potential studies on their collective dynamics.</description>

      <title>Internal sites of actuation and activation in thin elastic films and membranes of finite thickness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Functionalized thin elastic films and membranes frequently feature internal sites of net forces or stresses. These are, for instance, active sites of actuation, or rigid inclusions in a strained membrane that induce counterstress upon externally imposed deformations. We theoretically analyze the geometry of isotropic, flat, thin, linearly elastic films or membranes of finite thickness, laterally extended to infinity. At the mathematical core of such characterizations are the fundamental solutions for localized force and stress singularities associated with corresponding Green's functions. We derive such solutions in three dimensions and place them into the context of previous two-dimensional calculations. To this end, we consider both no-slip and stress-free conditions at the top and/or bottom surfaces. We provide an understanding for why the fully free-standing thin elastic membrane leads to diverging solutions in most geometries and compare these situations to the truly two-dimensional case. A no-slip support of at least one of the surfaces stabilizes the solution, which illustrates that the divergences in the fully free-standing case are connected to global deformations. Within the mentioned framework, our results are important for associated theoretical characterizations of thin elastic films, whether supported or free-standing, and of membranes subject to internal or external forces or stresses.</description>

      <title>Optimal frequency for undulatory motion in granular media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sand is a highly dissipative system, where the local spatial arrangements and densities depend strongly on the applied forces, resulting in fluid-like or solid-like behaviour. This makes sand swimming challenging and intriguing, raising questions about the nature of the motion and how to optimize the design of artificial swimmers able to swim in sand. Recent experiments suggest that lateral undulatory motion enables efficient locomotion, with a non-monotonic dependence of the swimming speed on the undulatory frequency and the height of the sediment bed. Here, we propose a quasi-2D granular model, where the effect of the bed height is modeled by a coarse-grained frictional force with the substrate. We show that the optimal frequency coincides with the second vibrational mode of the swimmer and explain the underlying mechanism through a characterization of the rheology of the medium. Potential implications in the design of artificial swimmers are discussed.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microphase separation is common in active biological systems as exemplified by the separation of RNA and DNA-rich phases in the cell nucleus driven by the transcriptional activity of polymerase enzymes acting similarly to amphiphiles in a microemulsion. Here we propose an analytically tractable model of an active microemulsion to investigate how the activity affects its structure and relaxation dynamics. Continuum theory derived from a lattice model exhibits two distinct regimes of the relaxation dynamics and is linked to the broken detailed balance due to intermittent activity of the amphiphiles.</description>

      <title>Dipolar order controls dielectric response of glass-forming liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dielectric response of liquids reflects both, reorientation of single molecular dipoles and collective modes, i.e., dipolar cross-correlations. A recent theory predicts the latter to produce an additional slow peak in the dielectric loss spectrum. Following this idea we argue that in supercooled liquids the high-frequency power law exponent of the dielectric loss $\beta$ should be correlated with the degree of dipolar order, i.e., the Kirkwood correlation factor $g_K$. This notion is confirmed for 25 supercooled liquids. While our findings support recent theoretical work the results are shown to violate the earlier Kivelson-Madden theory.</description>

      <title>A universal material model subroutine for soft matter systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soft materials play an integral part in many aspects of modern life including autonomy, sustainability, and human health, and their accurate modeling is critical to understand their unique properties and functions. Today's finite element analysis packages come with a set of pre-programmed material models, which may exhibit restricted validity in capturing the intricate mechanical behavior of these materials. Regrettably, incorporating a modified or novel material model in a finite element analysis package requires non-trivial in-depth knowledge of tensor algebra, continuum mechanics, and computer programming, making it a complex task that is prone to human error. Here we design a universal material subroutine, which automates the integration of novel constitutive models of varying complexity in non-linear finite element packages, with no additional analytical derivations and algorithmic implementations. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach to seamlessly integrate innovative constituent models from the material point to the structural level through a variety of soft matter case studies: a frontal impact to the brain; reconstructive surgery of the scalp; diastolic loading of arteries and the human heart; and the dynamic closing of the tricuspid valve. Our universal material subroutine empowers all users, not solely experts, to conduct reliable engineering analysis of soft matter systems. We envision that this framework will become an indispensable instrument for continued innovation and discovery within the soft matter community at large.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the stochastic thermodynamics of micro-magnetic systems. We first formulate the stochastic dynamics of micro-magnetic systems by incorporating noises into Landau-Lifshitz (LL) equation, which describes the irreversible and deterministic dynamics of magnetic moments. The resulting stochastic Landau-Lifshitz (sLL) equation obeys detailed balance, which guarantees that, with the external field fixed, the system converges to thermodynamic equilibrium with vanishing entropy production and with non-vanishing probability current. We then discuss various thermodynamic variables both at the trajectory level and at the ensemble level, and further establish both the first and the second laws of thermodynamics. Finally, we establish fluctuation theorems, and verify them using numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Odd dipole screening in disordered matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09942v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Disordered solids, straddling the solid-fluid boundary, lack a comprehensive continuum mechanical description. They exhibit a complex microstructure wherein multiple meta-stable states exist. Deforming disordered solids induces particles rearrangements enabling the system to transition between meta-stable states. A dramatic consequence of these transitions is that quasistatic deformation cycles modify the reference state, facilitating the storage and release of mechanical energy. Here we develop a continuum mechanical theory of disordered solids, which accounts for the absence of a reference state and the lack of conserved potential energy. Our theory, which introduces a new modulus describing non-conservative mechanical screening, reduces to classical elasticity in the absence of screening. We analytically derive predictions for the deformation field for various perturbations and geometries. While our theory applies to general disordered solids, we focus on a two-dimensional disordered granular system and predict accurately the non-affine displacement fields observed in experiments for both small and large deformations, along with the observable vanishing shear modulus. The new proposed moduli satisfy universal relations that are independent of the specific experimental realization. Our work thus forms the basis of an entirely new family of continuum descriptions of the mechanics of disordered solids.</description>

Abstract: We study the spontaneous configuration transitions of an active semi-flexible polymer between {\it spiral} and {\it non-spiral} states, and show that the configuration dynamics is fully described by a {\it subcritical pitchfork} bifurcation. Exploiting the fact that active polymer barely moves in {\it spiral} states and exhibits net displacements in {\it non-spiral} states, we theoretically prove that the motion of the active polymer is consistent with a {\it run-and-tumble}-like dynamics. Moreover, we find that there exists an {\it optimal} self-propelling {\it force}, at which the probabilities of finding the polymer in the {\it spiral} and {\it non-spiral} state become equal, that maximizes the diffusion coefficient.</description>

      <title>Global self$-$similarity of dense granular flow in hopper: the role of hopper width</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01810v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The influence of hopper width on dense granular flow in a two$-$dimensional hopper is investigated through experiments and simulations. Though the flow rate remains stable for larger hopper widths, a slight reduction in hopper width results in a significant increase in flow rate for smaller hopper widths. Both Beverloo\('\)s and Janda\('\)s formula accurately capture the relationship between the flow rate and outlet size. Flow characteristics in the regions near the outlet exhibit local self$-$similarity, supporting Beverloo and Janda's principles. Moreover, global self$-$similarity is analysed, indicated by the transition in flow state from mass flow in regions far from the outlet to funnel flow near the outlet. The earlier occurrence of this transition favors to enhance the grain velocity and consequently increases the dense flow rate. An exponential scaling law is proposed to describe the dependencies of flow rate, grain velocity, and transition height between the mass flow pattern and the funnel flow pattern on silo width.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discover unexpected connections between packing configurations and rare fluctuations in dense systems of active particles subject to pulsation of size. Using large deviation theory, we examine biased ensembles which select atypical realizations of the dynamics exhibiting high synchronization in particle size. We show that the order emerging at high bias can manifest as distinct dynamical states with either a finite or a vanishing size current. Remarkably, transitions between these states arise from changing the system geometry at fixed bias and constant density. We rationalize such transitions as stemming from a change in the packing configurations favored by the geometry. Specifically, we reveal that a master curve in the unbiased dynamics, correlating polydispersity and current, helps predict the dynamical state emerging in the biased dynamics. Finally, we demonstrate that deformation waves can propagate under suitable geometries when biasing with local order.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal pattern formation of conserved fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.08868v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, nonreciprocally coupled systems have received growing attention. Previous work has shown that the interplay of nonreciprocal coupling and Goldstone modes can drive the emergence of temporal order such as traveling waves. We show that these phenomena are generically found in a broad class of pattern-forming systems, including mass-conserving reaction--diffusion systems and viscoelastic active gels. All these systems share a characteristic dispersion relation that acquires a non-zero imaginary part at the edge of the band of unstable modes and exhibit a regime of propagating structures (traveling wave bands or droplets). We show that models for these systems can be mapped to a common "normal form" that can be seen as a spatially extended generalization of the FitzHugh--Nagumo model, providing a unifying dynamical-systems perspective. We show that the minimal nonreciprocal Cahn--Hilliard (NRCH) equations exhibit a surprisingly rich set of behaviors, including interrupted coarsening of traveling waves without selection of a preferred wavelength and transversal undulations of wave fronts in two dimensions. We show that the emergence of traveling waves and their speed are precisely predicted from the local dispersion relation at interfaces far away from the homogeneous steady state. Our work thus generalizes previously studied nonreciprocal phase transitions and shows that interfaces are the relevant collective excitations governing the rich dynamical patterns of conserved fields.</description>
