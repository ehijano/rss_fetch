      <title>Nonlinear fluctuations for a chain of weakly anharmonic oscillators with stochastic perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the fluctuations of the phonon modes in a one-dimensional chain of anharmonic oscillators where the deterministic Hamiltonian dynamics is perturbed by random exchanges of momentum between nearest neighbor particles. There are three locally conserved quantities: volume, momentum and energy. We study the evolution in equilibrium of the fluctuation fields of the two phonon modes (linear combination of the volume stretch and momentum), on a diffusive space-time scale after recentering on their sound velocities. We show that, weakening the anharmonicity with the scale parameter, the recentered phonon fluctuations fields converge to the stationary solutions of two uncoupled stochastic Burgers equations. The nonlinearity in the Burgers equation depends on the presence of a cubic term in the anharmonic potential (corresponding to the $\alpha$-FPUT dynamics). Main ingredients of the proof, based on a compactness argument for the Dynkin's martingale decomposition, are the second-order Boltzmann-Gibbs principle, as well as equipartition of energy, to characterize the nonlinear term and Riemann-Lebesgue estimates showing that fields with diverging velocity to different directions have no interaction in the limit.</description>

      <title>Large deviation principles for the Gross Pitaevskii Gibbs measure at low temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the large deviation principle for the conditional Gibbs measure associated with the focusing Gross Pitaevskii equation in the low temperature regime. This conditional measure is of mixed type, being canonical in energy and microcanonical in particle number. In particular, our result extends the large deviation principle for the mixed ensemble studied by Ellis, Jordan, Otto, and Turkington to a more singular setting, where the interaction potential is unbounded and the conditional event involves diverging renormalization constants. As a consequence of the large deviation principle, the Gibbs measure concentrates along the soliton manifold in the low temperature limit.</description>

      <title>Stochastic optimal transport for the Langevin dynamics and its zero--mass limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a stochastic optimal transport for the Langevin dynamics with positive mass and study its zero--mass limit. The new aspect of this paper is that we only fix the initial and terminal probability distributions of the positions of particles under consideration, but not those of their velocities with Heisenberg's uncertainty principle in mind. In the zero--mass limit, we show that the minimizer of our stochastic optimal transport is tight if and only if the initial momentum of a particle converges to zero. We also show that the limit of a minimizer of our stochastic optimal transport is a minimizer of a standard stochastic optimal transport for continuous semimartingales.</description>

      <title>Skeletons and Spectra: Bernoulli graphings are relatively Ramanujan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to investigate the spectral theory of unimodular random graphs and graphings representing them. We prove that Bernoulli graphings are relatively Ramanujan with respect to their skeleton Markov chain. That is, the part of their spectrum that comes from the random labels falls within the appropriate Alon-Boppana bound. This result complements an example due to Fr\k{a}czyk of an ergodic unimodular random graph with almost sure spectral gap but non-expanding Bernoulli graphing.
  We also highlight connections of our work with the theory of finite random graphs. Exploiting the result of Bordenave and Collins on random lifts being relatively almost Ramanujan, we prove a strengthening of our main theorem for unimodular quasi-transitive quasi-trees.</description>

      <title>Diameter and mixing time of the giant component in the percolated hypercube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider bond percolation on the $d$-dimensional binary hypercube with $p=c/d$ for fixed $c&gt;1$. We prove that the typical diameter of the giant component $L_1$ is of order $\Theta(d)$, and the typical mixing time of the lazy random walk on $L_1$ is of order $\Theta(d^2)$. This resolves long-standing open problems of Bollob\'as, Kohayakawa and {\L}uczak from 1994, and of Benjamini and Mossel from 2003.
  A key component in our approach is a new tight large deviation estimate on the number of vertices in $L_1$ whose proof includes several novel ingredients: a structural description of the residue outside the giant component after sprinkling, a tight quantitative estimate on the spread of the giant in the hypercube, and a stability principle which rules out the disintegration of large connected sets under thinning. This toolkit further allows us to obtain optimal bounds on the expansion in $L_1$.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Gaussianity of the 2D stochastic Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the qualitative properties of solutions to the 2D stochastic Navier-Stokes equations with forcing that is white in time and coloured in space. Our main result shows that the unique invariant measure of this system is equivalent to that of the corresponding Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.
  Our method relies on a generalization of the "time-shifted Girsanov method" of [MS05, MRS22] to compare the laws of time marginals for dissipative SPDEs. This generalisation allows to not only compare solutions to a nonlinear equation to those of the corresponding linear equation, but also to directly compare two nonlinear equations. We use this to establish equivalence of the Navier-Stokes system to a "twisted" nonlinear system that leaves the Gaussian measure invariant. We further apply this method to establish similar equivalence statements for a family of hypoviscous Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

      <title>Eddy viscosity by L\'evy transport noises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider stochastic 2D Euler equations with $L^2$-initial vorticity and driven by L\'evy transport noise in the Marcus sense. Under a suitable scaling limit of the noises, we prove that the weak solutions converge weakly to the unique solution of the deterministic 2D Navier-Stokes equation. This shows that small scale jump noises generate eddy viscosity, extending the recent studies on It\^o-Stratonovich diffusion limit to discontinuous setting.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Burgers Equation from Non-Product Stationary Measures via a Generalised Second-Order Boltzmann-Gibbs Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a generalised second-order Boltzmann-Gibbs principle for conservative interacting particle systems on a lattice whose stationary measures are not of product type and not invariant under particle jumps. The result, which requires neither a spectral gap bound nor an equivalence of ensembles, extends the classical framework to settings with correlated invariant measures and is based on quantitative bounds for the correlation decay. As an application, we show that the equilibrium density fluctuations of the Katz-Lebowitz-Spohn model with a given choice of parameters converge, under diffusive scaling, to the stationary energy solution of the stochastic Burgers equation.</description>

      <title>Coalescence in Markov chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Markov chain $X^i$ on a finite state space $S$ has transition matrix $P$ and initial state $i$. We may run the chains $(X^i: i\in S)$ in parallel, while insisting that any two such chains coalesce whenever they are simultaneously at the same state. There are $|S|$ trajectories which evolve separately, but not necessarily independently, prior to coalescence. What can be said about the number $k(\mu)$ of coalescence classes of the process, and what is the set $K(P)$ of such numbers $k(\mu)$, as the coupling $\mu$ of the chains ranges over couplings that are consistent with $P$? We continue earlier work of the authors ('Non-coupling from the past', $\textit{In and Out of Equilibrium 3}$, Springer, 2021) on these two fundamental questions, which have special importance for the 'coupling from the past' algorithm.
  We concentrate partly on a family of couplings termed block measures, which may be viewed as couplings of lumpable chains with coalescing lumps. Constructions of such couplings are presented, and also of non-block measure with similar properties.</description>

      <title>Near-critical Ornstein--Zernike theory for the planar random-cluster model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an Ornstein--Zernike theory for the two-dimensional random-cluster model with $1 \leq q &lt;4$ that also applies in its near-critical regime. In particular, we prove an asymptotic formula for the two-point function which holds uniformly for~$p &lt; p_c$ and blends the subcritical and near-critical behaviours of the model.
  The analysis is carried out by studying the renewal properties of a subcritical percolation cluster, \emph{at the scale of the correlation length}. More precisely, we explore sequentially the cluster in a given direction, by slices of thickness comparable to the correlation length. We show that this exploration satisfies the properties of a {\em killed Markov renewal process} -- a class of processes that may be analysed independently and have Brownian behaviour. In addition to the two-point function estimate, we derive other consequences of the Ornstein--Zernike theory such as an invariance principle for the rescaled cluster and the strict convexity of the inverse correlation length -- all at the scale of the correlation length, uniformly in~$p&lt;p_c$.
  Finally, our approach differs from that of earlier papers of Campanino, Ioffe, Velenik and others, with the cluster being dynamically explored rather than constructed from its diamond decomposition.</description>

      <title>On the energy image density conjecture of Bouleau and Hirsch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We affirmatively resolve the energy image density conjecture of Bouleau and Hirsch (1986). Beyond the original framework of Dirichlet structures, we establish the energy image density property in several related settings. In particular, we formulate a version of the property that encompasses strongly local, regular Dirichlet forms, Sobolev spaces defined via upper gradients, and self-similar energies on fractals, thereby unifying these under a single framework. As applications, we prove the finiteness of the martingale dimension for diffusions satisfying sub-Gaussian heat kernel bounds, and we obtain a new proof of a conjecture of Cheeger concerning the Hausdorff dimension of the images of differentiability charts in PI spaces. The proof of the energy image density property is based on a structure theorem for measures and normal currents in $\mathbb{R}^n$ due to De Philippis--Rindler, together with the notions of decomposability bundles due to Alberti--Marchese and cone null sets due to Alberti--Cs\"ornyei--Preiss and Bate.</description>

      <title>The $p$-$\theta$ relation in mating of trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the mating-of-trees approach to Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE) and Liouville quantum gravity (LQG), it is natural to consider two pairs of correlated Brownian motions coupled together. This arises in the scaling limit of bipolar-orientation-decorated planar maps (Gwynne-Holden-Sun, 2016) and in the related skew Brownian permuton studied by Borga et al. There are two parameters that can be used to index the coupling between the two pairs of Brownian motions, denoted as $p$ and $\theta$ in the literature: $p$ describes the Brownian motions, whereas $\theta$ describes the SLE curves on LQG surfaces. In this paper, we derive an exact relation between the two parameters and demonstrate its application to computing statistics of the skew Brownian permuton. Our derivation relies on the synergy between mating-of-trees and Liouville conformal field theory (LCFT), where the boundary three-point function in LCFT provide the exact solvable inputs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Internal Diffusion Limited Aggregation is an interacting particle system that describes the growth of a random cluster governed by the boundary harmonic measure seen from an internal point. Our paper studies IDLA in $\mathbb{Z}^d$ driven by critical branching random walks. We prove that, unlike classical IDLA, this process exhibits a phase transition in the dimension. More precisely, we establish the existence of a spherical shape theorem in dimension $d\geq 3$ and the absence of a spherical shape theorem for $d \leq 2$. Our bounds on the inner and outer worst deviations are of polynomial nature, which we expect to be a feature of this model.</description>

      <title>Finding a Nash equilibrium of a random win-lose game in expected polynomial time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A long-standing open problem in algorithmic game theory asks whether or not there is a polynomial time algorithm to compute a Nash equilibrium in a random bimatrix game. We study random win-lose games, where the entries of the $n\times n$ payoff matrices are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Bernoulli random variables with parameter $p=p(n)$. We prove that, for nearly all values of the parameter $p=p(n)$, there is an expected polynomial-time algorithm to find a Nash equilibrium in a random win-lose game. More precisely, if $p\sim cn^{-a}$ for some parameters $a,c\ge 0$, then there is an expected polynomial-time algorithm whenever $a\not\in \{1/2, 1\}$. In addition, if $a = 1/2$ there is an efficient algorithm if either $c \le e^{-52} 2^{-8} $ or $c\ge 0.977$. If $a=1$, then there is an expected polynomial-time algorithm if either $c\le 0.3849$ or $c\ge \log^9 n$.</description>

      <title>Structure of solutions to continuous constraint satisfaction problems through the statistics of wedged and inscribed spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of random landscapes has long relied on counting stationary points: metastable states and the barriers between them. However, this method is useless for describing flat regions, common in constraint satisfaction problems. We introduce a characterization of flat regions by counting the number of spheres that can be uniquely inserted into them, either by wedging spheres of fixed radius or by inscribing spheres of variable radius. The ratio of these counts constrains the topology of the solution space. We apply this characterization to the spherical perceptron and show the existence of at least two topological regimes.</description>

For each $X_n$, one chooses an independent modulating random vector $\Xi_n \in \mathbb{R}^{d_n}$ and forms the projection $Y_n = \Xi_n'X_n$. It is shown, under regularity conditions on $X_n$ and $\Xi_n$, that $Y_n|\Xi_n$ converges weakly in probability to a normal distribution. More broadly, the conditional joint distribution of a family of projections constructed from random samples from $X_n$ and $\Xi_n$ is shown to converge weakly to a matrix normal distribution. We derive, \textit{via} G. P\'olya's characterization of the normal distribution, a necessary and sufficient condition on $Y_n$ for $\Xi_n$ to be normally distributed. When $\Xi_n$ has a spherically symmetric distribution we deduce, through I. J. Schoenberg's characterization of the spherically symmetric characteristic functions on Hilbert spaces, that the probability density function of $Y_n|\Xi_n$ converges pointwise in certain $p$th means to a mixture of normal densities and the rate of convergence is quantified, resulting in uniform convergence. The cumulative distribution function of $Y_n|\Xi_n$ is shown to converge uniformly in those $p$th means to the distribution function of the same mixture, and a Lipschitz property is obtained. Examples of distributions satisfying our results are provided; these include Bingham distributions on hyperspheres of random radii, uniform distributions on hyperspheres and hypercubes of random volumes, and multivariate normal distributions; and examples of such $\Xi_n$ include the multivariate $t$-, multivariate Laplace, and spherically symmetric stable distributions.</description>

      <title>Average-case thresholds for exact regularization of linear programs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Small regularizers can preserve linear programming solutions exactly. This paper provides the first average-case analysis of exact regularization: with a standard Gaussian cost vector and fixed constraint set, bounds are established for the probability that exact regularization succeeds as a function of regularization strength. Failure is characterized via the Gaussian measure of inner cones, controlled by novel two-sided bounds on the measure of shifted cones. Results reveal dimension-dependent scaling laws and connect exact regularization of linear programs to their polyhedral geometry via the normal fan and the Gaussian (solid-angle) measure of its cones. Computable bounds are obtained in several canonical settings, including regularized optimal transport. Numerical experiments corroborate the predicted scalings and thresholds.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically optimal reinforcement learning in Block Markov Decision Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The curse of dimensionality renders Reinforcement Learning (RL) impractical in many real-world settings with exponentially large state and action spaces. Yet, many environments exhibit exploitable structure that can accelerate learning. To formalize this idea, we study RL in Block Markov Decision Processes (BMDPs). BMDPs model problems with large observation spaces, but where transition dynamics are fully determined by latent states. Recent advances in clustering methods have enabled the efficient recovery of this latent structure. However, a regret analysis that exploits these techniques to determine their impact on learning performance remained open. We are now addressing this gap by providing a regret analysis that explicitly leverages clustering, demonstrating that accurate latent state estimation can indeed effectively speed up learning.
  Concretely, this paper analyzes a two-phase RL algorithm for BMDPs that first learns the latent structure through random exploration and then switches to an optimism-guided strategy adapted to the uncovered structure. This algorithm achieves a regret that is $O(\sqrt{T}+n)$ on a large class of BMDPs susceptible to clustering. Here, $T$ denotes the number of time steps, $n$ is the cardinality of the observation space, and the Landau notation $O(\cdot)$ holds up to constants and polylogarithmic factors. This improves the best prior bound, $O(\sqrt{T}+n^2)$, especially when $n$ is large. Moreover, we prove that no algorithm can achieve lower regret uniformly on this same class of BMDPs. This establishes that, on this class, the algorithm achieves asymptotic optimality.</description>

Abstract: Two-pointed quantum disks with a weight parameter $W&gt;0$ is a canonical family of finite-volume random surfaces in Liouville quantum gravity. We extend the conformal welding of quantum disks in [AHS23] to the non-simple regime, and give a construction of the multiple SLE associated with any given link pattern for $\kappa\in(4,8)$. Our proof is based on connections between SLE and Liouville conformal field theory (LCFT), where we show that in the conformal welding of multiple forested quantum disks, the surface after welding can be described in terms of LCFT, and the random conformal moduli contains the SLE partition function for the interfaces as a multiplicative factor. As a corollary, for $\kappa\in(4,8)$, we prove the existence of the multiple SLE partition functions, which are smooth functions satisfying a system of PDEs and conformal covariance.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove in a very weak regularity setting existence and uniqueness of quasi-stationary distributions as well as exponential conver- gence towards the quasi-stationary distribution for the generalized Langevin and the Nos{\'e}-Hoover processes, two processes which are widely used in molecular dynamics. The case of singular potentials is considered. With the techniques used in this work, we are also able to greatly improve existing results on quasi-stationary distributions for the kinetic Langevin process to a weak regularity setting.</description>

Abstract: We give a substitute to Feller property for semigroups of time-changed processes; under some conditions this leads to establish sufficient (new) conditions for the semigroups to be Feller. Moreover, given a standard process and a sequence of measures converging vaguely to a final measure, under some assumptions, we establish convergence of the sequence of the semigroups and the resolvents of the corresponding time changed-processes. Some applications are given: convergence of solutions of evolution equations and convergence of finite time distributions, as well as weak convergence of the related processes.</description>

Abstract: We take scaling limits of the Bouchaud and Dean trap model on Parisi's tree in time scales where the dynamics is either ergodic (close to equilibrium) or aging (far from equilibrium). These results follow from a continuity theorem formulated for a certain kind of process on trees, which we call a cascading jump evolution, defined in terms of a collection of jump functions, with a cascading structure given by the tree.</description>

We then build on this work to formalize the construction of the product of an arbitrary family of probability measures.</description>

      <title>Delocalization of Non-Mean-Field Random Matrices in Dimensions $d\ge 3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study $N \times N$ random band matrices $H = (H_{xy})$ with mean-zero complex Gaussian entries, where $x,y$ lie on the discrete torus $(\mathbb{Z} / \sqrt[d]{N} \mathbb{Z})^d$ in dimensions $d \ge 3$. The variance profile satisfies $\mathbb{E}|H_{xy}|^2 = S_{xy}$, with $S_{xy} = 0$ whenever the distance between $x$ and $y$ exceeds a bandwidth parameter $W$. We prove that if $W \geq N^{\mathfrak{c}}$ for some constant $\mathfrak{c} &gt; 0$, then in the large-$N$ limit, bulk eigenvectors are delocalized, quantum unique ergodicity (QUE) holds, and the local bulk eigenvalue statistics are universal. Our proof is based on the tree approximation of the loop hierarchy (arXiv:2501.01718) and diagrammatic techniques developed in earlier works (arXiv:1807.02447, arXiv:2104.12048, arXiv:2107.05795, arXiv:2412.15207, arXiv:2503.07606).
  Besides random band matrices, we also study two classical non-mean-field random matrix models: the Wegner orbital and the block Anderson models. Specifically, we consider Hermitian matrices $H = V + g \Psi$ on the same discrete torus $(\mathbb{Z} / \sqrt[d]{N} \mathbb{Z})^d$, where $V$ is a random block potential consisting of i.i.d. complex Gaussian diagonal blocks of size $W^d \times W^d$, and $\Psi$ encodes the interactions between neighboring blocks -- random in the Wegner orbital model and deterministic in the block Anderson model. The parameter $g &gt; 0$ represents the coupling strength between blocks. Assuming again that $W \geq N^{\mathfrak{c}}$, we establish delocalization of bulk eigenvectors, QUE, and bulk universality under the condition $W^{-d/2+\varepsilon}\le g \le \varepsilon^{-1}$ for any small constant $\varepsilon&gt;0$. Combined with the localization results of arXiv:1608.02922 for $g \ll W^{-d/2}$, this identifies a localization--delocalization transition at the scale $g=W^{-d/2}$ in dimensions $d \ge 3$.</description>

      <title>Pathwise Patching: A Geometric Construction of Quasi-Sure Solutions to G-SDEs and the Fundamental Role of the Path Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06054v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a geometric framework for constructing quasi-sure solutions to stochastic differential equations under model uncertainty. We introduce a pathwise patching methodology that builds universal solutions directly on the path space, establishing a direct link between probabilistic formulations and pathwise structures.
  The construction leverages the strengthened uniqueness theory of Malliavin calculus, which ensures pathwise uniqueness for a broad class of equations beyond classical settings. This enhanced uniqueness property directly facilitates the path compatibility essential to our approach-solutions defined under different probability measures can be consistently combined into a single universal process.
  We prove that when an SDE admits unique solutions in the Malliavin sense under each measure, our method yields a universally measurable process that serves as the unique quasi-sure solution to the corresponding G-SDE. The resulting process exhibits both global uniqueness and universal measurability, providing mathematical foundations for applications in stochastic control and robust finance.
  This work demonstrates how local probabilistic descriptions naturally generate global pathwise structures through systematic patching, offering a unified perspective on G-expectation and related theories.</description>

Abstract: We explicitly connect (discrete-time) quantum walks on Z with a four-state Markov additive process via a Feynman-type formula (2.5). Using this representation, we derive a relation between the spectral decomposition of the Markov additive process and the limiting density of the homogeneous quantum walk. In addition, we consider a space-time rescaling of quantum walks, which leads to a system of quantum transport PDEs in continuous time and space with a phase interaction term. Our probabilistic representation for this type of PDE offers an efficient Monte Carlo computational technique.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.09680v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Replication of genetic material is an important process for all living organisms. Origins of replication initiate the copying of DNA at many points on a chromosome, and it is the distribution of these points that is relevant here, as it presents us with an interesting stochastic process. It was observed by Newman et al. that for various types of yeast cells, there were fewer very small inter-origin spacings, and fewer very large inter-origin spacings in the replication origin data than would be expected if the origins were uncorrelated, random points. We propose a very simple stochastic model for DNA replication and determine that this probabilistic process produces replication origins that display repulsion between origins and relative scarcity of large spacings. We detail some connections between this model and existing polynuclear or polymer growth models.</description>

Abstract: The Lie--Trotter product formula is a foundational approximation for the quantum partition function, yet obtaining rigorous error bounds for the unbounded Hamiltonians common in physics remains a significant challenge. This paper provides a quantitative error analysis for this approximation across two key systems. For a particle in a smooth, periodic potential, we establish an optimal convergence rate of $\mathcal O(1/N^2)$ for both the partition function and thermal averages, where $N$ is the number of imaginary time steps. We then extend this analysis to the more challenging case of a confining potential on $\mathbb R$, proving a nearly optimal rate of $\mathcal O((\log N+1)^{\frac32}/N^2)$. The derived error bounds provide a firm mathematical foundation for the high-order accuracy of path integral simulations in quantum statistical mechanics.</description>

      <title>Partial Regularity for the Three-dimensional Stochastic Ericksen--Leslie equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the global existence of martingale suitable weak solutions to stochastic Ericksen-Leslie equations with additive noise in a 3D torus. The notion of suitable weak solutions has been introduced to address possible emergence of finite-time singularities, which remains a notably challenging question in the field of fluid dynamics. Weak solutions offer an approach to account for these potential singularities. A restricted class of weak solutions that exhibit a higher level of regularity, and are therefore more likely to be physically meaningful, is naturally called for. Consequently, suitable weak solutions -- that is, weak solutions that satisfy a local energy inequality -- have become a focus of research, including investigations into how regular these solutions can be. In this article, we prove that, despite the presence of white noise, the paths of martingale suitable weak solutions of 3D stochastic Ericksen-Leslie equations exhibit singular points of one-dimensional parabolic Hausdorff measure zero. To establish this result, we utilize two techniques that can potentially be generalized to handle other stochastically forced complex fluid dynamics equations with a similar structure. First, a local energy-preserving approximation is constructed, which markedly facilitates the proof of the global existence of martingale suitable weak solutions. Second, to demonstrate partial regularity of these solutions, a blow-up argument is formulated, which efficiently yields the desired key estimate.</description>

      <title>On fluctuations of Coulomb systems and universality of the Heine distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of external potentials on the complex plane $\mathbb{C}$ for which the coincidence set to the obstacle problem contains a Jordan curve in the exterior of the droplet. We refer to this curve as a spectral outpost. We study the corresponding Coulomb gas at $\beta=2$. Generalizing recent work in the radially symmetric case, we prove that the number of particles which fall near the spectral outpost has an asymptotic Heine distribution, as the number of particles $n\to\infty$.We also consider a class of potentials with disconnected droplets whose connected components are separated by a ring-shaped spectral gap. We prove that the fluctuations of the number of particles that fall near a given component has an asymptotic discrete normal distribution, which depends on $n$. For the case of disconnected droplets we also consider fluctuations of general smooth linear statistics and show that they tend to distribute as the sum of a Gaussian field and an independent, oscillatory, discrete Gaussian field. Our techniques involve a new asymptotic formula on the norm of monic orthogonal polynomials in the bifurcation regime and a variant of the method of limit Ward identities of Ameur, Hedenmalm, and Makarov.</description>

      <title>Pathwise guessing in categorical time series with unbounded alphabets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06547v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The following learning problem arises naturally in various applications: Given a finite sample from a categorical or count time series, can we learn a function of the sample that (nearly) maximizes the probability of correctly guessing the values of a given portion of the data using the values from the remaining parts? Unlike classical approaches in statistical inference, our approach avoids explicitly estimating the conditional probabilities.
  We propose a non-parametric guessing function with a learning rate independent of the alphabet size. Our analysis focuses on a broad class of time series models that encompasses finite-order Markov chains, some hidden Markov chains, Poisson regression for count processes, and one-dimensional Gibbs measures.
  We provide a margin condition that controls the rate of convergence for the risk. Additionally, we establish a minimax lower bound for the convergence rate of the risk associated with our guessing problem. This lower bound matches the upper bound achieved by our estimator up to a logarithmic factor, demonstrating its near-optimality.</description>

      <title>Yet Another Distributional Bellman Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider non-standard Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) where the target function is not only a simple expectation of the accumulated reward. Instead, we consider rather general functionals of the joint distribution of terminal state and accumulated reward which have to be optimized. For finite state and compact action space, we show how to solve these problems by defining a lifted MDP whose state space is the space of distributions over the true states of the process. We derive a Bellman equation in this setting, which can be considered as a distributional Bellman equation. Well-known cases like the standard MDP and quantile MDPs are shown to be special examples of our framework. We also apply our model to a variant of an optimal transport problem.</description>

      <title>Non-convex entropic mean-field optimization via Best Response flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of minimizing non-convex functionals on the space of probability measures, regularized by the relative entropy (KL divergence) with respect to a fixed reference measure, as well as the corresponding problem of solving entropy-regularized non-convex-non-concave min-max problems. We utilize the Best Response flow (also known in the literature as the fictitious play flow) and study how its convergence is influenced by the relation between the degree of non-convexity of the functional under consideration, the regularization parameter and the tail behaviour of the reference measure. In particular, we demonstrate how to choose the regularizer, given the non-convex functional, so that the Best Response operator becomes a contraction with respect to the $L^1$-Wasserstein distance, which ensures the existence of its unique fixed point that is then shown to be the unique global minimizer for our optimization problem. This extends recent results where the Best Response flow was applied to solve convex optimization problems regularized by the relative entropy with respect to arbitrary reference measures, and with arbitrary values of the regularization parameter. Our results explain precisely how the assumption of convexity can be relaxed, at the expense of making a specific choice of the regularizer. Additionally, we demonstrate how these results can be applied in reinforcement learning in the context of policy optimization for Markov Decision Processes and Markov games with softmax parametrized policies in the mean-field regime.</description>

      <title>Short, Quantitative Construction of the IIC in Planar Percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is standard to construct the Incipient Infinite Cluster as the limit of the critical percolation measure conditioned on 0 being connected to radius n, as n tends to infinity. We provide a short proof of that convergence in the planar setting. A key step in the proof is to introduce an unbiased percolation configuration above which are coupled two percolations conditioned on 0 being connected to different radii. It implies a speed of convergence in total variation distance to the IIC measure upper-bounded by the dual one-arm probability, which is the first occurrence of an explicit upperbound.</description>

      <title>A coupling-based approach to f-divergences diagnostics for Markov chain Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07559v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A long-standing gap exists between the theoretical analysis of Markov chain Monte Carlo convergence, which is often based on statistical divergences, and the diagnostics used in practice. We introduce the first general convergence diagnostics for Markov chain Monte Carlo based on any f-divergence, allowing users to directly monitor, among others, the Kullback--Leibler and the $\chi^2$ divergences as well as the Hellinger and the total variation distances. Our first key contribution is a coupling-based `weight harmonization' scheme that produces a direct, computable, and consistent weighting of interacting Markov chains with respect to their target distribution. The second key contribution is to show how such consistent weightings of empirical measures can be used to provide upper bounds to f-divergences in general. We prove that these bounds are guaranteed to tighten over time and converge to zero as the chains approach stationarity, providing a concrete diagnostic. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our method is a practical and competitive diagnostic tool.</description>
