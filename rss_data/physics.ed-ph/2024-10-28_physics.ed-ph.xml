      <title>Assessing Confidence in AI-Assisted Grading of Physics Exams through Psychometrics: An Exploratory Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the use of artificial intelligence in grading high-stakes physics exams, emphasizing the application of psychometric methods, particularly Item Response Theory (IRT), to evaluate the reliability of AI-assisted grading. We examine how grading rubrics can be iteratively refined and how threshold parameters can determine when AI-generated grades are reliable versus when human intervention is necessary. By adjusting thresholds for correctness measures and uncertainty, AI can grade with high precision, significantly reducing grading workloads while maintaining accuracy. Our findings show that AI can achieve a coefficient of determination of $R^2\approx 0.91$ when handling half of the grading load, and $R^2 \approx 0.96$ for one-fifth of the load. These results demonstrate AI's potential to assist in grading large-scale assessments, reducing both human effort and associated costs. However, the study underscores the importance of human oversight in cases of uncertainty or complex problem-solving, ensuring the integrity of the grading process.</description>

      <title>Outreach, educational activities and communication of the ALICE collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Outreach and communication with the public is an integral part of our work as researchers. A wide range of activities and platforms allow ALICE members to share, especially with the young generation, the excitement of our field. ALICE Masterclasses for high-school students, both in-person and online, are expanding, reaching a higher number of students every year. Visits to the experiment site, especially to the underground installations when the LHC schedule allows, are very popular; the large demand also serves to motivate ALICE members to get involved as guides. The surface exhibition offers a glimpse to both the physics and the variety of detectors of ALICE. Virtual visits are also popular, and the growing use of social media platforms like Instagram brings the excitement of the physics of the quark-gluon plasma to new audiences of different ages and interests.</description>
