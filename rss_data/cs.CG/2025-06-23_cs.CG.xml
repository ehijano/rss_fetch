      <title>Local Routing on Ordered $\Theta$-graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of locally routing on geometric networks using limited memory is extensively studied in computational geometry. We consider one particular graph, the ordered $\Theta$-graph, which is significantly harder to route on than the $\Theta$-graph, for which a number of routing algorithms are known. Currently, no local routing algorithm is known for the ordered $\Theta$-graph.
  We prove that, unfortunately, there does not exist a deterministic memoryless local routing algorithm that works on the ordered $\Theta$-graph. This motivates us to consider allowing a small amount of memory, and we present a deterministic $O(1)$-memory local routing algorithm that successfully routes from the source to the destination on the ordered $\Theta$-graph. We show that our local routing algorithm converges to the destination in $O(n)$ hops, where $n$ is the number of vertices. To the best of our knowledge, our algorithm is the first deterministic local routing algorithm that is guaranteed to reach the destination on the ordered $\Theta$-graph.</description>

      <title>Wavelet-based Global Orientation and Surface Reconstruction for Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unoriented surface reconstruction is an important task in computer graphics and has extensive applications. Based on the compact support of wavelet and orthogonality properties, classic wavelet surface reconstruction achieves good and fast reconstruction. However, this method can only handle oriented points. Despite some improved attempts for unoriented points, such as iWSR, these methods perform poorly on sparse point clouds. To address these shortcomings, we propose a wavelet-based method to represent the mollified indicator function and complete both the orientation and surface reconstruction tasks. We use the modifying kernel function to smoothen out discontinuities on the surface, aligning with the continuity of the wavelet basis function. During the calculation of coefficient, we fully utilize the properties of the convolutional kernel function to shift the modifying computation onto wavelet basis to accelerate. In addition, we propose a novel method for constructing the divergence-free function field and using them to construct the additional homogeneous constraints to improve the effectiveness and stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both orientation and reconstruction for sparse models. We align the matrix construction with the compact support property of wavelet basis functions to further accelerate our method, resulting in efficient performance on CPU. Our source codes will be released on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Minimum-Weight Half-Plane Hitting Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a set $P$ of $n$ weighted points and a set $H$ of $n$ half-planes in the plane, the hitting set problem is to compute a subset $P'$ of points from $P$ such that each half-plane contains at least one point from $P'$ and the total weight of the points in $P'$ is minimized. The previous best algorithm solves the problem in $O(n^{7/2}\log^2 n)$ time. In this paper, we present a new algorithm with runtime $O(n^{5/2}\log^2 n)$.</description>

      <title>Volumetric Parameterization for 3-Dimensional Simply-Connected Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With advances in technology, there has been growing interest in developing effective mapping methods for 3-dimensional objects in recent years. Volumetric parameterization for 3D solid manifolds plays an important role in processing 3D data. However, the conventional approaches cannot control the bijectivity and local geometric distortions of the result mappings due to the complex structure of the solid manifolds. Moreover, prior methods mainly focus on one property instead of balancing different properties during the mapping process. In this paper, we propose several novel methods for computing volumetric parameterizations for 3D simply-connected manifolds. Analogous to surface parameterization, our framework incorporates several models designed to preserve geometric structure, achieve density equalization, and optimally balance geometric and density distortions. With these methods, various 3D manifold parameterizations with different desired properties can be achieved. These methods are tested on different examples and manifold remeshing applications, demonstrating their effectiveness and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Topological Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce two novel concepts, topological difference and topological correlation, that offer a new perspective on the discriminative power of multiparameter persistence. The former quantifies the discrepancy between multiparameter and monoparameter persistence, while the other leverages this gap to measure the interdependence of filtering functions. Our framework sheds light on the expressive advantage of multiparameter over monoparameter persistence and suggests potential applications.</description>

      <title>Convex Covering Using Collections of Convex Polygons and Set Cover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.07696v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the convex covering problem, we are given a convex polygon with holes $P$ and the goal is to cover $P$ using a small number of convex polygons that lie inside $P$. In this paper, we solve the problem using the following strategy. We find a big collection of large (often maximal) convex polygons inside $P$ and then solve several set cover problems to find a small subset of the collection that covers the whole polygon. The quality of our heuristics is confirmed by winning the second place in the CG:SHOP 2023 Challenge.</description>
