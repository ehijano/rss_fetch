      <title>Climate in a Bottle: Towards a Generative Foundation Model for the Kilometer-Scale Global Atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI emulators offer a path to compressing, boosting limited ensembles, and improving the latency of interacting with petabyte-scale climate prediction data. However, prevailing auto-regressive paradigms offer limited flexibility, and are challenging to train on climate time horizons due to drifts, instabilities and component-coupling challenges. Conditionally generative models offer an appealing alternative. In this context we demonstrate a generative diffusion-based framework -- Climate in a Bottle (cBottle) -- for emulating global km-scale climate simulations and reanalysis on the equal-area HEALPix grid. cBottle consists of two model stages: a globally-trained coarse-resolution image generator that generates 100km (50k-pixel) fields given monthly average sea surface temperatures and solar conditioning, followed by a locally-trained 16x super-resolution stage that generates 5km (12.5M-pixel) fields; global super-resolution is made affordable using an overlapping patch-based multi-diffusion. Overall, cBottle shows promise as an emulator across a battery of climate model diagnostics, including diurnal-to-seasonal scale variability, large-scale modes of variability, tropical cyclone statistics, and trends of climate change and weather extremes. Moreover, cBottle is a step towards a foundation model, by bridging multiple data modalities (reanalysis and simulation) with corresponding utility beyond emulation to tasks such as zero-shot bias correction, climate downscaling, and channel in-filling.</description>

      <title>A thermal acid calcification cause for seasonal oscillations in the increasing Keeling curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Why do atmospheric carbon dioxide levels rise and fall seasonally measured on Mauna Loa? This study explores the thermal acid-calcification (TAC) hypothesis, suggesting that seasonal temperature shifts in surface seawater trigger acid pH-driven CO2 emissions caused by calcification. Using oceanographic data, we modeled how temperature affects dissolved inorganic carbon including CO2, bicarbonate, and carbonate. Our findings reveal that warming waters absorb atmospheric CO2 by promoting calcium carbonate formation, acidifying seawater and boosting CO2 release to the atmosphere in late autumn and winter, when atmospheric CO2 becomes highest. The model predicts a net annual CO2 rise of 2 ppmv, driven by calcification rather than land-based processes. Seasonal pH swings of 0.04 units corroborate this mechanism. The TAC hypothesis indicates that continued ocean warming, not just fossil fuels, contribute to rising CO2 levels, calling for deeper investigation into marine carbon dynamics.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of Antarctic sea ice thickness from sparse satellite laser altimetry data using a partial convolutional neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The persistent lack of spatially complete Antarctic sea ice thickness (SIT) data at sub-monthly resolution has fundamentally constrained the quantitative understanding of large-scale sea ice mass balance processes. In this study, a pan-Antarctic SIT dataset at 5-day and 12.5 km resolution was developed based on sparse Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite (ICESat: 2003-2009) and ICESat-2 (2018-2024) along-track laser altimetry SIT retrievals using a deep learning approach. The reconstructed SIT was quantitatively validated against independent upward-looking sonar (ULS) observations and showed higher accuracy than the other four satellite-derived and reanalyzed Antarctic SIT datasets. The temporal evolution of the reconstructed SIT was further validated by ULS and ICESat-2 observations. Consistent seasonal cycles and intra-seasonal tendencies across these datasets confirm the reconstruction's reliability. Beyond advancing the mechanistic understanding of Antarctic sea ice variability and climate linkages, this reconstruction dataset's near-real-time updating capability offers operational value for monitoring and forecasting the Antarctic sea ice state.</description>

      <title>Turbulence-induced anti-Stokes flow: experiments and theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report experimental evidence of an Eulerian-mean flow, $\overline{u}(z)$, created by the interaction of surface waves and tailored ambient sub-surface turbulence, which partly cancels the Stokes drift, $u_s(z)$, and present supporting theory. Water-side turbulent velocity fields and Eulerian-mean flows were measured with particle image velocimetry before vs after the passage of a wave group, and with vs without the presence of regular waves. We compare different wavelengths, steepnesses and turbulent intensities. In all cases, a significant change in the Eulerian-mean current is observed, strongly focused near the surface, where it opposes the Stokes drift. The observations support the picture that when waves encounter ambient sub-surface turbulence, the flow undergoes a transition during which Eulerian-mean momentum is redistributed vertically (without changing the depth-integrated mass transport) until a new equilibrium state is reached, wherein the near-surface ratio between $\mathrm{d}\overline{u}/\mathrm{d}z$ and $|\mathrm{d}u_s/\mathrm{d} z|$ approximately equals the ratio between the streamwise and vertical Reynolds normal stresses. This accords with a simple statistical theory derived here and holds regardless of the absolute turbulence level, whereas stronger turbulence means faster growth of the Eulerian-mean current. We present a model based on Rapid Distortion Theory which describes the generation of the Eulerian-mean flow as a consequence of the action of the Stokes drift on the background turbulence. Predictions are in qualitative, and reasonable quantitative, agreement with experiments on wave groups, where equilibrium has not yet been reached. Our results could have substantial consequences for predicting the transport of water-borne material in the oceans.</description>

      <title>Experimental verification of the optimal fingerprint method for detecting climate change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The optimal fingerprint method serves as a potent approach for detecting and attributing climate change. However, its experimental validation encounters challenges due to the intricate nature of climate systems. Here, we experimentally examine the optimal fingerprint method simulated by a precisely controlled magnetic resonance system of spins. The spin dynamic under an applied deterministic driving field and a noise field is utilized to emulate the complex climate system with external forcing and internal variability. Our experimental results affirm the theoretical prediction regarding the existence of an optimal detection direction which maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio, thereby validating the optimal fingerprint method. This work offers direct empirical verification of the optimal fingerprint method, crucial for comprehending climate change and its societal impacts.</description>

      <title>Structured dataset of reported cloud seeding activities in the United States (2000 to 2025) using a large language model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cloud seeding, a weather modification technique aimed at locally enhancing precipitation, has been used in the Western United States since the 1940's. However, datasets to facilitate large-scale analysis of cloud seeding efforts are not currently available. To address this gap, we present a structured dataset of reported cloud seeding activities in the U.S. from 2000 to 2025, including the year, season, state, seeding agent, apparatus used for deployment, and purpose. Using OpenAI's o4-mini large language model (LLM), combined with multi-stage PDF-to-text conversion and response-parsing code, we processed 836 historical reports from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to extract the data. The resulting dataset achieved 94.72% human-verified accuracy across all fields and is publicly available on Zenodo. Our results address the gap in accessible cloud seeding data in the United States, and demonstrate the potential for LLMs to extract structured environmental data from historical documents. More broadly, this work provides a scalable framework for unlocking historical data from scanned documents across scientific domains.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Models for Flood Predictions in South Florida</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.15907v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating and predicting the water level/stage in river systems is essential for flood warnings, hydraulic operations, and flood mitigations. Physics-based detailed hydrological and hydraulic computational tools, such as HEC-RAS, MIKE, and SWMM, can be used to simulate a complete watershed and compute the water stage at any point in the river system. However, these physics-based models are computationally intensive, especially for large watersheds and for longer simulations, since they use detailed grid representations of terrain elevation maps of the entire watershed and solve complex partial differential equations (PDEs) for each grid cell. To overcome this problem, we train several deep learning (DL) models for use as surrogate models to rapidly predict the water stage. A portion of the Miami River in South Florida was chosen as a case study for this paper. Extensive experiments show that the performance of various DL models (MLP, RNN, CNN, LSTM, and RCNN) is significantly better than that of the physics-based model, HEC-RAS, even during extreme precipitation conditions (i.e., tropical storms), and with speedups exceeding 500x. To predict the water stages more accurately, our DL models use both measured variables of the river system from the recent past and covariates for which predictions are typically available for the near future.</description>

      <title>Improving Tropical Cyclone Forecasting With Video Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16003v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tropical cyclone (TC) forecasting is crucial for disaster preparedness and mitigation. While recent deep learning approaches have shown promise, existing methods often treat TC evolution as a series of independent frame-to-frame predictions, limiting their ability to capture long-term dynamics. We present a novel application of video diffusion models for TC forecasting that explicitly models temporal dependencies through additional temporal layers. Our approach enables the model to generate multiple frames simultaneously, better capturing cyclone evolution patterns. We introduce a two-stage training strategy that significantly improves individual-frame quality and performance in low-data regimes. Experimental results show our method outperforms the previous approach of Nath et al. by 19.3% in MAE, 16.2% in PSNR, and 36.1% in SSIM. Most notably, we extend the reliable forecasting horizon from 36 to 50 hours. Through comprehensive evaluation using both traditional metrics and Fr\'echet Video Distance (FVD), we demonstrate that our approach produces more temporally coherent forecasts while maintaining competitive single-frame quality.
