      <title>Stabilization of hyperbolic reaction-diffusion systems on directed networks through the generalized Routh-Hurwitz criterion for complex polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of dynamical systems on complex networks is of paramount importance in engineering, given that many natural and artificial systems find a natural embedding on discrete topologies. For instance, power grids, chemical reactors and the brain, to name a few, can be modeled through the network formalism by considering elementary units coupled via the links. In recent years, scholars have developed numerical and theoretical tools to study the stability of those coupled systems when subjected to perturbations. In such framework, it was found that asymmetric couplings enhance the possibilities for such systems to become unstable. Moreover, in this scenario the polynomials whose stability needs to be studied bear complex coefficients, which makes the analysis more difficult. In this work, we put to use a recent extension of the well-known Routh-Hurwitz stability criterion, allowing to treat the complex coefficient case. Then, using the Brusselator model as a case study, we discuss the stability conditions and the regions of parameters when the networked system remains stable.</description>

      <title>Expected Time-Optimal Control: a Particle MPC-based Approach via Sequential Convex Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of minimum-time optimal control for a dynamical system with initial state uncertainties and propose a sequential convex programming (SCP) solution framework. We seek to minimize the expected terminal (mission) time, which is an essential capability for planetary exploration missions where ground rovers have to carry out scientific tasks efficiently within the mission timelines in uncertain environments. Our main contribution is to convert the underlying stochastic optimal control problem into a deterministic, numerically tractable, optimal control problem. To this end, the proposed solution framework combines two strategies from previous methods: i) a partial model predictive control with consensus horizon approach and ii) a sum-of-norm cost, a temporally strictly increasing weighted-norm, promoting minimum-time trajectories. Our contribution is to adopt these formulations into an SCP solution framework and obtain a numerically tractable stochastic control algorithm. We then demonstrate the resulting control method in multiple applications: i) a closed-loop linear system as a representative result (a spacecraft double integrator model), ii) an open-loop linear system (the same model), and then iii) a nonlinear system (Dubin's car).</description>

      <title>Nonsmooth, Nonconvex Optimization Using Functional Encoding and Component Transition Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have developed novel algorithms for optimizing nonsmooth, nonconvex functions in which the nonsmoothness is caused by nonsmooth operators presented in the analytical form of the objective. The algorithms are based on encoding the active branch of each nonsmooth operator such that the active smooth component function and its code can be extracted at any given point, and the transition of the solution from one smooth piece to another can be detected via tracking the change of active branches of all the operators. This mechanism enables the possibility of collecting the information about the sequence of active component functions encountered in the previous iterations (i.e., the component transition information), and using it in the construction of a current local model or identification of a descent direction in a very economic and effective manner. Based on this novel idea, we have developed a trust-region method and a joint gradient descent method driven by the component information for optimizing the encodable piecewise-smooth, nonconvex functions. It has further been shown that the joint gradient descent method using a technique called proactive component function accessing can achieve a linear rate of convergence if a so-called multi-component Polyak-Lojasiewicz inequality and some other regularity conditions hold at a neighborhood of a local minimizer.</description>

      <title>Detecting self-organising patterns in crowd motion: Effect of optimisation algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The escalating process of urbanization has raised concerns about incidents arising from overcrowding, necessitating a deep understanding of large human crowd behavior and the development of effective crowd management strategies. This study employs computational methods to analyze real-world crowd behaviors, emphasizing self-organizing patterns. Notably, the intersection of two streams of individuals triggers the spontaneous emergence of striped patterns, validated through both simulations and live human experiments. Addressing a gap in computational methods for studying these patterns, previous research utilized the pattern-matching technique, employing the Nelder-Mead Simplex algorithm for fitting a two-dimensional sinusoidal function to pedestrian coordinates. This paper advances the pattern-matching procedure by introducing Simulated Annealing as the optimization algorithm and employing a two-dimensional square wave for data fitting. The amalgamation of Simulated Annealing and the square wave significantly enhances pattern fitting quality, validated through statistical hypothesis tests. The study concludes by outlining potential applications of this method across diverse scenarios.</description>

      <title>A New Two-Sided Sketching Algorithm for Large-Scale Tensor Decomposition Based on Discrete Cosine Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large tensors are frequently encountered in various fields such as computer vision, scientific simulations, sensor networks, and data mining. However, these tensors are often too large for convenient processing, transfer, or storage. Fortunately, they typically exhibit a low-rank structure that can be leveraged through tensor decomposition. Despite this, performing large-scale tensor decomposition can be time-consuming. Sketching is a useful technique to reduce the dimensionality of the data. In this study, we introduce a novel two-sided sketching method based on the $t$-product decomposition and the discrete cosine transformation. We conduct a thorough theoretical analysis to assess the approximation error of the proposed method. Specifically, we enhance the algorithm with power iteration to achieve more precise approximate solutions. Extensive numerical experiments and comparisons on low-rank approximation of color images and grayscale videos illustrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of both CPU time and approximation accuracy.</description>

      <title>A Mathematical Framework for Spatio-Temporal Control in Industrial Drying</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce two models of industrial drying - a simplified one-equation model, and a detailed three-equation model. The purpose of the simplified model is rigorous validation of numerical methods for PDE-constrained optimal control. The purpose of the detailed model is to be able to predict and control the behaviour of an industrial disk drier. For both models, we introduce a fully validated numerical method to compute the optimal source term to maintain the outlet temperature as close as possible to the set-point temperature. By performing simulations using realistic parameters for industrial driers, we illustrate potential applications of the method.</description>

      <title>Kalman-based approaches for online estimation of bioreactor dynamics from fluorescent reporter measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address online estimation of microbial growth dynamics in bioreactors from measurements of a fluorescent reporter protein synthesized along with microbial growth. We consider an extended version of standard growth models that accounts for the dynamics of reporter synthesis. We develop state estimation from sampled, noisy measurements in the cases of known and unknown growth rate functions. Leveraging conservation laws and regularized estimation techniques, we reduce these nonlinear estimation problems to linear time-varying ones, and solve them via Kalman filtering. We establish convergence results in absence of noise and show performance on noisy data in simulation.</description>

      <title>Distributed MPC for PWA Systems Based on Switching ADMM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for distributed model predictive control (MPC) for piecewise affine (PWA) systems. Existing approaches rely on solving mixed-integer optimization problems, requiring significant computation power or time. We propose a distributed MPC scheme that requires solving only convex optimization problems. The key contribution is a novel method, based on the alternating direction method of multipliers, for solving the non-convex optimal control problem that arises due to the PWA dynamics. We present a distributed MPC scheme, leveraging this method, that explicitly accounts for the coupling between subsystems by reaching agreement on the values of coupled states. Stability and recursive feasibility are shown under additional assumptions on the underlying system. Two numerical examples are provided, in which the proposed controller is shown to significantly improve the CPU time and closed-loop performance over existing state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>Non-asymptotic Global Convergence Analysis of BFGS with the Armijo-Wolfe Line Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the first explicit and non-asymptotic global convergence analysis of the BFGS method when deployed with an inexact line search scheme that satisfies the Armijo-Wolfe conditions. We show that BFGS achieves a global convergence rate of $(1-\frac{1}{\kappa})^k$ for $\mu$-strongly convex functions with $L$-Lipschitz gradients, where $\kappa=\frac{L}{\mu}$ denotes the condition number. Furthermore, if the objective function's Hessian is Lipschitz, BFGS with the Armijo-Wolfe line search achieves a linear convergence rate only determined by the line search parameters and independent of the condition number. These results hold for any initial point $x_0$ and any symmetric positive definite initial Hessian approximation matrix $B_0$, although the choice of $B_0$ affects the iteration count required to attain these rates. Specifically, we show that for $B_0 = LI$, the rate of $O((1-\frac{1}{\kappa})^k)$ appears from the first iteration, while for $B_0 = \mu I$, it takes $d\log \kappa$ iterations. Conversely, the condition number-independent linear convergence rate for $B_0 = LI$ occurs after $O\left(\kappa\left(d +\frac{M \sqrt{f(x_0)-f(x_*)}}{\mu^{3/2}}\right)\right)$ iterations, whereas for $B_0 = \mu I$, it holds after $O\left(\frac{M \sqrt{f(x_0)-f(x_*)}}{\mu^{3/2}}\left(d\log \kappa + \kappa\right)\right)$ iterations. Here, $d$ denotes the dimension of the problem, $M$ is the Lipschitz parameter of the Hessian, and $x_*$ denotes the optimal solution. We further leverage these global linear convergence results to characterize the overall iteration complexity of BFGS when deployed with the Armijo-Wolfe line search.</description>

      <title>Successive Convexification for Trajectory Optimization with Continuous-Time Constraint Satisfaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present successive convexification, a real-time-capable solution method for nonconvex trajectory optimization, with continuous-time constraint satisfaction and guaranteed convergence, that only requires first-order information. The proposed framework combines several key methods to solve a large class of nonlinear optimal control problems: (i) exterior penalty-based reformulation of the path constraints; (ii) generalized time-dilation; (iii) multiple-shooting discretization; (iv) $\ell_1$ exact penalization of the nonconvex constraints; and (v) the prox-linear method, a sequential convex programming (SCP) algorithm for convex-composite minimization. The reformulation of the path constraints enables continuous-time constraint satisfaction even on sparse discretization grids and obviates the need for mesh refinement heuristics. Through the prox-linear method, we guarantee convergence of the solution method to stationary points of the penalized problem and guarantee that the converged solutions that are feasible with respect to the discretized and control-parameterized optimal control problem are also Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) points. Furthermore, we highlight the specialization of this property to global minimizers of convex optimal control problems, wherein the reformulated path constraints cannot be represented by canonical cones, i.e., in the form required by existing convex optimization solvers. In addition to theoretical analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness and real-time capability of the proposed framework with numerical examples based on popular optimal control applications: dynamic obstacle avoidance and rocket landing.</description>

      <title>Efficient algorithms for regularized Poisson Non-negative Matrix Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of regularized Poisson Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) problem, encompassing various regularization terms such as Lipschitz and relatively smooth functions, alongside linear constraints. This problem holds significant relevance in numerous Machine Learning applications, particularly within the domain of physical linear unmixing problems. A notable challenge arises from the main loss term in the Poisson NMF problem being a KL divergence, which is non-Lipschitz, rendering traditional gradient descent-based approaches inefficient. In this contribution, we explore the utilization of Block Successive Upper Minimization (BSUM) to overcome this challenge. We build approriate majorizing function for Lipschitz and relatively smooth functions, and show how to introduce linear constraints into the problem. This results in the development of two novel algorithms for regularized Poisson NMF. We conduct numerical simulations to showcase the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we show how mixed-integer conic optimization can be used to combine feature subset selection with holistic generalized linear models to fully automate the model selection process. Concretely, we directly optimize for the Akaike and Bayesian information criteria while imposing constraints designed to deal with multicollinearity in the feature selection task. Specifically, we propose a novel pairwise correlation constraint that combines the sign coherence constraint with ideas from classical statistical models like Ridge regression and the OSCAR model.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Inferior Solutions For Superior Outcomes: Obtaining Robust Solutions From Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly advancing domain of quantum optimization, the confluence of quantum algorithms such as Quantum Annealing (QA) and the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) with robust optimization methodologies presents a cutting-edge frontier. Although it seems natural to apply quantum algorithms when facing uncertainty, this has barely been approached.
  In this paper we adapt the aforementioned quantum optimization techniques to tackle robust optimization problems. By leveraging the inherent stochasticity of quantum annealing and adjusting the parameters and evaluation functions within QAOA, we present two innovative methods for obtaining robust optimal solutions. These heuristics are applied on two use cases within the energy sector: the unit commitment problem, which is central to the scheduling of power plant operations, and the optimization of charging electric vehicles (EVs) including electricity from photovoltaic (PV) to minimize costs. These examples highlight not only the potential of quantum optimization methods to enhance decision-making in energy management but also the practical relevance of the young field of quantum computing in general. Through careful adaptation of quantum algorithms, we lay the foundation for exploring ways to achieve more reliable and efficient solutions in complex optimization scenarios that occur in the real-world.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.10017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of online optimization where the objective function is time-varying. In particular, we extend coordinate descent type algorithms to the online case, where the objective function varies after a finite number of iterations of the algorithm. Instead of solving the problem exactly at each time step, we only apply a finite number of iterations at each time step. Commonly used notions of regret are used to measure the performance of the online algorithm. Moreover, coordinate descent algorithms with different updating rules are considered, including both deterministic and stochastic rules that are developed in the literature of classical offline optimization. A thorough regret analysis is given for each case. Finally, numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Stochastic control problems with state-reflections arising from relaxed benchmark tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.08302v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies stochastic control problems motivated by optimal consumption with wealth benchmark tracking. The benchmark process is modeled by a combination of a geometric Brownian motion and a running maximum process, indicating its increasing trend in the long run. We consider a relaxed tracking formulation such that the wealth compensated by the injected capital always dominates the benchmark process. The stochastic control problem is to maximize the expected utility of consumption deducted by the cost of the capital injection under the dynamic floor constraint. By introducing two auxiliary state processes with reflections, an equivalent auxiliary control problem is formulated and studied, which leads to the HJB equation with two Neumann boundary conditions. We establish the existence of a unique classical solution to the dual PDE using some novel probabilistic representations involving the local time of some dual processes together with a tailor-made decomposition-homogenization technique. The proof of the verification theorem on the optimal feedback control can be carried out by some stochastic flow analysis and technical estimations of the optimal control.</description>

Abstract: We study the lift-and-project rank of the stable set polytopes of graphs with respect to the Lov\'asz-Schrijver SDP operator $\text{LS}_+$. In particular, we focus on a search for relatively small graphs with high $\text{LS}_+$-rank (i.e., the least number of iterations of the $\text{LS}_+$ operator on the fractional stable set polytope to compute the stable set polytope). We provide families of graphs whose $\text{LS}_+$-rank is asymptotically a linear function of its number of vertices, which is the best possible up to improvements in the constant factor. This improves upon the previous best result in this direction from 1999, which yielded graphs whose $\text{LS}_+$-rank only grew with the square root of the number of vertices.</description>

      <title>Benders decomposition algorithms for minimizing the spread of harmful contagions in networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.12402v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has been a recent example for the spread of a harmful contagion in large populations. Moreover, the spread of harmful contagions is not only restricted to an infectious disease, but is also relevant to computer viruses and malware in computer networks. Furthermore, the spread of fake news and propaganda in online social networks is also of major concern. In this study, we introduce the measure-based spread minimization problem (MBSMP), which can help policy makers in minimizing the spread of harmful contagions in large networks. We develop exact solution methods based on branch-and-Benders-cut algorithms that make use of the application of Benders decomposition method to two different mixed-integer programming formulations of the MBSMP: an arc-based formulation and a path-based formulation. We show that for both formulations the Benders optimality cuts can be generated using a combinatorial procedure rather than solving the dual subproblems using linear programming. Additional improvements such as using scenario-dependent extended seed sets, initial cuts, and a starting heuristic are also incorporated into our branch-and-Benders-cut algorithms. We investigate the contribution of various components of the solution algorithms to the performance on the basis of computational results obtained on a set of instances derived from existing ones in the literature.</description>

      <title>Tracking controllability for the heat equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the tracking or sidewise controllability of the heat equation. More precisely, we seek for controls that, acting on part of the boundary of the domain where the heat process evolves, aim to assure that the normal trace or flux on the complementary set tracks a given trajectory. The dual equivalent observability problem is identified. It consists on estimating the boundary sources, localized on a given subset of the boundary, out of boundary measurements on the complementary subset. Classical unique continuation and smoothing properties of the heat equation allow us proving approximate tracking controllability properties and the smoothness of the class of trackable trajectories. We also develop a new transmutation method which allows to transfer known results on the sidewise controllability of the wave equation to the tracking controllability of the heat one. Using the flatness approach we also give explicit estimates on the cost of approximate tracking control. The analysis is complemented with a discussion of some possible variants of these results and a list of open problems.</description>

      <title>Sliding Mode Observers for Set-valued Lur'e Systems with Uncertainties Beyond Observational Range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new sliding mode observer for Lur'e set-valued dynamical systems, particularly addressing challenges posed by uncertainties not within the standard range of observation. Traditionally, most of Luenberger-like observers and sliding mode observer have been designed only for uncertainties in the range of observation. Central to our approach is the treatment of the uncertainty term which we decompose into two components: the first part in the observation subspace and the second part in its complemented subspace. We establish that when the second part converges to zero, an exact sliding mode observer for the system can be obtained. In scenarios where this convergence does not occur, our methodology allows for the estimation of errors between the actual state and the observer state. This leads to a practical interval estimation technique, valuable in situations where part of the uncertainty lies outside the observable range. Finally, we show that our observer is also a T- observer as well as a strong H-infinity observer.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Exchangeable Stochastic Dynamic Teams in Continuous-time, their Mean-Field Limits and Optimality of Symmetric Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a class of stochastic exchangeable teams comprising a finite number of decision makers (DMs) as well as their mean-field limits involving infinite numbers of DMs. In the finite population regime, we study exchangeable teams under the centralized information structure. For the infinite population setting, we study exchangeable teams under the decentralized mean-field information sharing. The paper makes the following main contributions: i) For finite population exchangeable teams, we establish the existence of a randomized optimal policy that is exchangeable (permutation invariant) and Markovian; ii) As our main result in the paper, we show that a sequence of exchangeable optimal policies for finite population settings converges to a conditionally symmetric (identical), independent, and decentralized randomized policy for the infinite population problem, which is globally optimal for the infinite population problem. This result establishes the existence of a symmetric, independent, decentralized optimal randomized policy for the infinite population problem. Additionally, this proves the optimality of the limiting measure-valued MDP for the representative DM; iii) Finally, we show that symmetric, independent, decentralized optimal randomized policies are approximately optimal for the corresponding finite-population team with a large number of DMs under the centralized information structure. Our paper thus establishes the relation between the controlled McKean-Vlasov dynamics and the optimal infinite population decentralized stochastic control problem (without an apriori restriction of symmetry in policies of individual agents), for the first time, to our knowledge.</description>

      <title>Convolution Bounds on Quantile Aggregation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2007.09320v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantile aggregation with dependence uncertainty has a long history in probability theory with wide applications in finance, risk management, statistics, and operations research. Using a recent result on inf-convolution of quantile-based risk measures, we establish new analytical bounds for quantile aggregation which we call convolution bounds. Convolution bounds both unify every analytical result available in quantile aggregation and enlighten our understanding of these methods. These bounds are the best available in general. Moreover, convolution bounds are easy to compute, and we show that they are sharp in many relevant cases. They also allow for interpretability on the extremal dependence structure. The results directly lead to bounds on the distribution of the sum of random variables with arbitrary dependence. We discuss relevant applications in risk management and economics.</description>

      <title>Active Learning for Non-Parametric Choice Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.03346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of actively learning a non-parametric choice model based on consumers' decisions. We present a negative result showing that such choice models may not be identifiable. To overcome the identifiability problem, we introduce a directed acyclic graph (DAG) representation of the choice model. This representation provably encodes all the information about the choice model which can be inferred from the available data, in the sense that it permits computing all choice probabilities.
  We establish that given exact choice probabilities for a collection of item sets, one can reconstruct the DAG. However, attempting to extend this methodology to estimate the DAG from noisy choice frequency data obtained during an active learning process leads to inaccuracies. To address this challenge, we present an inclusion-exclusion approach that effectively manages error propagation across DAG levels, leading to a more accurate estimate of the DAG. Utilizing this technique, our algorithm estimates the DAG representation of an underlying non-parametric choice model. The algorithm operates efficiently (in polynomial time) when the set of frequent rankings is drawn uniformly at random. It learns the distribution over the most popular items among frequent preference types by actively and repeatedly offering assortments of items and observing the chosen item. We demonstrate that our algorithm more effectively recovers a set of frequent preferences on both synthetic and publicly available datasets on consumers' preferences, compared to corresponding non-active learning estimation algorithms. These findings underscore the value of our algorithm and the broader applicability of active-learning approaches in modeling consumer behavior.</description>

Abstract: Empirical quantiles for finitely distributed univariate random variables can be obtained by solving a certain linear program. It is shown in this short note that multivariate empirical quantiles can be obtained in a very similar way by solving a vector linear program. This connection provides a new approach for computing Tukey depth regions and more general cone quantile sets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.10552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that in the overparametrized regime, deep neural network provide universal approximations and can interpolate any data set, as long as the activation function is locally in $L^1(\RR)$ and not an affine function.
  Additionally, if the activation function is smooth and such an interpolation networks exists, then the set of parameters which interpolate forms a manifold. Furthermore, we give a characterization of the Hessian of the loss function evaluated at the interpolation points.
  In the last section, we provide a practical probabilistic method of finding such a point under general conditions on the activation function.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Reduction of Number of Spots and Energy Layers in Intensity Modulated Proton Therapy for Rapid Spot Scanning Delivery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11287</link>

Abstract: Reducing proton treatment time improves patient comfort and decreases the risk of error from intra-fractional motion, but must be balanced against clinical goals and treatment plan quality. We formulated the proton treatment planning problem as a convex optimization problem with a cost function consisting of a dosimetric plan quality term plus a weighted $l_1$ regularization term. We iteratively solved this problem and adaptively updated the regularization weights to promote the sparsity of both the spots and energy layers. The proposed algorithm was tested on four head-and-neck cancer patients, and its performance was compared with existing standard $l_1$ and group $l_2$ regularization methods. We also compared the effectiveness of the three methods ($l_1$, group $l_2$, and reweighted $l_1$) at improving plan delivery efficiency without compromising dosimetric plan quality by constructing each of their Pareto surfaces charting the trade-off between plan delivery and plan quality. The reweighted $l_1$ regularization method reduced the number of spots and energy layers by an average over all patients of 40% and 35%, respectively, with an insignificant cost to dosimetric plan quality. From the Pareto surfaces, it is clear that reweighted $l_1$ provided a better trade-off between plan delivery efficiency and dosimetric plan quality than standard $l_1$ or group $l_2$ regularization, requiring the lowest cost to quality to achieve any given level of delivery efficiency. In summary, reweighted $l_1$ regularization is a powerful method for simultaneously promoting the sparsity of spots and energy layers at a small cost to dosimetric plan quality. This sparsity reduces the time required for spot scanning and energy layer switching, thereby improving the delivery efficiency of proton plans.</description>

      <title>Exact Recovery for System Identification with More Corrupt Data than Clean Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.10506v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the system identification problem for linear discrete-time systems under adversaries and analyzes two lasso-type estimators. We examine both asymptotic and non-asymptotic properties of these estimators in two separate scenarios, corresponding to deterministic and stochastic models for the attack times. Since the samples collected from the system are correlated, the existing results on lasso are not applicable. We prove that when the system is stable and attacks are injected periodically, the sample complexity for exact recovery of the system dynamics is linear in terms of the dimension of the states. When adversarial attacks occur at each time instance with probability p, the required sample complexity for exact recovery scales polynomially in the dimension of the states and the probability p. This result implies almost sure convergence to the true system dynamics under the asymptotic regime. As a by-product, our estimators still learn the system correctly even when more than half of the data is compromised. We highlight that the attack vectors are allowed to be correlated with each other in this work, whereas we make some assumptions about the times at which the attacks happen. This paper provides the first mathematical guarantee in the literature on learning from correlated data for dynamical systems in the case when there is less clean data than corrupt data.</description>
