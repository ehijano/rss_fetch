      <title>Exact mobility line and mobility ring in the complex energy plane of a flat band lattice with a non-Hermitian quasiperiodic potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the problem of Anderson localization in a one-dimensional flat band lattice with a non-Hermitian quasiperiodic on-site potential. First of all, we discuss the influences of non-Hermitian potentials on the existence of critical states. Our findings show that, unlike in Hermitian cases, the non-Hermiticity of the potential leads to the disappearance of critical states and critical regions. Furthermore, we are able to accurately determine the Lyapunov exponents and the mobility edges. Our results reveal that the mobility edges form mobility lines and mobility rings in the complex energy plane. Within the mobility rings, the eigenstates are extended, while the localized states are located outside the mobility rings. For mobility line cases, only when the eigenenergies lie on the mobility lines, their corresponding eigenstates are extended states.Finally, as the energy approaches the mobility edges, we observe that, differently from Hermitian cases, here the critical index of the localization length is not a constant, but rather varies depending on the positions of the mobility edges.</description>

      <title>Reentrant localization transition induced by a composite potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the localization transition in a one-dimensional system subjected to a composite potential consisting of periodic and quasi-periodic components. For the rational wave vector $\alpha=1/2$, the periodic component reduces to a staggered potential, which has been reported to induce the reentrant localization transition. In addition to $\alpha=1/2$, we find that other rational wave vectors can also lead to the reentrant phenomenon. To investigate the underlying mechanisms of the reentrant localization transition, we vary the parameters of the composite potential and find that the reentrant localization transition is sensitive to the phase factor of the periodic component. By further studying the structure of the periodic component, we confirm that this sensitivity arises from the periodic phase factor modulating the mirror symmetry. Finally, we map out a global phase diagram and reveal that the reentrant localization transition originates from a paradoxical effect: increasing the amplitude of the periodic component enhances localization but simultaneously strengthens the mirror symmetry, which favors the formation of extended states. Our numerical analysis suggests that the interplay between these competing factors drives the reentrant localization transition.</description>

      <title>Many-body localization properties of one-dimensional anisotropic spin-1/2 chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we theoretically investigate the many-body localization (MBL) properties of one-dimensional anisotropic spin-1/2 chains by using the exact matrix diagonalization method. Starting from the Ising spin-1/2 chain, we introduce different forms of external fields and spin coupling interactions, and construct three distinct anisotropic spin-1/2 chain models. The influence of these interactions on the MBL phase transition is systematically explored. We first analyze the eigenstate properties by computing the excited-state fidelity. The results show that MBL phase transitions occur in all three models, and that both the anisotropy parameter and the finite system size significantly affect the critical disorder strength of the transition. Moreover, we calculated the bipartite entanglement entropy of the system, and the critical points determined by the intersection of curves for different system sizes are basically consistent with those obtained from the excited-state fidelity. Then, the dynamical characteristics of the systems are studied through the time evolution of diagonal entropy (DE), local magnetization, and fidelity. These observations further confirm the occurrence of the MBL phase transition and allow for a clear distinction between the ergodic (thermal) phase and the many-body localized phase. Finally, to examine the effect of additional interactions on the transition, we incorporate Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions into the three models. The results demonstrate that the MBL phase transition still occurs in the presence of DM interactions. However, the anisotropy parameter and finite system size significantly affect the critical disorder strength. Moreover, the critical behavior is somewhat suppressed, indicating that DM interactions tend to inhibit the onset of localization.</description>

      <title>Existence of Nonequilibrium Glasses in the Degenerate Stealthy Hyperuniform Ground-State Manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stealthy interactions are an emerging class of nontrivial, bounded long-ranged oscillatory pair potentials with classical ground states that can be disordered, hyperuniform, and infinitely degenerate. Their hybrid crystal-liquid nature endows them with novel physical properties with advantages over their crystalline counterparts. Here, we show the existence of nonequilibrium hard-sphere glasses within this unusual ground-state manifold as the stealthiness parameter $\chi$ tends to zero that are remarkably configurationally extremely close to hyperuniform 3D maximally random jammed (MRJ) sphere packings. The latter are prototypical glasses since they are maximally disordered, perfectly rigid, and perfectly nonergodic. Our optimization procedure, which leverages the maximum cardinality of the infinite ground-state set, not only guarantees that our packings are hyperuniform with the same structure-factor scaling exponent as the MRJ state, but they share other salient structural attributes, including a packing fraction of $0.638$, a mean contact number per particle of 6, gap exponent of $0.44(1)$, and pair correlation functions $g_2(r)$ and structures factors $S(k)$ that are virtually identical to one another for all $r$ and $k$, respectively. Moreover, we demonstrate that stealthy hyperuniform packings can be created within the disordered regime ($0 &lt; \chi &lt;1/2$) with heretofore unattained maximal packing fractions. As $\chi$ increases from zero, they always form interparticle contacts, albeit with sparser contact networks as $\chi$ increases from zero, resulting in linear polymer-like chains of contacting particles with increasingly shorter chain lengths. The capacity to generate ultradense stealthy hyperuniform packings for all $\chi$ opens up new materials applications in optics and acoustics.</description>

      <title>Measurement-induced phase transitions in quantum inference problems and quantum hidden Markov models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, there is interest in coincident 'sharpening' and 'learnability' transitions in monitored quantum systems. In the latter, an outside observer's ability to infer properties of a quantum system from measurements undergoes a phase transition. Such transitions appear to be related to the decodability transition in quantum error correction, but the precise connection is not clear. Here, we study these problems under one framework we call the general quantum inference problem. In cases as above where the system has a Markov structure, we say that the inference is on a quantum hidden Markov model. We show a formal connection to classical hidden Markov models and that they coincide for certain setups. For example, we prove this for those involving Haar-random unitaries and measurements. We introduce the notion of Bayes non-optimality, where parameters used for inference differs from true ones. This allows us to expand the phase diagrams of above models. At Bayes optimality, we obtain an explicit relation between 'sharpening' and 'learnability' order parameters, explicitly showing that the two transitions coincide. Next, we study concrete examples. We review quantum error correction on the toric and repetition code and their mapping to 2D random-bond Ising model (RBIM) through our framework. We study the Haar-random U(1)-symmetric monitored quantum circuit and tree, mapping each to inference models that we call the planted SSEP and planted XOR, respectively, and expanding the phase diagram to Bayes non-optimality. For the circuit, we deduce the phase boundary numerically and analytically argue that it is of a single universality class. For the tree, we present an exact solution of the entire phase boundary, which displays re-entrance as does the 2D RBIM. We discuss these phase diagrams, with their interpretations for quantum inference problems and rigorous arguments on their shapes.</description>

      <title>Universality of $SU(\infty)$ relaxation dynamics for $SU(n_f)$-symmetric spin-models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin-models, where the $N$ spins interact pairwise with a $SU(n_f)$ symmetry preserving hamiltonian, famously simplify in the large $n_f$, $N$ limits, as derived by Sachdev and Ye when exploring mean-field behavior of spin-glasses. We present numerical evidence that for a large class of models, the large $n_f$ limit is not necessary: the same dynamical equations can describe the relaxation processes at high temperatures for a set of classical models inspired from mean-field treatments of interacting dense neutrino gases, up to times set by the radius of convergence of the perturbation series for the correlation function. After a simple rescaling of time, the dynamics display a surprising universality, being identical for any value of $n_f$ as long as the rank of the coupling matrix is small. As a corollary of our results, we find that the direct interaction approximation originating from the study of stochastic flows in fluid turbulence should be thought of as only a short-time approximation for generic random coupling systems.</description>

      <title>Stability Control of Metastable States as a Unified Mechanism for Flexible Temporal Modulation in Cognitive Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flexible modulation of temporal dynamics in neural sequences underlies many cognitive processes. For instance, we can adaptively change the speed of motor sequences and speech. While such flexibility is influenced by various factors such as attention and context, the common neural mechanisms responsible for this modulation remain poorly understood. We developed a biologically plausible neural network model that incorporates neurons with multiple timescales and Hebbian learning rules. This model is capable of generating simple sequential patterns as well as performing delayed match-to-sample (DMS) tasks that require the retention of stimulus identity. Fast neural dynamics establish metastable states, while slow neural dynamics maintain task-relevant information and modulate the stability of these states to enable temporal processing. We systematically analyzed how factors such as neuronal gain, external input strength (contextual cues), and task difficulty influence the temporal properties of neural activity sequences - specifically, dwell time within patterns and transition times between successive patterns. We found that these factors flexibly modulate the stability of metastable states. Our findings provide a unified mechanism for understanding various forms of temporal modulation and suggest a novel computational role for neural timescale diversity in dynamically adapting cognitive performance to changing environmental demands.</description>

      <title>Dissipation-Induced Threshold on Integrability Footprints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The presence of a dissipative environment disrupts the unitary spectrum of dynamical quantum maps. Nevertheless, key features of the underlying unitary dynamics -- such as their integrable or chaotic nature -- are not immediately erased by dissipation. To investigate this, we model dissipation as a convex combination of a unitary evolution and a random Kraus map, and study how signatures of integrability fade as dissipation strength increases. Our analysis shows that in the weakly dissipative regime, the complex eigenvalue spectrum organizes into well-defined, high-density clusters. We estimate the critical dissipation threshold beyond which these clusters disappear, rendering the dynamics indistinguishable from chaotic evolution. This threshold depends only on the number of spectral clusters and the rank of the random Kraus operator. To characterize this transition, we introduce the eigenvalue angular velocity as a diagnostic of integrability loss. We illustrate our findings through several integrable quantum circuits, including the dissipative quantum Fourier transform. Our results provide a quantitative picture of how noise gradually erases the footprints of integrability in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Universality, Robustness, and Limits of the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis in Open Quantum Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) underpins much of our modern understanding of the thermalization of closed quantum many-body systems. Here, we investigate the statistical properties of observables in the eigenbasis of the Lindbladian operator of a Markovian open quantum system. We demonstrate the validity of a Lindbladian ETH ansatz through extensive numerical simulations of several physical models. To highlight the robustness of Lindbladian ETH, we consider what we dub the dilute-click regime of the model, in which one postselects only quantum trajectories with a finite fraction of quantum jumps. The average dynamics are generated by a non-trace-preserving Liouvillian, and we show that the Lindbladian ETH ansatz still holds in this case. On the other hand, the no-click limit is a singular point at which the Lindbladian reduces to a doubled non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and Lindbladian ETH breaks down.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19279v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex systems of many interacting components exhibit patterns of recurrence and emergent behaviors in their time evolution that can be understood from a new perspective in physics of information dynamics modeled after one such system, our brains. A generic brain-like network model is derived from a system of disordered superconducting loops with Josephson junction oscillators to demonstrate these behaviors. The loops can trap multiples of fluxons that represent quantized information units in many distinct memory configurations populating a state space. The state can be updated by exciting the junctions to $fire$ or allow the movement of fluxons through the network as the current through them surpasses their thresholds. Numerical simulations performed with a lumped circuit model of a 4-loop network show that information written through excitations is translated into stable states of trapped flux and their time evolution. Experimental implementation on the 4-loop network shows dynamically stable flux flow in each pathway characterized by the junction firing statistics. The network separates information from multiple excitations into state categories with large energy barriers observed in simulations that correspond to different flux (information) flow patterns observed across junctions in experiments. Strong evidence for associative and time-dependent (short-to-long-term) memories distributed across the network is observed, dependent on its intrinsic and geometrical properties as described by the model. Suitable network topologies can model various other systems, leading to two universal laws describing the nature of information dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Naturally occurring materials are often disordered, with their bulk properties being challenging to predict from the structure, due to the lack of underlying crystalline axes. In this paper, we develop a digital pipeline from algorithmically-created configurations with tunable disorder to 3D printed materials, as a tool to aid in the study of such materials, using electrical resistance as a test case. The designed material begins with a random point cloud that is iteratively evolved using Lloyd's algorithm to approach uniformity, with the points being connected via a Delaunay triangulation to form a disordered network metamaterial. Utilizing laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing with stainless steel 17-4 PH and titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V, we are able to experimentally measure the bulk electrical resistivity of the disordered network. The effective resistance of the structure calculated from the combinatorial weighted graph Laplacian is in good agreement with experimental data. However, the effective resistance is sensitive to anisotropy and global network topology, preventing a single network statistic or disorder characterization from predicting global resistivity.</description>

      <title>The fundamental localization phases in quasiperiodic systems: A unified framework and exact results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The disordered quantum systems host three types of quantum states, the extended, localized, and critical, which bring up various distinct fundamental phases, including the pure phases and coexisting ones with mobility edges. The quantum phases involving critical states are of particular importance, but are less understood compared with the other ones, and the different phases have been separately studied in different quasiperiodic models. Here we propose a unified framework based on a spinful quasiperiodic system which unifies the realizations of all the fundamental Anderson phases, with the exact and universal results being obtained for these distinct phases. Through the duality transformation and renormalization group method, we show that the pure phases are obtained when the (emergent) chiral symmetry preserves in the proposed spin-1/2 quasiperiodic model, which provides a criterion for the emergence of the pure phases or the coexisting ones with mobility edges. Further, we uncover a new universal mechanism for the critical states that the emergence of such states is protected by the generalized incommensurate matrix element zeros in the spinful quasiperiodic model, as a novel generalization of the quasiperiodic hopping zeros in the spinless systems. We also show with the Avila's global theory the criteria of exact solvability for the present unified quasiperiodic system, with which we identify several new quasiperiodic models derived from the spinful system hosting exactly solvable Anderson phases. In particular, we reach a single model that hosts all the seven fundamental phases of Anderson localization. Finally, an experimental scheme is proposed to realize these models using quasiperiodic optical Raman lattices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a generalized Aubry-Andr\'{e} model with tunable quasidisordered potentials. The model has an invariable mobility edge that separates the extended states from the localized states. At the mobility edge, the wave function presents critical characteristics, which can be verified by finite-size scaling analysis. Our numerical investigations demonstrate that the extended, critical, and localized states can be effectively distinguished via their phase space representation, specially the Wigner distribution. Based on the Wigner distribution function, we can further obtain the corresponding Wigner entropy and employ the feature that the critical state has the maximum Wigner entropy to locate the invariable mobility edge. Finally, we reveal that there are anomalous transport phenomena between the transition from ballistic transport to the absence of diffusion.</description>

Abstract: The search for quantum algorithms to tackle classical combinatorial optimization problems has long been one of the most attractive yet challenging research topics in quantum computing. In this context, variational quantum algorithms (VQA) are a promising family of hybrid quantum-classical methods tailored to cope with the limited capability of near-term quantum hardware. However, their effectiveness is hampered by the complexity of the classical parameter optimization which is prone to getting stuck either in local minima or in flat regions of the cost-function landscape. The clever design of efficient optimization methods is therefore of fundamental importance for fully leveraging the potential of VQAs. In this work, we approach QAOA parameter optimization as a sequential decision-making problem and tackle it with an adaptation of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), a common artificial intelligence technique designed for efficiently exploring complex decision graphs. We show that leveraging regular parameter patterns deeply affects the decision-tree structure and allows for a flexible and noise-resilient optimization strategy suitable for near-term quantum devices. Our results shed further light on the interplay between artificial intelligence and quantum information and provide a valuable addition to the toolkit of variational quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Learning by Confusion: The Phase Diagram of the Holstein Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04681</link>

Abstract: We employ the "learning by confusion" technique, an unsupervised machine learning approach for detecting phase transitions, to analyze quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the two-dimensional Holstein model--a fundamental model for electron-phonon interactions on a lattice. Utilizing a convolutional neural network, we conduct a series of binary classification tasks to identify Holstein critical points based on the neural network's learning accuracy. We further evaluate the effectiveness of various training datasets, including snapshots of phonon fields and other measurements resolved in imaginary time, for predicting distinct phase transitions and crossovers. Our results culminate in the construction of the finite-temperature phase diagram of the Holstein model.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetism Without Crystal Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Altermagnetism is a collinear magnetic order in which opposite spin species are exchanged under a real-space rotation. Hence, the search for physical realizations has focussed on crystalline solids with specific rotational symmetry. Here, we show that altermagnetism can also emerge in non-crystalline systems, such as amorphous solids, despite the lack of global rotational symmetries. We construct a Hamiltonian with two directional orbitals per site on an amorphous lattice with interactions that are invariant under spin rotation. Altermagnetism then arises due to spontaneous symmetry breaking in the spin and orbital degrees of freedom around each atom, displaying a common point group symmetry. This form of altermagnetism exhibits anisotropic spin transport and spin spectral functions, both experimentally measurable. Our mechanism generalizes to any lattice and any altermagnetic order, opening the search for altermagnetic phenomena to non-crystalline systems.</description>
