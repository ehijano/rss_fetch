      <title>Global Solutions to the Discrete Nonlinear Breakage Equations without Mass Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global existence of mild solutions to the discrete collisional breakage equations is established for a broad class of collision kernels, without imposing any growth assumptions. In addition, classical solutions are constructed, and uniqueness is proved for an appropriate class of kinetic coefficients and initial data. The large time behavior of solutions is also discussed, and numerical simulations are presented to support the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Average Nikolskii factors for random diffusion polynomials on closed Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For $1\le p,q\le \infty$, the Nikolskii factor for a diffusion polynomial $P_{\bf a}$ of degree at most $n$ is defined by $$N_{p,q}(P_{\bf a})=\frac{\|P_{\bf a}\|_{q}}{\|P_{\bf a}\|_{p}},\ \ P_{\bf a}({\bf x})=\sum_{k:\lambda_{k}\leq n}a_{k}\phi_{k}({\bf x}),$$ where ${\bf a}=\{a_k\}_{\lambda_k\le n}$, and $\{(\phi_k,-\lambda_k^2)\}_{k=0}^\infty$ are the eigenpairs of the Laplace-Beltrami operator $\Delta_{\mathbb M}$ on a closed smooth Riemannian manifold $\mathbb M$ with normalized Riemannian measure. We study this average Nikolskii factor for random diffusion polynomials with independent $N(0,\sigma^{2})$ coefficients and obtain the exact orders. For $1\leq p&lt;q&lt;\infty$, the average Nikolskii factor is of order $n^{0}$ (i.e., constant), as compared to the worst case bound of order $n^{d(1/p-1/q)}$, and for $1\leq p&lt;q=\infty$, the average Nikolskii factor is of order $(\ln n)^{1/2}$ as compared to the worst case bound of order $n^{d/p}$.</description>

      <title>Upper bound of the number of limit cycles for symmetric scalar piecewise linear differential equations with three zones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of the dynamics of a continuous observable and non-controllable three-dimensional symmetric piecewise linear system with three zones can be reduced to the study of the existence of limit cycles for the piecewise differential equation $x'=ax+(b-a)\mathop{\rm sat}(x)+\mu\sin t$, where $\operatorname{sat}$ stands for the normalized saturation function. This paper proves that the number of limit cycles of the equation is finite independently of $a,b,\mu$. Moreover, it is proven that the maximum number of limit cycles is exactly one or three for certain values of the parameters. Using Melnikov theory for a certain deformation of the equation, it is proven that for small values of the perturbation parameter, there are exactly three, five or one limit cycles, depending on the values of $\mu$. This strengthens the conjecture that the equation has at most five limit cycles.</description>

      <title>An optimal fractional Hardy inequality on the discrete half-line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of Hardy inequalities for the fractional Laplacian $(-\Delta_{\mathbb{N}})^{\sigma}$ on the discrete half-line $\mathbb{N}$, we provide an optimal Hardy-weight $W^{\mathrm{op}}_{\sigma}$ for exponents $\sigma\in\left(0,1\right]$. As a consequence, we provide an estimate of the sharp constant in the fractional Hardy inequality with the classical Hardy-weight $n^{-2\sigma}$ on $\mathbb{N}$. It turns out that for $\sigma =1$ the Hardy-weight $W^{\mathrm{op}}_{1}$ is pointwise larger than the optimal Hardy-weight obtained by Keller--Pinchover--Pogorzelski near infinity. As an application of our main result, we obtain unique continuation results at infinity for the solutions of some fractional Schr\"odinger equation.</description>

      <title>Interpolating with generalized Assouad dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12975v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $\phi$-Assouad dimensions are a family of dimensions which interpolate between the upper box and Assouad dimensions. They are a generalization of the well-studied Assouad spectrum with a more general form of scale sensitivity that is often closely related to "phase-transition" phenomena in sets.
  In this article we establish a number of key properties of the $\phi$-Assouad dimensions which help to clarify their behaviour. We prove for any bounded doubling metric space $F$ and $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}$ satisfying $\overline{\operatorname{dim}}_{\mathrm{B}}F&lt;\alpha\leq\operatorname{dim}_{\mathrm{A}} F$ that there is a function $\phi$ so that the $\phi$-Assouad dimension of $F$ is equal to $\alpha$. We further show that the "upper" variant of the dimension is fully determined by the $\phi$-Assouad dimension, and that homogeneous Moran sets are in a certain sense generic for these dimensions.
  Further, we study explicit examples of sets where the Assouad spectrum does not reach the Assouad dimension. We prove a precise formula for the $\phi$-Assouad dimensions for Galton--Watson trees that correspond to a general class of stochastically self-similar sets, including Mandelbrot percolation. This result follows from two results which may be of general interest: a sharp large deviations theorem for Galton--Watson processes with bounded offspring distribution, and a Borel--Cantelli-type lemma for infinite structures in random trees. Finally, we obtain results on the $\phi$-Assouad dimensions of overlapping self-similar sets and decreasing sequences with decreasing gaps.</description>

      <title>Two-sided bell-shaped sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11274v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A nonnegative real function f is bell-shaped if it converges to zero at plus and minus infinity and the nth derivative of f changes sign n times for every n = 0, 1, 2, ... Similarly, a two-sided nonnegative sequence a(k) is bell-shaped if it converges to zero at plus and minus infinity and the nth iterated difference of a(k) changes sign n times for every n = 0, 1, 2, ... A characterisation of bell-shaped functions was given by Thomas Simon and the first named author, and recently a similar result for one-sided bell-shaped sequences was found by the authors. In the present article we give a complete description of two-sided bell-shaped sequences. Our main result proves that bell-shaped sequences are convolutions of P\'olya frequency sequences and what we call absolutely monotone-then-completely monotone sequences, and it provides an equivalent, and relatively easy to verify, condition in terms of holomorphic extensions of the generating function. We also prove that if f is a bell-shaped function, then f(k) is a bell-shaped sequence.</description>

Abstract: The paper shows that the localization lemma used by N. Lev and A. Tselishchev in solving the problem of constructing quasi-bases from uniformly separated shifts of a function in the space $L^p (\mathbb R) $ for $ p &gt; ( 1 + \sqrt 5 )/2 $, is not carried over to small $p$.</description>

      <title>One sided orthogonal polynomials and a pointwise convergence result for $SU(2)$-valued nonlinear Fourier series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We elaborate on a connection between the $SU(2)$-valued nonlinear Fourier series and sequences of left and right orthogonal polynomials for complex measures on the unit circle. We show a convergence result for the associated reproducing kernel. This is a universality type result in the vein of Mate-Nevai-Totik, which turns out to be much simpler in the $SU(2)$ case than in the $SU(1,1)$ case. We then relate a.e. pointwise convergence of the product of left and right polynomials and their squares with both behavior of their zeros as well as behavior of some local parameters for these polynomials. We conclude by proving almost everywhere convergence along lacunary sequences of the functional $(a_n ^* +b_n)(a_n - b_n ^*)$ of the partial $SU(2)$-valued nonlinear Fourier series $(a_n, b_n)$ under the assumption that the nonlinear Fourier series $(a,b)$ itself satisfies both $\|b\|_{L^{\infty} (\mathbb{T})} &lt; 2^{- \frac 1 2}$ and $a^*$ is outer.</description>
