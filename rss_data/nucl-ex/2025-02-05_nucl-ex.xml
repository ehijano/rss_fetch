      <title>Absorption of $\psi(2S)$ mesons in nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present work we explore the inclusive $\psi(2S)$ meson photoproduction from nuclei near the kinematic threshold within the collision model, based on the nuclear spectral function, for incoherent direct photon--nucleon charmonium creation processes. The model takes into account the final $\psi(2S)$ absorption, target nucleon binding and Fermi motion. We calculate the absolute and relative excitation functions for production of $\psi(2S)$ mesons on $^{12}$C and $^{184}$W target nuclei at near-threshold photon beam energies of 8.0--16.4 GeV, the absolute momentum differential cross sections for their production off these target nuclei at laboratory polar angles of 0$^{\circ}$--10$^{\circ}$, the momentum dependence of the ratio of these cross sections as well as the A-dependences of the ratios (transparency ratios) of the total cross cross sections for $\psi(2S)$ production at photon energy of 13 GeV within the different scenarios for the $\psi(2S)N$ absorption cross section. We also calculate the A-dependence of the ratio of $\psi(2S)$ and $J/\psi$ photoproduction transparency ratios at photon energies around of 11.5 GeV within the adopted scenarios for this cross section. We demonstrate that both the absolute and relative observables considered reveal a definite sensitivity to these scenarios. Therefore, the measurement of such observables in future experiments at the upgraded up to 22 GeV CEBAF facility in the near-threshold energy region might shed light both on the $\psi(2S)N$ absorption cross section and on its part associated with the nondiagonal process $\psi(2S)+N \to J/\psi+N$ at finite momenta, which are of crucial importance in understanding of charmonium production and suppression in high-energy nucleus--nucleus collisions in a search for the quark-gluon plasma.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of Double Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering observables to Generalized Parton Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Double Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DDVCS) is a promising channel for Generalized Parton Distribution (GPD) studies as it is a generalization of the Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DVCS) and Timelike Compton Scattering (TCS) processes. Contrary to DVCS and TCS, the GPD phase space accessed through DDVCS is not constrained by on-shell conditions on the incoming and outgoing photons thus allowing unrestricted GPD extraction from experimental observables. Considering polarized electron and positron beams directed to a polarized proton target, we study the sensitivity of the DDVCS cross-section asymmetries to the chiral-even proton GPDs from different model predictions. The feasibility of such measurements is further investigated in the context of the CLAS and SoLID spectrometers at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility and the future Electron-Ion Collider at the Brookhaven National Laboratory.</description>

      <title>Signal shape studies and rate dependence of HFO-based gas mixtures in RPC detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The RPCs employed at the LHC experiments are currently operated in avalanche mode, with a mixture containing a large fraction of C$_{2}$H$_{2}$F$_{4}$ ($\approx$90\% or more) with the addition of i-C$_{4}$H$_{10}$ and SF$_{6}$ in different concentrations. However, C$_{2}$H$_{2}$F$_{4}$ and SF$_{6}$ are fluorinated greenhouse gases (F-gases) with Global Warming Potential (GWP) of $\approx$1400 and $\approx$22800, respectively. EU regulations imposed a progressive phase-down of C$_{2}$H$_{2}$F$_{4}$ production and consumption, aiming at strongly reducing its emission. This is already resulting in an increase of its price and reduction in availability.
  The most desirable long-term solution to this problem is to find an alternative, F-gases-free gas mixture, able to maintain similar detector performance. To address this challenge, the RPC ECOGasas@GIF++ collaboration (including RPC experts of ALICE, ATLAS, CMS, SHiP/LHCb, and the CERN EP-DT group) was created in 2019. The collaboration is currently studying a gas from the olefine family, the C$_{3}$H$_{2}$F$_{4}$ (or simply HFO, with GWP $\approx$6), to be used, in combination with CO$_{2}$, as a substitute for C$_{2}$H$_{2}$F$_{4}$.
  This contribution will focus on the signal shape studies that have been carried out by the collaboration during dedicated beam test periods. The methodology used in the data analysis will be presented, together with the results obtained with several HFO-based gas mixtures, and with the currently employed one. Furthermore, results on the counting-rate dependence of the RPC performance, obtained by combining the muon beam with the GIF++ $^{137}$Cs source with different attenuation factors, will also be presented.</description>

      <title>High-precision mass measurements of the ground and isomeric states in $^{124,125}$Ag</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The masses of the ground and isomeric states in $^{124,125}$Ag have been measured using the phase-imaging ion-cyclotron-resonance technique at the JYFLTRAP double Penning trap mass spectrometer. The ground states of $^{124}$Ag and $^{125}$Ag were found to be 30(250) keV and 250(430) keV less bound but 36 and 110 times more precise than in the Atomic Mass Evaluation 2020, respectively. The excitation energy of $^{124}$Ag$^{m}$, ${E_x = 188.2(25)}$ keV, was determined for the first time. The new precise mass values have been utilised to study the evolution of nuclear structure via two-neutron separation energies. The impact on the astrophysical rapid neutron capture process has been investigated via neutron-capture reaction rate calculations. The precision measurements indicate a more linear trend in two-neutron separation energies and reduce the mass-related uncertainties for the neutron-capture rate of $^{124}$Ag$(n,\gamma)^{125}$Ag by a factor of around 100. The new mass values also improve the mass of $^{123}$Pd, previously measured using $^{124}$Ag as a reference.</description>

      <title>Ultra-low $Q_\beta$ value for the allowed decay of $^{110}$Ag$^m$ confirmed via mass measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mass of the electron-antineutrino can be determined in dedicated measurements of the $\beta$ spectral shape near the $\beta$ endpoint of a $\beta^-$ transition, with a low $Q$ value enhancing the sensitivity of the measurement. One such low-$Q$-value candidate is the transition between the $6^+$ isomer of $^{110}$Ag and the $5^+_2$ state in $^{110}$Cd ($Q^{\ast}_{\beta,m}=-0.12(131)$ keV). To reduce the uncertainty of the $Q$ value, we have used the phase-imaging ion-cyclotron-resonance technique with the JYFLTRAP double Penning trap and performed a high-precision atomic-mass measurement of $^{109}$Ag with $^{110}$Cd as a reference. Combined with the known spectroscopic data, we obtain a re-evaluated value $Q^{\ast}_{\beta,m}=405(135)$ eV, for the $^{110}\text{Ag}(6^+_\text{m}) \rightarrow {^{110}\text{Cd}}(5^+_2)$ transition. This represents the lowest $Q_{\beta}$ value for any allowed transition observed to date. In order to estimate the partial half-life ($t_{1/2}$) and branching ratio (Br) of the transition, nuclear shell-model calculations were performed using the $jj45pnb$ Hamiltonian in combination with state-of-the-art atomic calculations. The computed values $t_{1/2} = 2.23^{+5.24}_{-1.28} \times 10^7$ years and $\textrm{Br} = 3.07^{+4.16}_{-2.15} \times 10^{-8}$, along with the thermal-neutron capture on stable $^{109}$Ag as a viable production method, make $^{110}\textrm{Ag}^m$ a promising candidate for future antineutrino-mass measurements.</description>

      <title>Statistical properties and photon strength functions of the ${}^{112,114}$Sn isotopes below the neutron separation threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here, we report on the measurements of the $\gamma$-ray strength functions and nuclear level densities of ${}^{112,114}$Sn performed for the first time at the 9~MV Tandem accelerator facilities at IFIN-HH using the Oslo method. We extract thermodynamic properties and gross and fine properties of the pygmy dipole resonance for systematic comparison in the chain of Sn isotopes. The results are compared with microscopic models implemented in the TALYS reaction code and the fully microscopic quasiparticle-phonon model for the underlying nuclear structure of the dipole strength in ${}^{112,114}$Sn. The quasiparticle-phonon model results show the importance of complex configurations to the low-energy dipole response in the pygmy dipole resonance energy region. The experimental data are further included in the cross-section and reaction rate calculations for the $(\mathrm{n},\gamma)$ reaction of the $p$-process nuclei ${}^{112,114}$Sn showing a significant increase in reaction rates at high temperatures compared to existing nuclear databases.</description>

      <title>Systematic Uncertainties in the Measurement of Neutron lifetime Using Lunar Prospector Neutron Spectrometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The lifetime of free neutrons measured in the lab has a long standing disparity of $\sim$9~s. A space-based technique has recently been proposed to independently measure the neutron lifetime using interactions between the galactic cosmic rays and a low atmosphere planetary body. This technique has not produced competitive results yet due to constraints of non-optimized data that contain large systematic errors. We use data from the neutron spectrometer on-board NASA's Lunar Prospector, and quantify the effects of lunar sub-surface temperature and the composition on the measurement of neutron lifetime. We use the HeCd and HeSn neutron spectrometer data when the spacecraft was in a highly elliptical orbit during the orbit insertion period. We report the neutron lifetime using lunar composition maps at different resolutions: 5$^{\circ}$ Prettyman+2006 and 2$^{\circ}$ re-binned Wilson+2021 maps to be 777.59$\pm$11.71~s and 739.64$\pm$10.83~s respectively. Further, for the 20$^{\circ}$ map, we apply both a constant equatorial and a latitude-dependent temperature model and report 738.63$\pm$10.75~s and 767.33$\pm$11.17~s respectively. We report the weighted average of the four measurements to be $\tau_n = 754.72 ^{+34.58}_{-25.91}$~s.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic neutrinoless double beta decay: long range quantum coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02602v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We re-introduce, in light of our modern understanding of neutrinos, the concept of ``macroscopic neutrinoless double beta decay" (MDBD) for Majorana neutrinos. In this process an antineutrino produced by a nucleus undergoing beta decay, $X\to Y + e^- + \bar \nu_e$, is absorbed as a neutrino by another identical $X$ nucleus via the inverse beta decay reaction, $\nu_e + X \to e^-+Y$. The distinct signature of MDBD is that the total kinetic energy of the two electrons equals twice the endpoint energy of single beta decay. The amplitude for MDBD, a coherent sum over the contribution of different mass states of the intermediate neutrinos, reflects quantum coherence over macroscopic distances, and is a new macroscopic quantum effect. We evaluate the rate of MDBD for a macroscopic sample of ``$X$" material, e.g., tritium, acting both as the source and the target. The accidental background for MDBD originating from two separate single beta decays, which contains two final state neutrinos, can be readily rejected by measuring the energy of the detected two electrons. We discuss the similarities and differences between the MDBD and conventional neutrinoless double beta decay.</description>
