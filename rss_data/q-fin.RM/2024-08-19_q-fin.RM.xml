      <title>Systemic values-at-risk and their sample-average approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the convergence properties of sample-average approximations (SAA) for set-valued systemic risk measures. We assume that the systemic risk measure is defined using a general aggregation function with some continuity properties and value-at-risk applied as a monetary risk measure. We focus on the theoretical convergence of its SAA under Wijsman and Hausdorff topologies for closed sets. After building the general theory, we provide an in-depth study of an important special case where the aggregation function is defined based on the Eisenberg-Noe network model. In this case, we provide mixed-integer programming formulations for calculating the SAA sets via their weighted-sum and norm-minimizing scalarizations. To demonstrate the applicability of our findings, we conduct a comprehensive sensitivity analysis by generating a financial network based on the preferential attachment model and modeling the economic disruptions via a Pareto distribution.</description>

      <title>Infinite-mean models in risk management: Discussions and recent advances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In statistical analysis, many classic results require the assumption that models have finite mean or variance, including the most standard versions of the laws of large numbers and the central limit theorems. Such an assumption may not be completely innocent, and it may fail for datasets with heavy tails (e.g., catastrophic losses), relevant to financial risk management. In this paper, we discuss the importance of infinite-mean models in economics, finance, and related fields, with recent results and examples. We emphasize that many results or intuitions that hold for finite-mean models turn out to fail or even flip for infinite-mean models. Due to the breakdown of standard thinking for infinite-mean models, we argue that if the possibility of using infinite-mean models cannot be excluded, great caution should be taken when applying classic methods that are usually designed for finite-mean cases in finance and insurance.</description>
