      <title>Soap Film-inspired Subdivisional Lattice Structure Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice structures, distinguished by their customizable geometries at the microscale and outstanding mechanical performance, have found widespread application across various industries. One fundamental process in their design and manufacturing is constructing boundary representation (B-rep) models, which are essential for running advanced applications like simulation, optimization, and process planning. However, this construction process presents significant challenges due to the high complexity of lattice structures, particularly in generating nodal shapes where robustness and smoothness issues can arise from the complex intersections between struts. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel approach for lattice structure construction by cutting struts and filling void regions with subdivisional nodal shapes. Inspired by soap films, the method generates smooth, shape-preserving control meshes using Laplacian fairing and subdivides them through the point-normal Loop (PN-Loop) subdivision scheme to obtain subdivisional nodal shapes. The proposed method ensures robust model construction with reduced shape deviations, enhanced surface fairness, and smooth transitions between subdivisional nodal shapes and retained struts. The effectiveness of the method has been demonstrated by a series of examples and comparisons. The code will be open-sourced upon publication.</description>

      <title>Commutative algebra-enhanced topological data analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological Data Analysis (TDA) combines computational topology and data science to extract and analyze intrinsic topological and geometric structures in data set in a metric space. While the persistent homology (PH), a widely used tool in TDA, which tracks the lifespan information of topological features through a filtration process, has shown its effectiveness in applications,it is inherently limited in homotopy invariants and overlooks finer geometric and combinatorial details. To bridge this gap, we introduce two novel commutative algebra-based frameworks which extend beyond homology by incorporating tools from computational commutative algebra : (1) \emph{the persistent ideals} derived from the decomposition of algebraic objects associated to simplicial complexes, like those in theory of edge ideals and Stanley--Reisner ideals, which will provide new commutative algebra-based barcodes and offer a richer characterization of topological and geometric structures in filtrations.(2)\emph{persistent chain complex of free modules} associated with traditional persistent simplicial complex by labelling each chain in the chain complex of the persistent simplicial complex with elements in a commutative ring, which will enable us to detect local information of the topology via some pure algebraic operations. \emph{Crucially, both of the two newly-established framework can recover topological information got from conventional PH and will give us more information.} Therefore, they provide new insights in computational topology, computational algebra and data science.</description>

      <title>Square Packing with Asymptotically Smallest Waste Only Needs Good Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of packing a large square with nonoverlapping unit squares. Let $W(x)$ be the minimum wasted area when a large square of side length $x$ is packed with unit squares. In Roth and Vaughan's paper that proves the lower bound $W(x) \notin o(x^{1/2})$, a good square is defined to be a square with inclination at most $10^{-10}$ with respect to the large square. In this article, we prove that in calculating the asymptotic growth of the wasted space, it suffices to only consider packings with only good squares. This allows the lower bound proof in Roth and Vaughan's paper to be simplified by not having to handle bad squares.</description>

      <title>Counting Number of Triangulations of Point Sets: Reinterpreting and Generalizing the Triangulation Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a framework that unifies the two types of polynomials introduced respectively by Bacher and Mouton and by Rutschmann and Wettstein to analyze the number of triangulations of point sets. Using this insight, we generalize the triangulation polynomials of chains to a wider class of near-edges, enabling efficient computation of the number of triangulations of certain families of point sets. We use the framework to try to improve the result in Rutschmann and Wettstein without success, suggesting that their result is close to optimal.</description>

      <title>Epsilon-Neighborhood Decision-Boundary Governed Estimation (EDGE) of 2D Black Box Classifier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately estimating decision boundaries in black box systems is critical when ensuring safety, quality, and feasibility in real-world applications. However, existing methods iteratively refine boundary estimates by sampling in regions of uncertainty, without providing guarantees on the closeness to the decision boundary and also result in unnecessary exploration that is especially disadvantageous when evaluations are costly. This paper presents the Epsilon-Neighborhood Decision-Boundary Governed Estimation (EDGE), a sample efficient and function-agnostic algorithm that leverages the intermediate value theorem to estimate the location of the decision boundary of a black box binary classifier within a user-specified epsilon-neighborhood. Evaluations are conducted on three nonlinear test functions and a case study of an electric grid stability problem with uncertain renewable power injection. The EDGE algorithm demonstrates superior sample efficiency and better boundary approximation than adaptive sampling techniques and grid-based searches.</description>

      <title>MASH: Masked Anchored SpHerical Distances for 3D Shape Representation and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Masked Anchored SpHerical Distances (MASH), a novel multi-view and parametrized representation of 3D shapes. Inspired by multi-view geometry and motivated by the importance of perceptual shape understanding for learning 3D shapes, MASH represents a 3D shape as a collection of observable local surface patches, each defined by a spherical distance function emanating from an anchor point. We further leverage the compactness of spherical harmonics to encode the MASH functions, combined with a generalized view cone with a parameterized base that masks the spatial extent of the spherical function to attain locality. We develop a differentiable optimization algorithm capable of converting any point cloud into a MASH representation accurately approximating ground-truth surfaces with arbitrary geometry and topology. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MASH is versatile for multiple applications including surface reconstruction, shape generation, completion, and blending, achieving superior performance thanks to its unique representation encompassing both implicit and explicit features.</description>

      <title>A Theory of Sub-Barcodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.10504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.10504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: From the work of Bauer and Lesnick, it is known that there is no functor from the category of pointwise finite-dimensional persistence modules to the category of barcodes and overlap matchings. In this work, we introduce sub-barcodes and show that there is a functor from the category of factorizations of persistence module homomorphisms to a poset of barcodes ordered by the sub-barcode relation. Sub-barcodes and factorizations provide a looser alternative to bottleneck matchings and interleavings that can give strong guarantees in a number of settings that arise naturally in topological data analysis. The main use of sub-barcodes is to make strong claims about an unknown barcode in the absence of an interleaving. For example, given only upper and lower bounds $g\geq f\geq \ell$ of an unknown real-valued function $f$, a sub-barcode associated with $f$ can be constructed from $\ell$ and $g$ alone. We propose a theory of sub-barcodes and observe that the subobjects in the category of functors from intervals to matchings naturally correspond to sub-barcodes.</description>
