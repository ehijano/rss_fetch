      <title>Turtles, Hats and Spectres: Aperiodic structures on a Rhombic tiling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These notes derive aperiodic monotiles (arXiv:2303.10798) from a set of rhombuses with matching rules. This dual construction is used to simplify the proof of aperiodicity by considering the tiling as a colouring game on a Rhombille tiling. A simple recursive substitution system is then introduced to show the existence of a non-periodic tiling without the need for computer-aided verification.
  A new cut-and-project style construction linking the Turtle tiling with 1-dimensional Fibonacci words provides a second proof of non-periodicity, and an alternative demonstration that the Turtle can tile the plane.
  Deforming the Turtle into the Hat tile then provides a third proof for non-periodicity by considering the effect on the lattice underlying the Rhombille tiling.
  Finally, attention turns to the Spectre tile. In collaboration with Erhard K\"unzel and Yoshiaki Araki, we present two new substitution rules for generating Spectre tilings. This pair of conjugate rules show that the aperiodic monotile tilings can be considered as a 2-dimensional analog to Sturmian words.</description>

      <title>Curvature and Other Local Inequalities in Markov Semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the approach of Ivanisvili and Volberg towards functional inequalities for probability measures with strictly convex potentials, we investigate the relationship between curvature bounds in the sense of Bakry-Emery and local functional inequalities. We will show that not only is the earlier approach for strictly convex potentials extendable to Markov semigroups and simplified through use of the $\Gamma$-calculus, providing a consolidating machinery for obtaining functional inequalities new and old in this general setting, but that a converse also holds. Local inequalities obtained are proven equivalent to Bakry-Emery curvature. Moreover we will develop this technique for metric measure spaces satisfying the RCD condition, providing a unified approach to functional and isoperimetric inequalities in non-smooth spaces with a synthetic Ricci curvature bound. Finally, we are interested in commutation properties for semi-group operators on $\mathbb{R}^n$ in the absence of positive curvature, based on a local eigenvalue criteria.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic order of the quantization error for a class of self-similar measures with overlaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\{f_i\}_{i=1}^N$ be a set of equi-contractive similitudes on $\mathbb{R}^1$ satisfying the finite-type condition. We study the asymptotic quantization error for self-similar measures $\mu$ associated with $\{f_i\}_{i=1}^N$ and a positive probability vector. With a verifiable assumption, we prove that the upper and lower quantization coefficient for $\mu$ are both bounded away from zero and infinity. This can be regarded as an extension of Graf and Luschgy's result on self-similar measures with the open set condition. Our result is applicable to a significant class of self-similar measures with overlaps, including Erd\"{o}s measure, the $3$-fold convolution of the classical Cantor measure and the self-similar measures on some $\lambda$-Cantor sets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a nonempty finite subset of the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^k$ $(k\ge 2)$. We prove that if a function $f\colon \mathbb{R}^k\to \mathbb{C}$ is such that the sum of $f$ on every congruent copy of $K$ is zero, then $f$ vanishes everywhere. In fact, a stronger, weighted version is proved. As a corollary we find that every finite subset $K$ of $\mathbb{R}^k$ having at least two elements is a Jackson set; that is, no subset of $\mathbb{R}^k$ intersects every congruent copy of $K$ in exactly one point.</description>

      <title>Geometry and Stability of Supervised Learning Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of distance between supervised learning problems, which we call the Risk distance. This optimal-transport-inspired distance facilitates stability results; one can quantify how seriously issues like sampling bias, noise, limited data, and approximations might change a given problem by bounding how much these modifications can move the problem under the Risk distance. With the distance established, we explore the geometry of the resulting space of supervised learning problems, providing explicit geodesics and proving that the set of classification problems is dense in a larger class of problems. We also provide two variants of the Risk distance: one that incorporates specified weights on a problem's predictors, and one that is more sensitive to the contours of a problem's risk landscape.</description>

      <title>Local vs. global Lipschitz geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we prove that for a definable set in an o-minimal structure with connected link (at 0 or infinity), the inner distance of the link is equivalent to the inner distance of the set restricted to the link. With this result, we obtain several consequences. We present also several relations between the local and the global Lipschitz geometry of singularities. For instance, we prove that two sets in Euclidean spaces, not necessarily definable in an o-minimal structure, are outer lipeomorphic if and only if their stereographic modifications are outer lipeomorphic if and only if their inversions are outer lipeomorphic.</description>

      <title>The distribution of Weierstrass points on a tropical curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.07920</link>
      <description>arXiv:1809.07920v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that on a metric graph of genus $g$, a divisor of degree $n$ generically has $g(n-g+1)$ Weierstrass points. For a sequence of generic divisors on a metric graph whose degrees grow to infinity, we show that the associated Weierstrass points become distributed according to the Zhang canonical measure. In other words, the limiting distribution is determined by effective resistances on the metric graph. This distribution result has an analogue for complex algebraic curves, due to Neeman, and for curves over non-Archimedean fields, due to Amini.</description>

      <title>The projection constant for the trace class</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.00218v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the projection constant of the space of operators on $n$-dimensional Hilbert spaces, with the trace norm, $\mathcal S_1(n)$. We show an integral formula for the projection constant of $\mathcal S_1(n)$; namely $ \boldsymbol{\lambda}\big(\mathcal S_1(n)\big) = n \int_{\mathcal U_n} \vert \text{tr}(U) \vert \,dU \,, $ where the integration is with respect to the Haar probability measure on the group $\mathcal U_n$ of unitary operators. Using a probabilistic approach, we derive the limit formula $ \lim_{n\to \infty} \boldsymbol{\lambda}\big(\mathcal S_1(n)\big)/n = \sqrt{\pi}/2\,. $</description>

      <title>A geometric property of quadrilaterals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.17337v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quadrilaterals in the complex plane play a significant part in the theory of planar quasiconformal mappings. Motivated by the geometric definition of quasiconformality, we prove that every quadrilateral with modulus in an interval $[1/K, K]$, where $K&gt;1$, contains a disk lying in its interior, of radius depending only on the internal distances between the pairs of opposite sides of the quadrilateral and on $K$.</description>

      <title>Locality in Sumsets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the Polynomial Freiman-Ruzsa (PFR) Conjecture, we develop a theory of locality in sumsets, with applications to John-type approximation and sets with small doubling. First we show that if $A \subset \mathbb{Z}$ with $|A+A| \le (1-\epsilon) 2^d |A|$ is non-degenerate then $A$ is covered by $O(2^d)$ translates of a $d$-dimensional generalised arithmetic progression ($d$-GAP) $P$ with $|P| \le O_{d,\epsilon}(|A|)$; thus we obtain one of the polynomial bounds required by PFR, under the non-degeneracy assumption that $A$ is not efficiently covered by $O_{d,\epsilon}(1)$ translates of a $(d-1)$-GAP. We also prove a stability result showing for any $\epsilon,\alpha&gt;0$ that if $A \subset \mathbb{Z}$ with $|A+A| \le (2-\epsilon)2^d|A|$ is non-degenerate then some $A' \subset A$ with $|A'|&gt;(1-\alpha)|A|$ is efficiently covered by either a $(d+1)$-GAP or $O_{\alpha}(1)$ translates of a $d$-GAP. This `dimension-free' bound for approximate covering makes for a stark contrast with exact covering, where the required number of translates grows exponentially with $d$. We further show that if $A \subset \mathbb{Z}$ is non-degenerate with $|A+A| \le (2^d + \ell)|A|$ and $\ell \le 0.1 \cdot 2^d$ then $A$ is covered by $\ell+1$ translates of a $d$-GAP $P$ with $|P| \le O_d(|A|)$; this is tight, in that $\ell+1$ cannot be replaced by any smaller number. The above results also hold for $A \subset \mathbb{R}^d$, replacing GAPs by a suitable common generalisation of GAPs and convex bodies. In this setting the non-degeneracy condition holds automatically, so we obtain essentially optimal bounds with no additional assumption on $A$. These results are all deduced from a unifying theory, in which we introduce a new intrinsic structural approximation of any set, which we call the `additive hull', and develop its theory via a refinement of Freiman's theorem with additional separation properties.</description>

      <title>A counterexample to parabolic dichotomies in holomorphic iteration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give an example of a parabolic holomorphic self-map $f$ of the unit ball $\mathbb B^2\subset \mathbb C^2$ whose canonical Kobayashi hyperbolic semi-model is given by an elliptic automorphism of the disc $\mathbb D\subset \mathbb C$, which can be chosen to be different from the identity. As a consequence, in contrast to the one dimensional case, this provides a first example of a holomorphic self-map of the unit ball which has points with zero hyperbolic step and points with nonzero hyperbolic step, solving an open question and showing that parabolic dynamics in the ball $\\mathbb B^2$ is radically different from parabolic dynamics in the disc. The example is obtained via a geometric method, embedding the ball $\mathbb B^2$ as a domain $\Omega$ in the bidisc $\\mathbb D\times \mathbb{H}$ that is forward invariant and absorbing for the map $(z,w)\mapsto (e^{i\theta}z,w+1)$, where $\mathbb H\subset \mathbb C$ denotes the right half-plane. We also show that a complete Kobayashi hyperbolic domain $\Omega$ with such properties cannot be Gromov hyperbolic w.r.t. the Kobayashi distance (hence, it cannot be biholomorphic to $\\mathbb B^2$) if an additional quantitative geometric condition is satisfied.</description>
