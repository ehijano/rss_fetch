      <title>Virtual Reality for Understanding Artificial-Intelligence-driven Scientific Discovery with an Application in Quantum Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) models can propose solutions to scientific problems beyond human capability. To truly make conceptual contributions, researchers need to be capable of understanding the AI-generated structures and extracting the underlying concepts and ideas. When algorithms provide little explanatory reasoning alongside the output, scientists have to reverse-engineer the fundamental insights behind proposals based solely on examples. This task can be challenging as the output is often highly complex and thus not immediately accessible to humans. In this work we show how transferring part of the analysis process into an immersive Virtual Reality (VR) environment can assist researchers in developing an understanding of AI-generated solutions. We demonstrate the usefulness of VR in finding interpretable configurations of abstract graphs, representing Quantum Optics experiments. Thereby, we can manually discover new generalizations of AI-discoveries as well as new understanding in experimental quantum optics. Furthermore, it allows us to customize the search space in an informed way - as a human-in-the-loop - to achieve significantly faster subsequent discovery iterations. As concrete examples, with this technology, we discover a new resource-efficient 3-dimensional entanglement swapping scheme, as well as a 3-dimensional 4-particle Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger-state analyzer. Our results show the potential of VR for increasing a human researcher's ability to derive knowledge from graph-based generative AI that, which is a common abstract data representation used in diverse fields of science.</description>

      <title>G3DR: Generative 3D Reconstruction in ImageNet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel 3D generative method, Generative 3D Reconstruction (G3DR) in ImageNet, capable of generating diverse and high-quality 3D objects from single images, addressing the limitations of existing methods. At the heart of our framework is a novel depth regularization technique that enables the generation of scenes with high-geometric fidelity. G3DR also leverages a pretrained language-vision model, such as CLIP, to enable reconstruction in novel views and improve the visual realism of generations. Additionally, G3DR designs a simple but effective sampling procedure to further improve the quality of generations. G3DR offers diverse and efficient 3D asset generation based on class or text conditioning. Despite its simplicity, G3DR is able to beat state-of-theart methods, improving over them by up to 22% in perceptual metrics and 90% in geometry scores, while needing only half of the training time. Code is available at https://github.com/preddy5/G3DR</description>

      <title>Neural radiance fields-based holography [Invited]</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a novel approach for generating holograms based on the neural radiance fields (NeRF) technique. Generating three-dimensional (3D) data is difficult in hologram computation. NeRF is a state-of-the-art technique for 3D light-field reconstruction from 2D images based on volume rendering. The NeRF can rapidly predict new-view images that do not include a training dataset. In this study, we constructed a rendering pipeline directly from a 3D light field generated from 2D images by NeRF for hologram generation using deep neural networks within a reasonable time. The pipeline comprises three main components: the NeRF, a depth predictor, and a hologram generator, all constructed using deep neural networks. The pipeline does not include any physical calculations. The predicted holograms of a 3D scene viewed from any direction were computed using the proposed pipeline. The simulation and experimental results are presented.</description>

      <title>Spectrum AUC Difference (SAUCD): Human-aligned 3D Shape Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing 3D mesh shape evaluation metrics mainly focus on the overall shape but are usually less sensitive to local details. This makes them inconsistent with human evaluation, as human perception cares about both overall and detailed shape. In this paper, we propose an analytic metric named Spectrum Area Under the Curve Difference (SAUCD) that demonstrates better consistency with human evaluation. To compare the difference between two shapes, we first transform the 3D mesh to the spectrum domain using the discrete Laplace-Beltrami operator and Fourier transform. Then, we calculate the Area Under the Curve (AUC) difference between the two spectrums, so that each frequency band that captures either the overall or detailed shape is equitably considered. Taking human sensitivity across frequency bands into account, we further extend our metric by learning suitable weights for each frequency band which better aligns with human perception. To measure the performance of SAUCD, we build a 3D mesh evaluation dataset called Shape Grading, along with manual annotations from more than 800 subjects. By measuring the correlation between our metric and human evaluation, we demonstrate that SAUCD is well aligned with human evaluation, and outperforms previous 3D mesh metrics.</description>

      <title>DaReNeRF: Direction-aware Representation for Dynamic Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Addressing the intricate challenge of modeling and re-rendering dynamic scenes, most recent approaches have sought to simplify these complexities using plane-based explicit representations, overcoming the slow training time issues associated with methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and implicit representations. However, the straightforward decomposition of 4D dynamic scenes into multiple 2D plane-based representations proves insufficient for re-rendering high-fidelity scenes with complex motions. In response, we present a novel direction-aware representation (DaRe) approach that captures scene dynamics from six different directions. This learned representation undergoes an inverse dual-tree complex wavelet transformation (DTCWT) to recover plane-based information. DaReNeRF computes features for each space-time point by fusing vectors from these recovered planes. Combining DaReNeRF with a tiny MLP for color regression and leveraging volume rendering in training yield state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis for complex dynamic scenes. Notably, to address redundancy introduced by the six real and six imaginary direction-aware wavelet coefficients, we introduce a trainable masking approach, mitigating storage issues without significant performance decline. Moreover, DaReNeRF maintains a 2x reduction in training time compared to prior art while delivering superior performance.</description>

      <title>ToonAging: Face Re-Aging upon Artistic Portrait Style Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02733v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Face re-aging is a prominent field in computer vision and graphics, with significant applications in photorealistic domains such as movies, advertising, and live streaming. Recently, the need to apply face re-aging to non-photorealistic images, like comics, illustrations, and animations, has emerged as an extension in various entertainment sectors. However, the absence of a network capable of seamlessly editing the apparent age on NPR images means that these tasks have been confined to a naive approach, applying each task sequentially. This often results in unpleasant artifacts and a loss of facial attributes due to domain discrepancies. In this paper, we introduce a novel one-stage method for face re-aging combined with portrait style transfer, executed in a single generative step. We leverage existing face re-aging and style transfer networks, both trained within the same PR domain. Our method uniquely fuses distinct latent vectors, each responsible for managing aging-related attributes and NPR appearance. Adopting an exemplar-based approach, our method offers greater flexibility than domain-level fine-tuning approaches, which typically require separate training or fine-tuning for each domain. This effectively addresses the limitation of requiring paired datasets for re-aging and domain-level, data-driven approaches for stylization. Our experiments show that our model can effortlessly generate re-aged images while simultaneously transferring the style of examples, maintaining both natural appearance and controllability.</description>

      <title>Minecraft-ify: Minecraft Style Image Generation with Text-guided Image Editing for In-Game Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we first present the character texture generation system \textit{Minecraft-ify}, specified to Minecraft video game toward in-game application. Ours can generate face-focused image for texture mapping tailored to 3D virtual character having cube manifold. While existing projects or works only generate texture, proposed system can inverse the user-provided real image, or generate average/random appearance from learned distribution. Moreover, it can be manipulated with text-guidance using StyleGAN and StyleCLIP. These features provide a more extended user experience with enlarged freedom as a user-friendly AI-tool.

      <title>Transparent Image Layer Diffusion using Latent Transparency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17113v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present LayerDiffuse, an approach enabling large-scale pretrained latent diffusion models to generate transparent images. The method allows generation of single transparent images or of multiple transparent layers. The method learns a "latent transparency" that encodes alpha channel transparency into the latent manifold of a pretrained latent diffusion model. It preserves the production-ready quality of the large diffusion model by regulating the added transparency as a latent offset with minimal changes to the original latent distribution of the pretrained model. In this way, any latent diffusion model can be converted into a transparent image generator by finetuning it with the adjusted latent space. We train the model with 1M transparent image layer pairs collected using a human-in-the-loop collection scheme. We show that latent transparency can be applied to different open source image generators, or be adapted to various conditional control systems to achieve applications like foreground/background-conditioned layer generation, joint layer generation, structural control of layer contents, etc. A user study finds that in most cases (97%) users prefer our natively generated transparent content over previous ad-hoc solutions such as generating and then matting. Users also report the quality of our generated transparent images is comparable to real commercial transparent assets like Adobe Stock.</description>
