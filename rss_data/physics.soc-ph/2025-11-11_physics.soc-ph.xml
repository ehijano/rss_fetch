      <title>Tipping to Climate Action: Qualitative Insights from a Social-Climate Model with a Committed Minority</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-established that human activity is driving extreme weather patterns, and that these extreme events influence human behaviour. However, few models allow for human behaviours and the climate to dynamically interact. The models presented in this paper expand on previous work and serve as an initial framework to extend current models by using a dynamic social-climate feedback loop. First, we introduce a social model to determine the conditions under which a committed minority can overturn a pre-established social convention. Second, we modify an existing climate model to include climatic variability. Lastly, we formulate a social-climate feedback model to study the interplay between human behaviour and the climate. Our results demonstrate that the social-climate feedback loop may be important in accurately predicting future temperatures, in contrast to the standard approach where human behaviour is a priori. Additionally, we find that a committed minority plays a vital role in shifting public opinion towards climate action and that the time at which the social convention of climate inaction is overturned has a large impact on future temperatures.</description>

      <title>Spatial Selection and the Multiscale Dynamics of Urban Change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Growth is a multi-layered phenomenon in human societies, composed of socioeconomic and demographic change at many different scales. Yet, standard macroeconomic indicators average over most of these processes, blurring the spatial and hierarchical heterogeneity driving people's choices and experiences. To address this gap, we introduce here a framework based on the Price equation to decompose aggregate growth exactly into endogenous and selection effects across nested spatial scales. We illustrate this approach with population and income data from the Chicago metropolitan area (2014-2019) and show that both growth rates and spatial selection effects are most intense at local levels, fat-tailed and spatially correlated. We also find that selection, defined as the covariance between prevailing income and relative population change, is concentrated in few spatial units and exhibits scaling behavior when grouped by county. Despite the intensity of local sorting, selection effects largely cancel in the aggregate, implying that fast heterogeneous micro-dynamics can yield deceptively stable macro-trends. By treating local spatial units (neighborhoods) as evolving subpopulations under selection, we demonstrate how methods from complex systems provide new tools to classify residential selection processes, such as abandonment and gentrification, in an urban sociological framework. This approach is general and applies to any other nested economic systems such as networks of production, occupations, or innovation enabling a new mechanistic understanding of compositional change and growth across scales of organization.</description>

      <title>Two variants of the friendship paradox: The condition for inequality between them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The friendship paradox -- the observation that, on average, one's friends have more friends than oneself -- admits two common formulations depending on whether averaging is performed over edges or over nodes. These two definitions, the "alter-based" and "ego-based" means, are often treated as distinct but related quantities. This document establishes their exact analytical relationship, showing that the difference between them is governed by the degree-degree covariance normalized by the mean degree. Explicit examples demonstrate the three possible cases of positive, zero, and negative covariance, corresponding respectively to assortative, neutral, and disassortative mixing patterns. The derivation further connects the covariance form to the moment-based expression introduced by Kumar, Krackhardt, and Feld [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 121, e2306412121 (2024)], which involves the (-1)st, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd moments of the degree distribution. The two formulations are shown to be equivalent, as they should be: the moment-based representation expands the same structural dependence that the covariance form expresses in its most compact and interpretable form. The analysis thus unifies node-level and moment-level perspectives on the friendship paradox, offering both a pedagogically transparent derivation and a direct bridge to recent theoretical developments.</description>

      <title>Public Transport Under Epidemic Conditions: Nonlinear Trade-Offs Between Risk and Accessibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Epidemics expose critical tensions between protecting public health and maintaining essential urban mobility. Public transport systems face this dilemma most acutely: they enable access to jobs, education, and services, yet also facilitate close contact among travelers. We develop an integrated modeling framework that couples agent-based epidemic simulation (EpiSim) with an optimization-based public transport flow model under capacity constraints. Using Munich as a case study, we analyze how combinations of facility closures and transport restrictions shape epidemic outcomes and accessibility. The results reveal three key insights. First, epidemic interventions redistribute rather than simply reduce infection risks, shifting transmission to households. Second, epidemic and transport policies interact nonlinearly - moderate demand suppression can offset large capacity cuts. Third, epidemic pressures amplify temporal and spatial inequalities, disproportionately affecting peripheral and peak-hour travelers. These findings highlight that blanket restrictions are both inefficient and inequitable, calling for targeted, time- and space-differentiated measures to build epidemic-resilient and socially fair transport systems.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Mixed-Methods Framework for Cybernetic Urban Mobility Governance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study develops a cybernetically inspired mixed-methods framework that bridges the gap between policy formation and implementation through feedback-driven analysis of mobility transitions. Using a major campus consolidation in Trondheim, Norway as a case study, we examine how this framework supports sustainable mobility through integrated analysis of mobility patterns, constraints, and transition impacts. The consolidation eliminates over 1,300 parking spaces while increasing daily population by 9,300 people. We employ a mixed-methods approach combining qualitative survey data (n=573) with quantitative big data analysis of public transit and crowd movement patterns. This integrates three analytical components and provides grounded insights into commuting flows, modes, durations, distances, and congestion points, while addressing the spatiotemporal mobility realities of affected populations. The analysis reveals complex mobility constraints, with 59.3% of respondents having children and private cars dominating in winter (49.4%). Though there is broad support for sustainable mobility goals, 86.0% identify increasing travel duration as primary difficulty. Quantitative analysis highlights peak usage patterns and congestion risks, with seasonal variations. This study demonstrates integrating qualitative and quantitative analysis to anticipate negative impacts and enable efficient sustainable mobility policies. The results inform practical recommendations for data-driven mobility interventions that align sustainability goals with lived realities.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Vaccine Prioritization via Non-Markovian Final-state Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective vaccine prioritization is critical for epidemic control, yet real outbreaks exhibit memory effects that inflate state space and make long-term prediction and optimization challenging. As a result, many strategies are tuned to short-term objectives and overlook how vaccinating certain individuals indirectly protects others. We develop a general age-stratified non-Markovian epidemic model that captures memory dynamics and accommodates diverse epidemic models within one framework via state aggregation. Building on this, we map non-Markovian final states to an equivalent Markovian representation, enabling real-time fast direct prediction of long-term epidemic outcomes under vaccination. Leveraging this mapping, we design a dynamic prioritization strategy that continually allocates doses to minimize the predicted long-term final epidemic burden, explicitly balancing indirect transmission blocking with the direct protection of important groups and outperforming static policies and those short-term heuristics that target only immediate direct effects. We further uncover the underlying mechanism that drives shifts in vaccine prioritization as the epidemic progresses and coverage accumulates, underscoring the importance of adaptive allocations. This study renders long-term prediction tractable in systems with memory and provides actionable guidance for optimal vaccine deployment.</description>

      <title>Properties of zero-determinant strategies in multichannel games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Controlling payoffs in repeated games is one of the important topics in control theory of multi-agent systems. Recently proposed zero-determinant strategies enable players to unilaterally enforce linear relations between payoffs. Furthermore, based on the mathematics of zero-determinant strategies, regional payoff control, in which payoffs are enforced into some feasible regions, has been discovered in social dilemma situations. More recently, theory of payoff control was extended to multichannel games, where players parallelly interact with each other in multiple channels. However, the existence of payoff-controlling strategies in multichannel games seems to require the existence of payoff-controlling strategies in some channels, and properties of zero-determinant strategies specific to multichannel games are still not clear. In this paper, we elucidate properties of zero-determinant strategies in multichannel games. First, we relate the existence condition of zero-determinant strategies in multichannel games to that of zero-determinant strategies in each channel. We then show that the existence of zero-determinant strategies in multichannel games requires the existence of zero-determinant strategies in some channels. This result implies that the existence of zero-determinant strategies in multichannel games is tightly restricted by structure of games played in each channel.</description>

      <title>Matchings Under Biased and Correlated Evaluations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a two-institution stable matching model in which candidates from two distinct groups are evaluated using partially correlated signals that are group-biased. This extends prior work (which assumes institutions evaluate candidates in an identical manner) to a more realistic setting in which institutions rely on overlapping, but independently processed, criteria. These evaluations could consist of a variety of informative tools such as standardized tests, shared recommendation systems, or AI-based assessments with local noise. Two key parameters govern evaluations: the bias parameter $\beta \in (0,1]$, which models systematic disadvantage faced by one group, and the correlation parameter $\gamma \in [0,1]$, which captures the alignment between institutional rankings. We study the representation ratio, i.e., the ratio of disadvantaged to advantaged candidates selected by the matching process in this setting. Focusing on a regime in which all candidates prefer the same institution, we characterize the large-market equilibrium and derive a closed-form expression for the resulting representation ratio. Prior work shows that when $\gamma = 1$, this ratio scales linearly with $\beta$. In contrast, we show that the representation ratio increases nonlinearly with $\gamma$ and even modest losses in correlation can cause sharp drops in the representation ratio. Our analysis identifies critical $\gamma$-thresholds where institutional selection behavior undergoes discrete transitions, and reveals structural conditions under which evaluator alignment or bias mitigation are most effective. Finally, we show how this framework and results enable interventions for fairness-aware design in decentralized selection systems.</description>

      <title>Leveraging LLM-based agents for social science research: insights from citation network simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrates their potential to encapsulate the logic and patterns inherent in human behavior simulation by leveraging extensive web data pre-training. However, the boundaries of LLM capabilities in social simulation remain unclear. To further explore the social attributes of LLMs, we introduce the CiteAgent framework, designed to generate citation networks based on human-behavior simulation with LLM-based agents. CiteAgent successfully captures predominant phenomena in real-world citation networks, including power-law distribution, citational distortion, and shrinking diameter. Building on this realistic simulation, we establish two LLM-based research paradigms in social science: LLM-SE (LLM-based Survey Experiment) and LLM-LE (LLM-based Laboratory Experiment). These paradigms facilitate rigorous analyses of citation network phenomena, allowing us to validate and challenge existing theories. Additionally, we extend the research scope of traditional science of science studies through idealized social experiments, with the simulation experiment results providing valuable insights for real-world academic environments. Our work demonstrates the potential of LLMs for advancing science of science research in social science.</description>

      <title>Sub-exponential Growth of New Words and Names Online: A Piecewise Power-Law Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04106v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The diffusion of ideas and language in society has conventionally been described by S-shaped models, such as the logistic curve. However, the role of sub-exponential growth -- a slower-than-exponential pattern known in epidemiology -- has been largely overlooked in broader social phenomena. Here, we present a piecewise power-law model to characterize complex growth curves with a few parameters. We systematically analyzed a large-scale dataset of approximately one billion Japanese blog articles linked to Wikipedia vocabulary, and observed consistent patterns in web search trend data (English, Spanish, and Japanese). Our analysis of 2,963 items, selected for reliable estimation (e.g., sufficient duration/peak, monotonic growth), reveals that 1,625 (55%) diffusion patterns without abrupt level shifts were adequately described by one or two segments. For single-segment curves, we found that (i) the mode of the shape parameter $\alpha$ was near 0.5, indicating prevalent sub-exponential growth; (ii) the peak diffusion scale is primarily determined by the growth rate $R$, with minor contributions from $\alpha$ or the duration $T$; and (iii) $\alpha$ showed a tendency to vary with the nature of the topic, being smaller for niche/local topics and larger for widely shared ones. Furthermore, a micro-behavioral model of outward (stranger) vs. inward (community) contact suggests that $\alpha$ can be interpreted as an index of the preference for outward-oriented communication. These findings suggest that sub-exponential growth is a common pattern of social diffusion, and our model provides a practical framework for consistently describing, comparing, and interpreting complex and diverse growth curves.</description>
