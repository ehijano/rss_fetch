      <title>Duet expectile preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel axiom of co-loss aversion for a preference relation over the space of acts, represented by measurable functions on a suitable measurable space. This axiom means that the decision maker, facing the sum of two acts, dislikes the situation where both acts realize as losses simultaneously. Our main result is that, under strict monotonicity and continuity, the axiom of co-loss aversion characterizes preference relations represented by a new class of functionals, which we call the duet expectiles. A duet expectile involves two endogenous probability measures, and it becomes a usual expectile, a statistical quantity popular in regression and risk measures, when these two probability measures coincide. We discuss properties of duet expectiles and connections with fundamental concepts including probabilistic sophistication, risk aversion, and uncertainty aversion.</description>

      <title>Bertrand oligopoly in insurance markets with Value at Risk Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since 2016 the operation of insurance companies in the European Union is regulated by the Solvency II directive. According to the EU directive the capital requirement should be calculated as a 99.5\% of Value at Risk. In this study, we examine the impact of this capital requirement constraint on equilibrium premiums and capitals. We discuss the case of the oligopoly insurance market using Bertrand's model, assuming profit maximizing insurance companies facing Value at Risk constraints. First we analyze companies' decision on premium level. The companies strategic behavior can result positive as well as negative expected profit for companies. The desired situation where competition eliminate positive profit and lead the market to zero-profit state is rare. Later we examine ex post and ax ante capital adjustments. Capital adjustment does not rule out market anomalies, although somehow changes them. Possibility of capital adjustment can lead the market to a situation where all of the companies suffer loss. Allowing capital adjustment results monopolistic premium level or market failure with positive probabilities.</description>

      <title>Domar aggregation under nonneutral elasticity of substitution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The characteristics inherent in a Domar aggregation, when all sectoral productions embody a common nonneutral elasticity of substitution, is examined. There, the general equilibrium propagation of productivity changes entails structural transformation that brings nonlinearities in their aggregation into price indices. We show that negative singularity, such that a finite productivity decrease induces an infinitely large price, is possible in an inelastic economy, while positive singularity, such that a finite productivity increase induces a zero price, is possible in an elastic economy. Regarding the aggregate outputs, two independent productivity changes will have synergism in an elastic economy, whereas negative synergism will be prevalent in an inelastic economy. Neither issue is of concern in a Cobb-Douglas economy where the elasticity of substitution is everywhere neutral.</description>

      <title>Reputation in Repeated Global Games of Regime Change with Exit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I study a repeated binary-action supermodular game with endogenous exit where many short-lived agents attempt to coordinate a revolt against a regime. The regime undertakes costly actions to increase the short-run players' coordination frictions, though acts only after if the revolt is unsuccessful, inducing a lack-of-commitment problem. In the complete-information repeated game, a folk theorem holds, with payoff multiplicity arising due to both the regime's dynamic incentives and agents' stage-game strategic complementarities. Neither the regime's reputational incentives nor belief dispersion among agents (via global-games type uncertainty) alone meaningfully refine the equilibrium payoff set. Together, though, the interaction between these two forces uniquely select the regime's highest payoff in equilibrium. Furthermore, under a Markov refinement, they select a unique equilibrium where the regime plays their optimal commitment action. Methodologically, I develop tools to analyze repeated games with endogenous exit where the regime's commitment action flexibly varies with their discount rate.</description>

      <title>Dominance between combinations of infinite-mean Pareto random variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study stochastic dominance between portfolios of independent and identically distributed (iid) extremely heavy-tailed (i.e., infinite-mean) Pareto random variables. With the notion of majorization order, we show that a more diversified portfolio of iid extremely heavy-tailed Pareto random variables is larger in the sense of first-order stochastic dominance. This result is further generalized for Pareto random variables caused by triggering events, random variables with tails being Pareto, bounded Pareto random variables, and positively dependent Pareto random variables. These results provide an important implication in investment: Diversification of extremely heavy-tailed Pareto profits uniformly increases investors' profitability, leading to a diversification benefit. Remarkably, different from the finite-mean setting, such a diversification benefit does not depend on the decision maker's risk aversion.</description>

      <title>Work Smarter...Not Harder: Efficient Minimization of Dependency Length in SOV Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dependency length minimization is a universally observed quantitative property of natural languages. However, the extent of dependency length minimization, and the cognitive mechanisms through which the language processor achieves this minimization remain unclear. This research offers mechanistic insights by postulating that moving a short preverbal constituent next to the main verb explains preverbal constituent ordering decisions better than global minimization of dependency length in SOV languages. This approach constitutes a least-effort strategy because it's just one operation but simultaneously reduces the length of all preverbal dependencies linked to the main verb. We corroborate this strategy using large-scale corpus evidence across all seven SOV languages that are prominently represented in the Universal Dependency Treebank. These findings align with the concept of bounded rationality, where decision-making is influenced by 'quick-yet-economical' heuristics rather than exhaustive searches for optimal solutions. Overall, this work sheds light on the role of bounded rationality in linguistic decision-making and language evolution.</description>

      <title>Reputation, Learning and Project Choice in Frictional Economies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.01813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.01813v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I introduce a dynamic model of learning and random meetings between a long-lived agent with unknown ability and heterogeneous projects with observable qualities. The outcomes of the agent's matches with the projects determine her posterior belief about her ability (i.e., her reputation). In a self-type learning framework with endogenous outside option, I find the optimal project selection strategy of the agent, that determines what types of projects the agent with a certain level of reputation will accept. Sections of the optimal matching set become increasing intervals, with different cutoffs across different types of the projects. Increasing the meeting rate has asymmetric effects on the sections of the matching sets: it unambiguously expands the section for the high type projects, while on some regions, it initially expands and then shrinks the section of the low type projects.</description>

      <title>Entanglement: Balancing Punishment and Compensation, Repeated Dilemma Game-Theoretic Analysis of Maximum Compensation Problem for Bypass and Least Cost Paths in Fact-Checking, Case of Fake News with Weak Wallace's Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02342v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This research note is organized with respect to a novel approach to solving problems related to the spread of fake news and effective fact-checking. Focusing on the least-cost routing problem, the discussion is organized with respect to the use of Metzler functions and Metzler matrices to model the dynamics of information propagation among news providers. With this approach, we designed a strategy to minimize the spread of fake news, which is detrimental to informational health, while at the same time maximizing the spread of credible information. In particular, through the punitive dominance problem and the maximum compensation problem, we developed and examined a path to reassess the incentives of news providers to act and to analyze their impact on the equilibrium of the information market. By applying the concept of entanglement to the context of information propagation, we shed light on the complexity of interactions among news providers and contribute to the formulation of more effective information management strategies. This study provides new theoretical and practical insights into issues related to fake news and fact-checking, and will be examined against improving informational health and public digital health.This paper is partially an attempt to utilize "Generative AI" and was written with educational intent. There are currently no plans for it to become a peer-reviewed paper.</description>

      <title>Strategic Bidding in Knapsack Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the Knapsack Problem a set of indivisible objects, each with different values and sizes, must be packed into a fixed-size knapsack to maximize the total value. The knapsack problem is known to be an NP-hard problem even when there is full information regarding values and sizes. In many real-world situations, however, the values of objects are private information, which adds another dimension of complexity. In this paper we examine the knapsack problem with private information by investigating three practical auctions as possible candidates for payment rules in a setup where the knapsack owner sells the space to object owners via an auction. The three auctions are the discriminatory price, the generalized second-price and the uniform-price auctions. Using a Greedy algorithm for allocating objects, we analyze bidding behavior, revenue and efficiency of these three auctions using theory, lab experiments, and AI-enriched simulations. Our results suggest that the uniform-price auction has the highest level of truthful bidding and efficiency while the discriminatory price and the generalized second-price auctions are superior in terms of revenue generation.</description>

      <title>Repetitive Dilemma Games in Distribution Information Using Interplay of Droop Quota: Meek's Method in Impact of Maximum Compensation and Minimum Cost Routes in Information Role of Marginal Contribution in Two-Sided Matching Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is a preliminary report of the research plan and a digest of the results and discussions. On research note explores the complex dynamics of fake news dissemination and fact-checking costs within the framework of information markets and analyzes the equilibrium between supply and demand using the concepts of droop quotas, Meek's method, and marginal contributions. By adopting a two-sided matching market perspective, we delve into scenarios in which markets are stable under the influence of fake news perceived as truth and those in which credibility prevails. Through the application of iterated dilemma game theory, we investigate the strategic choices of news providers affected by the costs associated with spreading fake news and fact-checking efforts. We further examine the maximum reward problem and strategies to minimize the cost path for spreading fake news, and consider a nuanced understanding of market segmentation into "cheap" and "premium" segments based on the nature of the information being spread. Our analysis uses mathematical models and computational processes to identify stable equilibrium points that ensure market stability in the face of deceptive information practices and provide insight into effective strategies to enhance the informational health of the market. Through this comprehensive approach, this paper aims for a more truthful and reliable perspective from which to observe information markets. This paper is partially an attempt to utilize "Generative AI" and was written with educational intent. There are currently no plans for it to become a peer-reviewed paper.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence for Multi-Unit Auction design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding bidding behavior in multi-unit auctions remains an ongoing challenge for researchers. Despite their widespread use, theoretical insights into the bidding behavior, revenue ranking, and efficiency of commonly used multi-unit auctions are limited. This paper utilizes artificial intelligence, specifically reinforcement learning, as a model free learning approach to simulate bidding in three prominent multi-unit auctions employed in practice. We introduce six algorithms that are suitable for learning and bidding in multi-unit auctions and compare them using an illustrative example. This paper underscores the significance of using artificial intelligence in auction design, particularly in enhancing the design of multi-unit auctions.</description>
