      <title>Dark Energy and Cosmic Evolution: A Study in f (R, T) Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of f(R, T) gravity theory for the flat Friedmann Lemaitre Robertson Walker (FLRW) model, the accelerating expansion of the universe is investigated using a specific form of the emergent Hubble parameter. Datasets from H(z), Type Ia supernovae (SNIa), and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) are used to constrain the model and identify the ideal parameter values in order to evaluate the statistical significance of f(R, T) gravity. The best-fit parameters are derived by solving the modified Friedmann equations through a MCMC analysis. These parameters are used to compute the equation of state, statefinders, energy conditions, and the (w-w) plane. Furthermore, the evolution of kinematic cosmographic parameters is examined. The findings provide significant behavior and features of dark energy models. Our comprehension of the dynamics and evolution of the universe is improved by this study, which also advances our understanding of dark energy and how it shapes the universe.</description>

      <title>Spherically Symmetric Geometrodynamics in Jordan and Einstein frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spherically symmetric geometrodynamics is studied for scalar-tensor theory and Einstein General Relativity minimally coupled to a scalar field. We discussed the importance of boundary terms and derived the equations of motion in the Hamiltonian canonical formalism both in the Jordan and Einstein frames. These two frames are connected through an Hamiltonian canonical transformation on the reduced phase space obtained gauge-fixing the lapse and the radial shift functions. We discussed the effects of the singularity of the Hamiltonian canonical transformation connecting Jordan and Einstein frames for two static solutions (Fisher, Janis, Newman and Winicour solution in the Einstein frame and Bocharova-Bronnikov-Melnikov-Bekenstein black hole solution in the Jordan frame).</description>

      <title>Revolutionizing Gravitational Potential Analysis: From Clairaut to Lie Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter introduces an advanced novel theory for calculating non-linear Newtonian hydrostatic perturbations in the density, shape, and gravitational field of fluid stars and planets subjected to external tidal and rotational forces. The theory employs a Lie group approach using exponential mappings to derive exact differential equations for large gravitational field perturbations and the shape function, which describes the finite deformation of the body's figure. This approach lays the foundation for the precise analytic determination and numerical computation of the induced body's multipole moments and Love numbers with any desired degree of accuracy.</description>

      <title>Boundary conditions of general black hole perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, significant progress has been made in the study of black hole (BH) perturbations, both within the framework of general modified gravity theories and in complex environments. However, a well-established conclusion regarding the boundary conditions of the perturbed fields remains elusive. In this paper, we investigate the boundary conditions for a general perturbation at spatial infinity and the event horizon of a black hole (BH) described by a generic metric that is stationary, axisymmetric, asymptotically flat, and respects the condition of circularity. Our analysis is independent of any specific BH model or the nature of the perturbed field. In particular, by extending the formulation introduced by Teukolsky and utilizing purely geometric principles, we derive a universal expression for the boundary condition at the horizon. This expression is elegantly formulated in terms of the physical quantities at the event horizon, specifically the BH's surface gravity and angular velocity. The results presented in this work may provide valuable insights for the calculation of quasinormal modes and the gravitational waves generated by extreme-mass-ratio inspirals, extending beyond the standard Kerr case.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Viability of $f(Q, T)$ Gravity: Constraining Parameters with Cosmological Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the model of $ f(Q, T) $ gravity, an extension of symmetric teleparallel gravity where the nonmetricity scalar $ Q $ is non-minimally coupled to the trace of the energy-momentum tensor $ T $. The model is developed as an alternative to the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model and is analyzed using a cosmic chronometer and Pantheon$^+$ supernovae data sets. Through Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis, we constrain the model parameters $ \alpha $, $ \beta $, and $ H_0 $, and compare the performance of the model with $\Lambda$CDM by evaluating statistical measures such as chi-square, Akaike information criterion, and Bayesian information criterion. The results show that the $ f(Q, T) $ model effectively mimics $\Lambda$CDM while offering an alternative explanation based on modified gravity. We also examine cosmographic parameters like the deceleration parameter, confirming the transition of the Universe from deceleration to acceleration, and the violation of the strong energy condition, which aligns with observed late-time cosmic acceleration. Additionally, the model provides age estimates for the Universe that are consistent with current observations.</description>

      <title>Can Rotating Black Holes Have Short Hairs?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the no-hair theorem, several notable hairy black hole (BH) solutions exist in both General Relativity and modified gravity theories. For such hairs to be detectable, they must extend sufficiently beyond the event horizon. This idea has been rigorously formalized by the no-short hair theorem, which dictates that all existing hairs of a static spherically symmetric BH must extend at least to the innermost light ring (LR). However, the theorem's applicability to the astrophysically relevant rotating BHs remains elusive as yet. To address this gap, we examine its validity for rotating BHs in the Konoplya-Rezzolla-Zhidenko-Stuchl\'ik and Johannsen classes. Interestingly, for Klein-Gordon separable BHs in these classes that are solutions of non-vacuum GR, the no-short hair property continues to hold. However, unlike in static cases, this result may not apply in a theory-agnostic fashion due to the rotation-induced repulsive effects. Consequently, we identify a minimal set of additional criteria on the metric and matter content needed for such a generalization in other theories. Our study marks an important first step toward establishing general results on the extent of rotating BH hairs, reinforcing their observational detections. Further extension of this novel result for rotating horizonless objects is also discussed.</description>

      <title>The Spectroscopy of Kerr-Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-Axion: Exact Quasibound States, Scalar Cloud, Horizon's Boson Statistics and Superradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present study, we investigate the quasibound states, scalar cloud and superradiance of relativistic scalar fields bound to a rotating black hole in Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-Axion theory (Kerr-EMDA). We present the exact eigensolutions of the governing Klein-Gordon equation in the black hole background. By imposing boundary conditions on the quasibound states, we are able to find the exact complex quasibound state frequencies of the corresponding radial wave functions in terms of the confluent Heun polynomial. Considering light scalar field limit of the obtained solution, we investigate the scalar-black hole resonance configuration known as the scalar cloud. In addition, we obtain analytic relation between light scalar mass and black hole spin for scalar cloud. We explore a boson distribution function by linearly expanding the radial wave function near the black hole's event horizon. Moreover, by applying the Damour-Ruffini method, this allows us to calculate the Hawking radiation flux. In the final section, we consider propagating wave in a slowly rotating Kerr-EMDA black hole for bosons having much larger Compton wavelength comparing to the size of rotating black hole. This condition allows us to use the asymptotic matching technique to calculate the amplification factor for scalar fields in the Kerr-EMDA black hole. We present the dependence of amplification factor on black hole parameters by graphical analysis.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the fermionic quasi-bound states around Schwarzschild black holes with improved analytic spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black holes have long served as a testing ground for probing theories of gravity and quantum mechanics. Notably, fundamental fields in the neighborhood of black holes exhibit rich phenomena that could yield astrophysical observable signatures. However, exploring these structures typically requires computationally intensive numerical calculations. In this work, the dynamics of a massive Dirac field outside a Schwarzschild black hole is revisited. We propose a novel matching scheme that enables the analytical solution of the coupled first-order Dirac equation, as opposed to the conventional second-order approach. This method yields a compact and unified analytical expression for the energy spectrum, which shows improved agreement with numerical results. The improvement is due to high-order correction of angular parameter that has been ignored previously.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Tomography: Unveiling Black Hole Ringdown via Gravitational Wave Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the post-merger regime of a binary black hole merger, the gravitational wave signal consists of a superposition of quasi-normal modes (QNMs) of the remnant black hole. It has been observed empirically, primarily through numerical simulations and heuristic arguments, that the infalling radiation at the horizon is also composed of a superposition of QNMs. In this paper, we provide an analytic explanation for this observation in the perturbative regime. Our analysis is based on a characteristic initial value formulation where data is prescribed on the horizon (modeled as a perturbed isolated horizon), and on a transversal null-hypersurface which registers the outgoing radiation. This allows us to reformulate the traditional QNM problem in a fully 4-dimensional setting. Using a mode-decomposition, we demonstrate that the radiation modes crossing $\mathcal{H}$ are highly correlated with the outgoing modes crossing $\mathcal{I}$, and provide explicit expressions linking $\widetilde{\Psi}_0$ at the horizon with $\widetilde{\Psi}_4$ at null infinity.</description>

      <title>Bayesian analysis of analog gravity systems with the Rezzolla-Zhidenko metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analog gravity systems have the unique opportunity to probe theoretical aspects of black hole physics in a controlled laboratory environment that one cannot easily observe for astrophysical black holes. In this work, we address the question of whether one could use controlled initial perturbations to excite the black hole ringdown and infer the effective black hole metric. Using a theory-agnostic ansatz for the effective metric described by the Rezzolla-Zhidenko metric and evolving perturbations on that background, we quantify with Bayesian analysis what regions of the effective spacetime could be constrained in experiments. In contrast to standard ringdown analyses based on quasi-normal mode extraction, a laboratory-controlled setup, in combination with our framework, allows one to model the entire signal, including the prompt response and possible effects of late-time tails. Therefore, it has the intriguing advantage of not relying on start and end times when the superposition of quasi-normal modes is a good signal approximation. It also avoids the non-trivial question of how many modes are present. We demonstrate that this approach is feasible in principle and discuss opportunities beyond this study.</description>

      <title>Complete Hamiltonian Framework of Relativistic Hierarchical Triple Systems: Capabilities and Limitations of Secular Perturbation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relativistic secular perturbation theory has ignited significant interest in uncovering intricate cross-term effects, especially the interplay between 1PN and quadrupole terms. While most existing studies rely on the Lagrangian planetary perturbation method for computing cross terms, a comprehensive Hamiltonian framework for the field has been missing. In this work, we introduce a framework based on von Zeipel transformation, utilizing two sequential canonical transformations to systematically compute cross terms to arbitrary orders. Our results reveal secular cross terms up to quadrupole-squared order, showcasing remarkable consistency with both the Lagrangian method [1] and the effective-field-theory approach [2]. We present leading-order periodic cross terms arising from the interactions between 1PN and quadrupole, and present estimates of higher-order cross terms. It is demonstrated that this method not only accurately predicts the long-term evolution of hierarchical systems but also captures fast oscillations observed in N-body simulations. We identify and validate resonances caused by quadrupole-squared effects, highlighting both consistencies and discrepancies when compared to N-body simulations. These discrepancies underscore the importance of mean-motion resonances, a factor overlooked in current secular perturbation frameworks. Finally, we provide a comprehensive review of the subtleties and limitations inherent to secular perturbation theory, paving the way for future research and advancements in this field.</description>

      <title>Polarimetric searches for axion dark matter and high-frequency gravitational waves using optical cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit birefringence effects associated with the evolution of the polarization of light as it propagates through axion dark matter or the background of a passing gravitational wave (GW). We demonstrate that this can be described by a unified formalism, highlighting a synergy between searches for axions and high-frequency GWs. We show that by exploiting this framework, the optical cavities used by the ALPS II experiment can potentially probe axion masses in the range $m_a \sim 10^{-9} - 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{eV}$, offering competitive sensitivity with existing laboratory and astrophysical searches. Also building on this approach, we propose using these optical cavities to search for high-frequency GWs by measuring changes in the polarization of their laser. This makes it a promising method for exploring, in the near future, GWs with frequencies above $100$ MHz and strain sensitivities on the order of $10^{-14} \, \mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$. Such sensitivity allows the exploration of currently unconstrained parameter space, complementing other high-frequency GW experiments. This work contributes to the growing community investigating novel approaches for high-frequency GW detection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Local methods of direct determination of the Hubble constant and $\sigma_8$ seem to conflict with the predictions made from the cosmic microwave background and $\Lambda$CDM. We propose a proof-of-concept model that models portions of the dark sector as several coupled axion-like fields, resulting in both early and late time departures from $\Lambda$CDM. We determine that the model successfully eliminates both the Hubble and $\sigma_8$ tensions, while remaining consistent with both the DESI survey and the BAO sound horizon.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic stability from Lorentzian path integrals and codimension-two singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has previously been shown how the gravitational thermal partition function can be obtained from a Lorentzian path integral. Unlike the Euclidean case, the integration contour over Lorentzian metrics is not immediately ruled out by the conformal factor problem. One can then ask whether this contour can be deformed to pick up nontrivial contributions from various saddle points. In Einstein-Maxwell theory, we argue that the relevance of each black hole saddle to the thermal partition function depends on its thermodynamic stability against variations in energy, angular momentum, and charge. The argument involves consideration of constrained saddles where area and quantities associated with angular momentum and charge are fixed on a codimension-two surface. Consequently, this surface possesses not only a conical singularity, but two other types of singularities. The latter are characterized by shifts along the surface and along the Maxwell gauge group acquired as one winds around near the surface in a metric-orthogonal and connection-horizontal manner. We first study this enlarged class of codimension-two singularities in generality and propose an action for singular configurations. We then incorporate these configurations into the path integral calculation of the partition function, focusing on three-dimensional spacetimes to simplify the treatment of angular momentum.</description>

      <title>Impact of particle production during inflation on the detection of CMB B-mode polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work focuses on particle production described by a nonminimally coupled model during inflation. In this model, three parameters determine the characteristic frequency and strength of the induced gravitational waves (GWs). Considering the impact of particle production on inflation, we identify the parameter values that generate the strongest GWs without violating the slow-roll mechanism at the CMB scale. However, even with such extreme parameters, the power spectrum of induced GWs is only about three thousandths of that of primordial GWs. This contribution remains insignificant when identifying the primary source of a detected CMB B-mode polarization. However, to precisely confirm the energy scale of inflation and extract information about quantum gravity, distinguishing between the CMB B-mode polarization from different sources is crucial. We compare the total power spectrum with that of primordial GWs, revealing a characteristic peak in the total spectrum. This peak can be used to test the model and differentiate it from other inflationary sources.</description>

      <title>Insights into Supermassive Black Hole Mergers from the Gravitational Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics, participants of the rapid response workshop on the gravitational wave background explored discrepancies between experimental results and theoretical models for a background originating from supermassive black hole binary mergers. Underestimated theoretical and/or experimental uncertainties are likely to be the explanation. Another key focus was the wide variety of search methods for supermassive black hole binaries, with the conclusion that the most compelling detections would involve systems exhibiting both electromagnetic and gravitational wave signatures</description>

      <title>A torus of $N$-dimensional charged anti-de-Sitter black holes in the quadratic form of $f(Q)$ gravitational theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to the absence of spherically symmetric black hole solutions in $f(\mathbb{Q})$ because of the constraint derived from its field equations, which yields either $\mathbb{Q}=0 $ or $f_{\mathbb{Q} \mathbb{Q}}=0 $ \cite{Heisenberg:2023lru,Maurya:2023muz}. We are going to introduce a tours solutions for charged anti-de-Sitter black holes in $N$-dimensions within the framework of the quadratic form of $f(\mathbb{Q})$ gravity, where the coincident gauge condition is applied \cite{Heisenberg:2023lru}. Here, $f(\mathbb{Q})=\mathbb{Q}+\frac{1}2\alpha \mathbb{Q}^2-2\Lambda$, and the condition $N \geq 4$ is satisfied. These black hole solutions exhibit flat or cylindrical horizons as their distinctive features. An intriguing aspect of these black hole solutions lies in the coexistence of electric monopole and quadrupole components within the potential field, which are indivisible and exhibit interconnected momenta. This sets them apart from the majority of known charged solutions in the linear form of the non-metricity theory and its extensions. Moreover, the curvature singularities in these solutions are less severe compared to those found in known charged black hole solutions within the characteristic can be demonstrated by computing certain invariants of the curvature and non-metricity tensors. Finally, we calculate thermodynamic parameters, including entropy, Hawking temperature, and Gibbs free energy. These thermodynamic computations affirm the stability of our model.</description>

      <title>Connecting the circular and drifted Rindler Unruh effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Minkowski spacetime quantum field theory, each stationary motion is associated with an effective, energy-dependent notion of temperature, which generalises the familiar Unruh temperature of uniform linear acceleration. Motivated by current experimental interest in circular motion, we analyse the effective temperature for drifted Rindler motion, generated by a boost and a spacelike translation (drift), and the way in which drifted Rindler motion can be smoothly (and in fact real analytically) deformed to circular motion through a third type of motion known as parator. For an Unruh-DeWitt detector coupled linearly to a massless scalar field in 2+1 and 3+1 spacetime dimensions, we establish analytic results in the limits of large gap, small gap and large drift speed. For fixed proper acceleration, the drifted Rindler temperature remains bounded in the large gap limit, in contrast to the circular motion temperature, which can be arbitrarily large in this limit. Finally, in 2+1 dimensions, we trace the vanishing of the circular motion temperature in the small gap limit to the weak decay of the Wightman function, and we show that, among all types of stationary motion in all dimensions, this phenomenon is unique to 2+1 dimensions and therein to circular and parator motion.</description>

      <title>The no-hair theorems at work in M87$^\ast$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, a perturbative calculation to the first post-Newtonian order has shown that the analytically worked out Lense-Thirring precession of the orbital angular momentum of a test particle following a circular path around a massive spinning primary is able to explain the measured features of the jet precession of the supermassive black hole at the centre of the giant elliptical galaxy M87. It is shown that also the hole's mass quadrupole moment $Q_2$, as given by the no-hair theorems, has a dynamical effect which cannot be neglected, as, instead, done so far in the literature. New allowed regions for the hole's dimensionless spin parameter $a^\ast$ and the effective radius $r_0$ of the accretion disk, assumed tightly coupled with the jet, are obtained by including both the Lense-Thirring and the quadrupole effects in the dynamics of the effective test particle modeling the accretion disk. One obtains that, by numerically integrating the resulting averaged equations for the rates of change of the angles $\eta$ and $\phi$ characterizing the orientation of the orbital angular momentum with $a^\ast = +0.98$ and $r_0=14.1$ gravitational radii, it is possible to reproduce, both quantitatively and qualitatively, the time series for them recently measured with the Very Long Baseline Interferometry technique. Instead, the resulting time series produced with $a^\ast = -0.95$ and $r_0=16$ gravitational radii turn out to be out of phase with respect to the observationally determined ones, while maintaining the same amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Ordering Ambiguities in Weak Chern-Simons 4D Gravity and Metastability of the Condensate-Induced Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12519v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we elaborate further on a 4D cosmological Running-Vacuum-type Model (RVM) of inflation that characterises string-inspired Chern-Simons (CS) gravity. It has been shown that inflation in such models is caused by a condensation of the gravitational CS (gCS) terms induced by primordial gravitational waves (GW), which leads to a linear-axion potential, thus breaking the shift symmetry, and lifting its periodicity (monodromy). We demonstrate here that this inflationary phase may be metastable, due to the existence of non-trivial imaginary parts of the gCS condensate. These imaginary parts are quantum effects, proportional to appropriate commutators of GW perturbations. As we stress, their existence is quantum-ordering-scheme dependent. We argue here in favor of a physical importance of such imaginary parts, which we compute to second order in the GW (tensor) perturbations in the framework of a specific gauge-fixed effective Lagrangian, within a (mean field) weak-quantum-gravity path integral approach. We pay specific attention to the various space-time boundary terms. We thus provide an estimate of the life time of inflation. On matching our results with the relevant inflationary phenomenology, we fix the quantum-ordering ambiguities, and obtain an order-of-magnitude constraint on the ratio of the string energy scale $M_s$ in this model to the (four-spacetime-dimensional) reduced Planck mass $M_{\rm Pl}$, specifically, $M_s/M_{\rm Pl} = \mathcal{O}(10^{-1})$. This is consistent with the corresponding estimate obtained in previous analyses by the authors in this framework, based on a dynamical-system approach to linear-axion RVM inflation. Finally, we examine the role of periodic modulations in the axion potential induced by non-perturbative stringy effects on the slow-roll inflationary parameters, and find compatibility with the cosmological data.</description>

Abstract: The concept of interior entropy of black hole provides a possible way to deal with information problem. We derive evolution relation between interior entropy and Bekenstein-Hawking entropy for a loop quantum-corrected black hole with large mass pierced by an infinitely straight cosmic string during Hawking radiation. We find that the present cosmic string can influence the evolution relation between these two types of entropy under black hole evaporation and the second law of thermodynamics is satisfied for the total variation of these two types of entropy.</description>

Abstract: We apply machine learning to understand fundamental aspects of holographic duality, specifically the entropies obtained from the apparent and event horizon areas. We show that simple features of only the time series of the pressure anisotropy, namely the values and half-widths of the maxima and minima, the times these are attained, and the times of the first zeroes can predict the areas of the apparent and event horizons in the dual bulk geometry at all times with a fixed maximum length ($10$) of the input vector. We also argue that the entropy functions are the measures of information that need to be extracted from simple one-point functions to reconstruct specific aspects of correlation functions of the dual state with the best possible approximations.</description>

      <title>Neural Ordinary Differential Equations for Mapping the Magnetic QCD Phase Diagram via Holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The QCD phase diagram is crucial for understanding strongly interacting matter under extreme conditions, with major implications for cosmology, neutron stars, and heavy-ion collisions. We present a novel holographic QCD model utilizing neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to map the QCD phase diagram under magnetic field $B$, baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$, and temperature $T$. By solving the inverse problem of constructing the gravitational theory from Lattice QCD data, we reveal an unprecedentedly rich phase structure at finite $B$, including discovering multiple critical endpoints (CEPs) under strong magnetic fields. Specifically, for {$B = 1.618 \, \mathrm{GeV}^2=2.592 \times 10^{19}$ Gauss}, we identify two distinct CEPs at $(T_C = 87.3 \, \mathrm{MeV}, \, \mu_C = 115.9 \, \mathrm{MeV})$ and $(T_C = 78.9 \, \mathrm{MeV}, \, \mu_C = 244.0 \, \mathrm{MeV})$. Notably, the critical exponents vary depending on the CEP's location. These findings significantly advance our understanding of the QCD phase structure and provide concrete predictions for experimental validation at upcoming facilities such as FAIR, JPARC-HI, and NICA.</description>

      <title>Testing the Cosmic Distance Duality Relation Using Strong Gravitational Lensing Time Delays and Type Ia Supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive test of the cosmic distance duality relation (DDR) using a combination of strong gravitational lensing (SGL) time delay measurements and Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) data. We investigate three different parameterizations of potential DDR violations. To bridge the gap between SGL and SNe Ia datasets, we implement an artificial neural network (ANN) approach to reconstruct the distance modulus of SNe Ia. Our analysis uniquely considers both scenarios where the absolute magnitude of SNe Ia ($M_B$) is treated as a free parameter and where it is fixed to a Cepheid-calibrated value. Using a sample of six SGL systems and the Pantheon+ SNe Ia dataset, we find no statistically significant evidence for DDR violations across all parameterizations. The consistency of our findings across different parameterizations not only reinforces confidence in the standard DDR but also demonstrates the robustness of our analytical approach.</description>

Abstract: Supernova theory has struggled to explain the lightest known neutron star candidate with an accurate mass determination, the $1.174\mathrm{M}_\odot$ companion in the eccentric compact binary system J0453+1559. To improve the theoretical lower limit for neutron star birth masses, we perform 3D supernova simulations for five stellar models close to the minimum mass for iron core collapse. We obtain a record-low neutron star mass of $1.192\mathrm{M}_\odot$ and a substantial kick of $\mathord{\sim} 100\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. Given residual uncertainties in stellar evolution, a neutron star origin for the $1.174\mathrm{M}_\odot$ object remains plausible.</description>

      <title>Investigating the role of nuclear parameters on oscillation modes in hot Neutron Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that certain nuclear parameters are more dominant than others in governing global neutron star properties, such as its structure or oscillation mode characteristics. Although neutron stars can in general assumed to be cold, in astrophysical scenarios such as newly born neutron stars or remnants of binary neutron star mergers, finite temperature effects play a non-negligible role. In this work, we perform a consistent and systematic investigation of the role of nuclear parameters and thermal effects on neutron star properties and fluid oscillation modes within a full general relativistic scheme. We impose constraints on the parameter space of the relativistic mean field model using state-of-the-art information from terrestrial experiments and multi-messenger astrophysical data. We find effective nucleon mass to be the most important nuclear parameter controlling astrophysical observables of hot neutron stars, similar to the cold beta equilibrated matter. However, we conclude that the interplay among saturation properties and astrophysical observables depends not only on the thermal configurations considered but also on the constraints imposed. We also investigated the role of nuclear saturation parameters on some universal relations for hot NSs which are important in gravitational wave asteroseismology. Our investigation confirmed that these relations are mostly insensitive to nuclear saturation properties and mainly affected by variation of charge fraction in the star.</description>

      <title>A neural network emulator of the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo selection function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Characterization of search selection effects comprises a core element of gravitational-wave data analysis. Knowledge of selection effects is needed to predict observational prospects for future surveys and is essential in the statistical inference of astrophysical source populations from observed catalogs of compact binary mergers. Although gravitational-wave selection functions can be directly measured via injection campaigns -- the insertion and attempted recovery of simulated signals added to real instrumental data -- such efforts are computationally expensive. Moreover, the inability to interpolate between discrete injections limits the ability to which we can study narrow or discontinuous features in the compact binary population. For this reason, there is a growing need for alternative representations of gravitational-wave selection functions that are computationally cheap to evaluate and can be computed across a continuous range of compact binary parameters. In this paper, we describe one such representation. Using pipeline injections performed during Advanced LIGO &amp; Advanced Virgo's third observing run (O3), we train a neural network emulator for $P(\mathrm{det}|\theta)$, the probability that given a compact binary with parameters is successfully detected, averaged over the course of O3. The emulator captures the dependence of $P(\mathrm{det}|\theta)$ on binary masses, spins, distance, sky position, and orbital orientation, and it is valid for compact binaries with components masses between $1$--$100\,M_\odot$. We test the emulator's ability to produce accurate distributions of detectable events, and demonstrate its use in hierarchical inference of the binary black hole population.</description>

Abstract: We present a new method to analytically prove global stability in ghost-ridden dynamical systems. Our proposal encompasses all prior results and consequentially extends them. In particular, we show that stability can follow from a conserved quantity that is unbounded from below, contrary to expectation. Novel examples illustrate all our results. Our findings take root on a careful examination of the literature, here comprehensively reviewed for the first time. This work lays the mathematical basis for ulterior extensions to field theory and quantization, and it constitutes a gateway for inter-disciplinary research in dynamics and integrability.</description>

Abstract: Since the discovery of the accelerated expansion of the Universe in 1998, modified gravity (MG) theories have attracted considerable attention as alternatives to dark energy (DE). While distinguishing the effects of MG from those of DE using cosmic background expansion alone is difficult, the large-scale structure is expected to differ significantly. Among the plethora of MG models, we are particularly interested in those that introduce a scale dependence in the growth of perturbations; specifically, theories that introduce fifth forces mediated by scalar fields with a finite range accessible to cosmological probes. This is the case with $f(R)$ gravity, which is widely regarded as the most studied model in cosmology. In this work, we utilize, for the first time, the full-shape power spectrum of galaxies to constrain scale-dependent modified gravity theories. By using BOSS DR12 dataset, along with a big bang nucleosynthesis prior on $ \omega_b $ and a Planck 2018 prior on $ n_s $, we obtain an upper bound of $ |f_{R0}| &lt; 5.89 \times 10^{-6} $ at 68% confidence level (c.l.) and $ &lt; 1.53 \times 10^{-5} $ at 95% c.l. for the Hu-Sawicki ($ n=1 $) model. We discuss that it is highly unlikely these constraints will be significantly improved by future galaxy spectroscopic catalogs, such as DESI and Euclid.</description>

      <title>Reheating Dynamics in Inflationary Cosmology: Insights from $\alpha$-Attractor and $\alpha$-Starobinsky Models</title>

Abstract: Reheating in inflationary cosmology is essential for understanding the early universe, influencing particle production, thermalization, and the primordial power spectrum. Crucial quantities defined during the reheating epoc, such as the equation of state parameter $\omega_{re}$, reheating temperature $T_{re}$, and the number of $e$-folds $N_{re}$, affect inflationary observables like the scalar spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. We analyze two classes of inflationary models: generalized $\alpha$-attractor models and the $\alpha$-Starobinsky generalization. These models, motivated by supergravity and string theory, exhibit attractor behavior, ensuring strong predictions and have been studied extensively before. A salient novelty of this study, compared to previous works, is the inclusion of an analytical expression for the reheating temperature, $T_{\text{re}}$, which makes it a dynamical quantity. This is crucial for determining all the cosmological quantities analyzed in this work. Our results show a universal scaling behavior for a tightly bounded $T_{re}$ in both models. We believe this is the first time that $T_{re}$ is so closely determined. This work complements previous Bayesian and numerical studies by providing detailed numerical and analytical insights into the evolution of cosmological observables and reheating parameters, offering also constraints on inflationary models based on observational data.</description>

      <title>Stepping Up Superradiance Constraints on Axions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Light feebly-coupled bosonic particles can efficiently extract the rotational energy of rapidly spinning black holes on sub-astrophysical timescales via a phenomenon known as black hole superradiance. In the case of light axions, the feeble self-interactions of these particles can lead to a non-linear coupled evolution of many superradiant quasi-bound states, dramatically altering the rate at which the black hole is spun down. In this work, we extend the study of axion superradiance to higher order states, solving for the first time the coupled evolution of all states with $n \leq 5$ in the fully relativistic limit (with $n$ being the principle quantum number). Using a Bayesian framework, we re-derive constraints on axions using the inferred spins of solar mass black holes, demonstrating that previously adopted limit-setting procedures have underestimated current sensitivity to the axion decay constant $f_a$ by around one order of magnitude, and that the inclusion to higher order states allows one to reasonably capture the evolution of typical high-spin black holes across a much wider range of parameter space, thereby allowing constraints to be extended to more massive axions. We conclude with an extensive discussion on the systematics associated with spin inference from x-ray observations.</description>

      <title>Properties of the wormhole-dominant phase in two-dimensional quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the $N \times N$ Hermitian one-matrix model modified by the double-trace interaction. It is known that the coupling for the double-trace interaction can control the weight for the microscopic wormholes if interpreting the matrix model as the lattice model of random surface; tuning the coupling to its critical value, the effect of wormholes become substantial to change the critical behavior of the pure $2$D quantum gravity, which is characterized by a certain positive value of the string susceptibility. In the large-$N$ limit, we calculate the continuum limit of the disk amplitude in which the wormhole effects are important. The resulting continuum disk amplitude is the same as that of the pure $2$D quantum gravity. We also introduce the renormalized coupling for the double-trace interaction, and show that the newly introduced renormalized coupling can alter the renormalized bulk cosmological constant effectively.</description>
