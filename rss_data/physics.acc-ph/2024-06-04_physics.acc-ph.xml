      <title>Deriving the size and shape of the ALBA electron beam with optical synchrotron radiation interferometry using aperture masks: technical choices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore non-redundant aperture masking to derive the size and shape of the ALBA synchrotron light source at optical wavelengths using synchrotron radiation interferometry. We show that non-redundant masks are required due to phase fluctuations arising within the experimental set-up. We also show, using closure phase, that the phase fluctuations are factorizable into element-based errors. We employ multiple masks, including 2, 3, 5, and 6 hole configurations. We develop a process for self-calibration of the element-based amplitudes (square root of flux through the aperture), which corrects for non-uniform illumination over the mask, in order to derive visibility coherences and phases, from which the source size and shape can be derived. We explore the optimal procedures to obtain the most reliable results with the 5-hole mask, based on the temporal scatter in measured coherences and closure phases. We find that the closure phases are very stable, and close to zero (within $2^o$). Through uv-modeling, we consider the noise properties of the experiment and conclude that our visibility measurements per frame are likely accurate to an rms scatter of $\sim 1\%$.</description>

      <title>Bi-Filar Coil Winding for Fast Quench Protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As superconducting magnet technology is pushed towards higher performance, energy density and total stored energy follow exponentially. Protecting magnets becomes substantially more challenging with traditional methods being stretched to their limits. New technologies such as CLIQ (Coupling Loss Induced Quench) promise to provide a robust method to protect advanced magnets, however they become inductance limited in large magnet strings or at low field, leading to more complex configurations. A technique to substantially reduce this limitation and improve response time is presented, by winding coils in a bifilar fashion and connecting them in series for typical operation, while providing an anti-parallel connection for quasi-zero-inductance in a protection case. This allows for extremely high di/dt. The concept is then demonstrated on a small REBCO coil.</description>

      <title>Beyond Earthly Limits: Protection against Cosmic Radiation through Biological Response Pathways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The upcoming phase of space exploration not only includes trips to Mars and beyond, but also holds great promise for human progress. However, the harm caused by cosmic radiation, consisting of Galactic Cosmic Rays and Solar Particle Events, is an important safety concern for astronauts and other living things that will accompany them. Research exploring the biological effects of cosmic radiation includes experiments conducted in space itself and in simulated space environments on Earth. Notably, NASA's Space Radiation Laboratory has taken significant steps forward in simulating cosmic radiation by using particle accelerators and is currently pioneering the progress in this field. Curiously, much of the research emphasis thus far has been on understanding how cosmic radiation impacts living organisms, instead of finding ways to help them resist the radiation. In this paper, we briefly talk about current research on the biological effects of cosmic radiation and propose possible protective measures through biological interventions. In our opinion, biological response pathways responsible for coping with stressors on Earth can provide effective solutions for protection against the stress caused by cosmic radiation. We also recommend evaluating the effectiveness of these pathways through experiments using particle accelerators to simulate the effects of cosmic radiation.</description>
