      <title>On the Performance of Linear Adaptive Filters driven by the Ergodic Chaotic Logistic Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chaotic dynamical systems are increasingly considered for use in coding and transmission systems. This stems from their parameter sensitivity and spectral characteristics. The latter are relevant for channel estimation methods. In particular the logistic map $f_\lambda =\lambda x\left( 1-x\right) $ has been employed in chaotic coding and spread spectrum transmission systems. For $\lambda =4$ the statistical properties of sequences generated by $f_4$ are considered as ideal drive signals for channel estimation schemes. This assumption is proven in the present paper. To this end the higher order statistical moments and the autocorrelation of time series generated by $f_4$ are derived. It is shown that for $\lambda =4$ the zero mean time series is uncorrelated. The adaptation performance of finite impulse response (FIR) digital adaptive filters (DAF) used for channel estimation is analyzed. It is shown that using zero mean sequences of $f_4$ leads to the maximal possible FIR DAF performance. An optimal value for the damping parameter in the LMS scheme is derived that leads to the maximal performance and ensures stability. The analytic considerations are confirmed by simulation results.</description>

      <title>Oscillations in a Slow-Fast Paleoclimate Model for Glacial Cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a deterministic variant of the Saltzman-Maasch model for Pleistocene glacial cycles, formulated as a three-dimensional dynamical system with cubic feedback in the atmospheric carbon dioxide equation. After reducing the model to a planar system on a critical manifold, we perform a detailed bifurcation analysis and identify both Hopf and Bautin (generalized Hopf) bifurcations, which govern the emergence of stable and unstable limit cycles. To analyze global transitions, we perform a rescaling of time and variables to derive a leading-order Hamiltonian system. This reduction enables the explicit construction of homoclinic orbits and the application of Melnikov's method to assess their persistence under perturbations. The analytical findings are further corroborated by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Relative periodic solutions in spatial Kepler problem with symmetric perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the spatial Kepler problem under a perturbation satisfying both rotational symmetry and reflection symmetry with respect to a plane perpendicular to the rotational axis. By applying recent results from \cite{CHHL23} combined with Franks Theorem, we prove the existence of infinitely many relative periodic solutions contained in compact energy surface when the perturbation is sufficiently small and certain technical conditions hold. In addition, we also demonstrate the existence of a unique $z$-symmetric brake orbit which forms a hopf link with a plane relative periodic solutions contained in compact energy surface only requires the perturbation sufficiently small. Our results apply to the motion of a satellite around an ellipsoid with uniform mass distribution and to the $n$-pyramidal problem with one point mass moving along $z$-axis and other $n$ equal masses forming a regular $n$-gon perpendicular to the $z$-axis at all times.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we first show that the collection of all subsets of \( \mathbb{R} \) having lower dimension \( \gamma \in [0,1] \) is dense in \( \Pi(\mathbb{R}) \), the space of compact subsets of \( \mathbb{R} \). Furthermore, we show that the set of Borel probability measures with lower dimension \( \beta \in [0, m] \) is dense in \( \Omega(\mathbb{R}^m) \), the space of Borel probability measures on \( \mathbb{R}^m \). We also prove that the quantization and the lower dimension of a measure \( \vartheta \) coincide with those of the convolution of \( \vartheta \) with a finite combination of Dirac measures. In the end, we compute the lower dimension of the invariant measure associated with the product IFS.</description>

      <title>Pointwise ergodic theorem along primes of the form $x^2 + ny^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper resolves the question of pointwise convergence for ergodic averages of a single function along the set of polynomial values of primes of the form $x^2 + ny^2$. Following the influential paper of Bourgain \cite{bourgain1989pointwise}, we employ the Hardy-Littlewood circle method where major arc and minor arc estimates for the set of prime ideals constitute the main novelty of the paper. We also prove that our convergence results cannot be extended to class of $L^1$ functions.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the differentiability of the conjugacy in a nonautonomous version of the Hartman--Grobman Theorem for systems with finite delay, where the linear part satisfies a $\mu$-dichotomy. Under suitable conditions on the nonlinear perturbation, the conjugacy is shown to be a $C^{1}$ diffeomorphism.</description>

      <title>Discrete VHCs for Propeller Motion of a Devil-Stick using purely Impulsive Inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The control problem of realizing propeller motion of a devil-stick in the vertical plane using impulsive forces applied normal to the stick is considered. This problem is an example of underactuated robotic juggling and has not been considered in the literature before. Inspired by virtual holonomic constraints, the concept of discrete virtual holonomic constraints (DVHC) is introduced for the first time to solve this orbital stabilization problem. At the discrete instants when impulsive inputs are applied, the location of the center-of-mass of the devil-stick is specified in terms of its orientation angle. This yields the discrete zero dynamics (DZD), which provides conditions for stable propeller motion. In the limiting case, when the rotation angle between successive applications of impulsive inputs is chosen to be arbitrarily small, the problem reduces to that of propeller motion under continuous forcing. A controller that enforces the DVHC, and an orbit stabilizing controller based on the impulse controlled Poincar\'e map approach are presented. The efficacy of the approach to trajectory design and stabilization is validated through simulations.</description>

      <title>Outer symplectic billiard map at infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the second iteration $T^2$ of the outer symplectic billiard map with respect to a convex domain $M$ in a symplectic vector space is approximated by an explicit Hamiltonian flow for points far away from $M$.
  More precisely, denote by $N$ the symplectic polar dual of the symmetrization $M\ominus M$ of $M$. If we write $N$ as the unit level set of a 1-homogeneous function $H$, then the difference between $T^2$ and the time-2-Hamiltonian flow of $H$ applied to a point $x$ is smaller than $c/|x|$ for some constant $c$ depending only on $M$.
  Moreover, we show that if an orbit escapes to infinity, then its distance to the origin grows not faster than $\sqrt{k}$ in the number of iterations. Finally, we prove that a $k$-periodic orbit needs to be close, in terms of $k$, to $M$.</description>

      <title>Differential Stochastic Variational Inequalities with Parametric Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The differential stochastic variational inequality with parametric convex optimization (DSVI-O) is an ordinary differential equation whose right-hand side involves a stochastic variational inequality and solutions of several dynamic and random parametric convex optimization problems. We consider that the distribution of the random variable is time-dependent and assume that the involved functions are continuous and the expectation is well-defined. We show that the DSVI-O has a weak solution with integrable and measurable solutions of the parametric optimization problems. Moreover, we propose a discrete scheme of DSVI-O by using a time-stepping approximation and the sample average approximation and prove the convergence of the discrete scheme. We illustrate our theoretical results of DSVI-O with applications in an embodied intelligence system for the elderly health by synthetic health care data generated by Multimodal Large Language Models.</description>

      <title>Stoichiometric recipes for periodic oscillations in reaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Oscillatory chemical reactions are functional components in a variety of biological contexts. In chemistry, the construction and identification of even rudimentary oscillators remain elusive and lack a general framework. Using parameter-rich kinetics - a methodology enabling the disentanglement of parametric dependencies from structural analysis - we investigate the stoichiometry of chemical oscillators. We introduce the concept of oscillatory cores - minimal subnetworks that guarantee the potential for oscillations in any reaction network containing them. These cores fall into two classes, depending on whether they involve positive or negative feedback. In particular, the latter class unveils a family of oscillators - yet to be synthesized - that require a minimum number of reaction steps to exhibit oscillations, a phenomenon we refer to as the principle of length. We identify several mechanisms through which catalysis promotes oscillations: (I) furnishing instability (e.g. autocatalysis), (II) lifting dependencies, (III) lowering length thresholds. Notwithstanding this mechanistic ubiquity, we show that oscillators can also be realized without employing any catalysis. Our results highlight branches of chemistry where oscillators are likely to arise by chance, suggest new strategies for their design, and point to novel classes of oscillators yet to be realized experimentally.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The long- and short-time behavior of solutions to dissipative evolution equations is studied by applying the concept of hypocoercivity. Aiming at partial differential equations that allow for a modal decomposition, we compute estimates that are uniform with respect to all modes. While the special example of the kinetic Lorentz equation was treated in previous work of the authors, that analysis is generalized here to general evolution equations having a scaled family of generators.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we extend a Ma\~n\'e's famous result on expansive homeomorphisms, originally presented in [17], to the setting of flows. Specifically, we provide a complete characterization of minimal expansive flows without fixed points on compact metric spaces. We prove that such flows must be defined on one-dimensional sets and are equivalent to the suspension of a minimal subshift. This result significantly improves upon [16] by eliminating the need for their additional hypothesis. Furthermore, we apply our findings to show that any regular expansive flow on a compact metric space of dimension two or higher must contain infinitely many minimal subsets.</description>

      <title>On the Invariance of Expansive Measures for Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study expansive measures for continuous flows without fixed points on compact metric spaces. We provide a new characterization of expansive measures through dynamical balls that, in contrast to the dynamical balls considered in [\emph{J. Differ. Equ.}, 256 (2014):2246--2260], are actually Borel sets. This makes the theory more amenable to measure-theoretic analysis. We prove that every ergodic invariant measure with positive entropy is positively expansive, extending the results of \emph{Ergod. Th. \&amp; Dynam. Sys.} \textbf{4}(3) (2014):765--776] to the setting of flows. This implies that flows with positive topological entropy admit expansive invariant measures. Furthermore, we show that the stable classes of such measures have zero measure. Lastly, we prove that the set of expansive measures for a flow is a $G_{\delta\sigma}$-subset of the space of all probability measures and that every expansive measure (invariant or not) can be approximated by expansive measures supported on invariant sets.</description>

      <title>Refined moves for structure-preserving isomorphism of graph C*-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.03714</link>
      <description>arXiv:1908.03714v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formalize eight different notions of isomorphism among (unital) graph C*-algebras, and initiate the study of which of these notions may be described geometrically as generated by moves. We propose a list of seven types of moves that we conjecture has the property that the collection of moves respecting one of six notions of isomorphism indeed generate that notion, in the sense that two graphs are equivalent in that sense if and only if one may transform one into another using only these kinds of moves.
  We carefully establish invariance properties of each move on our list, and prove a collection of generation results supporting our conjecture with an emphasis on the gauge simple case. In two of the six cases, we may prove the conjecture in full generality, and in two we can show it for all graphs defining gauge simple C*-algebras. In the two remaining cases we can show the conjecture for all graphs defining gauge simple C*-algebras provided that they are either finite or have at most one vertex allowing a path back to itself.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.00933v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $f_t$ be a one-parameter family of rational maps defined over a number field $K$. We show that for all $t$ outside of a set of natural density zero, every $K$-rational preperiodic point of $f_t$ is the specialization of some $K(T)$-rational preperiodic point of $f$. Assuming a weak form of the Uniform Boundedness Conjecture, we also calculate the average number of $K$-rational preperiodic points of $f$, giving some examples where this holds unconditionally. To illustrate the theory, we give new estimates on the average number of preperiodic points for the quadratic family $f_t(z) = z^2 + t$ over the field of rational numbers.</description>

Abstract: This paper generalizes the physical property of relaxation from linear time-invariant (LTI) to linear time-and-space-invariant (LTSI) systems. It is shown that the defining features of relaxation -- complete monotonicity, passivity, and memory-based storage -- carry over seamlessly to the spatio-temporal domain. An LTSI system is shown to be of relaxation type if and only if its associated spatio-temporal Hankel operator is cyclically monotone. This implies the existence of an intrinsic quadratic storage functional defined uniquely by past inputs, independently of any state-space realization. As in the LTI case, LTSI relaxation systems are shown to be those systems for which the state-space concept of storage coincides with the input-output concept of fading memory functional.</description>

      <title>Critical Exponent Rigidity for $\Theta-$positive Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17559v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove for a $\Theta-$positive representation from a discrete subgroup $\Gamma\subset \mathsf{PSL}(2,\mathbb{R})$, the critical exponent for any $\alpha\in \Theta$ is not greater than one. When $\Gamma$ is geometrically finite, the equality holds if and only if $\Gamma$ is a lattice.</description>

      <title>Multitask Learning with Stochastic Interpolants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04605v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a framework for learning maps between probability distributions that broadly generalizes the time dynamics of flow and diffusion models. To enable this, we generalize stochastic interpolants by replacing the scalar time variable with vectors, matrices, or linear operators, allowing us to bridge probability distributions across multiple dimensional spaces. This approach enables the construction of versatile generative models capable of fulfilling multiple tasks without task-specific training. Our operator-based interpolants not only provide a unifying theoretical perspective for existing generative models but also extend their capabilities. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the zero-shot efficacy of our method on conditional generation and inpainting, fine-tuning and posterior sampling, and multiscale modeling, suggesting its potential as a generic task-agnostic alternative to specialized models.</description>

      <title>Extending the Droplet-Wave Statistical Correspondence in Walking Droplet Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Walking droplets -- millimetric oil droplets that self-propel across the surface of a vibrating fluid bath -- exhibit striking emergent statistics that remain only partially understood. In particular, in a variety of experiments, a robust correspondence has been observed between the droplet's statistical distribution and the time-average of the wave field that guides it. Durey, Milewski, and Bush (2018) rigorously established such a correspondence in the case of a single droplet on a uniform, unbounded fluid bath, with a single, instantaneous droplet-bath impact during each vibration period. They also outlined how their result might extend to more general bath topography, and the work of Durey, Milewski, and Wang (2020) implemented such an approach for a circular bath. We attempt to complete this program in the present work, rigorously extending this statistical correspondence to account for arbitrary bath topography, arbitrary droplet-bath impact models, multiple droplet interactions, and non-resonant bouncing. We investigate this correspondence numerically in systems of one and two droplets in 1-D geometries, and particularly, we observe how the time-averaged wave field can distinguish between correlated and uncorrelated pairs of droplets.</description>

      <title>Strongly resonant polarization dynamics of pulse trains in a spin-flip model for an excitable microlaser with delayed self-feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13630v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experimental observations concerning the polarization dynamics in an excitable microlaser with saturable absorber coupled to an external feedback mirror reported in [Ruschel et al. (2025) Opt. Lett. 50 (8) 2618], we propose here an in-depth theoretical investigation of the locked dynamics of regenerative vectorial pulse trains that this system produces. We perform a numerical bifurcation analysis of self-sustained pulse trains of a corresponding spin-flip model with delayed feedback. Its focus is on strongly resonant regimes, where the modulation of the peak intensities of polarized regenerative pulse trains locks to 2, 3 and 4 times the pulse regeneration time. Specifically, we identify points of strongly resonant rotation numbers on curves of torus bifurcations in the parameter plane of the amplitude and phase anisotropy parameters, and continue emerging curves of fold and period-doubling bifurcations to identify locking regions. In this way, we clarify where pulse trains show strongly resonant polarization dynamics and highlight that even weak polarization coupling in delay-coupled microlasers creates considerable dynamical richness. These results may have impact on the design of future coupled microlasers systems for neuroinspired on-chip computing, where the polarization of an excitable pulse can be used to encode or process information.</description>
