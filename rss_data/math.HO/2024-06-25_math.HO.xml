      <title>How to Solve Diophantine Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present in this article a general approach (in the form of recommendations and guidelines) for tackling Diophantine equation problems (whether single equations or systems of simultaneous equations). The article should be useful in particular to young "mathematicians" dealing mostly with Diophantine equations at elementary level of number theory (noting that familiarity with elementary number theory is generally required).</description>

      <title>Multiple Forms of Knowing in Mathematics: A Scoping Literature Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a scoping review of published literature on ethnomathematics and Indigenous mathematics as a step towards a goal to decolonize the prevailing Eurocentric view of the provenance of mathematics. Mathematical practices were identified globally from 169 included studies. We map three development stages of ethnomathematical research from 1984 to 2023 and identify 20 categories of Indigenous and traditional cultural activities that evidence mathematical design and expression. We address two challenges of investigating non-Western based mathematics: where to look for mathematical knowledge, and how to decode it from cultural practices. These two hurdles are overcome by cluster analysis of the keywords of included studies. Existing research falls into two categories: I. identification of mathematical concepts used in Indigenous societies, and II. systematizing identified mathematical concepts. Both approaches are essential for research on Indigenous mathematics to flourish, in order to empower Indigenous knowledge holders and deconstruct restrictive colonial boundaries of mathematical knowledge and education.</description>
