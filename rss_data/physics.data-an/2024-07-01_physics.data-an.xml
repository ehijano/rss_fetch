      <title>A Bayesian Framework to Investigate Radiation Reaction in Strong Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments aiming to measure phenomena predicted by strong field quantum electrodynamics have done so by colliding relativistic electron beams and high-power lasers. In such experiments, measurements of the collision parameters are not always feasible, however, precise knowledge of these parameters is required for accurate tests of strong-field quantum electrodynamics. Here, we present a novel Bayesian inference procedure which infers collision parameters that could not be measured on-shot. This procedure is applicable to all-optical non-linear Compton scattering experiments investigating radiation reaction. The framework allows multiple diagnostics to be combined self-consistently and facilitates the inclusion of prior or known information pertaining to the collision parameters. Using this Bayesian analysis, the relative validity of the classical, quantum-continuous and quantum-stochastic models of radiation reaction were compared for a series of test cases, which demonstrate the accuracy and model selection capability of the framework and and highlight its robustness in the event that the experimental values of fixed parameters differ from their values in the models.</description>

      <title>An insightful approach to bearings-only tracking in log-polar coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The choice of coordinate system in a bearings-only (BO) tracking problem influences the methods used to observe and predict the state of a moving target. Modified Polar Coordinates (MPC) and Log-Polar Coordinates (LPC) have some advantages over Cartesian coordinates. In this paper, we derive closed-form expressions for the target state prior distribution after ownship manoeuvre: the mean, covariance, and higher-order moments in LPC. We explore the use of these closed-form expressions in simulation by modifying an existing BO tracker that uses the UKF. Rather than propagating sigma points, we directly substitute current values of the mean and covariance into the time update equations at the ownship turn. This modified UKF, the CFE-UKF, performs similarly to the pure UKF, verifying the closed-form expressions. The closed-form third and fourth central moments indicate non-Gaussianity of the target state when the ownship turns. By monitoring these metrics and appropriately initialising relative range error, we can achieve a desired output mean estimated range error (MRE). The availability of these higher-order moments facilitates other extensions of the tracker not possible with a standard UKF.</description>

      <title>Approximate solutions of a general stochastic velocity-jump process subject to discrete-time noisy observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in experimental techniques allow the collection of high-space-and-time resolution data that track individual motile entities over time. This poses the question of how to use these data to efficiently and effectively calibrate motion models. However, typical mathematical models often overlook the inherent aspects of data collection, such as the discreteness and the experimental noise of the measured locations. In this paper, we focus on velocity-jump models suitable to describe single-agent motion in one spatial dimension, characterised by successive Markovian transitions between a finite network of $n$ states, each with a specified velocity and a fixed rate of switching to every other state. Since the problem of finding the exact distributions of discrete-time noisy data is generally intractable, we derive a series of approximations for the data distributions and compare them to in-silico data generated by the models using four example network structures. These comparisons suggest that the approximations are accurate given sufficiently infrequent state switching, or equivalently, a sufficiently high data collection frequency. Moreover, for infrequent switching, the PDFs comparisons highlight the importance of accounting for the correlation between subsequent measured locations, due to the likely permanence in the state visited in the previous measurement. The approximate distributions computed can be used for fast parameter inference and model selection between a range of velocity-jump models using single-agent tracking data.</description>

      <title>Parameter inference and nonequilibrium identification for Markovian systems based on coarse-grained observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most experiments can only detect a set of coarse-grained clusters of a molecular system, while the internal microstates are often inaccessible. Here, based on a sufficient long coarse-grained trajectory, we obtain a set of sufficient statistics which extracts all statistic information of coarse-grained observations. Based on these sufficient statistics, we completely solve the problems of parameter inference and nonequilibrium identification for a general Markovian system with an arbitrary number of microstates and arbitrary coarse-grained partitioning. Our nonequilibrium criterion generalizes the one obtained in [J. Chem. Phys. 132:041102 (2010)] for a three-state system with two coarse-grained clusters, and is much superior to the classical criterion based on autocorrelation functions.</description>

      <title>Minimal cellular automaton model with heterogeneous cell sizes predicts epithelial colony growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Regulation of cell proliferation is a crucial aspect of tissue development and homeostasis and plays a major role in morphogenesis, wound healing, and tumor invasion. A phenomenon of such regulation is contact inhibition, which describes the dramatic slowing of proliferation, cell migration and individual cell growth when multiple cells are in contact with each other. While many physiological, molecular and genetic factors are known, the mechanism of contact inhibition is still not fully understood. In particular, the relevance of cellular signaling due to interfacial contact for contact inhibition is still debated. Cellular automata (CA) have been employed in the past as numerically efficient mathematical models to study the dynamics of cell ensembles, but they are not suitable to explore the origins of contact inhibition as such agent-based models assume fixed cell sizes. We develop a minimal, data-driven model to simulate the dynamics of planar cell cultures by extending a probabilistic CA to incorporate size changes of individual cells during growth and cell division. We successfully apply this model to previous in-vitro experiments on contact inhibition in epithelial tissue: After a systematic calibration of the model parameters to measurements of single-cell dynamics, our CA model quantitatively reproduces independent measurements of emergent, culture-wide features, like colony size, cell density and collective cell migration. In particular, the dynamics of the CA model also exhibit the transition from a low-density confluent regime to a stationary postconfluent regime with a rapid decrease in cell size and motion. This implies that the volume exclusion principle, a mechanical constraint which is the only inter-cellular interaction incorporated in the model, paired with a size-dependent proliferation rate is sufficient to generate the observed contact inhibition.</description>
