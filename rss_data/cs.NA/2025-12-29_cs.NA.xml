      <title>An $hp$-adaptive finite element framework for static cracks: The impact of pointwise density variations on mode I, mode II, and mixed-mode fracture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A robust $hp$-adaptive finite element framework is presented for the investigation of static cracks in materials characterized by complex, pointwise density variations. Within such heterogeneous media, the equilibrium equation governed by the divergence of the stress tensor is reduced to a vector-valued quasilinear partial differential equation, wherein significant gradients and nonlinearities are introduced into the governing constitutive relations by spatial density variations. To ensure that these localized field variables are accurately captured, an automated $hp$-refinement strategy is implemented so that element sizes ($h$) and polynomial degrees ($p$) are concurrently optimized. A dual-indicator approach is employed by the framework. In this approach, $h$-refinement is driven by the Kelly error estimator, which utilizes the jump of the normal derivative across element interfaces, while $p$-refinement is determined by the decay of Legendre-Fourier coefficients to assess the local smoothness of the solution. Optimal convergence rates are ensured by this dual-refinement strategy, particularly within the singular regions surrounding the crack tip where material heterogeneities and geometric discontinuities intersect. The performance of the proposed method is rigorously evaluated across three distinct loading regimes: pure tensile (Mode I), pure shear (Mode II), and mixed-mode loading. It is demonstrated through numerical simulations that the intricate interaction between the fracture process zone and the underlying material heterogeneities is effectively resolved by the $hp$-adaptive scheme. Furthermore, the influence of specific density-dependent constitutive relations on the resulting crack-tip stress fields and strain energy density distributions is analyzed in detail.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the approximation of generalized Laguerre- or Laplace-weighted integrals over $\mathbb{R}^d_+$ or $\mathbb{R}^d$ of functions from generalized Laguerre- or Laplace-weighted Sobolev spaces of mixed smoothness, respectively. We prove upper and lower bounds of the convergence rate of optimal quadratures with respect to $n$ integration nodes for functions from these spaces. The upper bound is performed by sparse-grid quadratures with integration nodes on step hyperbolic corners or hyperbolic crosses in the function domain $\mathbb{R}^d_+$ or $\mathbb{R}^d$, respectively.</description>

      <title>A stabilized virtual element framework for the steady state Boussinesq equation with temperature-dependent parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a new conforming stabilized virtual element method for the generalized Boussinesq equation with temperature-dependent viscosity and thermal conductivity. A gradient-based local projection stabilization method is introduced in the discrete formulation to circumvent the violation of the discrete inf-sup condition. The well-posedness of the continuous problem is established under sufficiently small datum. We derive a stabilized virtual element problem for the Boussinesq equation using equal-order virtual element approximations. The proposed method has several advantages, such as being more straightforward to implement, free from higher-order derivative terms, providing separate stabilization terms without introducing coupling between solution components, and minimizing the number of globally coupled degrees of freedom. The existence of a discrete solution to the stabilized virtual element problem is demonstrated using the Brouwer fixed-point theorem. The error estimates are derived in the energy norm. Additionally, several numerical examples are presented to show the efficiency and robustness of the proposed method, confirming the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Regularity analysis and verification of Coons volume mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Coons volume provides a classical approach for constructing three-dimensional parametric mappings via boundary surface interpolation and is widely employed in volumetric mesh generation, computer-aided geometric design, and isogeometric analysis. However, due to curvature variations and continuity limitations of the boundary surfaces, the Jacobian determinant of a Coons volume may locally vanish or become negative, resulting in a non-regular mapping. This undermines mesh quality and compromises the stability of subsequent numerical computations. Ensuring the regularity of Coons volumes is therefore critical for robust parametric modeling. This paper develops a systematic framework for analyzing and verifying the regularity of Coons volumes. We first derive a general sufficient condition applicable to arbitrary boundary parameterizations, independent of specific analytical forms. For B\'ezier-form Coons volumes, we introduce a criterion based on the B\'ezier coefficients of the Jacobian determinant, transforming the verification problem into checking the positivity of control coefficients. Furthermore, we construct a necessary condition by applying a subdivision strategy combined with the B\'ezier blossoming technique, ensuring that regularity is preserved in all subdomains. By integrating these conditions, we design an efficient verification algorithm whose correctness and computational performance are validated through numerical experiments. We observe that the regularity of a Coons volume is closely related to the geometric similarity of its opposite boundary surfaces. Moreover, through B\'ezier extraction, the algorithm is extended to multi-patch B-spline volumes of arbitrary topology. Numerical tests show that the method completes regularity verification in milliseconds, enabling real-time application.</description>

      <title>Factorized sparse approximate inverse preconditioning for singular M-matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we consider the factorized sparse approximate inverse (FSAI) preconditioner. We apply the FSAI preconditioner to singular irreducible M-matrices. These matrices arise e.g. in discrete Markov chain modeling or as graph Laplacians. We show, that there are some restrictions on the nonzero pattern needed for a stable construction of the FSAI preconditioner in this case. With these restrictions FSAI is well-defined. Moreover, we proved that the FSAI preconditioner shares some important properties with the original system. The lower triangular matrix $L_G$ and the upper triangular matrix $U_G$, generated by FSAI, are non-singular and non-negative. The diagonal entries of $L_GAU_G$ are positive and $L_GAU_G$, the preconditioned matrix, is a singular M-matrix. Even more, we establish that a (1,2)-inverse is computed for the complete nonzero patter.</description>

      <title>Optimal-Transport Stability of Inverse Point-Source Problems for Elliptic and Parabolic Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish quantitative global stability estimates, formulated in terms of optimal transport (OT) cost, for inverse point-source problems governed by elliptic and parabolic equations with spatially varying coefficients. The key idea is that the Kantorovich dual potential can be represented as a boundary functional of suitable adjoint solutions, thereby linking OT geometry with boundary observations. In the elliptic case, we construct complex geometric optics solutions that enforce prescribed pointwise constraints, whereas in the parabolic case we employ controllable adjoint solutions that transfer interior information to the boundary. Under mild regularity and separation assumptions, we obtain estimates of the form \[ \mathcal{T}_c(\mu,\nu) \le C\,\|u_1 - u_2\|_{L^2(\partial\Omega)} \quad \text{and} \quad \mathcal{T}_c(\mu,\nu) \le C\,\|u_1 - u_2\|_{L^2(\partial\Omega\times[0,T])}, \] where $\mu$ and $\nu$ are admissible point-source measures. These results provide a unified analytical framework connecting inverse source problems and optimal transport, and establish OT-based stability theory for inverse source problems governed by partial differential equations with spatially varying coefficients.</description>

      <title>Weighted $L_p$-Discrepancy Bounds for Parametric Stratified Sampling and Applications to High-Dimensional Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the expected $L_p$-discrepancy ($2 \leq p &lt; \infty$) for stratified sampling schemes under importance sampling. We introduce a parametric family of equivolume partitions $\Omega_{\theta,\sim}$ and leverage recent exact formulas for the expected $L_2$-discrepancy \cite{xian2025improved}. Our main contribution is a weighted discrepancy reduction lemma that relates weighted $L_p$-discrepancy to standard $L_p$-discrepancy with explicit constants depending on the weight function. For $p=2$, we obtain explicit bounds using the exact discrepancy formulas. For $p&gt;2$, we derive probabilistic bounds via dyadic chaining techniques. The results yield uniform error estimates for multivariate integration in Sobolev spaces $\mathcal{H}^1(K)$ and $F^*_{d,q}$, demonstrating improved performance over classical jittered sampling in importance sampling scenarios. Numerical experiments validate our theoretical findings and illustrate the practical advantages of parametric stratified sampling.</description>

      <title>Non-polynomial divided difference and blossoming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two notable examples of dual functionals in approximation theory and computer-aided geometric design are the blossom and the divided difference operator. Both of these dual functionals satisfy a similar set of formulas and identities. Moreover, the divided differences of polynomials can be expressed in terms of the blossom. In this paper, an extended non-polynomial homogeneous blossom for a wide collection of spline spaces, including trigonometric splines, hyperbolic splines, and special M\"{u}ntz spaces of splines, is defined. It is shown that there is a relation between the non-polynomial divided difference and the blossom, which is analogous to the polynomial case.</description>

      <title>Data-free Asymptotics-Informed Operator Networks for Singularly Perturbed PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning (ML) have opened new possibilities for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), yet robust performance in challenging regimes remains limited. In particular, singularly perturbed differential equations exhibit sharp boundary or interior layers with rapid transitions, where standard ML surrogates often fail without extensive resolution. Generating training data for such problems is also costly, as accurate reference solutions typically require massive adaptive mesh refinement. In this work, we propose eFEONet, an enriched Finite Element Operator Network tailored to singularly perturbed problems. Guided by classical singular perturbation theory, eFEONet augments the operator-learning framework with specialized enrichment basis functions that encode the asymptotic structure of layer solutions. This design enables accurate approximation of sharp transitions without relying on large datasets, and can operate with minimal supervision-or even in a data-free manner under appropriate settings. We further provide a rigorous convergence analysis of the proposed method and demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive experiments on representative problems featuring both boundary and interior layers.</description>

      <title>Some Patterns of Duplications in the outputs of Mersenne Twister Pseudorandom Number Generator MT19937</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Mersenne Twister MT19937 pseudorandom number generator, introduced by the last two authors in 1998, is still widely used. It passes all existing statistical tests, except for the linear complexity test, which measures the ratio of the even-odd of the number of 1's among specific bits (and hence should not be important for most applications). Harase reported that MT19937 is rejected by some birthday-spacing tests, which are rather artificially designed. In this paper, we report that MT19937 fails in a natural test based on the distribution of run-lengths on which we found an identical value in the output 32-bit integers. The number of observations of the run-length 623 is some 40 times larger than the expectation (and than the numbers of the observations of 622 and 624, etc.), which implies that the corresponding p-value is almost 0.
  We mathematically analyze the phenomena, and obtain a theorem which explains these failures. It seems not to be a serious defect of MT19937, because finding the defect requires astronomical efforts. Still, the phenomena should be reported to the academic society relating to pseudorandom number generation.</description>

      <title>A Semi-Implicit Variational Multiscale Formulation for the Incompressible Navier-Stokes Equations via Exact Adjoint Linearization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A semi-implicit, residual-based variational multiscale (VMS) formulation is developed for the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations. The approach linearizes convection using an extrapolated (Oseen-type) convecting velocity, producing a linear advection operator at each time step. For this operator, the adjoint can be written exactly. Exploiting this exact adjoint yields a systematic derivative-transfer mechanism within the VMS closure. In particular, unresolved-scale contributions enter the weak form without spatial derivatives of the modeled fine-scale velocity. The resulting terms also avoid derivatives of coarse-scale residuals and stabilization parameters. This eliminates the boundary-condition-sensitive, case-by-case integrations by parts that often accompany nonlinear residual-based VMS implementations, and it simplifies implementation in low-order FEM settings.
  The formulation is presented for a generalized linear convection operator encompassing three common advection forms (convective-, skew-symmetric- and divergence-form). Their numerical behavior is compared, along with the corresponding fully implicit nonlinear VMS counterparts. Because the method is linear by construction, each time step requires only one linear solve. Across the benchmark suite, this reduces wall-clock time by $2$--$4\times$ relative to fully implicit nonlinear formulations while maintaining comparable accuracy. Temporal convergence is verified, and validation is performed on standard problems including the lid-driven cavity, flow past a cylinder, turbulent channel flow, and turbulent flow over a NACA0012 airfoil at chord Reynolds number $6\times 10^{6}$. Overall, the convective and the skew-symmetric forms remain robust across the test cases, whereas the divergence-form can become nonconvergent for problems with purely Dirichlet boundaries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notion of post-Hopf algebroids, generalizing the pre-Hopf algebroids introduced in [Bronasco, Laurent, 2025] in the study of exotic aromatic S-series. We construct action post-Hopf algebroids through actions of post-Hopf algebras. We show that the universal enveloping algebra of a post-Lie-Rinehart algebra (post-Lie algebroid) is naturally a post-Hopf algebroid. As a byproduct, we construct the free post-Lie-Rinehart algebra using a magma algebra with a linear map to the derivation Lie algebra of a commutative associative algebra. Applications in geometric numerical integration on manifolds are given.</description>

      <title>A Frobenius-Optimal Projection for Enforcing Linear Conservation in Learned Dynamical Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of restoring linear conservation laws in data-driven linear dynamical models. Given a learned operator $\widehat{A}$ and a full-rank constraint matrix $C$ encoding one or more invariants, we show that the matrix closest to $\widehat{A}$ in the Frobenius norm and satisfying $C^\top A = 0$ is the orthogonal projection $A^\star = \widehat{A} - C(C^\top C)^{-1}C^\top \widehat{A}$. This correction is uniquely defined, low rank and fully determined by the violation $C^\top \widehat{A}$. In the single-invariant case it reduces to a rank-one update. We prove that $A^\star$ enforces exact conservation while minimally perturbing the dynamics, and we verify these properties numerically on a Markov-type example. The projection provides an elementary and general mechanism for embedding exact invariants into any learned linear model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present two stochastic positive-preserving symplectic methods for the stochastic Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model driven by a multiplicative noise. To inherit the intrinsic characteristic of the original system, the stochastic Lie--Trotter splitting method and the stochastic Strang splitting method are introduced, which are proved to preserve the positivity of the numerical solution and possess the discrete stochastic symplectic conservation law as well. By deriving the uniform boundedness of the $p$-th moment of the numerical solution, we prove that the strong convergence orders of these two methods are both one in the $L^2(\Omega)$-norm. Finally, we validate the theoretical results through two and four dimensional numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Identifying convex obstacles from backscattering far field data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recovery of anomalies from backscattering far field data is a long-standing open problem in inverse scattering theory. We make a first step in this direction by establishing the unique identifiability of convex impenetrable obstacles from backscattering far field measurements. Specifically, we prove that both the boundary and the boundary conditions of the convex obstacle are uniquely determined by the far field pattern measured in backscattering directions for all frequencies. The key tool is Majda's asymptotic estimate of the far field patterns in the high-frequency regime. Furthermore, we introduce a fast and stable numerical algorithm for reconstructing the boundary and computing the boundary condition. A key feature of the algorithm is that the boundary condition can be computed even if the boundary is not known, and vice versa. Numerical experiments demonstrate the validity and robustness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Solution of Least Squares Problems with Randomized Preconditioned Normal Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the solution of full column-rank least squares problems by means of normal equations that are preconditioned, symmetrically or non-symmetrically, with a randomized preconditioner. With an effective preconditioner, the solutions from the preconditioned normal equations are almost as accurate as those from the QR-based Matlab backslash (mldivide) command -- even for highly illconditioned matrices. This means the accuracy of the preconditioned normal equations depends on the residual of the original least squares problem. We present non-intuitive but realistic perturbation bounds for the relative error in the computed solutions and show that, with an effective preconditioner, these bounds are essentially equal to the perturbation bound for the original least squares problem. Probabilitistic condition number bounds corroborate the effectiveness of the randomized preconditioner computed with small amounts of sampling.</description>

      <title>Two operator splitting methods for three-dimensional stochastic Maxwell equations with multiplicative noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03390v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop two energy-preserving splitting methods for solving three-dimensional stochastic Maxwell equations driven by multiplicative noise. We use operator splitting methods to decouple stochastic Maxwell equations into simple one-dimensional subsystems and construct two stochastic splitting methods, Splitting Method I and Splitting Method II, through a combination of spatial compact difference methods and the midpoint rule in time discretization for the deterministic parts, and exact unitary analytical solutions for the stochastic parts. Theoretical proofs show that both methods strictly preserve the discrete energy conservation law. Finally, numerical experiments fully verify the energy conservation of the methods and demonstrate that the temporal convergence order of the two splitting methods is first-order.</description>

      <title>A coupled finite element-virtual element method for thermomechanical analysis of electronic packaging structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09348v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a finite element and virtual element (FE-VE) coupled method for thermomechanical analysis in electronic packaging structures. The approach partitions computational domains strategically, employing FEM for regular geometries to maximize computational efficiency and VEM for complex shapes to enhance geometric flexibility. Interface compatibility is maintained through coincident nodal correspondence, ensuring solution continuity across domain boundaries while reducing meshing complexity and computational overhead. Validation through electronic packaging applications demonstrates reasonable agreement with reference solutions and acceptable convergence characteristics across varying mesh densities. The method effectively captures thermal distributions and stress concentrations in multi-material systems, establishing a practical computational framework for electronic packaging analysis involving complex geometries.

      <title>Solving stochastic climate-economy models: A deep least-squares Monte Carlo approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09642v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic versions of recursive integrated climate-economy assessment models are essential for studying and quantifying policy decisions under uncertainty. However, as the number of state variables and stochastic shocks increases, solving these models via deterministic grid-based dynamic programming (e.g., value-function iteration / projection on a discretized grid over continuous state variables, typically coupled with discretized shocks) becomes computationally infeasible, and simulation-based methods are needed. The least-squares Monte Carlo (LSMC) method has become popular for solving optimal stochastic control problems in quantitative finance. In this paper, we extend the application of the LSMC method to stochastic climate-economy models. We exemplify this approach using a stochastic version of the DICE model with five key uncertainty sources highlighted in the literature. To address the complexity and high dimensionality of these models, we incorporate deep neural network approximations in place of standard regression techniques within the LSMC framework. Our results demonstrate that the deep LSMC method can be used to efficiently derive optimal policies for climate-economy models in the presence of uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Notes on Simplifying the Construction of Barabanov Norms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02230v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To answer the question about the growth rate of matrix products, the concepts of joint and generalized spectral radius were introduced in the 1960s. A common tool for finding the joint/generalized spectral radius is the so-called extremal norms and, in particular, the Barabanov norm. The goal of this paper is to try to combine the advantages of different approaches based on the concept of extremality in order to obtain results that are simpler for everyday use. It is shown how the Dranishnikov-Konyagin theorem on the existence of a special invariant body for a set of matrices can be used to construct a Barabanov norm. A modified max-relaxation algorithm for constructing Barabanov norms, which follows from this theorem, is described. Additional techniques are also described that simplify the construction of Barabanov norms under the assumption that</description>
