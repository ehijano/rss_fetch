      <title>A Favre-Averaged Shallow Water Framework for Aerated Flows with Friction Factor Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of flow resistance in high-Froude-number aerated flows remains challenging due to air entrainment, which causes strong spatial variability in mixture density. In this work, we introduce a density-weighted (Favre) averaging approach to rigorously account for vertical distributions of air concentration and velocity. Favre averaging naturally captures variations in mixture density induced by air entrainment, thereby enabling a density-consistent Shallow Water Equation (SWE) formulation for aerated flows. Within this framework, we present a novel Darcy-Weisbach friction factor formulation that decomposes contributions associated with uniform flow, spatially varying flow, and temporally evolving flow, and incorporates momentum and pressure correction factors reflecting the vertical structure of the mixture. Application to experimental data from the literature demonstrates that the Favre-averaged SWE framework provides a physically consistent means of quantifying effective friction. Overall, this work establishes a mechanistic, density-weighted methodology for modelling resistance in high-Froude-number aerated flows, provides new physical insight into the role of aeration in frictional dissipation, and lays a rational foundation for future modelling of unsteady and rapidly varied aerated flows.</description>

      <title>Inferring the Turbulent Breakup of Colloidal Aggregates Using Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid aggregates in turbulent suspensions may break under the action of shear stresses. We explore the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to infer aggregate fragmentation once the aggregate structure and flow velocity gradients are known. We consider two models: the first GNN is a classifier, trained to distinguish aggregates that break from those that do not; the second GNN is a regression model, trained to predict the maximal tensile force within each aggregate in a given flow condition. We show that both models complete their task with a high statistical accuracy, and generally perform better than the statistical prediction based on mean field quantities. This work paves the way for future use of Graph Neural Networks to quantify aggregate breakup in large population of aggregates suspended in complex flow configurations.</description>

      <title>Development and Experimental Validation of Novel Evaluation Criteria for Turbulent Two-Phase VOF Simulations in High-Pressure Die Casting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Air entrapment during mold filling critically affects porosity and overall casting quality in High Pressure Die Casting. This study assesses the feasibility of applying the vof method within OpenFOAM to simulate compressible, turbulent mold filling in a thin-walled geometry. Three-dimensional simulations with the "compressibleInterFoam" solver were carried out under ambient initial cavity conditions, using both laminar flow and the k-e turbulence model. The free surface dynamics were examined across a range of inlet velocities to evaluate their influence on interface morphology, cavity pressurization, and gas entrapment. To quantify these effects, three evaluation criteria were introduced: the TIFSA as a measure of oxidation risk, the TMVF as an indicator of filling continuity and air entrapment, and the TIVF as a proxy for surface loading. Results show that turbulence modeling accelerates pressurization and limits the persistence of entrapped gas, with velocity governing the balance between smooth filling, turbulent breakup, and exposure duration. Comparison with experimental casting trials, including CT based porosity analysis and photogrammetric surface evaluation, validated that the model captures key defect mechanisms and provides quantitative guidance for process optimization.</description>

      <title>On the Reynolds analogy for high-speed rough-wall flows: implications for wall modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the validity of the generalized Reynolds analogy (GRA) in compressible turbulent boundary layers over prism-shaped roughness by mining direct numerical simulation data of Mach 2 and Mach 4 compressible turbulent boundary layers with adiabatic and cooled surfaces. Although the direct influence of roughness strongly disrupts the near-wall coupling between momentum and energy, we show that this breakdown is confined to the roughness sublayer. Above this layer, the enthalpy and velocity fields recover a smooth-wall-like similarity, and the GRA becomes asymptotically valid by naturally accounting for roughness-enhanced wall shear stress and heat flux. Building on these results, we propose a GRA-based wall model for predicting heat transfer over rough surfaces, which is coupled with a drag-predictive physics-based method developed for prism-shaped roughness by means of compressibility transformations.</description>

      <title>Combined effects of evaporation, sedimentation and solute crystallization on the dynamics of aerosol size distributions on multiple length and time scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate three aspects of aerosol-mediated air-borne viral infection mechanisms on different length and time scales. First, we address the evolution of the size distribution of a non-interacting ensemble of droplets that are subject to evaporation and sedimentation using a sharp droplet-air interface model. From the exact solution of the evolution equation we derive the viral load in the air and show that it depends sensitively on the relative humidity. Secondly, from Molecular Dynamics simulations we extract the molecular reflection coefficient of single water molecules from the air-water interface. This parameter determines the water condensation and evaporation rate at a liquid droplet surface and therefore the evaporation rate of aqueous droplets. We find the reflection of water to be negligible at room temperature but to rise significantly at elevated temperatures and for grazing incidence angles. Thirdly, we derive a thermodynamically consistent three-dimensional diffuse-interface model for solute-containing droplets that is formulated as a three-phase Cahn-Hilliard/Allen-Cahn system. By numerically solving the coupled system of equations, we explore representative scenarios that show that this model reproduces and generalizes features of the sharp-interface model. These interconnected studies on the dynamics of aerosol droplet evaporation are relevant in order to quantitatively assess the airborne infection risk under varying environmental conditions.</description>

      <title>Coupled Level-Set Lattice Boltzmann Method on Adaptive Cartesian Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel coupled level-set lattice Boltzmann method on adaptive Cartesian grids for simulating liquid-gas multiphase flows is presented. The approach addresses the inherent challenges of accurately modeling multiphase systems characterized by sharp interfaces and large density ratios. By employing separate solution algorithms for each fluid phase which are coupled through boundary conditions at the interface the method is more accurate and more efficient. The study highlights the advantages of using lattice Boltzmann methods together with level-set techniques to track interfaces effectively while facilitating adaptive mesh refinement. Applications to various test cases, e.g., immiscible stratified flow and rising bubbles, demonstrate the method's capability to capture complex interfacial dynamics and validate its accuracy against literature data.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of driven systems via the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the differences between the driven turbulence described by the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) equation and the second law of thermodynamics. A general velocity and entropy density system is analyzed with the unified thermodynamic algorithm of metriplectic dynamics, and we show that the positive spectra of the KS equation due to an external energy source prevent its metriplectic description. A variant of the KS equation is produced that monotonically generates an entropy, but the only equilibria of this variant system are spatially constant. Numerical experiments are performed comparing the evolution of the KS equation and its thermodynamic variant. The entropy of this thermodynamic system is increased further by the driving effects of the KS equation, reconciling the generation of entropy with the energy source of the KS equation. Further numerical experiments restrict the positive spectra in the KS equation to determine the effect on the system time evolution. While rescaling the growth rates of instabilities reproduces similar behavior on a slower time scale, introduction of individual positive spectra reproduces the formation of equilibria, relative equilibria, and a transition to chaos.</description>

      <title>An integration-free method for calculating curl and divergence in space plasmas using multi-spacecraft data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The knowledge of local spatial gradients (curl, divergence etc.) is crucial to examine the three-dimensional variation of flow fields including velocity and magnetic fields in space plasmas like the solar wind. Here we propose a simple method to calculate the same using the in-situ data of multi-spacecraft systems. Unlike the popular Curlometer method which depends on the vector integration theorems, our integration-free method is based on the construction of a local orthonormal coordinate system and the associated finite difference approximations. The Curlometer is applicable to a four spacecraft system arranged in a tetrahedron and yields a single volume-averaged estimate of the curl. Using our proposed method over 107 intervals of MMS (NASA) data, on the other hand, we successfully calculate the spatial derivatives at the position of each spacecraft of the tetrahedron and a three-spacecraft (non-collinear) subset of the same. The average value of all the curls calculated for a given tetrahedron shows an excellent agreement (correlation coeffcient ~ 0:99) with the curls calculated using Curlometer formula. The quality of the calculated curl (using our method) is found to improve if the spacecraft configuration approaches a regular tetrahedron. The current framework facilitates investigation of turbulent heating rates and the exploration of local flow features like Beltramization, existence of current sheets, etc., in present and future multi-spacecraft mission, including those involving more than four spacecraft.</description>

      <title>Space-time nonlinear reduced-order modelling for unsteady flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates projection-based Reduced-Order Models (ROMs) formulated in the frequency domain, employing a space-time basis constructed with Spectral Proper Orthogonal Decomposition to efficiently represent dominant spatio-temporal coherent structures. Although frequency domain formulations are well suited to capturing time-periodic solutions, such as unstable periodic orbits, this study focusses on modelling statistically stationary flows by computing long-time solutions that approximate their underlying statistics. In contrast to traditional ROMs based solely on spatial modes, a space-time formulation achieves simultaneous reduction in both space and time. This is accomplished by Galerkin projection of the Navier-Stokes equations onto the basis using a space-time inner product, yielding a quadratic algebraic system of equations in the unknown amplitude coefficients. Solutions of the ROM are obtained by identifying amplitude coefficients that minimise an objective function corresponding to the sum of the squares of the residuals of the algebraic system across all frequencies and modes, quantifying the aggregate violation of momentum conservation within the reduced subspace. A robust gradient-based optimisation algorithm is employed to identify the minima of this objective function. The method is demonstrated for chaotic flow in a two-dimensional lid-driven cavity at $Re=20{,}000$, where solutions with extended temporal periods approximately fifteen times the dominant shear layer time scale are sought. Even without employing closure models to represent the truncated spatio-temporal triadic interactions, multiple ROM solutions are found that successfully reproduce the dominant dynamical flow features and predict the statistical distribution of turbulent quantities with good fidelity, although they tend to overpredict energy at spatio-temporal scales near the truncation boundary.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Applicability of the Lattice-Boltzmann Method for Two-Dimensional Turbulence Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23820v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Lattice-Boltzmann method is a mesoscopic approach for solving hydrodynamic problems involving both laminar and turbulent fluids. Although the suitability for the former cases is supported by a myriad of studies, turbulent flows always give rise to additional challenges that need to be addressed properly. In this paper, we estimate the accuracy of the simulation results obtained via a custom implementation of a Lattice-Boltzmann solver for a two-dimensional turbulent flow. To this end, a two-dimensional flow field filled with randomly located rigid disks was simulated, and the von Karman vortex street generated after the wake of such obstacles was studied. To ensure reproducibility, the implementation underlying these results is provided as supplementary material.</description>

      <title>Development of Rheological Constitutive Modeling Method Using a Sparse Identification Algorithm: A Case Study for Extensional Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deriving constitutive models (CMs) from numerical data has been an attractive approach as a systematic CM building method. One recent study is Rheo-SINDy, which extended the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) method to rheology. Although the Rheo-SINDy framework discovered an approximate CM from numerical data under shear flow, its versatility has not been investigated. To clarify its applicability to other types of flows, this study applied Rheo-SINDy to numerically generated data under extensional flow conditions. As baseline tests for extensional flow, we considered two problems: (i) whether the Rheo-SINDy framework can reproduce the famous Giesekus model from data generated by that model, and (ii) whether it can derive an approximate CM from data generated by a dumbbell model with a finite extensible nonlinear elastic (FENE) spring. For problem (i), we confirmed that Rheo-SINDy can identify the exact expression of the Giesekus model under extensional flow. For problem (ii), the Rheo-SINDy framework discovered a relatively simple expression of the approximate CM by manually designing the library matrix based on rheological knowledge. The identified approximate CM can reasonably predict extensional rheological properties of the FENE dumbbell model, including an extrapolation region. These findings demonstrate the fundamental validity of using Rheo-SINDy under extensional flow.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the scale dependence of the Reynolds number in correlated fluctuating fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the incompressible Navier--Stokes equation, the Reynolds number ($\mathrm{Re}$) is a dimensionless parameter quantifying the relative importance of inertial over viscous forces. In the low-$\mathrm{Re}$ regime ($\mathrm{Re} \ll 1$), the flow dynamics are commonly approximated by the linear Stokes equation. Here we show that, within the framework of spatially fluctuating hydrodynamics, this linearization breaks down when the thermal noise is spatially correlated, even if $\mathrm{Re} \ll 1$. We perform direct numerical simulations of spatially correlated fluctuating hydrodynamics in both one and two dimensions. In one dimension, the linearized dynamics exhibit significantly slower relaxation of high-wavenumber Fourier modes than the full nonlinear dynamics. In two dimensions, an analogous discrepancy arises in the particle velocity autocorrelation function, which decays more slowly in the correlated linear Stokes case than in the correlated nonlinear Navier--Stokes case. In both settings, spatial correlations inhibit viscous momentum diffusion at small scales, leading to prolonged relaxation under the linear dynamics, whereas nonlinear mode coupling accelerates small-scale relaxation. Thus, the interplay between nonlinear coupling and viscous damping becomes scale dependent, invalidating the use of a single global Reynolds number. Taken together, these findings show that, for spatially correlated fluctuating fluids, the effective Reynolds number must be reinterpreted as a scale-dependent quantity.</description>

      <title>Shear jamming and nonlinear rheology of chocolate suspensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21032v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate the rheology of dark chocolate pastes in both industrially relevant pre-refined form and simplified model systems. Steady and oscillatory shear experiments reveal yielding, pronounced shear-thinning, and stress-dependent hysteresis governed by solid loading. Fitting the viscosity data with the Maron-Pierce model provides stress-dependent maximum flowable fractions $\phi_{\rm{m}}(\sigma)$, defining yield loci in the $(\phi, \sigma)$ plane. Their variation with stress quantifies the coupled roles of friction and adhesion in setting flow limits. Large-amplitude oscillatory shear tests characterize transitions from elastic to viscous behavior and identify distinct recovery pathways near jamming. Contact-stress decomposition separates hydrodynamic and frictional contributions, confirming that adhesive contact networks dominate stress transmission in pre-refined pastes. These results establish chocolate pastes as dense, adhesive suspensions whose flow is controlled by the interplay of friction and adhesion, offering quantitative benchmarks for constitutive modeling and linking chocolate processing to the broader physics of constraint rheology.</description>
