      <title>Large Investment Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional quantitative investment research is encountering diminishing returns alongside rising labor and time costs. To overcome these challenges, we introduce the Large Investment Model (LIM), a novel research paradigm designed to enhance both performance and efficiency at scale. LIM employs end-to-end learning and universal modeling to create an upstream foundation model capable of autonomously learning comprehensive signal patterns from diverse financial data spanning multiple exchanges, instruments, and frequencies. These "global patterns" are subsequently transferred to downstream strategy modeling, optimizing performance for specific tasks. We detail the system architecture design of LIM, address the technical challenges inherent in this approach, and outline potential directions for future research. The advantages of LIM are demonstrated through a series of numerical experiments on cross-instrument prediction for commodity futures trading, leveraging insights from stock markets.</description>

      <title>Deep-MacroFin: Informed Equilibrium Neural Network for Continuous Time Economic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present Deep-MacroFin, a comprehensive framework designed to solve partial differential equations, with a particular focus on models in continuous time economics. This framework leverages deep learning methodologies, including conventional Multi-Layer Perceptrons and the newly developed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks. It is optimized using economic information encapsulated by Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations and coupled algebraic equations. The application of neural networks holds the promise of accurately resolving high-dimensional problems with fewer computational demands and limitations compared to standard numerical methods. This versatile framework can be readily adapted for elementary differential equations, and systems of differential equations, even in cases where the solutions may exhibit discontinuities. Importantly, it offers a more straightforward and user-friendly implementation than existing libraries.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Startup Success Predictions in Venture Capital: A GraphRAG Augmented Multivariate Time Series Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the Venture Capital(VC) industry, predicting the success of startups is challenging due to limited financial data and the need for subjective revenue forecasts. Previous methods based on time series analysis or deep learning often fall short as they fail to incorporate crucial inter-company relationships such as competition and collaboration. Regarding the issues, we propose a novel approach using GrahphRAG augmented time series model. With GraphRAG, time series predictive methods are enhanced by integrating these vital relationships into the analysis framework, allowing for a more dynamic understanding of the startup ecosystem in venture capital. Our experimental results demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms previous models in startup success predictions. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first application work of GraphRAG.</description>
