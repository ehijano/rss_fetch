      <title>pop-cosmos: Insights from generative modeling of a deep, infrared-selected galaxy population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an extension of the pop-cosmos model for the evolving galaxy population up to redshift $z\sim6$. The model is trained on distributions of observed colors and magnitudes, from 26-band photometry of $\sim420,000$ galaxies in the COSMOS2020 catalog with Spitzer IRAC $\textit{Ch. 1}&lt;26$. The generative model includes a flexible distribution over 16 stellar population synthesis (SPS) parameters, and a depth-dependent photometric uncertainty model, both represented using score-based diffusion models. We use the trained model to predict scaling relationships for the galaxy population, such as the stellar mass function, star-forming main sequence, and gas-phase and stellar metallicity vs. mass relations, demonstrating reasonable-to-excellent agreement with previously published results. We explore the connection between mid-infrared emission from active galactic nuclei (AGN) and star-formation rate, finding high AGN activity for galaxies above the star-forming main sequence at $1\lesssim z\lesssim 2$. Using the trained population model as a prior distribution, we perform inference of the redshifts and SPS parameters for 429,669 COSMOS2020 galaxies, including 39,588 with publicly available spectroscopic redshifts. The resulting redshift estimates exhibit minimal bias ($\text{median}[\Delta_z]=-8\times10^{-4}$), scatter ($\sigma_\text{MAD}=0.0132$), and outlier fraction ($6.19\%$) for the full $0&lt;z&lt;6$ spectroscopic compilation. These results establish that pop-cosmos can achieve the accuracy and realism needed to forward-model modern wide--deep surveys for Stage IV cosmology. We publicly release pop-cosmos software, mock galaxy catalogs, and COSMOS2020 redshift and SPS parameter posteriors.</description>

      <title>JWST IFU observations uncover host galaxy continua in extremely red and obscured quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncovering bright quasars' host galaxies at cosmic noon is challenging because of the high contrast between the quasar and its host and redshifted light, making them primarily visible in the infrared. We present JWST NIRSpec integral field unit (IFU) observations of six extremely red quasars (ERQs) at $z=2.4-2.9$ and two dust-obscured quasars at lower redshifts. Using image decomposition across the spectral range, we successfully separate quasar and host galaxy continuum emission, model host morphologies, and extract spectra. The ERQs and obscured quasars have compact host galaxies with half-light radii of 1.4$-$2.9 kpc and stellar masses of 10$^{10.6-10.9}$ $M_{\odot}$. Their stellar masses are consistent with the average stellar mass of quasar hosts as expected from abundance matching and clustering analysis. Most of the quasars in our sample exhibit significant spatial offsets (0.4$-$1.3 kpc) between the quasar and host galaxy, potentially caused by post-merger dynamics or non-uniform dust obscuration. The ERQs reside 0.5$-$2 dex above the local black hole-stellar mass relation, similar to other heavily obscured populations such as HotDOGs, optically selected quasars at cosmic noon, and high-redshift SMBH candidates identified with JWST. However, this "over-massive" feature might be attributed to selection bias. Compared to HST-based studies, our JWST measurements reveal more compact host galaxies, smaller Sersic indices, and lower stellar masses, likely because of improved resolution, more accurate modeling, and minimal line contamination. These findings highlight the unique capabilities of JWST IFU in revealing quasar host galaxy properties and potential evolutionary stages of obscured quasars at cosmic noon.</description>

      <title>A 13-Billion-Year View of Galaxy Growth: Metallicity Gradient Evolution from the Local Universe to $z=9$ with JWST and Archival Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gas-phase metallicity gradients of galaxies have been extensively studied over the past four decades both in the local and high-redshift universe, as they trace the baryon cycle and growth of galaxies. With the unprecedented spatial resolution and sensitivity of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), it is now possible to measure metallicity and its radial gradients out to redshifts as high as $z = 9$. Here, we present a sample of 456 spectroscopically confirmed galaxies from redshifts $1.5 \lesssim z \lesssim 9$ that are spatially resolved on sub-kiloparsec (kpc) scales by deep JWST NIRCam or NIRISS Wide Field Slitless Spectroscopy (WFSS). Synthesizing these new JWST observations with legacy observations from the literature, we observe that at redshift $z &gt; 5$, galaxy centers are more metal-rich, exhibiting negative metallicity gradients of $\sim-0.4$ dex kpc$^{-1}$. These gradients flatten over time, reaching near-zero around $z \approx 2$, coinciding with the peak of the cosmic star formation rate. Beyond this point, the gradients become negative again at lower redshifts approaching $z=0$. This evolution likely reflects transitions in galaxy formation modes: an inside-out growth phase dominated by intense central star formation with inefficient feedback and limited gas mixing during ``cosmic dawn", enhanced gas mixing due to feedback-driven wind and gas accretion at ``cosmic noon", and a later phase of slow evolution and reduced feedback toward the present day. These physical processes including gas accretion and feedback not only regulate star and galaxy formation on cosmic scale, but also shape the evolutionary pathways of individual galaxies over cosmic time.</description>

      <title>Biases in stellar masses of JWST high-z quasar host galaxies caused by quasar subtraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST has enabled a new era of understanding high-z galaxy and black hole evolution with more than 30 high-z quasar host galaxy detections. Many of these observations imply galaxies with black holes that are overmassive compared to their low-z counterparts. However, the bright quasar point source removal may cause significant biases in these stellar mass measurements. We develop a simulation-based inference method to disentangle the quasar host galaxy stellar mass measurements from observational biases during the point source removal. We use the BlueTides simulation to generate mock images and perform point source removal on thousands of simulated high-z quasar host galaxies, constructing corrected host magnitude posteriors. We find that JWST photometry tends to either correctly recover or modestly misestimate host magnitudes, with a maximum magnitude underestimate of 0.21 mag. With our corrected magnitude posteriors, we perform SED fitting on each quasar host galaxy and compare the stellar mass measurement before and after the correction. We find that stellar mass estimates are generally robust, or overestimated by $\leq0.3$ dex. We also find that the stellar masses of a subset of hosts (J1120+0641, J0844-0132, J0911+0152, and J1146-0005) remain unconstrained, as key photometric bands provide only flux upper limits. Understanding these biases is essential to uncovering the evolutionary pathways of high-z quasars with their hosts.</description>

      <title>The Star Formation in Radio Survey: Adding 90 GHz Data to 3-33 GHz Observations of Star-forming Regions in Nearby Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present 90 GHz continuum imaging of 119 star-forming regions in 30 nearby galaxies observed with MUSTANG-2 on the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope as part of the Star Formation in Radio Survey. The 90 GHz data were combined with 3, 15, and 33 GHz data taken previously by the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array to decompose radio spectra on $\approx$0.8 kpc scales into their synchrotron, free-free, and thermal dust emission components. This was done using three scenarios: (i) a power law fit from 3 to 33 GHz, (ii) Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) fitting from 3 to 90 GHz with a thermal dust component, and (iii) MCMC fitting from 3 to 33 GHz without a thermal dust component. For these cases, we find a median thermal (free-free) emission fraction at 33 GHz of (i) $88 \pm 2$% with a scatter of 17%, (ii) $76\pm 3$% with a scatter of 25%, and (iii) $84\pm 2$% with a scatter of 18%. From this we conclude that, on average, free-free, not thermal dust, remains the dominant emission component at 33 GHz. While scenario (ii) yields a thermal fraction that is $\approx$10% larger than scenario (iii), this difference decreases to $\approx$5% after AGN are removed. Consequently, star formation rates measured with thermal fractions at 33 GHz are only mildly biased high without 90 GHz data for the spectral decomposition. Furthermore, a power law fit of data from 3 to 33 GHz still provides a reliable estimate of the free-free emission at 33 GHz.</description>

      <title>A big red dot at cosmic noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a little red dot (LRD), dubbed BiRD ('big red dot'), at $z=2.33$ in the field around the $z=6.3$ quasar SDSSJ1030+0524. Using NIRCam images, we identified it as a bright outlier in the $F200W-F356W$ color vs $F356W$ magnitude diagram of point sources in the field. The NIRCam/WFSS spectrum reveals the emission from HeI$\lambda 10830$ and PaG line, both showing a narrow and a broad ($FWHM\gtrsim 2000\ \rm kms^{-1}$) component. The HeI line is affected by an absorption feature, tracing dense gas with HeI column density in the $2^3S$ level $N\sim 0.5-1.2\times 10^{14}\rm cm^{-2}$, depending on the location of the absorber, which is outflowing at the speed of $\Delta v \sim -830\ \rm kms^{-1}$. As observed in the majority of LRDs, BiRD does not show X-ray or radio emission. The BH mass and the bolometric luminosity, both inferred from the PaG broad component, amount to $M_{\rm BH}\sim 10^8\rm M_{\odot}$ and $L_{\rm bol}\sim 2.9\times 10^{45}\rm ergs^{-1}$, respectively. Intriguingly, BiRD presents strict analogies with other two LRDs spectroscopically confirmed at cosmic noon, GN-28074 ("Rosetta Stone") at $z=2.26$ and RUBIES-BLAGN-1 at $z=3.1$. The blueshifted HeI absorption detected in all three sources suggests that gas outflows may be common in LRDs. We derive a first estimate of the space density of LRDs at $z&lt;3$ based on JWST data, as a function of $L_{\rm bol}$ and BH mass. The space density is only a factor of $\sim 2-3$ lower than that of UV-selected quasars with comparable $L_{\rm bol}$ and $z$, meaning that the contribution of LRDs to the broader AGN population is also relevant at cosmic noon. A similar trend is also observed in terms of BH masses. If, as suggested by recent theories, LRDs probe the very first and rapid growth of black hole seeds, our finding may suggest that the formation of black hole seeds remains efficient at least up to cosmic noon.</description>

      <title>PEARLS: Twenty-One Transients Found in the Three-Epoch NIRCam Observations in the Continuous Viewing Zone of the James Webb Space Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present 21 infrared transients found in our three-epoch, four-band NIRCam observations covering 14.16 arcmin^2 in the Spitzer IRAC Dark Field (IDF), taken by the JWST Prime Extragalactic Areas for Reionization and Lensing Science (PEARLS) program in Cycle 1 with a time cadence of ~6 months. A separate HST program provided complementary ACS optical imaging contemporaneous with the second and third epochs of the NIRCam observations. Spectroscopic identifications were carried out for three transients using the NIRSpec instrument. One of them was confirmed to be a Type Ia supernova at z=1.63, while the other two had their host galaxies identified at $z=2.64$ and 1.90, respectively. Combining these redshifts with the photometric redshifts of the host galaxies in the rest of the sample, we find that the transients are either in a "mid-z" group at z&gt;1.6 with M_V &lt; -16.0 mag or a "low-z" group at z&lt;0.4 with M_H &gt; -14.0 mag. The mid-z transients are consistent with various types of supernovae. In contrast, by their luminosities, the low-z transients fall in the range of the so-called ``gap transients'' between those of supernovae and classical novae. While they might contain some known types of gap transients (e.g., supernova impostors and luminous red novae), there could also be new kinds of transients. To reveal their nature, we will need a long-term, multi-band NIRCam monitoring program with a higher cadence and prompt NIRSpec follow-up spectroscopy. Being in the continuous viewing zone of the JWST, the IDF is an ideal field for such a future program.</description>

      <title>Morphology across cosmic time: assessing the evolution and interplay of disk and bulge-dominated galaxies in the CANDELS survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the redshift evolution of disk and bulge-dominated galaxies using a mass-complete sample of $\sim$14,000 galaxies from the CANDELS survey, selected with $H_{\rm mag} \leq 24$, $M_{\rm stellar} \geq 10^9\,{\rm M}_\odot$, and spanning $0.2 \leq z \leq 2.4$. Adopting an unbiased morphological classification, free from visual inspection or parametric assumptions, we explore the evolution of specific star formation rate (sSFR), stellar mass, structural properties, and galaxy fractions as a function of redshift and morphology. We find that while disk and bulge-dominated galaxies exhibit similar sSFR distributions at $z \sim 2.4$, bulge-dominated systems develop a redshift-dependent bimodality below $z &lt; 1.6$, unlike the unimodal behaviour of disks. This bimodality correlates with stellar mass: bulge-dominated galaxies with lower sSFR are significantly more massive and exhibit higher S\'ersic indices than their star-forming counterparts, despite having similar effective radii. Based on a Gaussian mixture decomposition, we identify two evolutionary tracks for bulge-dominated galaxies: G1, a long-lived, star-forming population with disk-like properties; and G2, a quenched, massive population whose prominence increases with decreasing redshift. The evolution of the star formation main sequence and morphology--mass fractions support a scenario in which G2 systems form through merger-driven transformations of massive disks. Our results indicate that bulge-dominated galaxies are not a homogeneous population, but instead follow divergent evolutionary paths driven by distinct physical mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Studies of stationary features in jets: 3C 279 quasar I. On-sky scattering and dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent study on the dynamics of the quasi-stationary component (QSC) in the jet of BL~ Lacertae highlighted its significance in evaluating the physical properties of relativistic transverse waves in the parsec-scale jet. Motivated by this finding, we selected a different type of blazar, the flat-spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) 3C~279, which hosts a QSC at an angular median distance of 0.35~mas from the radio core, as revealed by 27 years of VLBA monitoring data at 15~GHz. We investigate the positional scatter and dynamics of a QSC in the 3C~279 jet, aiming to detect the presence of a relativistic transverse wave and estimate its characteristics. We employ an analytical statistical method to estimate the mean intrinsic speed of the QSC, while moving average and refinement methods are used to smooth its trajectory. Analysis of the QSC position scatter shows that the jet axis change its direction by about $21\degr$ over 27 years and jet mean intrinsic full opening angle is $\approx 0.30\degr \pm 0.03\degr$. The apparent displacement vectors of the QSC exhibit strong asymmetry and anisotropy along the jet direction, indicating pronounced anisotropic displacements of the core along the jet axis. We estimated the mean intrinsic speed of the QSC to be superluminal, $\overline{\beta_{\rm s}} \approx 15$ in units of the speed of light, which, within the framework of the seagull-on-wave model, is interpreted as evidence for a relativistic transverse wave propagating through the QSC. Analysis of the reversing trajectory of the QSC enables the classification and characterization of reversal patterns, which, in turn, allows the determination of key transverse wave parameters such as frequency, amplitude, inclination angle, and magnetic energy of the wave (abbrev.).</description>

      <title>CO, CS, HCO, HCO+, C2H, and HCN in the diffuse interstellar medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Radio frequency molecular absorption lines appear along sight lines with AV well below 1 mag, revealing the presence of H2 in diffuse gas even when 2.6mm CO emission is absent. Aims. We discuss absorption lines of HCO+, C2H, HCN, CS, and HCO in a larger sample (88 sight lines) than was available before. Methods. We observed millimeter-wave absorption at the IRAM and ALMA interferometers over the past 30 years and gathered the results for to compare with observations of HCO+ and CO emission taken at the ARO KP12m and IRAM 30m telescopes. Results: We detected HCO+ along 72 of 86 sightlines where it was observed, C2H along 53 of 76 sightlines and HCN along 38 of 57 sightlines. C2H is ubiquitous and N(C2H)/N(HCO+) increases at smaller EB-V and smaller N(HCO+) but C2H absorption is intrinsically weaker, decreasing the number of sightlines with low column density along which it was detected.The dense-gas tracer HCN was uniformly detected down to N(H2) = 10^20 cm-2 with little change in the relative abundance N(HCN)/N(HCO+) = 1.25. HCO was detected along only 4 of 46 sight lines that were newly observed at ALMA because its lines are intrinsically weak, but HCO is ubiquitous in the interstellar medium with N(HCO)/N(HCO+) = 1/3 or N(HCO)/N(H2) = 10^-9. The line widths of HCN features are (like those of CO) narrower than those of matching features observed in HCO+, and those of C2H are broader. HCO+ emission is commonly observed at log levels -2+/-0.3 dex with respect to CO emission.</description>

      <title>The Rotating Bulge and Halo in the Milky Way: Evidence of Angular Momentum Transferred from the Decelerating Bar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations indicate that both the Milky Way bulge and inner halo exhibit angular momentum, although the origin and evolution of this prograde signature remain ambiguous. One plausible scenario involves secular evolution induced by the central bar and spiral arms. In this study, we identified a component consisting of 1,175,737 stars with net rotation through the application of a neural network (NN) method. To investigate the composition of this rotating sample and the origin of its rotation, we conducted a test particle simulation incorporating an equilibrium axisymmetric background potential together with a central decelerating bar. The test particles were generated using a distribution function (DF) model derived from observational constraints. Our results indicate that the decelerating bar transfers angular momentum to the pseudo-stars, and the rotational profile from our simulation shows strong agreement with observational data. These findings suggest that the rotating sample identified by our NN model predominantly comprises bulge, halo, and thick disk stars, and that the central decelerating bar is pivotal in shaping the inner Galaxy's kinematics through angular momentum transfer.</description>

      <title>Simulating nearby disc galaxies on the main star formation sequence II. The gas structure transition in low and high stellar mass discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent hydrodynamical simulations of isolated barred disc galaxies have suggested a structural change in the distribution of the interstellar medium (ISM) around a stellar mass M$_{*}$ of $10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$. In the higher-mass regime (M$_{*} \geq 10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$), we observe the formation of a central gas and stellar disc with a typical size of a few hundred parsecs connected through lanes to the ends of the stellar bar. In the lower-mass regime (M$_{*} &lt; 10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$), such an inner disc is absent and the gas component exhibits a more chaotic distribution. Observations of nearby star-forming galaxies support the existence of such a change. These inner gas discs may represent an important intermediate scale connecting the large kiloparsec-scale structures with the nuclear (sub-parsec) region, transporting gas inwards to fuel the central supermassive black hole (SMBH). For this work, we used an extended set of high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations of isolated disc galaxies with initial properties (i.e. stellar mass, gas fraction, stellar disc scale length, and the bulge mass fraction) with properties covering the range of galaxies in the PHANGS sample to investigate this change of regime. We studied the physical properties of the star-forming ISM in both stellar mass regimes and extracted a few physical tracers: the inner Lindblad resonance (ILR), the probability distribution function (PDF), the virial parameter, and the Mach number. In line with observations, we confirm a structure transition in the simulations that occurs between a stellar mass of $10^{9.5}$ and $10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$. We show that the physical origin of this change of regime is driven by stellar feedback and its contribution relative to the underlying gravitational potential.</description>

      <title>First detection of HS2 in a cold dark cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first detection of HS2 towards the cold dark cloud TMC-1. This is the first observation of a chemical species containing more than one sulphur atom in this type of sources. The astronomical observations are part of QUIJOTE, a line survey of TMC-1 in the Q band (31-50 GHz). The detection is confirmed by the observation of the fine and hyperfine components of two rotational transitions (2(0,2)-1(0,1) and 3(0,3)-2(0,2)). Assuming a rotational temperature of 7 K, we derived an HS2 column density of 5.7x10^11 cm-2, using a local thermodynamic equilibrium model that reproduces the observed spectra. The abundance of HS2 relative to H2 is 5.7x10^-11, which means that it is about seven times more abundant than its oxygenated counterpart HSO. We also explored the main formation and destruction mechanisms of HS2 using a chemical model, which reproduces the observed abundance of HS2 and indicates that dissociative recombination reactions from the ions H2S2+ and H3S2+ play a major role in forming HS2.</description>

      <title>Stellar initial mass function in the 100-pc solar neighbourhood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stellar initial mass function (IMF) is one of the most important astrophysical distribution function, and is defined as the mass distribution for stars formed in a single star-formation event and when they just enter the main-sequence stage. The measurement of IMF is challenging even in the solar neighbourhood where IMF can be extracted by star-counting. This is because the definition of the IMF should be handled cautiously, and there are multiple corrections should be made from observation to a well-founded measurement. We present a new parametrisation of the stellar IMF in the 100-pc solar neighbourhood, leveraging the astrometric and photometric data from \textsl{Gaia} DR3: we model the colour-magnitude diagram of the field star population while accounting for observational uncertainties, Malmquist bias, Lutz-Kelker bias, the effect of varying mass-luminosity relation caused by mixture of different metallicity, and the effect of unresolved binaries. In particular, we synthesise the binaries with a process imitating the dynamical evolution observed in star clusters to model their present-day mass-ratio distribution. We derive a stellar IMF consistent with canonical IMFs but with significantly reduced uncertainties: $\alpha_1=0.81^{+0.06}_{-0.05}$, $\alpha_2=2.12^{+0.04}_{-0.04}$, and a break point at $m_{\mathrm{break}}=0.41^{+0.01}_{-0.01}$ $\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$. Our model also constrains the binary fraction to $\sim$25\% and the \textsl{Gaia} DR3 angular resolution to $1.31^{+0.24}_{-0.29}$ arcsec. We also provide the $\xi$-parameter for our IMF to be $0.5075_{-0.0051}^{+0.0112}$ for the users to compare our result with other work.</description>

      <title>Acceleration and Collimation of the Two-Sided Jets in the Nearby Low-luminosity Active Galactic Nucleus NGC 4261 (3C 270)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the acceleration and collimation of the two-sided jets in the nearby low-luminosity active galactic nucleus NGC 4261 (3C 270) using archival multifrequency, multi-epoch Very Long Baseline Array data. By applying multiple analysis methods and incorporating results from the literature, we robustly identify a parabolic-to-conical structural transition in both the jet and counterjet, with the transition occurring at $(1.23\pm0.24)\,$pc or $(8.1\pm1.6)\times10^3\,R_{\rm s}$ (Schwarzschild radii) for the jet and $(0.97\pm0.29)\,$pc or $(6.4\pm1.9)\times10^3\,R_{\rm s}$ for the counterjet. Assuming that the brightness asymmetry between the twin jets is primarily due to relativistic Doppler (de)boosting, we derive the jet velocity field at distances of $\sim (10^3-2\times10^4)\,R_{\rm s}$ based on the jet-to-counterjet brightness ratio and spectral index. Although local kinematic variations are present, the jet shows an overall acceleration to relativistic speeds from $\sim 10^3$ to $\sim8\times10^3\,R_{\rm s}$, with a maximum Lorentz factor of $\Gamma_{\rm max} \approx 2.6$. Beyond this region, the jet gradually decelerates to sub-relativistic speeds. These results support the existence of a (sub)parsec-scale ($\lesssim 1.5\,$pc) acceleration and collimation zone (ACZ) in NGC 4261, where the jet is accelerated via magnetic-to-kinetic energy conversion while being confined by external pressure. A brief comparison with M 87 suggests that the ACZ in NGC 4261 may represent a scaled-down analogue of that in M 87.</description>

      <title>Formation Pathways of Compact Elliptical Galaxies: Perspective of Internal Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13108v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a structural analysis of 138 compact elliptical galaxies (cEs) in the redshift range of $z &lt; 0.05$ using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR12 data. We perform single- and double-component S\'ersic model fitting to their SDSS $r$-band surface brightness profiles. By dividing cEs into those with [cE(w)] and without [cE(w/o)] a bright host galaxy, we find a significant structural dichotomy: the majority ($\sim$85\%) of cE(w)s exhibit single-component profiles, while a similar proportion ($\sim$85\%) of isolated cE(w/o)s display double-component profiles, characterized by a compact, inner component and a diffuse, disk-like outer component. These results suggest that host-associated cE(w)s primarily form through the tidal stripping of larger progenitors, resulting in a compact bulge-like core. In contrast, isolated cE(w/o)s appear to form intrinsically at early epochs, likely through gas-rich mergers, and retain disk-like outer structures. The S\'ersic index distribution of cE(w)s with single-component structure indicates progenitor types ranging from pseudo-bulge to classical bulge, supported by differences in stellar populations. A small fraction of cEs, including double-component cE(w)s and single-component cE(w/o)s, suggests complex evolutionary channels involving environmental capture or ejection. Our results emphasize that the structural characteristics of cEs, specifically the presence or absence of an extended outer envelope, serve as a crucial diagnostic tool to distinguish tidally stripped remnants from intrinsically formed low-mass cEs in isolation.</description>

      <title>Parameter Recovery Study on IZI -- a Bayesian Analysis Tool for Emission Lines from H II Regions and Star-forming Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a series of parameter recovery test results of the Bayesian analysis tool IZI, which analyses emission lines from H II regions and star-forming galaxies and returns the estimates of the gas metallicity 12 + log (O/H), ionisation parameter log q, and nebular emission-line colour excess E(B-V). We created several mock datasets using IZI to represent a few different ideal or realistic datasets and performed parameter estimation on the mock data with IZI. We found that IZI underestimated or overestimated the parameters by approximately 1-$\sigma$ or greater when the model error was included, even when using all emission lines available in the model grids. We strongly recommend that IZI users run parameter recovery tests adjusted for their data before interpreting the IZI estimates. To encourage the appropriate use of IZI, we also share a script for parameter recovery tests. The cause of IZI's biased estimation is the substantial model error in the likelihood term, which varies with the model parameters. We thus note that any parameter estimation with a substantial, varying model error in the likelihood term could return biased estimates for the model parameters, such as in the case of NebulaBayes, another Bayesian analysis tool for photoionisation emission lines. We also note two issues relevant to setting the log q prior using the observed line ratio [S III]$\lambda$$\lambda$9068,9532/[S II]$\lambda$6717,6731 (the mismatch of line flux terms and violation of Bayes' theorem) and propose a way to avoid the issues.</description>

      <title>A new classification of ex-situ and in-situ Galactic globular clusters based on a method trained on Milky Way analogues in the TNG50 cosmological simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel method combining existing cosmological simulations and orbital integration to study the hierarchical assembly of globular cluster (GC) populations in the Milky Way (MW). Our method models the growth and evolution of GC populations across various galactic environments as well as the dynamical friction and mass loss experienced by these objects. This allows us to track the trajectory of about 18,000 GCs over cosmic time in 198 MW-like galaxies from TNG50. This cosmological-scale tracking of the dynamics of in-situ and ex-situ GC populations with such a large statistical sample allows us to confirm the presence of an overlap between the two populations in MW-like galaxies, occurring below an energy threshold of $E &lt; 0.7 E_{\rm circ}(r_{\rm hm}^{*})$ where $E_{\rm circ}(r_{\rm hm}^{*})$ is the energy of a circular orbit at the galaxy's stellar half-mass radius $r_{\rm hm}^{*}$. Our results challenge the validity of current classification schemes commonly adopted in the literature, which ultimately fail to provide a clear separation between the two populations. Instead, they tend to isolate only a subset of the ex-situ GCs. More precisely, we argue that it is highly unlikely to find in-situ clusters at $E &gt; 0.7 E_{\rm circ}(r_{\rm hm}^{*})$, and that the real challenge lies in distinguishing the two populations below this energy threshold. In this context, we provide new predictions regarding the origins of the MW GCs observed with Gaia, as well as a comparison with existing literature. Additionally, we highlight that even if ex-situ clusters share a common origin, they inevitably lose their dynamical coherence in the $E$-$L_{z}$ space within MW-like galaxies. We observe a dispersion of GC groups as a function of $E$ and $L_{z}$, primarily driven by the evolution of the galactic potential over time and by dynamical friction, respectively.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Phenylium Reactivity under Interstellar Relevant Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work by Kocheril \textit{et al.}\cite{kocheril2025} claimed that phenylium--the cyclic structure of the \ce{C6H5+} species--is unreactive toward key interstellar molecules such as molecular hydrogen (\ce{H2}) and acetylene (\ce{C2H2}). This finding challenges the previously proposed role of phenylium as a cornerstone in the formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) \cite{cherchneff1992,byrne2024}. Here, we present new experimental and theoretical evidence that challenge this assumption. The study focused on the reactivity of \ce{C6H5+}, formed via the radiative association between \ce{C4H3+} and \ce{C2H2}, believed to be a major pathway for phenylium formation. Our results demonstrate that phenylium does indeed react with \ce{C2H2} under astrophysically relevant conditions. Quantum chemical calculations support this finding by revealing a barrierless mechanism, indicating that the reaction is feasible even in cold interstellar environments. We believe this clarification is critically important, as the conclusions of Kocheril et al. could mislead the community and hinder further investigations into the formation of the first aromatic ring in space--a process that remains a key bottleneck in our understanding of PAHs formation and growth.</description>

      <title>Jet outbursts, non-thermal pressure and the AGN jet duty cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13422v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We predict the non-thermal pressure (NTP) induced in the cores of galaxy clusters by kinetic jet feedback from an active galactic nucleus (AGN). We model a population of Fanaroff-Riley type I jets when sampling power-law distributions in jet power and age, which we evolve in time with a two-phase jet-lobe model. We couple the energy of each jet outburst to the surrounding gas inside spherical shells, allowing us to estimate the fraction of NTP to total pressure induced in the cluster. We predict the mean profile for this NTP fraction over the source population in a variety of cluster environments and for different AGN jet duty cycles. For typical gas and dark matter profiles, the mean NTP fraction peaks at ~4-6% when the AGN jets are active for 10-30% of the total AGN lifecycle. These predictions are in good agreement with observational constraints, suggesting that AGN feedback imparts only small non-thermal contributions to the cluster's core. Furthermore, we find a relationship between the peak in the mean NTP fraction and the AGN jet duty cycle in a given cluster environment. Applying this to Hitomi measurements of the NTP in the Perseus cluster, we infer an AGN jet duty cycle that is consistent with independent evidence of Perseus' AGN jet activity. We propose this as a novel approach for observationally inferring the past AGN activity of real clusters from their observed NTP fraction and environmental profiles.</description>

      <title>Cloud-to-cloud velocity dispersions across a Local arm segment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a large sample of 9617 molecular clouds (MCs) from the Milky Way Imaging Scroll Painting survey, we mainly measure one-dimensional cloud-to-cloud velocity dispersions across a 450 deg$^{2}$ segment of the Local arm in the Galactic second quadrant. We define the cloud-to-cloud velocity dispersion using two metrics: the standard deviation ($\sigma_{\rm bin}$) and flux-weighted root-mean-squared value ($\sigma_{\rm bin, w}$) of the centroid velocities of $^{12}$CO-detected MCs within spatial bins. The typical values of $\sigma_{\rm bin}$ and $\sigma_{\rm bin, w}$ are 7.5$\pm$0.5 km s$^{-1}$ and 6.2$\pm$0.5 km s$^{-1}$, respectively. After categorizing clouds by sizes into three types: Type $S$ (0.15 $-$ 1.2 pc), Type $M$ (1.2 $-$ 4.8 pc), and Type L ($\gtrsim$ 4.8 pc), we find that the spatial distribution of Type $S$ and $M$ MCs projected onto the Galactic longitude-latitude (l-b) plane is generally uniform. Additionally, the cloud-to-cloud velocity dispersion among Type $S$ clouds ($\sim$ 7.6 and 7.4 km s$^{-1}$ for $\sigma_{\rm bin}$ and $\sigma_{\rm bin, w}$, respectively) is systematically greater than that among Type $M$ clouds ($\sim$ 6.7 and 6.0 km s$^{-1}$ for $\sigma_{\rm bin}$ and $\sigma_{\rm bin, w}$, respectively), with differences of 0.9 $-$ 1.4 km s$^{-1}$. From these measurements, we estimate merger timescales between MCs to be approximately 0.3 to 0.9 Myr, which is shorter than their internal crossing timescales ($\sim$ 1 Myr for Type $S$, $\sim$ 2 Myr for Type $M$, and $\gtrsim$ 5 Myr for Type $L$). This disparity, particularly pronounced for larger Type $L$ clouds, suggests that MCs are dynamically transient structures, with their gas content changing due to frequent interactions with neighboring clouds.</description>

      <title>Insights into the structure and kinematics of a Milky Way-like galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How the large-scale kinematics of the Milky Way (MW) relate -- or even regulate -- the formation of large-to-small scale structures is incredibly hard to infer from observations. Here we investigate this interplay through a detailed analysis of a MW-like galaxy simulation, generated through the self-consistent evolution of gas, stars, and dark matter. We show that our model provides a close match to many of the MW's stellar structure and kinematic features (including in the inner Galaxy, and around the Solar neighbourhood), and find that the stellar spiral pattern in our model is very faint, with significantly less multiplicity than the sharper gaseous arms.If taken as an analogue to the MW, this finding would explain the difficulty in observational studies to agree on the number and location of our Galaxy's spiral arms. We also examine radial and tangential velocity residuals in the disc, and find that sharp kinematic transitions correlate with spiral arms, especially in the gas, where values reach $30 - 50$\,km\,s$^{-1}$. We find strong radial converging flows promoting spiral-arm growth, while diverging flows disrupt them. A time-resolved analysis of spiral-ridge segments confirms that convergence precedes density enhancements and potential star-forming conditions, while divergence leads to fragmentation and mass redistribution. These patterns evolve on relatively short timescales ($\sim10-20$\,Myr), highlighting the transient nature of spiral arms. Our model's spiral arms are dynamically driven, short-lived features shaped by evolving flows, rather than static density waves, which could explain the observed lack of contrast of cloud properties and star formation within and outside spiral arms in the MW.</description>

      <title>KRIOS: A new basis-expansion $N$-body code for collisional stellar dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravitational $N$-body problem is a nearly universal problem in astrophysics which, despite its deceptive simplicity, still presents a significant computational challenge. For collisional systems such as dense star clusters, the need to resolve individual encounters between $N$ stars makes the direct summation of forces - with quadratic complexity - almost infeasible for systems with $N\gtrsim 10^6$ particles over many relaxation times. At the same time, the most common Monte Carlo $N$-body algorithm - that of H\'enon - assumes the cluster to be spherically symmetric. This greatly limits the study of many important features of star clusters, including triaxiality, rotation, and the production of tidal debris. In this paper, we present a new hybrid code, KRIOS, that combines 3D collisionless relaxation using an adaptive self-consistent field method with a collisional dynamics part handled via H\'enon's method. We demonstrate that KRIOS can accurately model the long-term evolution of clusters and provide its complete phase-space information over many relaxation times. As a test of our new code, we present detailed comparisons to two well-known results from stellar dynamics: (i) the collisional evolution of an isotropic Plummer sphere to core collapse, and (ii) the emergence of the radial-orbit instability in radially anisotropic star clusters, including its non-spherical effects.</description>

      <title>DESI survey of S IV absorption outflows in quasars: Contribution to AGN feedback and comparison with [O III] emission outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasar outflows can play a crucial role in the evolution of their host galaxies through various feedback processes. This effect is expected to be particularly important when the universe was only 2-3 billion years old, during the period known as cosmic noon. By utilizing observations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopy Instrument (DESI), we conduct a survey of high-ionization quasar outflows at cosmic noon, with the aim of doubling the current sample of such outflows with distance and energetics determination. We also aim to compare these properties to those derived from spatially resolved outflows in similar quasars probed through Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS). In a sample of 130 quasars we detect signatures of high-ionization outflows in the form of a S IV trough in eight objects. We characterize the physical conditions of these outflows by determining their total hydrogen column density ($N_H$), ionization parameter ($U_H$), and electron number density ($n_e$). The detected outflows show complex kinematic structures with a wide range in blueshifted velocities (100$-$4600 km s$^{-1}$). We locate five out of the eight outflows at distances between 240$-$5500 pc away from the central source. From the combined sample of 15 high-ionization S IV outflows at cosmic noon, we find a high fraction (up to 46 %) of them to be powerful enough to contribute significantly to multi-stage AGN feedback processes. Their mass outflow rates and kinetic luminosities are also found to be consistent with spatially resolved outflows in a luminosity and redshift matched sample of quasars. Comparison with previous spectra reveals interesting variations in some objects, with two cases of emerging high-velocity broad absorption line features with velocities of $-$8000 and $-$39,000 km s$^{-1}$. An impressive case of four line-locked Si IV outflow systems is also revealed in one of the objects.</description>

      <title>The optical constants and grain sizes of interstellar dust measured directly using the dust scattered x-ray halo of GRB 221009A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray scattering is a powerful probe of the optical constants and grain size distribution of interstellar dust. Bright, transient sources are excellent tools for this, since they fade rapidly, leaving only the expanding scattered x-ray halo. Here, we analyse the dust-scattered x-ray halo data of the unprecedentedly bright $\gamma$-ray burst, GRB 221009A, using anomalous diffraction theory to measure the grain size distribution of dust in the Galaxy as well as the complex refractive index, $m$, and use these results to infer the likely composition. We find a complex refractive index, $m=n+ik$ at several x-ray energies, finding $k_{1\,\mathrm{keV}}= (2.7 \pm 0.7)\times10^{-4}$ and $1-n_{1\,\mathrm{keV}}= (9 \pm 2)\times 10^{-4}$, strongly inconsistent with the commonly employed assumptions of the Rayleigh-Gans approximation. These results lie in the expected range for interstellar dust compositions dominated by carbon, magnesium silicates, and iron. The absorption results suggest a substantial mass fraction of iron at $35\pm7\%$. The MRN distribution fit returns a maximum grain radius, $a_{\rm max}=0.24\pm 0.01\,\mu$m; all fits strongly rule out models with $\sim0.4\,\mu$m grains for this sightline. The soft x-ray spectrum of the prompt GRB can also be inferred from the fitting, with the best-fit providing a spectral slope that is consistent with the slope of the low energy side of the best-fit Band model of the directly measured prompt emission. Forcing a different grain size or composition than the best fit results in an inferred prompt spectrum different to the observed prompt emission. The refractive index is consistent with standard average dust compositions, showing that x-ray scattering is an effective tool to measure interstellar dust optical properties.

      <title>Collision-induced mass loss and mass gain on an extremely massive star. An analytical approach and a static proto-globular cluster test-case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The objective of this study is to analytically explore mass loss and gain induced by stellar collisions on a gas-accreting extremely massive star (aEMS, 10^3 &lt;= M/M_sun &lt;= 10^4). We also consider its contribution to the mass budget in the context of forming multiple stellar populations in a typical protoglobular cluster. We used MESA to build a series of aEMS models up to 2e4 M_sun for three [Fe/H] values, covering the metallicity range of Galactic GCs, with different treatments of super-adiabatic convection. We set analytical prescriptions to quantify collision-induced mass loss when a star spirals in and deposits energy into the envelope of the aEMS. We used a Monte Carlo approach to simulate the effects of multiple collisions on an aEMS of initial mass 10^3 M_sun in a static proto-GC, accounting for mass loss and gain from collisions, gas accretion, and stellar winds. We show that assumptions on super-adiabaticity in radiation-dominated layers significantly impact aEMS properties and their collision responses: extended stars tend to lose mass, while compact ones are more likely to gain it. Our MC simulations predict total mass lost and gained, along with timescales and contributions from winds and collisions. The results depend on both the aEMS structure and the gas accretion rate during the collision phase. Under certain conditions, the EMS shows a "conveyor belt" behavior, processing up to 10^5.5 M_sun of material in 5 Myr. This study provides theoretical predictions supporting aEMSs as contributors to the abundance anomalies observed in GCs. It emphasizes the need to include collision dynamics and mass transfer in aEMS formation and evolution models in dense stellar environments. We provide a grid of predictions for stellar M-R-[Fe/H]-structure relations and collision-induced mass loss and gain, suitable for hydro and N-body simulations.</description>

      <title>Luminous, rapidly declining supernovae as stripped transitional objects in low metallicity environments: the case of SN 2022lxg</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the optical and near-infrared properties of SN 2022lxg, a bright ($\rm M_{g\, \mathrm{peak}}=-19.41$ mag) and rapidly evolving SN. It was discovered within a day of explosion, and rose to peak brightness in 10 d. Two distinct phases of circumstellar interaction are evident in the data. The first is marked by a steep blue continuum (T $&gt;15,000$ K) with flash-ionisation features due to hydrogen and He II. The second, weaker phase is marked by a change in the colour evolution accompanied by changes in the shapes and velocities of the spectral line profiles. Narrow P-Cygni profiles (~ $150$ km s$^{-1}$) of He I further indicate the presence of slow-moving unshocked material and suggesting partial stripping of the progenitor. The fast decline of the light curve from peak (3.48$\pm$ 0.26 mag $\rm (50\,d)^{-1}$ in $g$-band) implies that the ejecta mass must be low. Spectroscopically, until $+35$ d there are similarities to some Type IIb SNe but then there is a transition to spectra that are more reminiscent of an interacting SN II. However, metal lines are largely absent in the spectra, even at epochs of 80 d. Its remote location from the presumed host galaxy, a dwarf with $\rm M_B$ ~ $-14.4$ mag, is consistent with our metallicity estimate - close to the SMC value - obtained from scaling relations. Furthermore, several lines of evidence (including intrinsic polarisation of $p$ ~ (0.5-1.0) %) point to deviations from spherical symmetry. We suggest that a plausible way of uniting the observational clues is to consider a binary system that underwent case C mass transfer. This failed to remove the entire H-envelope of the progenitor before it underwent core-collapse. In this scenario, the progenitor itself would be more compact and perhaps straddle the boundary between blue and yellow supergiants, tying in with the early spectroscopic similarity to Type IIb SNe.</description>

Abstract: The Einstein Telescope (ET), a planned third-generation gravitational-wave (GW) observatory, will offer significantly improved sensitivity, introducing new challenges for data analysis and computing. To prepare for these demands, the ET community has initiated a series of Mock Data Challenges (MDCs) aimed at developing and testing analysis pipelines under realistic conditions. This paper presents the first ET MDC, providing an overview of the simulated dataset and the properties of the injected GW signals, with a focus on populations of compact binary coalescences and Gaussian noise. A tutorial is also included to guide users in accessing the data and performing basic analyses. This initial challenge establishes a baseline for future MDCs and supports collaborative efforts toward the successful scientific operation of the ET.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Mass of a Hypothetical Secondary Black Hole in M87 with the NANOGrav 15-Year Data Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galaxy mergers, each hosting a supermassive black hole (SMBH), are thought to form SMBH binaries. Motivated by recent observations from the East Asian VLBI Network (EAVN) showing periodic behavior in the M87 jet, a precession of about 11 years and a transverse oscillation of about 0.9 years, we constrain the mass of a hypothetical secondary black hole orbiting the primary SMBH in M87. To constrain the mass ratio between the primary SMBH ($M_{1}$) and the secondary black hole ($M_{2}$) defined as $q \equiv M_{2}/M_{1} \leq 1$, and the length of the semimajor axis of the binary system ($a$), we impose the following three constraints: (i) the lower limit of $a$, below which the SMBH binary is expected to merge. (ii) the strain amplitude of the gravitational wave background (GWB) at nanohertz frequencies shown in the NANOGrav 15-year dataset. (iii) a finite length of the semimajor axis of $M_{1}$, that can induce periodic behavior in the jet. By combining these constraints, we obtain the allowed parameter space for $q$ and $a$. If either of the EAVN-detected periods ($T$) corresponds to the binary's orbital period, the allowed range of $q$ is $6.9 \times 10^{-3} \le q \le 4.2 \times 10^{-2}$ for $T \approx 11$ years, and $3.7\times 10^{-2} \le q \le 1$ for $T \approx 0.9$ years. VLBI astrometric monitoring of the jet base of M87 is essential to explore the allowed parameter space for $q$ and $a$.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Link between Fast Radio Burst and Binary Neutron Star Origins with Spaceborne Gravitational Wave Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12602v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of repeating Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) is an open question, with observations suggesting that at least some are associated with old stellar populations. It has been proposed that some repeating FRBs may be produced by interactions of the binary neutron star magnetospheres decades to centuries before the coalescence. These systems would also emit centi-Hertz gravitational waves during this period, which can be detectable by space-borne gravitational wave detectors. We explore the prospects of using current and future space-borne gravitational wave detectors, such as TianQin, LISA, and DECIGO, to test this FRB formation hypothesis. Focusing on nearby galaxies like M81, which hosts a repeating FRB source in a globular cluster, we calculate the detection capabilities for binary neutron star systems. Our analysis reveals that while missions like TianQin and LISA face limitations in horizon distance, changing detector pointing direction could significantly enhance detection probabilities. Considering the chance of a Milky Way-like galaxy coincidentally containing a BNS within 100 years before merger is only $3\times10^{-5}$ to $5\times10^{-3}$, if a signal is detected originating from M81, we can establish the link between FRB and binary neutron stars with a significance level of at least 2.81$\sigma$, or a Bayes factor of $4\times10^6 - 7\times10^8$ / $5\times10^2 - 10^5$ against the background model with optimistic/realistic assumptions. Next-generation detectors such as DECIGO offer enhanced capabilities and should easily detect these systems in M81 and beyond. Our work highlights the critical role of space-borne gravitational wave missions in unraveling FRB origins.</description>

Abstract: Cosmic-rays are charged particles moving in magnetic fields. They not only emit well-known synchrotron photons but also gravitational radiation. We clarify the characteristics of the gravitational wave signal in this specific situation and underline some unexpected features. A phenomenological approximation for the radiated power is given. We derive the shape and peaking frequency of the associated stochastic backgrounds of gravitational waves for both electrons and protons, either of galactic or extra-galactic origin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the anisotropic diffusion of cosmic rays in the large-scale Galactic magnetic field, where diffusion occurs at different rates along and across the magnetic field lines. To model this process, we use stochastic differential equations to describe cosmic ray propagation and solve them numerically. The Galactic magnetic field is modeled using the Jansson-Farrar prescription. In this study, we focus on the impact of perpendicular diffusion on the residence time of cosmic rays in the Galaxy. This allows us to estimate how anisotropic diffusion influences both the residence time and the total amount of matter (grammage) traversed by a typical cosmic ray during its journey through the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>A New Determination of the Mass of NGC 3603-A1: the Most Massive Binary Known?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The star NGC 3603-A1 has long been known to be a very massive binary, consisting of a pair of O2-3If*/WN5-6 stars, which show Wolf-Rayet-like emission due to their luminosities being near the Eddington limit. The system has been poorly characterized until now, due to the difficulties of obtaining reliable radial velocities from broad, blended emission lines and the extreme crowding in the cluster. However, previously unpublished archival HST/STIS spectra revealed that some of the upper Balmer lines (seen in absorption) are well separated at favorable orbital phases, prompting us to obtain our own carefully-timed new HST/STIS spectra, which we have analyzed along with the older data. Radial velocities measured from these spectra allow us to obtain an orbit for this 3.77298 day system. We also used archival STIS imaging of the cluster to obtain a more accurate light curve for this eclipsing system, which we then modeled, yielding the orbital inclination and providing values for the stellar radii and temperatures. Together, these data show that the NGC 3603-A1 system consists of a 93.3+/-11.0 Mo O3If*/WN6 primary with an effective temperature of 37,000 K, and a 70.4+/-9.3 Mo O3If*/WN5 secondary that is slightly hotter, 42,000 K. Although a more massive binary is known in the LMC, NGC 3603-A1 is the most massive binary in our own Galaxy for which a direct measurement of its mass has been made by a fundamental method. The secondary has been spun up by mass accretion from the primary, and we discuss the evolutionary status of this intriguing system.</description>

      <title>Near-Eddington mass loss of hydrogen-rich Wolf-Rayet stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Very massive clusters and regions of intense star formation such as the center of our Milky Way contain young, hydrogen-burning stars very close to the Eddington Limit. Formally classified as hydrogen-rich Wolf-Rayet stars, the winds and spectra of these stars are distinctively different to the more evolved, classical Wolf-Rayet (cWR) stars. Results. We find an overall downward trend of the mass-loss rate with increasing temperature and decreasing metallicity. However, at SMC metallicities and above, we find a maximum in the wind efficiency with the mass-loss eventually decreasing again at lower temperatures. For intermediate metallicities, we also find strong discontinuities in the mass-loss trends, which do not appear at high or very low metallicities. For the lowest metallicities, a more homogeneous behavior is obtained without any maximum in the wind efficiency. The terminal velocities are generally higher for hotter temperatures. For cooler temperatures, the combined effect of metallicity and mass-loss change significantly reduces the changes in terminal velocity with metallicity. Conclusions. Contrary to cWR stars, the spectral appearance of late-type WNh stars rules out supersonic winds launched at the hot iron bump. Instead, a more extended quasi-hydrostatic regime is necessary. The proximity to the Eddington limit and the complex interactions cause a lot of substructure in the global wind parameter trends. While the strong discontinuities show resemblances to the bi-stability jump predicted for the B-supergiant regime, our models reveal a more complex origin. At sub-SMC metallicity, iron is no longer a major key for setting the mass-loss rate in this WNh regime. Instead, other elements (e.g. nitrogen) and continuum contributions become important.</description>

Abstract: The possibility of discovering twin stars, two neutron stars (NSs) with the same mass but different radii, is usually studied in forward modelings by using a restricted number of NS matter equation of state (EOS) encapsulating a first-order phase transition from hadronic to quark matter (QM). Informing our likelihood function with the NS radius data from GW170817 and using a meta-model with 9-parameters capable of mimicking most NS EOSs available in the literature, we conduct a Bayesian quantification of the observability and underlying EOSs of twin stars. Of the accepted EOSs, between 12-18\% yield twin stars, depending on the restrictions we place on the twin branch. We show that many of these twin star scenarios are observable with currently available levels of accuracy in measuring NS radii. We also present the marginalized posterior probability density functions (PDFs) of every EOS parameter for each of four mass-radius correlation topologies. We find that the inferred EOS depends sensitively on not only whether twin stars are present, but also the category of twin stars, indicating that the observation of twin stars would provide a strong constraint on the underlying EOS. In particular, for two coexisting hybrid stars having QM cores at different densities, the PDF for QM speed of sound squared $c_{\rm qm}^2$ has two peaks, one below and another above the conformal limit $c_{\rm qm}^2=1/3$ predicted by perturbative QCD.</description>

      <title>Mass models of galaxy clusters from a non-parametric weak-lensing reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the CLASH sample of galaxy clusters using a new deprojection method for weak gravitational lensing observations. This method is non-parametric, allowing us to infer mass profiles, or equivalently circular velocities, without having to assume a specific halo profile. While this method assumes spherical symmetry, we show that, on average, triaxiality is unlikely to significantly affect our results. We use this method to study the total mass profiles of the CLASH clusters, as well as the relation between their total and baryonic components: (1) We find that the implied circular velocities are consistent with being approximately flat at large radii, akin to the rotation curves of galaxies. (2) We infer radially resolved baryonic mass fractions, finding that these vary significantly from cluster to cluster and depend strongly on the details of the X-ray gas mass profiles. Since the gas mass profiles are poorly constrained at large radii, it is unclear whether the CLASH clusters reach the cosmic baryon fraction expected in $\Lambda$CDM. (3) The non-parametric masses are consistent with the stellar mass--halo mass relation expected in $\Lambda$CDM; fitting parametric NFW halos to the non-parametric mass profiles gives results in overall agreement with the expected mass-concentration relation, though the concentrations are relatively poorly constrained. (4) Galaxy clusters systematically deviate from the Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation (BTFR) and the Radial Acceleration Relation (RAR) defined by galaxies, but the magnitude of the offset depends strongly on the gas mass extrapolation at large radii. Contrary to some previous results based on hydrostatic equilibrium, we find that galaxy clusters may fall on the same BTFR and RAR as galaxies if one adds a suitable positive baryonic mass component.</description>

      <title>Suppressed accretion onto massive black hole binaries surrounded by thin disks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that gas disks around binary systems might deliver gas to the binary components only when the circumbinary disk is relatively warm. We present new grid-based hydrodynamics simulations, performed with the binary on the grid and a locally isothermal equation of state, in which the binary is seen to functionally ``stop accreting'' if the orbital Mach number in the disk exceeds a threshold value of about 40. Above this threshold, the disk continues to extract angular momentum from the binary orbit, but it delivers very little mass to the black holes, and instead piles up mass in a ring surrounding the binary. This ring will eventually become viscously relaxed and deliver mass to the binary at the large-scale inflow rate. However we show that the timescale for such relaxation can far exceed the implied binary lifetime. We demonstrate that the ability of a binary-disk system to equilibrate is dependent on the efficiency at which accretion streams deposit mass onto the binary; which in turn is highly sensitive to the thermodynamic conditions of the inner disk. If disks around massive black hole binaries do operate in such non-accreting regimes, it suggests these systems may be dimmer than their single black hole counterparts, but could exhibit dramatic re-brightening after the black holes in-spiral and merge. This dimming begins in the UV/optical and could completely choke high-energy emission, such that these systems would likely be intrinsically X-ray weak with reddened continua, potentially resembling the spectra of `Little Red Dots'' recently identified in JWST observations.</description>

      <title>The dual nature of GHZ9: coexisting AGN and star formation activity in a remote X-ray source at z=10.145</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present JWST/NIRSpec PRISM spectroscopic characterization of GHZ9 at z= 10.145 $\pm$ 0.010, currently the most distant source detected by the Chandra X-ray Observatory. The spectrum reveals several UV high-ionization lines, including CII, SiIV, [NIV], CIV, HeII, OIII], NIII], and CIII]. The prominent rest-frame equivalent widths (EW(CIV)$\simeq$65A, EW(OIII])$\simeq$28A, EW(CIII])$\simeq$48A) show the presence of a hard AGN radiation field, while line ratio diagnostics are consistent with either AGN or star-formation as the dominant ionizing source. GHZ9 is nitrogen-enriched (6--9.5 (N/O)$_{\odot}$), carbon-poor (0.2--0.65 (C/O)$_{\odot}$), metal-poor (Z = 0.01--0.1 Z$_{\odot}$), and compact ($&lt;$ 106 pc), similarly to GNz11, GHZ2, and recently discovered N-enhanced high redshift objects. We exploited the newly available JWST/NIRSpec and NIRCam dataset to perform an independent analysis of the Chandra data confirming that GHZ9 is the most likely JWST source associated to X-ray emission at 0.5-7 keV. Assuming a spectral index $\Gamma$ = 2.3 (1.8), we estimate a black hole (BH) mass of 1.60 $\pm$ 0.31 (0.48 $\pm$ 0.09) $\times$ 10$^8$M$_{\odot}$, which is consistent either with Eddington-accretion onto heavy ($\geq$ 10$^6$ M$_{\odot}$) BH seeds formed at z=18, or super-Eddington accretion onto a light seed of $\sim$ 10$^2-10^4$ M$_{\odot}$ at z = 25. The corresponding BH-to-stellar mass ratio M$_{BH}$/M$_{star}$= 0.33$\pm$0.22 (0.10$\pm$0.07), with a stringent limit $&gt;$0.02, implies an accelerated growth of the BH mass with respect to the stellar mass. GHZ9 is the ideal target to constrain the early phases of AGN-galaxy coevolution with future multi-frequency observations.</description>

      <title>LIGHTS. The extended point spread functions of the LIGHTS survey at the LBT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the arrival of the next generation of ultra-deep optical imaging surveys reaching $\mu_V$$\sim$30 mag/arcsec$^2$ (3$\sigma$; 10"$\times$10"), the removal of scattered light due to the point spread function (PSF) effect remains a critical step for the scientific exploitation of the low surface brightness information contained in these data. Because virtually all pixels in the ground-based images are affected by an unwanted screen of light with a brightness greater than $\mu_V$$\sim$29 mag/arcsec$^2$, the characterization of the extended PSF (R$&gt;$5 arcmin) is mandatory. We describe the procedure used to construct the extended PSFs of the LIGHTS survey in the g- and r-band images taken with the Large Binocular Cameras (LBCs) of the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT). We produce PSFs with a radial extension of 6.5 arcmins. These are later extended to 30 arcmins following an empirically motivated power-law extrapolation of their behaviour in their outermost regions. As an example of the application of our methodology, we subtract the scattered light around the galaxy NGC3198. The result of this subtraction clearly shows the outermost parts of the galaxy's disc, which have been obscured by the influence of nearby bright stars. We make all the PSF (compact and extended) models publicly available.</description>

      <title>GaiaUnlimited: The old stellar disc of the Milky Way as traced by the Red Clump</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an exploration of the Milky Way's structural parameters using an all-sky sample of RC giants to map the stellar density from the Galactic disc beyond 3 kpc. These evolved giants are considered to be standard candles due to their low intrinsic variance in their absolute luminosities, allowing us to estimate their distances with reasonable confidence. We exploit all-sky photometry from the AllWISE mid-infrared survey and the Gaia survey, along with astrometry from Gaia Data Release 3 and recent 3D extinction maps, to develop a probabilistic scheme in order to select with high confidence RC-like stars. Our curated catalogue contains about 10 million sources, for which we estimate photometric distances based on the WISE W1 photometry. We then derive the selection function for our sample, which is the combined selection function of sources with both Gaia and AllWISE photometry. Using the distances and accounting for the full selection function of our observables, we are able to fit a two-disc, multi-parameter model to constrain the scale height (hz), scale-length (rd), flaring, and the relative mass ratios of the two disc components. We illustrate and verify our methodology using mock catalogues of RC stars. We find that the RC population is best described by a flared disc with scale length rd=$4.24\pm0.32$ kpc and scale height at the Sun of hz(at Sun)=$0.18\pm0.01$ kpc, and a shorter and thicker disc with rd=$2.66\pm0.11$ kpc, hz(at Sun)=$0.48\pm0.11$ kpc, with no flare. The thicker disc constitutes 66\% of the RC stellar mass beyond 3 kpc, while the flared disc shows evidence of being warped beyond 9 kpc from the Galactic center. The residuals between the predicted number density of RC stars from our axisymmetric model and the measured counts show possible evidence of a two-armed spiral perturbation in the disc of the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Intermediate Mass Ratio Inspirals in Milky Way Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A consequence of a non-zero occupation fraction of massive black holes (MBHs) in dwarf galaxies is that these MBHs can become residents of larger galaxy halos via hierarchical merging and tidal stripping. Depending on the parameters of their orbits and original hosts, some of these MBHs will merge with the central supermassive black hole in the larger galaxy. We examine four cosmological zoom-in simulations of Milky Way-like galaxies to study the demographics of the black hole mergers which originate from dwarf galaxies. Approximately half of these mergers have mass ratios less than 0.04, which we categorize as intermediate mass ratio inspirals, or IMRIs. Inspiral durations range from 0.5 - 8 Gyr, depending on the compactness of the dwarf galaxy. Approximately half of the inspirals may become more circular with time, while the eccentricity of the remainder does not evolve. Overall, IMRIs in Milky Way-like galaxies are a significant class of black hole merger that can be detected by LISA, and must be prioritized for waveform modeling.</description>

      <title>A statistical study of lopsided galaxies using random forest</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19723v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lopsided galaxies are late-type galaxies with a non-axisymmetric disk due to an uneven distribution of their stellar mass. Despite being a relatively common perturbation, several questions regarding its origin and the information that can be extracted from them about the evolutionary history of late-type galaxies. The advent of several large multi-band photometric surveys will allow us to statistically analyze this perturbation, with information that was not previously available. Given the strong correlation between lopsidedness and the structural properties of the galaxies, this paper aims to develop a method to automatically classify late-type galaxies between lopsided and symmetric. We seek to explore if an accurate classification can be obtain by only considering their internal properties, without additional information about the environment. We select 8000 late-type galaxies from TNG50. A Fourier decomposition of their stellar mass surface density is used to label galaxies as lopsided and symmetric. We trained a Random Forest classifier to rapidly and automatically identify this type of perturbations, exclusively using galaxies internal properties. We test different algorithms to deal with the imbalance of our data and select the most suitable approach based on the considered metrics. We show that our trained algorithm can provide a very accurate and rapid classification of lopsided galaxies. The excellent results obtained by our classifier strongly supports the hypothesis that lopsidedness is mainly a tracer of galaxies internal structures. We show that similar results can be obtained using observable quantities, readily obtainable from multi-bad photometric surveys. Our results show it allows a rapid and accurate classification of lopsided galaxies, allowing us to explore whether lopsidedness in present-day disk galaxies is connected to galaxies specific evolutionary histories.</description>

      <title>JWST UNCOVERs the Optical Size - Stellar Mass Relation at $4&lt;z&lt;8$: Rapid Growth in the Sizes of Low Mass Galaxies in the First Billion Years of the Universe</title>

Abstract: We study the rest-frame optical and ultraviolet morphology of galaxies in the first billion years of the Universe. Using JWST data from the UNCOVER and MegaScience surveys targeting the lensing cluster Abell 2744 we present multi-band morphological measurements for a sample of 995 galaxies selected using 20-band NIRCam photometry and 35 using NIRSpec Prism spectroscopy over the redshift range of $4&lt;z&lt;8$. The wavelength-dependent morphology is measured using pysersic by simultaneously modeling the images in 6 NIRCam wide filters covering the rest-frame UV to optical. The joint modeling technique increases the precision of measured radii by 50\%. Galaxies in our sample show a wide range of Sersic indices, with no systematic difference between optical and UV morphology. We model the size-mass relation in a Bayesian manner using a continuity model to directly fit the redshift evolution while accounting for observational uncertainties. We find the average size of galaxies at $\log M_*/M_\odot=8.5$ grows rapidly, from 400 pc at $z=8$ to 830 pc at $z=4$. This is faster evolution than expected from power law scalings of the Hubble parameter or scale factor that describe well previous results at $z&lt;2$. This suggests that different and/or much stronger processes affect low mass systems during the epoch of reionization. The measured logarithmic slope (0.25) and scatter (0.23 dex) are non-evolving. We discuss the remarkable consistency of the slope and scatter over cosmic time in the context of the galaxy-halo connection.</description>

      <title>A New Measure of Assembly Bias using the Environment Dependence of the Luminosity Function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assembly bias is the variation in the clustering of dark matter halos and galaxies that arises from correlations between the halo assembly history and the large-scale environment at fixed halo mass. In this work, we use the cosmological magneto-hydrodynamical simulation TNG300 to investigate how assembly bias affects the environment-dependent galaxy luminosity function. We measure the luminosity functions in bins of large-scale environment for the original simulated galaxy sample and for a shuffled sample, where the galaxies are randomly reassigned among halos of similar mass to remove assembly bias. By comparing them, we find distinct signatures, showing variations in the number of galaxies at the $\sim10\%$ level across all luminosities. Assembly bias increases the tendency of galaxies to reside in denser environments and further dilutes underdense regions, beyond the trends governed by halo mass. When separating by color, we see that assembly bias has a much bigger effect on red galaxies fainter than $\mathrm{M_r} - 5 \log{h} = -18.5$, which accounts for a $\sim20\%$ increase in the number of galaxies in the densest environment and a remarkable $50\%$ decrease in the least dense regions. The ratio of these measurements for the densest and least dense regions provides a significant assembly bias signal for the faint red galaxies, larger than a factor of two. Overall, our results provide a novel sensitive measure of assembly bias, offering valuable insight for modeling the effect and a potential new route to detect it in observations.</description>

      <title>Radiative Transfer Simulations of Ly$\alpha$ Intensity Mapping During Cosmic Reionization Including Sources from Galaxies and the Intergalactic Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present new simulations of Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) intensity maps that include Ly$\alpha$ radiative transfer in the intergalactic medium (IGM) and all significant sources of Ly$\alpha$ photons. The sources considered include Ly$\alpha$ directly from galaxies, cooling at the edges of ionized bubbles, recombinations within these bubbles, and reprocessing of galaxy continuum emission in the IGM. We also vary astrophysical parameters including the average neutral fraction of the IGM, the dust absorption of Ly$\alpha$ in galaxies, and the ionizing escape fraction. Previous work has suggested that Ly$\alpha$ intensity mapping can be used to constrain the neutral fraction of the IGM when accounting for radiative transfer in the IGM. When radiative transfer is ignored, direct Ly$\alpha$ emission from galaxies has the highest amplitude of power on all scales. When we include radiative transfer in our simulations, we find continuum emission reprocessed as Ly$\alpha$ is comparable to the Ly$\alpha$ emission directly from galaxies on large scales. For high neutral fraction in the IGM, emission from recombinations is comparable to galaxies on large scales. We find that the slope of the power spectrum is sensitive to the neutral fraction of the IGM when radiative transfer is included, suggesting that this may be useful for placing constraints on cosmic reionization. In addition, we find the power of galaxies is decreased across all scales due to dust absorption. We also find the escape fraction must be large for recombinations and bubble edges to contribute significantly to the power. We find the cross power is observable between SPHEREx Ly$\alpha$ intensity maps and a hypothetical galaxy survey is observable with a total signal-to-noise of 4 from $k = 0.035$ Mpc$^{-1}$ to $k = 1$ Mpc$^{-1}$.</description>

Abstract: We present arguments on the likely origins of supernovae without associated host galaxies from open field, non-clustered, environments. We show why it is unlikely these ``hostless'' supernovae stem from escaped hyper-velocity stars (HVS) in any appreciable numbers, especially for core-collapse supernovae. It is highly likely that hostless events arise from dwarf host galaxies too faint to be detected in their parent surveys. Several detections and numerous upper limits suggest a large number of field dwarfs, to $M_V&gt;-14$, which themselves may be important to constraining the slope of the low-mass end of the UV luminosity function, understanding galaxy evolution, and putting $\Lambda$CDM into context. Moreover, the detailed study of these mass and metallicity-constrained host environments, and the variety of supernovae that occur within them, could provide more stringent constraints on the nature of progenitor systems.</description>

      <title>Unveiling faint X-ray AGN populations in the NewAthena era: Insights from cosmological simulations</title>

Abstract: Recent observations expanded our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution, yet key challenges persist in the X-ray regime, crucial for studying Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). These limitations drive the development of next-generation observatories such as ESA's NewAthena. Now in phase B (preliminary design), the mission requires extensive testing to ensure compliance with its scientific goals, particularly given the uncertainties surrounding high redshift AGN. This work leverages the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation to build an X-ray AGN mock catalogue and assess the performance of NewAthena's WFI. We created a Super Massive Black Hole (SMBH) light cone, spanning 10 deg2, with corrections to account for the limited resolution of the simulation and X-ray properties derived in post-processing. The resulting catalogue reveals a 5* overabundance of faint AGN compared to current X-ray constraints, an inconsistency potentially resolved by invoking a higher Compton-thick (CTK) fraction and intrinsic X-ray weakness, as suggested by recent JWST findings. An end-to-end survey simulation using SIXTE predicts 250000 AGN detections, including 20,000 at z &gt; 3 and 35 in the Epoch of Reionization (z &gt; 6); notably, only AGN with LX &gt; 43.5 erg/s are detectable at z &gt; 6. The analysis also forecasts a significant population of detectable CTK AGN, even beyond z &gt; 4. These findings suggest X-ray observations will, for the first time, probe a significant AGN population in the EoR, offering new insights into SMBH growth. They also provide key input for refining NewAthena's mission design and optimizing its survey strategy.</description>

      <title>Metallicities of old open clusters: A new Galactic map</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18378v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Old open clusters (OCs) can constrain the chemical evolution of the Galactic disc through their metallicity gradients and age-metallicity relation but they are affected by low statistics. This work aims to determine precise and homogeneous metallicities for a number of old clusters ($\geq$ 500 Myr) from all-sky catalogues of stellar parameters leveraging Gaia spectrophotometry. Our purpose was to revisit the metallicity distribution of the oldest OCs as a function of their Galactic position and age with improved statistics. Our sample includes ~600 old OCs with a typical precision of 0.05 dex in metallicity. We identified metal-poor or metal-rich clusters never studied before, as well as moving groups as the remnants of dissolving clusters. Galactic maps show a smooth decrease in metallicity from inside to outside the disc. Metal-rich and metal-poor clusters exist at all ages but dominate respectively in the inner and the outer disc, with different scale heights.The radial metallicity gradient was found to have a knee shape with a steep value of -0.084$\pm$0.004 dex/kpc in the inner side and -0.018$\pm$0.056 dex/kpc outside the knee. The inner radial gradient flattens with age. Vertically, the metallicity gradient is -0.415$\pm$0.030 dex/kpc. The large scatter in the distribution of metallicity versus age is nicely explained by the superposition of OC populations standing at different galactocentric distances, each with its own mean metallicity and small dispersion, less than 0.08 dex in radius bins of 1 kpc.Our results are consistent with a negative radial metallicity gradient of interstellar matter that was present in the disc when the clusters formed. The low metallicity dispersion in each radius bin reflects weak radial mixing.</description>

      <title>100 Proof: HI Observations of 100 Nearby Dwarf Galaxies with the 100-meter Green Bank Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe the results of observations with the 100m Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT) in the HI line of 105 nearby dwarf galaxies, 60 of which were discovered recently in the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys. Of 105 objects observed, we detected 77 galaxies with the following median parameters: an HI-flux of 0.69 Jy km/s, a heliocentric velocity of 732 km/s, and a $W_{50}$ line width of 32 km/s. 70 are isolated late-type objects and 35 are new probable satellites of nearby spiral galaxies (NGC 628, NGC 2787, NGC 3556, NGC 4490, NGC 4594 and NGC 5055). The detected galaxies are predominantly gas-rich systems with a median gas-to-stellar-mass ratio of 1.87. In general, they follow the classic Tully-Fisher relation obtained for large disk-dominated spiral galaxies if their $M_{21}$ magnitudes are used instead of B-magnitudes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03635v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present 72 cosmological dark matter-only $N$-body zoom-in simulations with initial conditions beyond cold, collisionless dark matter (CDM), as the first installment of the COZMIC suite. We simulate Milky Way (MW) analogs with linear matter power spectra $P(k)$ for i) thermal-relic warm dark matter (WDM) with masses $m_{\mathrm{WDM}}\in [3,4,5,6,6.5,10]~\mathrm{keV}$, ii) fuzzy dark matter (FDM) with masses $m_{\mathrm{FDM}}\in [25.9,69.4,113,151,185,490]\times 10^{-22}~\mathrm{eV}$, and iii) interacting dark matter (IDM) with a velocity-dependent elastic proton scattering cross section $\sigma=\sigma_0 v^n$ relative particle velocity scaling $n\in [2,4]$, and dark matter mass $m_{\mathrm{IDM}}\in[10^{-4},~ 10^{-2},~ 1]$ GeV. Subhalo mass function (SHMF) suppression is significantly steeper in FDM versus WDM, while dark acoustic oscillations in $P(k)$ can reduce SHMF suppression for IDM. We fit SHMF models to our simulation results and derive new bounds on WDM and FDM from the MW satellite population, obtaining $m_{\mathrm{WDM}}&gt;5.9~\mathrm{keV}$ and $m_{\mathrm{FDM}}&gt;1.4\times 10^{-20}~\mathrm{eV}$ at $95\%$ confidence; these limits are $\approx 10\%$ weaker and $5\times$ stronger than previous constraints owing to the updated transfer functions and SHMF models, respectively. We estimate IDM bounds for $n=2$ ($n=4$) and obtain $\sigma_0 &lt; 1.0\times 10^{-27}$, $1.3\times 10^{-24}$, and $3.1\times 10^{-23}~\mathrm{cm}^2$ ($\sigma_0 &lt; 9.9\times 10^{-27}$, $9.8\times 10^{-21}$, and $2.1\times 10^{-17}~\mathrm{cm}^2$) for $m_{\mathrm{IDM}}=10^{-4}$, $10^{-2}$, and $1$ GeV, respectively. Thus, future development of IDM SHMF models can improve IDM cross section bounds by up to a factor of $\sim 20$ with current data. COZMIC presents an important step toward accurate small-scale structure modeling in beyond-CDM cosmologies, critical to upcoming observational searches for dark matter physics.</description>

      <title>COZMIC. II. Cosmological Zoom-in Simulations with Fractional non-CDM Initial Conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03431v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present $24$ cosmological dark matter (DM)-only zoom-in simulations of a Milky Way analog with initial conditions appropriate for scenarios where non-cold dark matter (NCDM) is a fraction of the total DM abundance (f-NCDM models) as the second installment of the COZMIC suite. We initialize our simulations using transfer functions, $T_{\mathrm{f-NCDM}}(k)\equiv\sqrt{P_{\mathrm{f-NCDM}}(k)/P_{\mathrm{CDM}}(k)}$ (where $P(k)$ is the linear matter power spectrum), with an initial suppression similar to thermal-relic warm dark matter (WDM) followed by a constant-amplitude plateau. We simulate suppression wavenumbers $[22.8,~ 32.1,~ 41.8,~ 52.0,~ 57.1,~ 95.3]~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, corresponding to thermal-relic WDM masses $m_{\mathrm{WDM}}\in [3,~ 4,~ 5,~ 6,~ 6.5,~ 10]~\mathrm{keV}$, and plateau amplitudes $\delta\in [0.2,~ 0.4,~ 0.6,~ 0.8]$. We model the subhalo mass function in terms of the suppression wavenumber and $\delta$. Integrating these models into a forward model of the MW satellite galaxy population yields new limits on f-NCDM scenarios, with suppression wavenumbers greater than $46$ and $ 40~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ for $\delta=0.2$, $0.4$, respectively, at $95\%$ confidence. The current data do not constrain $\delta&gt;0.4$. We map these limits to scenarios where a fraction $f_{\mathrm{WDM}}$ of DM behaves as a thermal relic, which yields the following bounds on cosmologies with a mixture of WDM and CDM: $m_{\mathrm{WDM}}&gt;3.6,~ 4.1,~ 4.6,~ 4.9,~ 5.4~\mathrm{keV}$ for $f_{\mathrm{WDM}}=0.5,~ 0.6,~ 0.7,~ 0.8,~ 0.9$, respectively, at $95\%$ confidence. The current data do not constrain WDM fractions $f_{\mathrm{WDM}}&lt;0.5$. Our results affirm that low-mass halo abundances are sensitive to partial suppression in $P(k)$, indicating the possibility of using galactic substructure to reconstruct $P(k)$ on small scales.</description>

      <title>COZMIC. III. Cosmological Zoom-in Simulations of Self-interacting Dark Matter with Suppressed Initial Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present eight cosmological dark matter (DM)--only zoom-in simulations of a Milky Way--like system that include suppression of the linear matter power spectrum $P(k)$, and/or velocity-dependent DM self-interactions, as the third installment of the COZMIC suite. We consider a model featuring a massive dark photon that mediates DM self-interactions and decays into massless dark fermions. The dark photon and dark fermions suppress linear matter perturbations, resulting in dark acoustic oscillations in $P(k)$, which ultimately affect dwarf galaxy scales. The model also features a velocity-dependent elastic self-interaction between DM particles (SIDM), with a cross section that can alleviate small-scale structure anomalies. For the first time, our simulations test the impact of $P(k)$ suppression on gravothermal evolution in an SIDM scenario that leads to core collapse in (sub)halos with present-day virial masses below $\approx 10^9~M_{\mathrm{\odot}}$. In simulations with $P(k)$ suppression and self-interactions, the lack of low-mass (sub)halos and the delayed growth of structure reduce the fraction of core-collapsed systems relative to SIDM simulations without $P(k)$ suppression. In particular, $P(k)$ suppression that saturates current warm DM constraints almost entirely erases core collapse in isolated halos. Models with less extreme $P(k)$ suppression produce core collapse in $\approx 20\%$ of subhalos and $\approx 5\%$ of isolated halos above $10^8~M_{\mathrm{\odot}}$, and also increase the abundance of extremely low-concentration isolated low-mass halos relative to SIDM. These results reveal a complex interplay between early and late-Universe DM physics, revealing new discovery scenarios in the context of upcoming small-scale structure measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06891v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A distinctive feature of ultralight bosonic dark matter is its ability to form a Bose-Einstein condensate with a dense, stationary configuration at the center of galactic halos. In this work, we investigate the internal dynamics of such cores by numerically solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations within a fully self-consistent gravitational framework, accounting for both gravitational potential perturbations and local self-interactions. We demonstrate that the solitonic core supports a discrete spectrum of well-defined collective modes. These oscillations characterize the linear response of the core to perturbations and may influence various dynamical processes. We also discuss potential astrophysical implications of these excitations on galactic scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01722v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As wide-field surveys yield increasingly precise data, multiprobe analyses offer significant advantages. In this work, we use our previously developed framework for jointly analyzing cosmic microwave background (CMB) and large-scale structure data. We analyze combinations of three CMB (Planck PR3, Planck PR4, and ACT+WMAP) datasets, DESI Y1 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data, and a $9\times 2$pt low-$z$ dataset comprising KiDS-1000, BOSS DR12, and Planck CMB lensing/Integrated Sachs Wolfe (including all cross-correlations). We first assess internal consistency, finding a mild ($&lt;2\sigma$) tension between CMB and low-$z$ datasets in the full parameter space and hints of systematics in Planck PR3 and KiDS-1000. We then derive constraints in $\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$ and, motivated by recent DESI results, dynamical dark energy ($w_0w_a\mathrm{CDM}$) and free neutrino mass extensions. In $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$, we derive a novel $9\times2$pt constraint of $S8=0.777^{+0.17}_{-0.17}$ and find strong consistency among CMB datasets. In $w_0w_a\mathrm{CDM}$, adding low-$z$ to CMB+BAO tightens $(w_0,w_a)$ constraints by 50\% (in figure-of-merit terms) in our baseline combination of Planck PR4 + low-$z$ + BAO. The posterior accommodates a cosmological constant ($w_0 = -1, w_a = 0$) within $1\sigma$, in contrast to the $\sim2\sigma$ preference for evolving dark energy from CMB+BAO alone. For neutrino masses, our baseline dataset yields a systematics-robust constraint of $M_\nu&lt;0.12\mathrm{eV}$ in $\nu\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$. Allowing dynamical dark energy and free neutrino mass ($\nu w_0w_a\mathrm{CDM}$) broadens and shifts the neutrino mass posterior higher, yielding a $1.8\sigma$ constraint ($M_\nu=0.16^{+0.09}_{-0.09}\mathrm{eV}$) in our baseline. Our analysis demonstrates the power of multiprobe analyses for assessing tensions, identifying systematics and providing robust constraints.</description>

      <title>The ISW-Lensing Bispectrum &amp; Trispectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03826v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect, cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and polarization fluctuations are correlated with the gravitational lensing potential. Famously, this induces a CMB three-point function, whose shape can be used to constrain dark energy and modifications to gravity. An analogous effect occurs at higher-order, producing an ISW-lensing trispectrum whose amplitude is hitherto unconstrained. We present a detailed discussion of this effect, and define minimum-variance estimators for the ISW-lensing three- and four-point functions. These are implemented within the PolySpec code, and bear strong similarities to the quadratic estimators used in lensing analyses. Applying these tools to Planck, we obtain strong detections of the bispectrum amplitude (consistent with previous works), but find only weak constraints on the trispectrum, due to a strong cancellation between the various ISW-induced contributions. We additionally forecast the constraints from future datasets, finding that (a) simple estimators for the ISW-lensing bispectrum will be severely limited by non-Gaussian modifications to the covariance, and (b) the ISW-lensing trispectrum will be very challenging to detect even with high-resolution future experiments. We finally consider the induced bias on primordial non-Gaussianity amplitudes (and lensing itself), which we show to be large for the bispectrum (as expected) but negligible for the trispectrum.</description>

Abstract: Black hole shadows are a widespread topic in astrophysics. This paper searches for an optical view of the black hole and the relationship between black hole shadow and photon sphere with curvature. We were inspired by the observations of Sagittarius $A^*$ and supermassive black hole M87$*$ through the Event Horizon Telescope. We have found the signature of the modified theory of gravity on the photon sphere and shadow. We considered $f(R)$ modified theory of gravity and new scalar degree of freedom $F$ appears in the expressions of photon sphere and shadow.</description>
