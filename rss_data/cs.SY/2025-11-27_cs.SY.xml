      <title>Local Dissipativity Analysis of Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dissipativity is an input-output (IO) characterization of nonlinear systems that enables compositional robust control through Vidyasagar's Network Dissipativity Theorem. However, determining the dissipativity of a system is an involved and, often, model-specific process. We present a general method to determine the local dissipativity properties of nonlinear, control affine systems. We simultaneously search for the optimal IO characterization of a system and synthesize a continuous piecewise affine (CPA) storage function via a convex optimization problem. To do so, we reformulate the relationship between the Hamilton-Jacobi inequality and the dissipation inequality as an linear matrix inequality (LMI) and develop novel LMI bounds for a triangulation. Further, we develop a method to synthesize a combined quadratic and CPA storage function to expand the systems the optimization problem is applicable to. Finally, we demonstrate that our method will always find a feasible IO characterization and a CPA or quadratic storage function given that the system is strictly locally dissipative.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Modeling of Load Demand in Electrified Highways Based on the EV Composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrified roadways (ERs) equipped with the dynamic wireless power transfer (DWPT) technology can achieve longer driving range and reduce on-board battery requirements for electric vehicles (EVs). Due to the spatial arrangement of transmitter (Tx) coils embedded into the ER pavement, the power drawn by the EV's receiver (Rx) coil is oscillatory in nature. Therefore, understanding the dynamic behavior of the total DWPT load is important for power system dynamic studies. To this end, we model the load of individual EVs in the time and frequency domains for constant EV speed. We establish that a nonlinear control scheme implemented in existing DWPT-enabled EVs exhibits milder frequency harmonics compared to its linear alternative. According to this model, the harmonics of an EV load decrease in amplitude with the Rx coil length. We further propose and analyze stochastic models for the total DWPT load served by an ER segment. Our models explain how the EV composition on the ER affects its frequency spectrum. Interestingly, we show that serving more EVs with longer Rx coils (trucks) does not necessarily entail milder harmonics. Our analytical findings are corroborated using realistic flows from a traffic simulator and offer valuable insights to grid operators and ER designers.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Gradient Descent MPPT Algorithm With Complexity-Aware Benchmarking for Low-Power PV Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a computationally efficient, real-time maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm tailored for low-power photovoltaic (PV) systems operating under fast-changing irradiance and partial shading conditions (PSC). The proposed method augments the classical perturb and observe (P&amp;O) algorithm with an adaptive gradient descent mechanism that dynamically scales the perturbation step size based on the instantaneous power-voltage slope, thereby minimizing tracking time and steady-state oscillations. An optional initialization routine enhances global MPP (GMPP) tracking under PSC. Extensive simulations, including irradiance recordings from freely moving rodent subjects relevant to the targeted application, and tests across varying converter topologies and temperatures, demonstrate its robust, topology-independent performance. The proposed algorithm achieves 99.94 percent MPPT efficiency under standard test conditions (STC), 99.21 percent when applied to experimental data, and more than 99.6 percent for the tested temperature profiles. Under PSC, the initialization routine improves tracking efficiency by up to 7.8 percent. A normalized gate-level complexity analysis and a unified figure-of-merit (FoM) incorporating efficiency, tracking time, and computational cost demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms 35 state-of-the-art P&amp;O-based MPPT algorithms. These results underscore its suitability for integration in low-power power management integrated circuits (PMICs) operating under dynamic and resource-constrained conditions.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Cascading Risk in Multi-Agent Rendezvous: Extended Analysis of Parameter-Induced Ambiguity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring safety in autonomous multi-agent systems during time-critical tasks such as rendezvous is a fundamental challenge, particularly under communication delays and uncertainty in system parameters. In this paper, we develop a theoretical framework to analyze the \emph{distributionally robust risk of cascading failures} in multi-agent rendezvous, where system parameters lie within bounded uncertainty sets around nominal values. Using a time-delayed dynamical network as a benchmark model, we quantify how small deviations in these parameters impact collective safety. We introduce a \emph{conditional distributionally robust functional}, grounded in a bivariate Gaussian model, to characterize risk propagation between agents. This yields a \emph{closed-form risk expression} that captures the complex interaction between time delays, network structure, noise statistics, and failure modes. These expressions expose key sensitivity patterns and provide actionable insight for the design of robust and resilient multi-agent networks. Extensive simulations validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Post-Event Analysis with Real-World Oscillation Data from Denmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates how Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD), grounded in Koopman operator theory, can effectively identify the main contributor(s) to oscillations in power grids. We use PMU data recorded from a real 0.15 Hz oscillation event in Denmark for post-event analysis. To this end, the EDMD algorithm processed only voltage and current phasors from nineteen PMUs at different voltage levels across the Danish grid. In such a blind-test setting with no supplementary system information, EDMD accurately pinpointed the location of the main contributor to the 0.2 Hz oscillation, consistent with the location of the problematic IBR plant later confirmed by Energinet, where the underlying cause was a control system issue. Conventional approaches, such as the dissipating energy flow (DEF) method used in the ISO-NE OSL tool did not clearly identify this plant. This joint validation with Energinet, reinforcing earlier studies using simulated IBR-dominated systems and real PMU data from ISO-NE, highlights the potential of EDMD-based post-event analysis for identifying major oscillation contributors and enabling targeted SSO mitigation.</description>

      <title>Independent policy gradient-based reinforcement learning for economic and reliable energy management of multi-microgrid systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficiency and reliability are both crucial for energy management, especially in multi-microgrid systems (MMSs) integrating intermittent and distributed renewable energy sources. This study investigates an economic and reliable energy management problem in MMSs under a distributed scheme, where each microgrid independently updates its energy management policy in a decentralized manner to optimize the long-term system performance collaboratively. We introduce the mean and variance of the exchange power between the MMS and the main grid as indicators for the economic performance and reliability of the system. Accordingly, we formulate the energy management problem as a mean-variance team stochastic game (MV-TSG), where conventional methods based on the maximization of expected cumulative rewards are unsuitable for variance metrics. To solve MV-TSGs, we propose a fully distributed independent policy gradient algorithm, with rigorous convergence analysis, for scenarios with known model parameters. For large-scale scenarios with unknown model parameters, we further develop a deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on independent policy gradients, enabling data-driven policy optimization. Numerical experiments in two scenarios validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Our approaches fully leverage the distributed computational capabilities of MMSs and achieve a well-balanced trade-off between economic performance and operational reliability.</description>

      <title>An Exact, Finite Dimensional Representation for Full-Block, Circle Criterion Multipliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides the first finite-dimensional characterization for the complete set of full-block, circle criterion multipliers. We consider the interconnection of a discrete-time, linear time-invariant system in feedback with a non-repeated, sector-bounded nonlinearity. Sufficient conditions for stability and performance can be derived using: (i) dissipation inequalities, and (ii) Quadratic Constraints (QCs) that bound the input/output pairs of the nonlinearity. Larger classes of QCs (or multipliers) reduce the conservatism of the conditions. Full-block, circle criterion multipliers define the complete set of all possible QCs for non-repeated, sector-bounded nonlinearities. These provide the least conservative conditions. However, full-block multipliers are defined by an uncountably infinite number of constraints and hence do not lead to computationally tractable solutions if left in this raw form. This paper provides a new finite-dimensional characterization for the set of full-block, circle criterion multipliers. The key theoretical insight is: the set of all input/output pairs of non-repeated sector-bounded nonlinearities is equal to the set of all incremental pairs for an appropriately constructed piecewise linear function. Our new description for the complete set of multipliers only requires a finite number of matrix copositivity constraints. These conditions have an exact, computationally tractable implementation for problems where the nonlinearity has small input/output dimensions $(\le 4)$. We illustrate the use of our new characterization via a simple example.</description>

      <title>From Consensus to Robust Clustering: Multi-Agent Systems with Nonlinear Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes a theoretical framework to describe the transition from consensus to stable clustering in multi-agent systems with nonlinear, cooperative interactions. We first establish a sharp threshold for consensus. For a broad class of non-decreasing, Lipschitz-continuous interactions, an explicit inequality linking the interaction's Lipschitz constant to the second-largest eigenvalue of the normalized adjacency matrix of the interaction graph confines all system equilibria to the synchronization manifold. This condition is shown to be a sharp threshold, as its violation permits the emergence of non-synchronized equilibria. We also demonstrate that such clustered states can only arise if the interaction law itself possesses specific structural properties, such as unstable fixed points. For the clustered states that emerge, we introduce a formal framework using Input-to-State Stability (ISS) theory to quantify their robustness. This approach allows us to prove that the internal cohesion of a cluster is robust to perturbations from the rest of the network. The analysis reveals a fundamental principle: cluster coherence is limited not by the magnitude of external influence, but by its heterogeneity across internal nodes. This unified framework, explaining both the sharp breakdown of consensus and the quantifiable robustness of the resulting modular structures, is validated on Zachary's Karate Club network, used as a classic benchmark for community structure.</description>

      <title>Stability of data-driven Koopman MPC with terminal conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper derives conditions under which Model Predictive Control (MPC) with terminal conditions, using a data-driven surrogate model as a prediction model, asymptotically stabilizes the plant despite approximation errors. In particular, we prove recursive feasibility and asymptotic stability if a proportional error bound holds, where proportional means that the bound is linear in the norm of the state and the input. For a broad class of nonlinear systems, this condition can be satisfied using data-driven surrogate models generated by kernel Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (kEDMD) using the Koopman operator. Last, the applicability of the proposed framework is demonstrated in a numerical case study.</description>

      <title>Design and Measurements of mmWave FMCW Radar Based Non-Contact Multi-Patient Heart Rate and Breath Rate Monitoring System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments in mmWave radar technologies have enabled the truly non-contact heart-rate (HR) and breath-rate (BR) measurement approaches, which provides a great ease in patient monitoring. Additionally, these technologies also provide opportunities to simultaneously detect HR and BR of multiple patients, which has become increasingly important for efficient mass monitoring scenarios. In this work, a frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) mmWave radar based truly non-contact multiple patient HR and BR monitoring system has been presented. Furthermore, a novel approach is also proposed, which combines multiple processing methods using a least squares solution to improve measurement accuracy, generalization, and handle measurement error. The proposed system has been developed using Texas Instruments' FMCW radar and experimental results with multiple subjects are also presented, which show &gt;97% and &gt;93% accuracy in the measured BR and HR values, respectively.</description>

      <title>Response-Based Frequency Stability Assessment under Multi-Scale Disturbances in High-Renewable Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In high-renewable power systems, active-power disturbances are becoming larger and exhibit increasingly diverse time scales, which complicates frequency stability assessment under unanticipated events. This paper presents a response-based frequency stability assessment method that uses disturbance power, inferred from generator electrical responses, to provide a unified treatment of multi-scale disturbances. Unanticipated disturbances are first classified into short-term and permanent events; permanent disturbances are further divided into step, second-level slope and minute-level slope disturbances. Based on the measured power responses of generator groups, a unified disturbance-power model is constructed to identify the disturbance type online and to quantify disturbance intensity through the disturbance power and its rate of change. Analytical frequency-response models are then derived for each disturbance class. For step disturbances, the maximum tolerable disturbance power is obtained under steady-state and transient frequency deviation constraints, and a safety-margin index is defined. For slope-type disturbances, an improved system frequency response (SFR) model and the rotor motion equation after exhaustion of primary frequency regulation are used to compute the over-limit time of frequency deviation. The proposed response-based assessment method is validated on the CSEE-FS frequency-stability benchmark system, demonstrating its effectiveness and accuracy for quantitative frequency stability assessment in high-renewable power systems.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Lighting Control in Visible Light Systems: An Integrated Sensing, Communication, and Illumination Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indoor visible light communication (VLC) is a promising sixth-generation (6G) technology, as its directional and sensitive optical signals are naturally suited for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). However, current research mainly focuses on maximizing data rates and sensing accuracy, creating a conflict between high performance, high energy consumption, and user visual comfort. This paper proposes an adaptive integrated sensing, communication, and illumination (ISCI) framework that resolves this conflict by treating energy savings as a primary objective. The framework's mechanism first partitions the receiving plane using a geometric methodology, defining an activity area and a surrounding non-activity area to match distinct user requirements. User location, determined using non-line-of-sight (NLOS) sensing, then acts as a dynamic switch for the system's optimization objective. The system adaptively shifts between minimizing total transmit power while guaranteeing communication and illumination performance in the activity area and maximizing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) uniformity in the non-activity area. Numerical results confirm that this adaptive ISCI approach achieves 53.59% energy savings over a non-adaptive system and improves SNR uniformity by 57.79%, while satisfying all illumination constraints and maintaining a mean localization error of 0.071 m.</description>

      <title>Respiratory Motion Compensation and Haptic Feedback for X-ray-Guided Teleoperated Robotic Needle Insertion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Respiratory motion limits the accuracy and precision of abdominal percutaneous procedures. In this paper, respiratory motion is compensated robotically using motion estimation models. Additionally, a teleoperated insertion is performed using proximity-based haptic feedback to guide physicians during insertion, enabling a radiation-free remote insertion for the end-user. The study has been validated using a robotic liver phantom, and five insertions were performed. The resulting motion estimation errors were below 3 mm for all directions of motion, and the overall resulting 3D insertion errors were 2.60, 7.75, and 2.86 mm for the superior-inferior, lateral, and anterior-posterior directions of motion, respectively. The proposed approach is expected to minimize the chances of inaccurate treatment or diagnosis due to respiratory-induced motion and reduce radiation exposure.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Reduction of Fault Location Errors in Onshore Wind Farm Collectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate fault location is essential for operational reliability and fast restoration in wind farm collector networks. However, the growing integration of inverter-based resources changes the current and voltage behavior during faults, challenging the effectiveness of traditional phasor-based diagnostic methods. In this context, the present paper introduces an advanced machine-learning solution that enhances a deterministic fault distance estimator by incorporating a correction model driven by a Gated Residual Network, specifically designed to minimize residual fault location errors. Through comprehensive feature engineering and selection processes, an improved predictor was developed and trained on a diverse set of fault scenarios simulated in a PSCAD-based real-world wind farm model, including variations in fault type, resistance, location, inception angle, and generation penetration. Hyperparameter optimization was performed using the Optuna framework, and the robustness of the method was statistically validated. Results show a significant improvement in accuracy, with a 76% overall decrease in fault location error compared to state-of-the-art approaches. The proposed method demonstrates strong scalability and adaptability to topological and operational changes. This approach advances the deployment of data-driven fault location frameworks for modern power systems.</description>

      <title>Sparse shepherding control of large-scale multi-agent systems via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a reinforcement learning framework for sparse indirect control of large-scale multi-agent systems, where few controlled agents shape the collective behavior of many uncontrolled agents. The approach addresses this multi-scale challenge by coupling ODEs (modeling controlled agents) with a PDE (describing the uncontrolled population density), capturing how microscopic control achieves macroscopic objectives. Our method combines model-free reinforcement learning with adaptive interaction strength compensation to overcome sparse actuation limitations. Numerical validation demonstrates effective density control, with the system achieving target distributions while maintaining robustness to disturbances and measurement noise, confirming that learning-based sparse control can replace computationally expensive online optimization.</description>

      <title>Design and Performance Assessment of a Virtualized IED for Digital Substations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital substations have significantly enhanced power grid protection by replacing traditional copper wiring with fiber-optic communication and integrating IEC 61850-compliant Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs), resulting in greater efficiency, reliability, and interoperability. While these advancements provide improved interoperability, challenges such as high costs, complex networks, and limited upgradeability persist. To mitigate these issues, the virtualization of IEDs has emerged as a cost-effective solution, offering scalability, simplified maintenance, and reduced hardware costs by replacing traditional hardware-based IEDs with software-based counterparts. However, the performance and reliability of virtual IEDs (vIED) must be rigorously evaluated to ensure their robustness in real-time applications. This paper develops, implements, and evaluates a vIED designed to match the performance of its hardware-based counterparts. The vIED was deployed on a server using virtual machines, with its core logic implemented in low-level programming languages to ensure high-speed, deterministic behavior. The performance was evaluated using real-time simulations, focusing on the response times of the protection functions. The results demonstrated that vIEDs achieved acceptable response times, validating their suitability for deployment in critical time-sensitive environments within digital substations.</description>

      <title>Scalable Multisubject Vital Sign Monitoring With mmWave FMCW Radar and FPGA Prototyping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce an innovative approach to estimate the vital signs of multiple human subjects simultaneously in a non-contact way using a Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar-based system. Traditional vital sign monitoring methods often face significant limitations, including subject discomfort with wearable devices, challenges in calibration, and the risk of infection transmission through contact measurement devices. To address these issues, this research is motivated by the need for versatile, non-contact vital monitoring solutions applicable in various critical scenarios. This work also explores the challenges of extending this capability to an arbitrary number of subjects, including hardware and theoretical limitations. Supported by rigorous experimental results and discussions, the paper illustrates the system's potential to redefine vital sign monitoring. An FPGA-based implementation is also presented as proof of concept for a hardware-based and portable solution, improving upon previous works by offering 2.7x faster execution and 18.4% less Look-Up Table (LUT) utilization, as well as providing over 7400x acceleration compared to its software counterpart.</description>

      <title>Analytical Phasor-Based Fault Location Enhancement for Wind Farm Collector Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing integration of Inverter-Based Resources (IBRs) is reshaping fault current characteristics, presenting significant challenges to traditional protection and fault location methods. This paper addresses a key limitation in fault location within wind farm collector networks, i.e., one-terminal phasor-based methods become inaccurate when IBRs are electrically located downstream from the fault. In such cases, the voltage drop caused by IBR fault current injections is not captured by the Intelligent Electronic Device, resulting in a systematic overestimation of fault distance. To mitigate this issue, a general compensation framework was proposed by augmenting classical loop formulations with a distance-dependent voltage correction term. The methodology was derived analytically using a sequence-domain representation and generalized to multiple fault types through a unified notation. It maintains the simplicity and interpretability of conventional approaches and can be implemented using only local measurements. The method was evaluated through EMT simulations in PSCAD using a realistic wind farm model. Results show significant improvements in location accuracy, with average and maximum errors notably reduced, especially for ground-involved faults where reductions exceed 90\%. Furthermore, the compensation eliminates sensitivity to wind penetration levels and ensures uniform performance across feeders, positioning the method as a practical solution for modern renewable-dominated grids.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a model predictive control (MPC) framework leveraging an ensemble of data-based models to optimally control complex systems under multiple operating conditions. A novel combination rule for ensemble models is proposed, based on the statistical Mahalanobis distance, enabling the ensemble weights to suitably vary across the prediction window based on the system input. In addition, a novel state observer for ensemble models is developed using moving horizon estimation (MHE). The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated on a benchmark energy system operating under multiple conditions.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Large Language Models for Numeric Anomaly Detection in Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have gained increasing attention in power grids for their general-purpose capabilities. Meanwhile, anomaly detection (AD) remains critical for grid resilience, requiring accurate and interpretable decisions based on multivariate telemetry. Yet the performance of LLMs on large-scale numeric data for AD remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs for numeric AD in power systems. We use GPT-OSS-20B as a representative model and evaluate it on the IEEE 14-bus system. A standardized prompt framework is applied across zero-shot, few-shot, in-context learning, low rank adaptation (LoRA), fine-tuning, and a hybrid LLM-traditional approach. We adopt a rule-aware design based on the three-sigma criterion, and report detection performance and rationale quality. This study lays the groundwork for further investigation into the limitations and capabilities of LLM-based AD and its integration with classical detectors in cyber-physical power grid applications.</description>

      <title>Influence of converter current limiting and prioritization on protection of highly IBR-penetrated networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates how grid-forming (GFM) and grid-following (GFL) control strategies in inverter-based resources (IBRs) influence line distance and differential protection in converter-dominated transmission systems. A modified IEEE 39-bus system is evaluated with GFM and GFL units equipped with low-voltage ride-through logic, current limiting, and positive- or negative-sequence prioritization. Distance protection is implemented with a mho characteristic, while line differential protection uses an alpha-plane approach. Results show that phase-to-ground loops in distance protection can substantially overestimate the fault location near the Zone-1 reach. For line differential protection, external faults may cause the operating point to briefly enter the trip region of the alpha-plane, even for the healthy-phase in ABG faults under GFL control and during the initial moments of the fault, demanding strong external security measures. These findings highlight that modern converter controls, together with current limitation and sequence-current prioritization, can compromise the reliability and security of traditional protection schemes.</description>

      <title>Understanding Regional Inertia Dynamics in CAISO from Real Grid Disturbances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The shift from synchronous generators to inverter-based resources has caused power system inertia to be unevenly distributed across power grids. As a result, certain grid regions are more vulnerable to high rate-of-change of frequency (RoCoF) during disturbances. This paper presents a measurement-based framework for estimating grid inertia in CAISO (California Independent System Operator) region using real disturbance-driven frequency data from the Frequency Monitoring Network (FNET/GridEye). By analyzing confirmed disturbances from 2013 to 2024, we identify trends in regional inertia and frequency dynamics, highlighting their relationship with renewable generation and the evolving duck curve. Regional RoCoF values were up to six times higher than interconnection-wide values, coinciding with declining inertia. Recent recovery in inertia is attributed to the increased deployment of battery energy storage systems with synthetic inertia capabilities. These findings underscore the importance of regional inertia monitoring, strategic resource planning, and adaptive operational practices to ensure grid reliability amid growing renewable integration.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Shepherding of Non-Cohesive Swarms Through Cluttered Environments via Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates decentralized shepherding in cluttered environments, where a limited number of herders must guide a larger group of non-cohesive, diffusive targets toward a goal region in the presence of static obstacles. A hierarchical control architecture is proposed, integrating a high-level target assignment rule, where each herder is paired with a selected target, with a learning-based low-level driving module that enables effective steering of the assigned target. The low-level policy is trained in a one-herder-one-target scenario with a rectangular obstacle using Proximal Policy Optimization and then directly extended to multi-agent settings with multiple obstacles without requiring retraining. Numerical simulations demonstrate smooth, collision-free trajectories and consistent convergence to the goal region, highlighting the potential of reinforcement learning for scalable, model-free shepherding in complex environments.</description>

      <title>Multi-Hypotheses Navigation in Collaborative Localization subject to Cyber Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses resilient collaborative localization in multi-agent systems exposed to spoofed radio frequency measurements. Each agent maintains multiple hypotheses of its own state and exchanges selected information with neighbors using covariance intersection. Geometric reductions based on distance tests and convex hull structure limit the number of hypotheses transmitted, controlling the spread of hypotheses through the network. The method enables agents to separate spoofed and truthful measurements and to recover consistent estimates once the correct hypothesis is identified. Numerical results demonstrate the ability of the approach to contain the effect of adversarial measurements, while also highlighting the impact of conservative fusion on detection speed. The framework provides a foundation for resilient multi-agent navigation and can be extended with coordinated hypothesis selection across the network.</description>

      <title>VibraWave: Sensing the Pulse of Polluted Waters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional methods for water pollutant detection, such as chemical assays and optical spectroscopy, are often invasive, expensive, and unsuitable for real-time, portable monitoring. In this paper, we introduce VibraWave, a novel non-invasive sensing framework that combines mmWave radar with controlled acoustic excitation, tensor decomposition, and deep learning to detect and quantify a wide range of water pollutants. By capturing radar reflections as a three-dimensional tensor encoding phase dynamics, range bin power, and angle-of-arrival (AoA), we apply PARAFAC decomposition with non-negative constraints to extract compact, interpretable pollutant fingerprints. These are used to train a lightweight student neural network via knowledge distillation, enabling joint classification and quantification of heavy metals (Cu, Fe, Mg), oil emulsions, and sediments. Extensive experiments show that VibraWave achieves high accuracy and low RMSE across pure, binary, and tertiary mixtures, while remaining robust and computationally efficient, making it well-suited for scalable, real-time water quality monitoring.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the cost of batteries lowers, sizing and control methods that are both fast and can achieve their promised performances when deployed are becoming more important. In this paper, we show how stochastically tuned rule based controllers (RBCs) can be effectively used to achieve both these goals, providing more realistic estimates in terms of achievable levelised cost of energy (LCOE), and better performances while in operation when compared to deterministic model predictive control (MPC). We test the proposed methodology on yearly profiles from real meters for peak shaving applications and provide strong evidence about these claims.</description>

      <title>Bang-Bang Evasion: Its Stochastic Optimality and a Terminal-Set-Based Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of optimal evasion in a planar endgame engagement, where a target with bounded lateral acceleration seeks to avoid interception by a missile guided by a linear feedback law. Contrary to existing approaches, that assume perfect information or use heuristic maneuver models in stochastic settings, we formulate the problem in an inherently stochastic framework involving imperfect information and bounded controls. Complying with the generalized separation theorem, the control law factors in the posterior distribution of the state. Extending the well-known optimality of bang-bang evasion maneuvers in deterministic settings to the realm of realistic, stochastic evasion scenarios, we firstly prove that an optimal evasion strategy always exists, and that the set of optimal solutions includes at least one bang-bang policy, rendering the resulting optimal control problem finite-dimensional. Leveraging this structure, we secondly propose the closed-loop terminal-set-based evasion (TSE) strategy, and demonstrate its effectiveness in simulation against a proportional navigation pursuer. Monte Carlo simulations show that the TSE strategy outperforms traditional stochastic evasion strategies based on random telegraph, Singer, and weaving models.</description>

      <title>Model-free practical PI-Lead control design by ultimate sensitivity principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Practical design and tuning of feedback controllers has to do often without any model of the given dynamic process. Only some general assumptions about the process, in this work type-one stable behavior, can be available for engineers, in particular in motion control systems. This paper proposes a practical and simple in realization procedure for designing a robust PI-Lead control without modeling. The developed method derives from the ultimate sensitivity principles, known in the empirical Ziegler-Nichols tuning of PID control, and makes use of some general characteristics of loop shaping. A three-steps procedure is proposed to determine the integration time constant, control gain, and Lead-element in a way to guarantee a sufficient phase margin, while all steps are served by only experimental observations of the output value. The proposed method is also evaluated with experiments on a noise-perturbed electro-mechanical actuator system with translational motion.</description>

      <title>MTTR-A: Measuring Cognitive Recovery Latency in Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring cognitive stability in autonomous multi-agent systems (MAS) is a central challenge for large-scale, distributed AI. While existing observability tools monitor system outputs, they cannot quantify how rapidly agentic workflows recover once reasoning coherence has been lost. We adapt classical reliability metrics-Mean Time-to-Recovery (MTTR), Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF), and related ratios-into the cognitive domain, defining MTTR-A (Mean Time-to-Recovery for Agentic Systems) as a runtime measure of cognitive recovery latency. MTTR-A quantifies the time required for a MAS to detect reasoning drift and restore consistent operation, capturing the recovery of reasoning coherence rather than infrastructural repair.
  A benchmark simulation using the AG~News corpus and the LangGraph orchestration framework was conducted, modeling recovery latencies across multiple reflex modes. Automated reflexes restored stability within approximately 6s on average, while human-approval interventions required about 12s. Across 200 runs, the median simulated MTTR-A was 6.21+-2.14s, MTBF=6.7+-2.14s, and NRR=0.08, demonstrating measurable runtime resilience across reflex strategies.
  By formalizing recovery latency as a quantifiable property of distributed reasoning-and deriving reliability bounds linking recovery time and cognitive uptime-this work establishes a foundation for runtime dependability in agentic cognition, transforming cognitive recovery from an ad-hoc process into a standardized, interpretable performance</description>

      <title>A Review of Pseudospectral Optimal Control: From Theory to Flight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The home space for optimal control is a Sobolev space. The home space for pseudospectral theory is also a Sobolev space. It thus seems natural to combine pseudospectral theory with optimal control theory and construct ``pseudospectral optimal control theory,'' a term coined by Ross. In this paper, we review key theoretical results in pseudospectral optimal control that have proven to be critical for a successful flight. Implementation details of flight demonstrations onboard NASA spacecraft are discussed along with emerging trends and techniques in both theory and practice. The 2011 launch of pseudospectral optimal control in embedded platforms is changing the way in which we see solutions to challenging control problems in aerospace and autonomous systems.</description>

      <title>NOIR 2.0: Neural Signal Operated Intelligent Robots for Everyday Activities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural Signal Operated Intelligent Robots (NOIR) system is a versatile brain-robot interface that allows humans to control robots for daily tasks using their brain signals. This interface utilizes electroencephalography (EEG) to translate human intentions regarding specific objects and desired actions directly into commands that robots can execute. We present NOIR 2.0, an enhanced version of NOIR. NOIR 2.0 includes faster and more accurate brain decoding algorithms, which reduce task completion time by 46%. NOIR 2.0 uses few-shot robot learning algorithms to adapt to individual users and predict their intentions. The new learning algorithms leverage foundation models for more sample-efficient learning and adaptation (15 demos vs. a single demo), significantly reducing overall human time by 65%.</description>

      <title>Data-driven control of continuous-time systems: A synthesis-operator approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses data-driven control of continuous-time systems. We develop a framework based on synthesis operators associated with input and state trajectories. A key advantage of the proposed method is that it does not require the state derivative and uses continuous-time data directly without sampling or filtering. First, systems compatible with given data are described by the synthesis operators into which data trajectories are embedded. Next, we characterize data informativity properties for system identification and for stabilization. Finally, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for informativity for quadratic stabilization in the presence of process noise. This condition is formulated as linear matrix inequalities by exploiting the finite-rank structure of the synthesis operators.</description>

      <title>Accelerated ADMM: Automated Parameter Tuning and Improved Linear Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work studies the linear convergence of an accelerated scheme of the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) for strongly convex and Lipschitz-smooth problems. We use the methodology of expressing the accelerated ADMM as a Lur'e system, i.e., an interconnection of a linear dynamical system in feedback with a slope-restricted operator, and we use Integral Quadratic Constraints to establish linear convergence. In addition, we propose several parameter tuning heuristics and their impact on the convergence rate through numerical analyses. Our new bounds show significantly improved linear convergence rates compared to the vanilla algorithm and previous proposed accelerated variants, which is also empirically validated on a LASSO regression benchmark.</description>

      <title>DynamicAdaptiveClimb: Adaptive Cache Replacement with Dynamic Resizing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient cache management is critical for optimizing the system performance, and numerous caching mechanisms have been proposed, each exploring various insertion and eviction strategies. In this paper, we present AdaptiveClimb and its extension, DynamicAdaptiveClimb, two novel cache replacement policies that leverage lightweight, cache adaptation to outperform traditional approaches. Unlike classic Least Recently Used (LRU) and Incremental Rank Progress (CLIMB) policies, AdaptiveClimb dynamically adjusts the promotion distance (jump) of the cached objects based on recent hit and miss patterns, requiring only a single tunable parameter and no per-item statistics. This enables rapid adaptation to changing access distributions while maintaining low overhead. Building on this foundation, DynamicAdaptiveClimb further enhances adaptability by automatically tuning the cache size in response to workload demands. Our comprehensive evaluation across a diverse set of real-world traces, including 1067 traces from 6 different datasets, demonstrates that DynamicAdaptiveClimb consistently achieves substantial speedups and higher hit ratios compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms. In particular, our approach achieves up to a 29% improvement in hit ratio and a substantial reduction in miss penalties compared to the FIFO baseline. Furthermore, it outperforms the next-best contenders, AdaptiveClimb and SIEVE [43], by approximately 10% to 15%, especially in environments characterized by fluctuating working set sizes. These results highlight the effectiveness of our approach in delivering efficient performance, making it well-suited for modern, dynamic caching environments.</description>

      <title>Multiport Analytical Pixel Electromagnetic Simulator (MAPES) for AI-assisted RFIC and Microwave Circuit Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel analytical framework, termed the Multiport Analytical Pixel Electromagnetic Simulator (MAPES). MAPES enables efficient and accurate prediction of the electromagnetic (EM) performance of arbitrary pixel-based microwave (MW) and RFIC structures. Inspired by the Integrated Internal Multiport Method (IMPM), MAPES extends the concept to the pixel presence/absence domain used in AI-assisted EM design. By introducing virtual pixels and diagonal virtual pixels and inserting virtual ports at critical positions, MAPES captures all horizontal, vertical, and diagonal electromagnetic couplings within a single multiport impedance matrix. Only a small set of full-wave simulations (typically about 1% of the datasets required by AI-assisted EM simulators) is needed to construct this matrix. Subsequently, any arbitrary pixel configuration can be evaluated analytically using a closed-form multiport relation without additional full-wave calculations. The proposed approach eliminates data-driven overfitting and ensures accurate results across all design variations. Comprehensive examples for single- and double-layer CMOS processes (180 nm and 65 nm) and PCBs confirm that MAPES achieves high prediction accuracy with 600- 2000x speed improvement compared to CST simulations. Owing to its efficiency, scalability and reliability, MAPES provides a practical and versatile tool for AI-assisted MW circuit and RFIC design across diverse fabrication technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electric power systems are increasingly turning to energy storage systems to balance supply and demand. But how much storage is required? What is the optimal volume of storage in a power system and on what does it depend? In addition, what form of hedge contracts do storage facilities require? We answer these questions in the special case in which the uncertainty in the power system involves successive draws of an independent, identically-distributed random variable. We characterize the conditions for the optimal operation of, and investment in, storage and show how these conditions can be understood graphically using price-duration curves. We also characterize the optimal hedge contracts for storage units.</description>

      <title>Predictive Safety Shield for Dyna-Q Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Obtaining safety guarantees for reinforcement learning is a major challenge to achieve applicability for real-world tasks. Safety shields extend standard reinforcement learning and achieve hard safety guarantees. However, existing safety shields commonly use random sampling of safe actions or a fixed fallback controller, therefore disregarding future performance implications of different safe actions. In this work, we propose a predictive safety shield for model-based reinforcement learning agents in discrete space. Our safety shield updates the Q-function locally based on safe predictions, which originate from a safe simulation of the environment model. This shielding approach improves performance while maintaining hard safety guarantees. Our experiments on gridworld environments demonstrate that even short prediction horizons can be sufficient to identify the optimal path. We observe that our approach is robust to distribution shifts, e.g., between simulation and reality, without requiring additional training.</description>

      <title>Closed Form HJB Solution for Continuous-Time Optimal Control of a Non-Linear Input-Affine System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing optimal controllers for nonlinear dynamical systems often relies on reinforcement learning and adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) to approximate solutions of the Hamilton Jacobi Bellman (HJB) equation. However, these methods require iterative training and depend on an initially admissible policy. This work introduces a new analytical framework that yields closed-form solutions to the HJB equation for a class of continuous-time nonlinear input-affine systems with known dynamics. Unlike ADP-based approaches, it avoids iterative learning and numerical approximation. Lyapunov theory is used to prove the asymptotic stability of the resulting closed-loop system, and theoretical guarantees are provided. The method offers a closed-form control policy derived from the HJB framework, demonstrating improved computational efficiency and optimal performance on state-of-the-art optimal control problems in the literature.</description>

      <title>Modeling, Analysis, and Control of Continuous-Time Weighted-Median Opinion Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16318v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simple yet predictive mathematical models are essential for mechanistic understanding of opinion evolution in social groups. The weighted-median mechanism has recently been proposed as a well-founded alternative to conventional DeGroot-type opinion dynamics. However, the original weighted-median model excludes compromise behavior, as individuals directly adopt their neighbors' opinions without forming intermediate values. In this paper, we introduce a parsimonious continuous-time extension of the weighted-median model by incorporating individual inertia, allowing opinions to move gradually toward the neighbors' weighted median. Empirical evidence shows that this model outperforms both the original weighted-median and DeGroot models with inertia in predicting opinion shifts. We provide a complete theoretical analysis of the proposed dynamics: the equilibria are characterized and shown to be Lyapunov stable; global convergence is established via the Bony-Brezis method, yielding necessary and sufficient conditions for consensus from arbitrary initial states. In addition, we derive a graph-theoretic condition for persistent disagreement and a necessary and sufficient condition for steering the system to any prescribed consensus value through constant external inputs to a subset of individuals. These results reveal how a social group's resilience to external manipulation fundamentally depends on its internal network structure.</description>

      <title>L4acados: Learning-based models for acados, applied to Gaussian process-based predictive control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19258v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Incorporating learning-based models, such as artificial neural networks or Gaussian processes, into model predictive control (MPC) strategies can significantly improve control performance and online adaptation capabilities for real-world applications. Still, enabling state-of-the-art implementations of learning-based models for MPC is complicated by the challenge of interfacing machine learning frameworks with real-time optimal control software. This work aims at filling this gap by incorporating external sensitivities in sequential quadratic programming solvers for nonlinear optimal control. To this end, we provide L4acados, a general framework for incorporating Python-based dynamics models in the real-time optimal control software acados. By computing external sensitivities via a user-defined Python module, L4acados enables the implementation of MPC controllers with learning-based residual models in acados, while supporting parallelization of sensitivity computations when preparing the quadratic subproblems. We demonstrate significant speed-ups and superior scaling properties of L4acados compared to available software using a neural-network-based control example. Last, we provide an efficient and modular real-time implementation of Gaussian process-based MPC using L4acados, which is applied to two hardware examples: autonomous miniature racing, as well as motion control of a full-scale autonomous vehicle for an ISO lane change maneuver.</description>

      <title>Boosting the transient performance of reference tracking controllers with neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reference tracking is a key objective in many control systems, including those characterized by complex nonlinear dynamics. In these settings, traditional control approaches can effectively ensure steady-state accuracy but often struggle to explicitly optimize transient performance. Neural network controllers have gained popularity due to their adaptability to nonlinearities and disturbances; however, they often lack formal closed-loop stability and performance guarantees. To address these challenges, a recently proposed neural-network control framework known as Performance Boosting (PB) has demonstrated the ability to maintain $\mathcal{L}_p$ stability properties of nonlinear systems while optimizing generic transient costs.
  This paper extends the PB approach to reference tracking problems. First, we characterize the complete set of nonlinear controllers that preserve desired tracking properties for nonlinear systems equipped with base reference-tracking controllers. Then, we show how to optimize transient costs while searching within subsets of tracking controllers that incorporate expressive neural network models. Furthermore, we analyze the robustness of our method to uncertainties in the underlying system dynamics. Numerical simulations on a robotic system demonstrate the advantages of our approach over the standard PB framework.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Transmission Flexibility under Uncertainty: Getting Dynamic Line Ratings into Electricity Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00826v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Static transmission line ratings may lead to underutilization of line capacity due to overly conservative assumptions. Grid-enhancing technologies (GETs) such as dynamic line ratings (DLRs), which adjust line capacity based on real-time conditions, are a techno-economically viable alternative to increase the utilization of existing power lines. Nonetheless, their adoption has been slow, partly due to the absence of operational tools that effectively account for simultaneous impacts on dispatch and pricing. In this paper, we represent transmission capacity with DLRs as a stock-like resource with time-variant interdependency, which is modeled via an approximation of line temperature evolution process, decoupling the impacts of ambient weather conditions and power flow on transmission line temperature and thus capacity. We integrate DLRs into a multi-period DC optimal power flow problem, with chance constrains addressing correlated uncertainty in DLRs and renewable generation. This yields non-convex problems that we transform into a tractable convex form by linearization. We derive locational marginal energy and ancillary services prices consistent with a competitive equilibrium. Numerical experiments on the 11-zone and 1814-node NYISO systems demonstrate its performance, including impacts on dispatch, pricing, and marginal carbon emissions.</description>

      <title>Geometric Decentralized Stability Certificate for Power Systems Based on Projecting DW Shells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17033v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of decentralized stability conditions has gained considerable attention due to the need to analyze multi-agent network systems, such as heterogeneous multi-converter power systems. A recent advance is the application of the small-phase theorem, which extends the passivity theory. However, it requires the transfer function matrix to be sectorial, which may not hold in some frequency range and will result in conservativeness. To address this issue, this paper proposes a geometric decentralized stability condition based on Davis-Wielandt (DW) shell and its projections. Our approach provides a geometric interpretation of the small-gain and small-phase theorems and enables decentralized stability analysis of power systems. It serves as a visualization method to understand the closed-loop interactions and assess the stability of large-scale network systems in a scalable and modular manner.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07218v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) is driving an unprecedented increase in the electricity demand of AI data centers, raising emerging challenges for electric power grids. Understanding the characteristics of AI data center loads and their interactions with the grid is therefore critical for ensuring both reliable power system operation and sustainable AI development. This paper provides a comprehensive review and vision of this evolving landscape. Specifically, this paper (i) presents an overview of AI data center infrastructure and its key components, (ii) examines the key characteristics and patterns of electricity demand across the stages of model preparation, training, fine-tuning, and inference, (iii) analyzes the critical challenges that AI data center loads pose to power systems across three interrelated timescales, including long-term planning and interconnection, short-term operation and electricity markets, and real-time dynamics and stability, and (iv) discusses potential solutions from the perspectives of the grid, AI data centers, and AI end-users to address these challenges. By synthesizing current knowledge and outlining future directions, this review aims to guide research and development in support of the joint advancement of AI data centers and power systems toward reliable, efficient, and sustainable operation.</description>

      <title>Analysis and Control of Acoustic Emissions from Marine Energy Converters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Environmental licensing related to underwater acoustic emissions represents a critical bottleneck for the commercial deployment of marine renewable energy. This study presents a control engineering framework to mitigate acoustic risks from tidal current converters without compromising project viability. A MATLAB/Simulink model of a tidal current converter was utilised to evaluate two distinct mitigation tiers: (1) architectural modification, comparing a geared induction generator against a direct-drive permanent magnet synchronous generator, and (2) operational control, analysing the impact of switching frequencies and maximum power point tracking coefficient tuning. Results indicate that lowering switching frequencies is ineffective, increasing power electronic losses by over 2000% with negligible acoustic benefit. Conversely, the direct-drive permanent magnet synchronous generator architecture reduced sound pressure levels, effectively eliminating mechanical tonal noise. For existing geared systems, de-tuning the maximum power point tracking coefficient by a factor of 1.2 reduced the probability of exceeding temporary threshold shift limits for marine mammals, with a quantified energy yield reduction of 3.58%. These findings propose a hierarchical mitigation strategy: selecting direct-drive topologies for acoustically sensitive sites, and utilising maximum power point tracking coefficient based power curtailment as a transient operational mode during critical biological migration periods.</description>

      <title>Bounds of Validity for Bifurcations of Equilibria in a Class of Networked Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Local bifurcation analysis plays a central role in understanding qualitative transitions in networked nonlinear dynamical systems, including dynamic neural network and opinion dynamics models. In this article we establish explicit bounds of validity for the classification of bifurcation diagrams in two classes of continuous-time networked dynamical systems, analogous in structure to the Hopfield and the Firing Rate dynamic neural network models. Our approach leverages recent advances in computing the bounds for the validity of Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction, a reduction method widely employed in nonlinear systems analysis. Using these bounds we rigorously characterize neighborhoods around bifurcation points where predictions from reduced-order models remain reliable. We further demonstrate how these bounds can be applied to an illustrative family of nonlinear opinion dynamics on k-regular graphs, which emerges as a special case of the general framework. These results provide new analytical tools for quantifying the robustness of bifurcation phenomena in dynamics over networked systems and highlight the interplay between network structure and nonlinear dynamical behavior.</description>

      <title>Hopfield Neural Networks for Online Constrained Parameter Estimation with Time-Varying Dynamics and Disturbances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes two projector-based Hopfield neural network (HNN) estimators for online, constrained parameter estimation under time-varying data, additive disturbances, and slowly drifting physical parameters. The first is a constraint-aware HNN that enforces linear equalities and inequalities (via slack neurons) and continuously tracks the constrained least-squares target. The second augments the state with compensation neurons and a concatenated regressor to absorb bias-like disturbance components within the same energy function. For both estimators we establish global uniform ultimate boundedness with explicit convergence rate and ultimate bound, and we derive practical tuning rules that link the three design gains to closed-loop bandwidth and steady-state accuracy. We also introduce an online identifiability monitor that adapts the constraint weight and time step, and, when needed, projects updates onto identifiable subspaces to prevent drift in poorly excited directions...</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The describing function (DF) and phase response curve (PRC) are classical tools for the analysis of feedback oscillations and rhythmic behaviors, widely used across control engineering, biology, and neuroscience. These tools are known to have limitations in networks of relaxation oscillators and excitable systems. For this reason, the paper proposes a novel approach tailored to excitable systems. Our analysis focuses on the discrete-event operator mapping input trains of events to output trains of events. The methodology is illustrated on the excitability model of Hodgkin-Huxley. The proposed framework provides a basis for designing and analyzing central pattern generators in networks of excitable neurons, with direct relevance to neuromorphic control and neurophysiology.</description>

      <title>Observer Design for Singularly Perturbed Linear Networked Control Systems Subject to Measurement Noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the emulation-based observer design for linear networked control systems (NCS) operating at two time scales in the presence of measurement noise. The system is formulated as a hybrid singularly perturbed dynamical system, enabling the systematic use of singular perturbation techniques to derive explicit bounds on the maximum allowable transmission intervals (MATI) for both fast and slow communication channels. Under the resulting conditions, the proposed observer guarantees that the estimation error satisfies a global exponential derivative-input-to-state stability (DISS)-like property, where the ultimate bound scales proportionally with the magnitudes of the measurement noise and the time derivative of the control input. The effectiveness of the approach is illustrated through a numerical example.</description>

      <title>Connectivity-Preserving Multi-Agent Area Coverage via Optimal-Transport-Based Density-Driven Optimal Control (D2OC)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-agent systems play a central role in area coverage tasks across search-and-rescue, environmental monitoring, and precision agriculture. Achieving non-uniform coverage, where spatial priorities vary across the domain, requires coordinating agents while respecting dynamic and communication constraints. Density-driven approaches can distribute agents according to a prescribed reference density, but existing methods do not ensure connectivity. This limitation often leads to communication loss, reduced coordination, and degraded coverage performance.
  This letter introduces a connectivity-preserving extension of the Density-Driven Optimal Control (D2OC) framework. The coverage objective, defined using the Wasserstein distance between the agent distribution and the reference density, admits a convex quadratic program formulation. Communication constraints are incorporated through a smooth connectivity penalty, which maintains strict convexity, supports distributed implementation, and preserves inter-agent communication without imposing rigid formations.
  Simulation studies show that the proposed method consistently maintains connectivity, improves convergence speed, and enhances non-uniform coverage quality compared with density-driven schemes that do not incorporate explicit connectivity considerations.</description>

Abstract: Autonomous robots relying on radio frequency (RF)-based localization such as global navigation satellite system (GNSS), ultra-wide band (UWB), and 5G integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) are vulnerable to spoofing and sensor manipulation. This paper presents a resilient navigation architecture that combines multi-hypothesis estimation with a Poisson binomial windowed-count detector for anomaly identification and isolation. A state machine coordinates transitions between operation, diagnosis, and mitigation, enabling adaptive response to adversarial conditions. When attacks are detected, trajectory re-planning based on differential flatness allows information-gathering maneuvers minimizing performance loss. Case studies demonstrate effective detection of biased sensors, maintenance of state estimation, and recovery of nominal operation under persistent spoofing attacks</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tracking maneuvering targets requires estimators that are both responsive and robust. Interacting Multiple Model (IMM) filters are a standard tracking approach, but fusing models via Gaussian mixtures can lag during maneuvers. Recent winnertakes-all (WTA) approaches react quickly but may produce discontinuities. We propose SAFE-IMM, a lightweight IMM variant for tracking on mobile and resource-limited platforms with a safe covariance-aware gate that permits WTA only when the implied jump from the mixture to the winner is provably bounded. In simulations and on nuScenes front-radar data, SAFE-IMM achieves high accuracy at real-time rates, reducing ID switches while maintaining competitive performance. The method is simple to integrate, numerically stable, and clutter-robust, offering a practical balance between responsiveness and smoothness.</description>

      <title>Earth Observation Satellite Scheduling with Graph Neural Networks and Monte Carlo Tree Search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Earth Observation Satellite Planning (EOSP) is a difficult optimization problem with considerable practical interest. A set of requested observations must be scheduled on an agile Earth observation satellite while respecting constraints on their visibility window, as well as maneuver constraints that impose varying delays between successive observations. In addition, the problem is largely oversubscribed: there are much more candidate observations than can possibly be achieved. Therefore, one must select the set of observations that will be performed while maximizing their cumulative benefit and propose a feasible schedule for these observations. As previous work mostly focused on heuristic and iterative search algorithms, this paper presents a new technique for selecting and scheduling observations based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). GNNs are used to extract relevant information from the graphs representing instances of the EOSP, and DRL drives the search for optimal schedules. A post-learning search step based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is added that is able to find even better solutions. Experiments show that it is able to learn on small problem instances and generalize to larger real-world instances, with very competitive performance compared to traditional approaches.</description>

      <title>Alignment of large language models with constrained learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of computing an optimal large language model (LLM) policy for the constrained alignment problem, where the goal is to maximize a primary reward objective while satisfying constraints on secondary utilities. Despite the popularity of Lagrangian-based LLM policy search in constrained alignment, iterative primal-dual methods often fail to converge, and non-iterative dual-based methods do not achieve optimality in the LLM parameter space. To address these challenges, we employ Lagrangian duality to develop an iterative dual-based alignment method that alternates between updating the LLM policy via Lagrangian maximization and updating the dual variable via dual descent. In theory, we characterize the primal-dual gap between the primal value in the distribution space and the dual value in the LLM parameter space. We further quantify the optimality gap of the learned LLM policies at near-optimal dual variables with respect to both the objective and the constraint functions. These results prove that dual-based alignment methods can find an optimal constrained LLM policy, up to an LLM parametrization gap. We demonstrate the effectiveness and merits of our approach through extensive experiments conducted on the PKU-SafeRLHF and Anthropic HH-RLHF datasets.</description>

      <title>Rapid and Safe Trajectory Planning over Diverse Scenes through Diffusion Composition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04384v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Safe trajectory planning in complex environments must balance stringent collision avoidance with real-time efficiency, which is a long-standing challenge in robotics. In this work, we present a diffusion-based trajectory planning framework that is both rapid and safe. First, we introduce a scene-agnostic, MPC-based data generation pipeline that efficiently produces large volumes of kinematically feasible trajectories. Building on this dataset, our integrated diffusion planner maps raw onboard sensor inputs directly to kinematically feasible trajectories, enabling efficient inference while maintaining strong collision avoidance. To generalize to diverse, previously unseen scenarios, we compose diffusion models at test time, enabling safe behavior without additional training. We further propose a lightweight, rule-based safety filter that, from the candidate set, selects the trajectory meeting safety and kinematic-feasibility requirements. Across seen and unseen settings, the proposed method delivers real-time-capable inference with high safety and stability. Experiments on an F1TENTH vehicle demonstrate practicality on real hardware.

      <title>Action Chunking and Exploratory Data Collection Yield Exponential Improvements in Behavior Cloning for Continuous Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09061v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical analysis of two of the most impactful interventions in modern learning from demonstration in robotics and continuous control: the practice of action-chunking (predicting sequences of actions in open-loop) and exploratory augmentation of expert demonstrations. Though recent results show that learning from demonstration, also known as imitation learning (IL), can suffer errors that compound exponentially with task horizon in continuous settings, we demonstrate that action chunking and exploratory data collection circumvent exponential compounding errors in different regimes. Our results identify control-theoretic stability as the key mechanism underlying the benefits of these interventions. On the empirical side, we validate our predictions and the role of control-theoretic stability through experimentation on popular robot learning benchmarks. On the theoretical side, we demonstrate that the control-theoretic lens provides fine-grained insights into how compounding error arises, leading to tighter statistical guarantees on imitation learning error when these interventions are applied than previous techniques based on information-theoretic considerations alone.</description>

      <title>HardFlow: Hard-Constrained Sampling for Flow-Matching Models via Trajectory Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion and flow-matching have emerged as powerful methodologies for generative modeling, with remarkable success in capturing complex data distributions and enabling flexible guidance at inference time. Many downstream applications, however, demand enforcing hard constraints on generated samples (for example, robot trajectories must avoid obstacles), a requirement that goes beyond simple guidance. Prevailing projection-based approaches constrain the entire sampling path to the constraint manifold, which is overly restrictive and degrades sample quality. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that reformulates hard-constrained sampling as a trajectory optimization problem. Our key insight is to leverage numerical optimal control to steer the sampling trajectory so that constraints are satisfied precisely at the terminal time. By exploiting the underlying structure of flow-matching models and adopting techniques from model predictive control, we transform this otherwise complex constrained optimization problem into a tractable surrogate that can be solved efficiently and effectively. Furthermore, this trajectory optimization perspective offers significant flexibility beyond mere constraint satisfaction, allowing for the inclusion of integral costs to minimize distribution shift and terminal objectives to further enhance sample quality, all within a unified framework. We provide a control-theoretic analysis of our method, establishing bounds on the approximation error between our tractable surrogate and the ideal formulation. Extensive experiments across diverse domains, including robotics (planning), partial differential equations (boundary control), and vision (text-guided image editing), demonstrate that our algorithm, which we name $\textit{HardFlow}$, substantially outperforms existing methods in both constraint satisfaction and sample quality.</description>

      <title>Nonuniform-Grid Markov Chain Approximation of Continuous Processes with Time-Linear Moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20416v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to approximate continuous-time, continuous-state stochastic processes by a discrete-time Markov chain defined on a nonuniform grid. Our method provides exact moment matching for processes whose first and second moments are linear functions of time. In particular, we show that, under certain conditions, the transition probabilities of a Markov chain can be chosen so that its first two moments match prescribed linear functions of time. These conditions depend on the grid points of the Markov chain and the coefficients of the linear mean and variance functions. Our proof relies on two recurrence relations for the expectation and variance across time. This approach enables simulation-based numerical analysis of continuous processes while preserving their key characteristics. We illustrate its efficacy by approximating continuous processes describing heat diffusion and geometric Brownian motion (GBM). For heat diffusion, we show that the heat profile at a set of points can be investigated by embedding those points inside the nonuniform grid of our Markov chain. For GBM, numerical simulations demonstrate that our approach, combined with suitable nonuniform grids, yields accurate approximations, with consistently small empirical Wasserstein-1 distances at long time horizons.</description>
