      <title>AGN flares as counterparts to the mergers detected by LIGO and Virgo: a novel spatial correlation analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The primary formation channel for the stellar-mass Binary Black Holes which have been detected merging by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration is yet to be discerned. One of the main obstacles is that such Gravitational Wave (GW) events are not in general expected to produce an Electromagnetic (EM) counterpart. This might not be the case if the mergers happen in gaseous environments, such as the accretion discs of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Recently, 20 AGN flares detected by the Zwicky Transient Facility have been investigated as potential counterparts of GW events by Graham et al. (2023). We present a new spatial correlation analysis involving such events that uses the up-to-date posterior samples of 78 mergers detected during the third observing run of the LVK collaboration. We apply a likelihood method which takes into account the exact position of the EM signal within the 3D sky map of the GW events. We find that current data favour the hypothesis of no causal connection between the detected mergers and the AGN flares. We place an upper limit of 0.155 at a 90 per cent credibility level on the fraction of coalescences that are physically related to a flare. Moreover, we show that the mass distribution of the merging binaries that appear in coincidence with AGN flares, characterised by values typically larger than the ones of the full population of GW events, is also consistent with the no-connection hypothesis. This is because of a positive correlation between the binary mass and the reconstruction volume.</description>

      <title>Exotic Stable Branches with Efficient TOV Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern inference schemes for the neutron star equation of state (EoS) require large numbers of stellar models constructed with different EoS, and these stellar models must capture all the behavior of stable stars. I introduce termination conditions for sequences of stellar models for cold, non-rotating neutron stars that are guaranteed to identify all stable stellar configurations up to arbitrarily large central pressures along with an efficient algorithm to build accurate interpolators for macroscopic properties. I explore the behavior of stars with both high- and low-central pressures. Interestingly, I find that EoS with monotonically increasing sound-speed can produce multiple stable branches (twin stars) and that large phase transitions at high densities can produce stable branches at nearly any mass scale, including sub-solar masses, while still supporting stars with $M &gt; 2\,M_\odot$. I conclude with some speculation about the astrophysical implications of this behavior.</description>

      <title>The possibility of multi-TeV secondary gamma rays from GRB221009A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The brightest gamma ray burst (GRB) ever observed, GRB221009A, produced a surprisingly large flux of gamma rays with multi-TeV energies, which are expected to be absorbed in interactions with extragalactic background light (EBL). If the highest energy gamma rays were produced at the source, their spectral shape would have to exhibit a nonphysical spike even for the lowest levels of EBL. We show that, for widely accepted models of EBL, the data can be explained by secondary gamma rays produced in cosmic ray interactions along the line of sight, as long as the extragalactic magnetic fields (EGMFs) are $10^{-16}$G or smaller, assuming 1 Mpc correlation length. Our interpretation supports the widely held expectation that GRB jets can accelerate cosmic rays to energies as high as 10 EeV and above, and it has implications for understanding the magnitudes of EGMFs.</description>

      <title>Theoretical investigation of energy levels and transitions for Ce III with applications to kilonova spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Doubly ionized cerium (Ce$^{2+}$) is one of the most important ions to understand the kilonova spectra. In particular, near-infrared (NIR) transitions of Ce III between the ground (5p$^6$ 4f$^2$) and first excited (5p$^6$ 4f 5d) configurations are responsible for the absorption features around 14,500 A. However, there is no dedicated theoretical studies to provide accurate transition probabilities for these transitions. We present energy levels of the ground and first excited configurations and transition data between them for Ce III. Calculations are performed using the GRASP2018 package, which is based on the multiconfiguration Dirac-Hartree-Fock and relativistic configuration interaction methods. Compared with the energy levels in the NIST database, our calculations reach the accuracy with the root-mean-square (rms) of 2732 cm$^{-1}$ or 1404 cm$^{-1}$ (excluding one highest level) for ground configuration, and rms of 618 cm$^{-1}$ for the first excited configuration. We extensively study the line strengths and find that the Babushkin gauge provide the more accurate values. By using the calculated gf values, we show that the NIR spectral features of kilonova can be explained by the Ce III lines.</description>

      <title>Discovering the Mass-Scaled Damping Timescale from Microquasars to Blazars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying the variability of the accretion disks of black holes and jets is important to identify their internal physical processes. In this letter, we obtain the characteristic damping timescale of 34 blazars and seven microquasars from the Fermi-Large Area Telescope and the XMM-Newton X-ray telescope, respectively. We found that the mass-scaled characteristic timescales, ranging from the microquasars of stellar-mass black holes to the blazars of supermassive black holes, exhibited a linear relationship with a slope of $\sim$0.57. Given the fact the damping timescales of the $\gamma$-ray in the blazars are associated with the jet, we propose that the timescales of the X-ray in these microquasars are also related with the jet. The mass-scaled damping timescale that we found was consistent with the radiation of the optical accretion disk. This can be attributed to the viscous timescale at the ultraviolet-emitting radii of the disk, which can affect the jet. Our study provides a new perspective on the origin of the region of radiation and the possible disk--jet connection based on time-domain analysis.</description>

      <title>Parallelizing Air Shower Simulation for Background Characterization in IceCube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic kilometer neutrino telescope located at the Geographic South Pole. For every observed neutrino event, there are over $10^6$ background events caused by cosmic ray air shower muons. In order to properly separate signal from background, it is necessary to produce Monte Carlo simulations of these air showers. Although to-date, IceCube has produced large quantities of background simulation, these studies still remain statistics limited. The first stage of simulation requires heavy CPU usage while the second stage requires heavy GPU usage. Processing both of these stages on the same node will result in an underutilized GPU but using different nodes will encounter bandwidth bottlenecks. Furthermore, due to the power-law energy spectrum of cosmic rays, the memory footprint of the detector response often exceeded the limit in unpredictable ways. This proceeding presents new client-server code which parallelizes the first stage onto multiple CPUs on the same node and then passes it on to the GPU for photon propagation. This results in GPU utilization of greater than 90% as well as more predictable memory usage and an overall factor of 20 improvement in speed over previous techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A wide variety of celestial bodies have been considered as dark matter detectors. Which stands the best chance of delivering the discovery of dark matter? Which is the most powerful dark matter detector? We investigate a range of objects, including the Sun, Earth, Jupiter, Brown Dwarfs, White Dwarfs, Neutron Stars, Stellar populations, and Exoplanets. We quantify how different objects are optimal dark matter detectors in different regimes by deconstructing some of the in-built assumptions in these search sensitivities, including observation potential and particle model assumptions. We show how different objects can be expected to deliver corroborating signals. We discuss different search strategies, their opportunities and limitations, and the interplay of regimes where different celestial objects are optimal dark matter detectors.</description>

      <title>The impact of plasma on the relaxation of black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our universe is permeated with interstellar plasma, which prevents propagation of low-frequency electromagnetic waves. Here, we show that two dramatic consequences arise out of such suppression; (i) if plasma permeates the light ring of a black hole, electromagnetic modes are screened entirely from the gravitational-wave signal, changing the black hole spectroscopy paradigm; (ii) if a near vacuum cavity is formed close to a charged black hole, as expected for near equal-mass mergers, ringdown "echoes" are excited. The amplitude of such echoes decays slowly and could thus serve as a silver bullet for plasmas near charged black holes.</description>

      <title>Chemo-dynamical Evolution of Simulated Satellites for a Milky Way-like Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chemical abundances of Milky Way's satellites reflect their star formation histories (SFHs), yet, due to the difficulty of determining the ages of old stars, the SFHs of most satellites are poorly measured. Ongoing and upcoming surveys will obtain around ten times more medium-resolution spectra for stars in satellites than are currently available. To correctly extract SFHs from large samples of chemical abundances, the relationship between chemical abundances and SFHs needs to be clarified. Here, we perform a high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way-like galaxy with detailed models of star formation, supernova feedback, and metal diffusion. We quantify SFHs, metallicity distribution functions, and the $\alpha$-element (Mg, Ca, and Si) abundances in satellites of the host galaxy. We find that star formation in most simulated satellites is quenched before infalling to their host. Star formation episodes in simulated satellites are separated by a few hundred Myr owing to supernova feedback; each star formation event produces groups of stars with similar [$\alpha$/Fe] and [Fe/H]. We then perform a mock observation of the upcoming Subaru Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS) observations. We find that Subaru PFS will be able to detect distinct groups of stars in [$\alpha$/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] space, produced by episodic star formation. This result means that episodic SFHs can be estimated from the chemical abundances of $\gtrsim$ 1,000 stars determined with medium-resolution spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Feeding Hidden Monsters: a Super-Eddington accreting Black Hole ~1.5 Gyr after the Big Bang</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have revealed a surprisingly abundant population of faint, dusty active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at z~4-7. Together with the presence of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at z&gt;6, this raises questions about the formation and growth histories of early black holes. Current theories for the formation of seed black holes from the death of the first stars (i.e. light seeds) and/or the direct collapse of primordial gas clouds (i.e. heavy seeds) still lack observational confirmation. Here, we present LID-568, a low-mass (7.2e6Msun) black hole hosting powerful outflows that is observed in an extreme phase of rapid growth at z~4. This object is similar to other JWST-discovered faint AGN populations, but is bright in X-ray emission and accreting at more than 4000% of the limit at which radiation pressure exceeds the force of gravitational attraction of the black hole (i.e. super-Eddington accretion). Analysis of JWST NIRSpec/IFU data reveals spatially extended Ha emission with velocities of ~ -600 - -500 km/s relative to the central black hole, indicative of robust nuclear-driven outflows. LID-568 represents an elusive low-mass black hole experiencing super-Eddington accretion as invoked by models of early black hole formation. This discovery showcases a previously undiscovered key parameter space and offers crucial insights into rapid black hole growth mechanisms in the early universe.</description>

      <title>From Young Massive Clusters to Old Globular Clusters: Density Profile Evolution and IMBH Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The surface brightness profiles of globular clusters are conventionally described with the well-known King profile. However, observations of young massive clusters (YMCs) in the local Universe suggest that they are better fit by simple models with flat central cores and simple power-law densities in their outer regions (such as the Elson-Fall-Freeman, or EFF, profile). Depending on their initial central density, these YMCs may also facilitate large numbers of stellar collisions, potentially creating very massive stars that will directly collapse to intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). Using Monte Carlo $N$-body models of YMCs, we show that EFF-profile clusters transform to Wilson or King profiles through natural dynamical evolution, but that their final $W_0$ parameters do not strongly correlate to their initial concentrations. The most centrally-dense YMCs can produce runaway stellar mergers as massive as $4000\,M_{\odot}$ (the largest resolved mass in our simulations) which can collapse to produce IMBHs of similar masses. In doing so, these runaway collisions also deplete the clusters of their primordial massive stars, reducing the number of stellar-mass BHs by as much as $\sim$ 40\%. This depletion will accelerate the core collapse of clusters, suggesting that the process of IMBH formation itself may produce the high densities observed in some core-collapsed clusters.</description>

      <title>Detecting environmental effects in gravitational waves from binaries perturbed by periodic forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the gravitational wave (GW) emission of sources perturbed by periodic dynamical forces which do not cause secular evolution in the orbital elements. We construct a corresponding post-Newtonian waveform model and provide estimates for the detectability of the resulting GW phase perturbations, for both space-based and future ground-based detectors. We validate our results by performing a set of Bayesian parameter recovery experiments with post-Newtonian waveforms. We find that, in stark contrast to the more commonly studied secular dephasing, periodic phase perturbations do not suffer from degeneracies with any of the tested vacuum binary parameters. We discuss the applications of our findings to a range of possible astrophysical scenarios, finding that such periodic perturbations may be detectable for massive black hole binaries embedded in circum-binary discs, extreme mass-ratio inspirals in accretion discs, as well as stellar-mass compact objects perturbed by tidal fields. We argue that modelling conservative sub-orbital dynamics opens up a promising new avenue to detect environmental effects in binary sources of GWs that should be included in state-of-the-art waveform templates.</description>

      <title>Constraints on primordial black holes from LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O3 events</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBH) can efficiently form black hole binaries in the early universe. We update the resulting constraints on PBH abundance using data from the third observational run (O3) of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA. To capture a wide range of PBH scenarios, we consider a variety of mass functions, including critical collapse in the QCD epoch in the presence of non-Gaussianities. Applying hierarchical Bayesian analysis to a population binaries consisting of primordial and astrophysical black holes, we find that, in every scenario, the PBHs can make up at most $f_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 10^{-3}$ of dark matter in the mass range $1-200~M_\odot$. The shape and strength of the constraints are insensitive to the type of non-Gaussianities, the modifications to the mass function during the QCD epoch, or the modelling of the astrophysical PBH population.</description>

      <title>Binary Supermassive Black Holes Orbiting Dark Matter Solitons: From the Dual AGN in UGC4211 to NanoHertz Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17821v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore orbital implications of the Supermassive Black Hole (SMBH) binary in UGC4211 for the energy spectrum of stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB), measured with pulsar timing. The SMBH binary in UGC4211 has a projected separation of $\sim 230\,$pc and relative velocity of $\sim 150\,$km/s along the line of sight. It orbits with a disk of gas and stars, with a total mass $\sim 1.7 \times 10^9 M_\odot$ that is several times larger than the combined SMBHs plus the observed gas and stars. The unseen mass can be naturally explained by a soliton of wave dark matter present within the SMBH orbit. Such a scenario is encouraging as during galaxy merger, the two precursor galactic solitons are expected to combine to generate a new soliton and hence bind the two initial SMBHs efficiently. Generalizing this scenario to the cosmological population of SMBH binaries, we show the SGWB spectrum produced by late-stage inspiraling is modified preferentially at low frequency by the presence of soliton. Finally, we demonstrate that the NANOGrav and EPTA data can be well-fit in this scenario, favoring $\{m_a, f_a\} \sim \{10^{-21.7} {\rm eV}, 10^{15.5} {\rm GeV}\}$ and $\{10^{-20.5} {\rm eV}, 10^{16.8} {\rm GeV}\}$ respectively when the UGC4211 data and the constraints from dwarf galaxies are also combined.</description>

      <title>GRB 231115A: a nearby Magnetar Giant Flare or a cosmic Short Gamma-Ray Burst?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02848v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are two classes of gamma-ray transients with a duration shorter than 2 seconds. One consists of cosmic short Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) taking place in the deep universe via the neutron star mergers, and the other is the magnetar giant flares (GFs) with energies of $\sim 10^{44}-10^{46}$ erg from ``nearby" galaxies. Though the magnetar GFs and the short GRBs have rather similar temporal and spectral properties, their energies ($E_{\rm \gamma,iso}$) are different by quite a few orders of magnitude and hence can be distinguished supposing the host galaxies have been robustly identified. The newly observed GRB 231115A has been widely discussed as a new GF event for its high probability of being associated with M82. Here we conduct a detailed analysis of its prompt emission observed by Fermi-GBM, and compare the parameters with existing observations. The prompt gamma-ray radiation properties of GRB 231115A, if associated with M82, nicely follow the $E_{\rm p,z}-E_{\gamma,\rm iso}$ relation of the GFs, where $E_{\rm p,z}$ is the peak energy of the gamma-ray spectrum after the redshift ($z$) correction. To be a short GRB, the reshift needs to be $\sim 1$. Though such a chance is low, the available X-ray/GeV observation upper limits are not stringent enough to further rule out this possibility. We have also discussed the prospect of convincingly establishing the magnetar origin of GRB 231115A-like events in the future.</description>

      <title>Simulating Electromagnetic Cascades with Lorentz Invariance Violation</title>

Abstract: Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) is a phenomenon featuring in various quantum gravity models whereby Lorentz symmetry is broken at high energies, potentially impacting the behaviour of particles and their interactions. Here we investigate the phenomenology of LIV within the context of gamma-ray-induced electromagnetic cascades. We conduct detailed numerical simulations to explore the expected manifestations of LIV on gamma-ray fluxes, taking into account relevant effects such as pair production and inverse Compton scattering. Additionally, we consider processes forbidden in the Standard Model, namely vacuum Cherenkov emission and photon decay. Our analysis reveals that these modifications result in distinct characteristics within the measured particle fluxes at Earth, which have the potential to be observed in high-energy gamma-ray observations.</description>

      <title>Apparently ultra-long period radio sources from self-lensed pulsar-black hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pulsar-black hole (BH) close binary systems, which have not been found yet, are unique laboratories for testing theories of gravity and understanding the formation channels of gravitational-wave sources. We study the self-gravitational lensing effect in a pulsar-BH system on the pulsar's emission. Because this effect occurs once per orbital period for almost edge-on binaries, we find that it could generate apparently ultra-long period (minutes to hours) radio signals when the intrinsic pulsar signal is too weak to detect. Each of such lensed signals, or 'pulse', is composed of a number of amplified intrinsic pulsar pulses. We estimate that a radio telescope with a sensitivity of $10\,\rm mJy$ could detect $\sim$ a few systems that emit such signals in our galaxy. The model is applied to three recently found puzzling long-period radio sources: GLEAM-X J1627, PSR J0901-4046, and GPM J1839-10. To explain their observed signal durations and periods, the masses of their lensing components would be $\sim10^4\,\rm M_{\odot}$, $\sim4\,\rm M_{\odot}$ and $10^{3-6}\,\rm M_{\odot}$, respectively, with their binary coalescence times ranging from a few tens to thousands of years. However, the implied merger rates (as high as $\sim 10^{3-4}\,\rm Myr^{-1}$ per galaxy) and the large period decay rates ($&gt;10^{-8}\,\rm s\,s^{-1}$) tend to disfavour this self-lensing scenario for these three sources. Finally, for a binary containing a millisecond pulsar and a stellar-mass BH, the Shapiro delay effect would cause a $\geq10\%$ variation of the profile width for the sub-pulses in such lensed signals.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Primordial Black Hole Capture by Neutron Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A sub-solar mass primordial black hole (PBH) passing through a neutron star, can lose enough energy through interactions with the dense stellar medium to become gravitationally bound to the star. Once captured, the PBH would sink to the core of the neutron star, and completely consume it from the inside. In this paper, we improve previous energy-loss calculations by considering a realistic solution for the neutron star interior, and refine the treatment of the interaction dynamics and collapse likelihood. We then consider the effect of a sub-solar PBH population on neutron stars near the Galactic center. We find that it is not possible to explain the lack of observed pulsars near the galactic center through dynamical capture of PBHs, as the velocity dispersion is too high. We then show that future observations of old neutron stars close to Sgr A* could set stringent constraints on the PBHs abundance. These cannot however be extended in the currently unconstrained asteroid-mass range, since PBHs of smaller mass would lose less energy in their interaction with the neutron star and end up in orbits that are too loosely bound and likely to be disrupted by other stars in the Galactic center.</description>

      <title>Constraints on dark matter and astrophysics from tomographic $\gamma$-ray cross-correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14881v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the cross-correlation between maps of the unresolved $\gamma$-ray background constructed from the 12-year data release of the Fermi Large-Area Telescope, and the overdensity of galaxies in the redshift range $z\lesssim0.4$ as measured by the 2MASS Photometric Redshift survey and the WISE-SuperCOSMOS photometric survey. A signal is detected at the $8-10\sigma$ level, which we interpret in terms of both astrophysical $\gamma$-ray sources, and WIMP dark matter decay and annihilation. The sensitivity achieved allows us to characterise the energy and redshift dependence of the signal, and we show that the latter is incompatible with a pure dark matter origin. We thus use our measurement to place an upper bound on the WIMP decay rate and the annihilation cross-section, finding constraints that are competitive with those found in other analyses. Our analysis is based on the extraction of clean model-independent observables that can then be used to constrain arbitrary astrophysical and particle physics models. In this sense we produce measurements of the $\gamma$-ray emissivity as a function of redshift and rest-frame energy $\epsilon$, and of a quantity $F(\epsilon)$ encapsulating all WIMP parameters relevant for dark matter decay or annihilation. We make these measurements, together with a full account of their statistical uncertainties, publicly available.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Spacetime With Multipole Moments: The Minimal Size Conjecture, Black Hole Shadow, and Gravitational Wave Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11491v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explicitly construct the vacuum solution of Einstein's equations with prescribed multipole moments. By observing the behavior of the multipole spacetime metric at small distances, we conjecture that for a sufficiently large multipole moment, there is a minimal size below which no object in nature can support such a moment. The examples we have investigated suggest that such minimal size scales as $(M_n)^{1/(n+1)}$ (instead of $(M_n/M)^{1/n}$), where $M$ is the mass and $M_n$ is the $n$th order multipole moment. With the metric of the "multipole spacetime", we analyze the shape of black hole shadow for various multipole moments and discuss the prospects of constraining the moments from shadow observations. In addition, we discuss the shift of gravitational wave phase with respect to those of the Kerr spacetime, for a test particle moving around an object with this set of multipole moments. These phase shifts are required for the program of mapping out the spacetime multipole moments based on gravitational wave observations of extreme mass-ratio inspirals.</description>

      <title>On the minimal mass of thermal dark matter and the viability of millicharged particles affecting 21cm cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermal freeze-out offers an attractive explanation of the dark matter density free from fine-tuning of initial conditions. For dark matter with a mass below tens of MeV, photons, electrons, and neutrinos are the only available direct Standard Model annihilation products. Using a full three-sector abundance calculation, we determine the minimal mass of dark matter, allowing for an arbitrary branching into electrons/photons and neutrinos that is compatible with current cosmological observations. The analysis takes into account the heat transfer between the various sectors from annihilation and elastic scattering, representing the first fully self-consistent analysis that tracks the respective sectors' temperatures. We thereby provide accurate thermal annihilation cross sections, particularly for velocity-dependent cases, and deduce the sensitivity of current and upcoming CMB experiments to MeV thermal dark matter. In the latter context, we also establish the fine-tuned parameter region where a tiny admixture of neutrinos in the final states rules in MeV-scale $p$-wave annihilating DM into electrons. Finally, we show that a sub-% millicharged dark matter with an interaction strength that interferes with 21 cm cosmology is still allowed when freeze-out is supplemented with annihilation into neutrinos. For all cases considered, we provide concrete particle physics models and supplement our findings with a discussion of other relevant experimental results.</description>

      <title>Optimal Summary Statistics for X-ray Polarization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop two new highly efficient estimators to measure the polarization (Stokes parameters) in experiments that constrain the position angle of individual photons such as scattering and gas-pixel-detector polarimeters, and analyse in detail a previously proposed estimator. All three of these estimators are at least fifty percent more efficient on typical datasets than the standard estimator used in the field. We present analytic estimates of the variance of these estimators and numerical experiments to verify these estimates. Two of the three estimators can be calculated quickly and directly through summations over the measurements of individual photons.</description>
