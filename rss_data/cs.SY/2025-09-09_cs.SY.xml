      <title>Flight of Dynamic Targeting on the CogniSAT-6 Spacecraft</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic targeting (DT) is a spacecraft autonomy concept in which sensor data is acquired and rapidly analyzed and used to drive subsequent observation. We describe the low Earth orbit application of this approach in which lookahead imagery is analyzed to detect clouds, thermal anomalies, or land use cases to drive higher quality near nadir imaging. Use cases for such a capability include: cloud avoidance, storm hunting, search for planetary boundary layer events, plume study, and beyond. The DT concept requires a lookahead sensor or agility to use a primary sensor in such a mode, edge computing to analyze images rapidly onboard, and a primary followup sensor. Additionally, an inter-satellite or low latency communications link can be leveraged for cross platform tasking. We describe implementation in progress to fly DT in early 2025 on the CogniSAT-6 (Ubotica/Open Cosmos) spacecraft that launched in March 2024 on the SpaceX Transporter-10 launch.</description>

      <title>A Fully Analog Implementation of Model Predictive Control with Application to Buck Converters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach to design analog electronic circuits that implement Model Predictive Control (MPC) policies for plants described by affine models. The combination of state-of-the-art approaches to define reduced-complexity Explicit MPC (EMPC) is employed to realize an analog circuit characterized by a limited amount of low-latency and commercially available components. The practical feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach are demonstrated through its application in the design of an advanced controller for DC-DC Buck converters. We formally analyze the stability of the obtained system and conduct extensive numerical simulations to demonstrate that it is capable of achieving outstanding load disturbance rejection performance, outclassing standard approaches.</description>

      <title>State Estimation for Linear Systems with Non-Gaussian Measurement Noise via Dynamic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new recursive estimator for linear dynamical systems under Gaussian process noise and non-Gaussian measurement noise. Specifically, we develop an approximate maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator using dynamic programming and tools from convex analysis. Our approach does not rely on restrictive noise assumptions and employs a Bellman-like update instead of a Bayesian update. Our proposed estimator is computationally efficient, with only modest overhead compared to a standard Kalman filter. Simulations demonstrate that our estimator achieves lower root mean squared error (RMSE) than the Kalman filter and has comparable performance to state-of-the-art estimators, while requiring significantly less computational power.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Decision-Making in Population Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a hierarchical framework for population games, where individuals delegate decision-making to proxies that act within their own strategic interests. This framework extends classical population games, where individuals are assumed to make decisions directly, to capture various real-world scenarios involving multiple decision layers. We establish equilibrium properties and provide convergence results for the proposed hierarchical structure. Additionally, based on these results, we develop a systematic approach to analyze population games with general convex constraints, without requiring individuals to have full knowledge of the constraints as in existing methods. We present a navigation application with capacity constraints as a case study.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Single-Iteration Model Predictive Control for Wave Energy Converters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel real-time algorithm for controlling wave energy converters (WECs). We begin with the economic model predictive control (MPC) problem formulation and apply a novel, first-order optimization algorithm inspired by recently developed control-based algorithms for constrained optimization to define the controller dynamics according to the single-iteration MPC approach. We theoretically analyse the convergence of the employed algorithm and the computational complexity of the obtained controller. Results from simulations using a benchmark WEC system indicate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms standard MPC, thanks to the inherent ability to handle faster sampling rates.</description>

      <title>A Dynamic Programming Framework for Vehicular Task Offloading with Successive Action Improvement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, task offloading from vehicles with random velocities is optimized via a novel dynamic programming framework. Particularly, in a vehicular network with multiple vehicles and base stations (BSs), computing tasks of vehicles are offloaded via BSs to an edge server. Due to the random velocities, the exact locations of vehicles versus time, namely trajectories, cannot be determined in advance. Hence, instead of deterministic optimization, the cell association, uplink time, and throughput allocation of multiple vehicles during a period of task offloading are formulated as a finite-horizon Markov decision process. In order to derive a low-complexity solution algorithm, a two-time-scale framework is proposed. The scheduling period is divided into super slots, each super slot is further divided into a number of time slots. At the beginning of each super slot, we first obtain a reference scheduling scheme of cell association, uplink time and throughput allocation via deterministic optimization, yielding an approximation of the optimal value function. Within the super slot, the actual scheduling action of each time slot is determined by making improvement to the approximate value function according to the system state. Due to the successive improvement framework, a non-trivial average cost upper bound could be derived. In the simulation, the random trajectories of vehicles are generated from a high-fidelity traffic simulator. It is shown that the performance gain of the proposed scheduling framework over the baselines is significant.</description>

      <title>Certifying the Nonexistence of Feasible Path Between Power System Operating Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By providing the optimal operating point that satisfies both the power flow equations and engineering limits, the optimal power flow (OPF) problem is central to the operation of electric power systems. While extensive research efforts have focused on reliably computing high-quality OPF solutions, assessing the feasibility of transitioning between operating points remains challenging since the feasible spaces of OPF problems may consist of multiple disconnected components. It is not possible to transition between operating points in different disconnected components without violating OPF constraints. To identify such situations, this paper introduces an algorithm for certifying the infeasibility of transitioning between two operating points within an OPF feasible space. As an indication of potential disconnectedness, the algorithm first seeks an infeasible point on the line connecting a pair of feasible points. The algorithm then certifies disconnectedness by using convex relaxation and bound tightening techniques to show that all points on the plane that is normal to this line are infeasible. Using this algorithm, we provide the first certifications of disconnected feasible spaces for a variety of OPF test cases.</description>

      <title>Mutual Support by Sensor-Attacker Team for a Passive Target</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a pursuit game played between a team of a sensor and an attacker and a mobile target in the unbounded Euclidean plane. The target is faster than the sensor, but slower than the attacker. The sensor's objective is to keep the target within a sensing radius so that the attacker can capture the target, whereas the target seeks to escape by reaching beyond the sensing radius from the sensor without getting captured by the attacker. We assume that as long as the target is within the sensing radius from the sensor, the sensor-attacker team is able to measure the target's instantaneous position and velocity. We pose and solve this problem as a \emph{game of kind} in which the target uses an open-loop strategy (passive target). Aside from the novel formulation, our contributions are four-fold. First, we present optimal strategies for both the sensor and the attacker, according to their respective objectives. Specifically, we design a sensor strategy that maximizes the duration for which the target remains within its sensing range, while the attacker uses proportional navigation to capture the target. Second, we characterize the \emph{sensable region} -- the region in the plane in which the target remains within the sensing radius of the sensor during the game -- and show that capture is guaranteed {if and only if} the Apollonius circle between the attacker and the target is fully contained within this region. Third, we {derive a lower bound} on the target's speed below which capture is guaranteed, and an upper bound on the target speed above which there exists an escape strategy for the target, from an arbitrary initial orientation between the agents. Fourth, for a given initial orientation between the agents, we present a sharper upper bound on the target speed above which there exists an escape strategy for the target.</description>

      <title>DNN-based Digital Twin Framework of a DC-DC Buck Converter using Spider Monkey Optimization Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Component ageing is a critical concern in power electronic converter systems (PECSs). It directly impacts the reliability, performance, and operational lifespan of converters used across diverse applications, including electric vehicles (EVs), renewable energy systems (RESs) and industrial automation. Therefore, understanding and monitoring component ageing is crucial for developing robust converters and achieving long-term system reliability. This paper proposes a data-driven digital twin (DT) framework for DC-DC buck converters, integrating deep neural network (DNN) with the spider monkey optimization (SMO) algorithm to monitor and predict component degradation. Utilizing a low-power prototype testbed along with empirical and synthetic datasets, the SMO+DNN approach achieves the global optimum in 95% of trials, requires 33% fewer iterations, and results in 80% fewer parameter constraint violations compared to traditional methods. The DNN model achieves $R^2$ scores above 0.998 for all key degradation parameters and accurately forecasts time to failure ($t_{failure}$). In addition, SMO-tuned degradation profile improves the converter's performance by reducing voltage ripple by 20-25% and inductor current ripple by 15-20%.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Low-Altitude Airspace Security: MLLM-Enabled UAV Intent Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid development of the low-altitude economy emphasizes the critical need for effective perception and intent recognition of non-cooperative unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The advanced generative reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) present a promising approach in such tasks. In this paper, we focus on the combination of UAV intent recognition and the MLLMs. Specifically, we first present an MLLM-enabled UAV intent recognition architecture, where the multimodal perception system is utilized to obtain real-time payload and motion information of UAVs, generating structured input information, and MLLM outputs intent recognition results by incorporating environmental information, prior knowledge, and tactical preferences. Subsequently, we review the related work and demonstrate their progress within the proposed architecture. Then, a use case for low-altitude confrontation is conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of our architecture and offer valuable insights for practical system design. Finally, the future challenges are discussed, followed by corresponding strategic recommendations for further applications.</description>

      <title>First-Principle Modeling Framework of Boost Converter Dynamics for Precise Energy Conversions in Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boost converters are essential for modern electrification and intelligent technologies. However, conventional Boost converter models relying on steady-state assumptions fail to accurately predict transient behaviors during input voltage and load fluctuations, which cause significant output voltage overshoots and instability, resulting in failures of electrical systems, thereby restricting their use in space. This study introduces a first-principle modeling framework that derives precise dynamic equations for Boost converters by incorporating non-ideal component coupling. As compared to the most accurate existing Boost converter model, the proposed models reduce steady-state and dynamic-state errors between experimental and simulated output voltages by factors of 11.0 (from 20.9% to 1.9%) and 15.4 (from 77.1% to 5.0%) under input voltage variations, and by factors of 10.2 (from 15.3% to 1.5%) and 35.1 (from 42.1% to 1.2%) under load changes, respectively. Consequently, a reliable Boost converter is accordingly designed and on-orbit deployed for precise energy conversions.</description>

      <title>Unified Graph-Theoretic Modeling of Multi-Energy Flows in Distribution Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing complexity of energy systems due to sector coupling and decarbonization calls for unified modeling frameworks that capture the physical and structural interactions between electricity, gas, and heat networks. This paper presents a graph-based modeling approach for multi-energy systems, where each domain is represented as a layer in a multi-layer graph, and coupling technologies are modeled as inter-layer edges via a dedicated coupling layer. A steady-state solver based on a block-structured Newton-Raphson method is developed to jointly compute flows and state variables across all carriers. The proposed model is tested and validated on a realistic case study based on data from a German distribution network. The results demonstrate convergence, numerical accuracy, and consistent domain interaction, and demonstrate the method's applicability for system-wide analysis and its potential as a foundation for future optimizations in integrated energy systems.</description>

      <title>Parameter Robustness in Data-Driven Estimation of Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the robustness of system estimation to parametric perturbations in system dynamics and initial conditions. We define the problem of sensitivity-based parametric uncertainty quantification in dynamical system estimation. The main contribution of this paper is the development of a novel robustness metric for estimation of parametrized linear dynamical systems with and without control actions. For the computation of this metric, we delineate the uncertainty contributions arising from control actions, system dynamics, and initial conditions. Furthermore, to validate our theoretical findings, we establish connections between these new results and the existing literature on the robustness of model reduction. This work provides guidance for selecting estimation methods based on tolerable levels of parametric uncertainty and paves the way for new cost functions in data-driven estimation that reward sensitivity to a desired subset of parameters while penalizing others.</description>

      <title>Wireless Low-Latency Synchronization for Body-Worn Multi-Node Systems in Sports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biomechanical data acquisition in sports demands sub-millisecond synchronization across distributed body-worn sensor nodes. This study evaluates and characterizes the Enhanced ShockBurst (ESB) protocol from Nordic Semiconductor under controlled laboratory conditions for wireless, low-latency command broadcasting, enabling fast event updates in multi-node systems. Through systematic profiling of protocol parameters, including cyclic-redundancy-check modes, bitrate, transmission modes, and payload handling, we achieve a mean Device-to-Device (D2D) latency of 504.99 +- 96.89 us and a network-to-network core latency of 311.78 +- 96.90 us using a one-byte payload with retransmission optimization. This performance significantly outperforms Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), which is constrained by a 7.5 ms connection interval, by providing deterministic, sub-millisecond synchronization suitable for high-frequency (500 Hz to 1000 Hz) biosignals. These results position ESB as a viable solution for time-critical, multi-node wearable systems in sports, enabling precise event alignment and reliable high-speed data fusion for advanced athlete monitoring and feedback applications.</description>

      <title>Distributed Automatic Generation Control subject to Ramp-Rate-Limits: Anytime Feasibility and Uniform Network-Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers automatic generation control over an information-sharing network of communicating generators as a multi-agent system. The optimization solution is distributed among the agents based on information consensus algorithms, while addressing the generators' ramp-rate-limits (RRL). This is typically ignored in the existing linear/nonlinear optimization solutions but they exist in real-time power generation scenarios. Without addressing the RRL, the generators cannot follow the assigned rate of generating power by the optimization algorithm; therefore, the existing solutions may not necessarily converge to the exact optimal cost or may lose feasibility in practice. The proposed solution in this work addresses the ramp-rate-limit constraint along with the box constraint (limits on the generated powers) and the coupling-constraint (generation-demand balance) at all iteration times of the algorithm. The latter is referred to as the anytime feasibility and implies that at every termination point of the algorithm, the balance between the demand and generated power holds. To improve the convergence rate of the algorithm we further consider internal signum-based nonlinearity. We also show that our solution can tolerate communication link removal. This follows from the uniform-connectivity assumption on the communication network.</description>

      <title>Human-Hardware-in-the-Loop simulations for systemic resilience assessment in cyber-socio-technical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern industrial systems require updated approaches to safety management, as the tight interplay between cyber-physical, human, and organizational factors has driven their processes toward increasing complexity. In addition to dealing with known risks, managing system resilience acquires great value to address complex behaviors pragmatically. This manuscript starts from the System-Theoretic Accident Model and Processes (STAMP) as a modelling initiative for such complexity. The STAMP can be natively integrated with simulation-based approaches, which however fail to realistically represent human behaviors and their influence on the system performance. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a Human-Hardware-in-the-Loop (HHIL) modeling and simulation framework aimed at supporting a more realistic and comprehensive assessments of systemic resilience. The approach is tested on an experimental oil and gas plant experiencing cyber-attacks, where two personas of operators (experts and novices) work. This research provides a mean to quantitatively assess how variations in operator behavior impact the overall system performance, offering insights into how resilience should be understood and implemented in complex socio-technical systems at large.</description>

      <title>Edge Server Monitoring for Job Assignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a goal-oriented communication problem for edge server monitoring, where compute jobs arrive intermittently at dispatchers and must be immediately assigned to distributed edge servers. Due to competing workloads and the dynamic nature of the edge environment, server availability fluctuates over time. To maintain accurate estimates of server availability states, each dispatcher updates its belief using two mechanisms: (i) active queries over shared communication channels and (ii) feedback from past job executions. We formulate a query scheduling problem that maximizes the job success rate under limited communication resources for queries. This problem is modeled as a Restless Multi-Armed Bandit (RMAB) with multiple actions and addressed using a Net-Gain Maximization (NGM) scheduling algorithm, which selects servers to query based on their expected improvement in execution performance. Simulation results show that the proposed NGM Policy significantly outperforms baseline strategies, achieving up to a 30% gain over the Round-Robin Policy and up to a 107% gain over the Never-Query Policy.</description>

      <title>Steering Opinion through Dynamic Stackelberg Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper employs the Friedkin-Johnsen (FJ) model to describe the dynamics of opinion evolution within a social network. Under the FJ framework, the society is divided into two subgroups that include stubborn agents and regular agents. The opinions of stubborn agents are not influenced by regular agents, whereas the opinions of regular agents evolve based on the opinions of their neighboring agents. By defining the origin as the desired collective opinion of the society, the objective of the paper is to minimize deviations from this desired opinion. To achieve this, a Stackelberg game is established between the stubborn and regular subgroups, where the opinion adjustments of the stubborn agents and the openness variables of regular agents serve as the decision variables. The proposed solution approach integrates quadratic programming and dynamic programming to optimize these decision variables at each discrete time step using forward and backward propagation.</description>

      <title>Agentic DDQN-Based Scheduling for Licensed and Unlicensed Band Allocation in Sidelink Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an agentic artificial intelligence (AI)-driven double deep Q-network (DDQN) scheduling framework for licensed and unlicensed band allocation in New Radio (NR) sidelink (SL) networks. SL must share licensed spectrum with cellular communications (CC) and unlicensed bands with Wi-Fi, posing significant challenges for coexistence. Unlike prior rule-based or threshold-based methods, the proposed agentic scheduler autonomously perceives queueing dynamics, channel conditions, and coexistence states, and adapts its policy to maintain quality-of-service (QoS). Simulation results show that our framework reduces the blocking rate by up to 87.5% compared to threshold-based scheduling under limited licensed bandwidth. These findings demonstrate the potential of Agentic AI to enable stable, QoS-aware, and adaptive scheduling for future NR SL systems.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement learning meets bioprocess control through behaviour cloning: Real-world deployment in an industrial photobioreactor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inherent complexity of living cells as production units creates major challenges for maintaining stable and optimal bioprocess conditions, especially in open Photobioreactors (PBRs) exposed to fluctuating environments. To address this, we propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL) control approach, combined with Behavior Cloning (BC), for pH regulation in open PBR systems. This represents, to the best of our knowledge, the first application of an RL-based control strategy to such a nonlinear and disturbance-prone bioprocess. Our method begins with an offline training stage in which the RL agent learns from trajectories generated by a nominal Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller, without direct interaction with the real system. This is followed by a daily online fine-tuning phase, enabling adaptation to evolving process dynamics and stronger rejection of fast, transient disturbances. This hybrid offline-online strategy allows deployment of an adaptive control policy capable of handling the inherent nonlinearities and external perturbations in open PBRs. Simulation studies highlight the advantages of our method: the Integral of Absolute Error (IAE) was reduced by 8% compared to PID control and by 5% relative to standard off-policy RL. Moreover, control effort decreased substantially-by 54% compared to PID and 7% compared to standard RL-an important factor for minimizing operational costs. Finally, an 8-day experimental validation under varying environmental conditions confirmed the robustness and reliability of the proposed approach. Overall, this work demonstrates the potential of RL-based methods for bioprocess control and paves the way for their broader application to other nonlinear, disturbance-prone systems.</description>

      <title>LocoMamba: Vision-Driven Locomotion via End-to-End Deep Reinforcement Learning with Mamba</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11849v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce LocoMamba, a vision-driven cross-modal DRL framework built on selective state-space models, specifically leveraging Mamba, that achieves near-linear-time sequence modeling, effectively captures long-range dependencies, and enables efficient training with longer sequences. First, we embed proprioceptive states with a multilayer perceptron and patchify depth images with a lightweight convolutional neural network, producing compact tokens that improve state representation. Second, stacked Mamba layers fuse these tokens via near-linear-time selective scanning, reducing latency and memory footprint, remaining robust to token length and image resolution, and providing an inductive bias that mitigates overfitting. Third, we train the policy end-to-end with Proximal Policy Optimization under terrain and appearance randomization and an obstacle-density curriculum, using a compact state-centric reward that balances progress, smoothness, and safety. We evaluate our method in challenging simulated environments with static and moving obstacles as well as uneven terrain. Compared with state-of-the-art baselines, our method achieves higher returns and success rates with fewer collisions, exhibits stronger generalization to unseen terrains and obstacle densities, and improves training efficiency by converging in fewer updates under the same compute budget.</description>

      <title>Learning to Walk in Costume: Adversarial Motion Priors for Aesthetically Constrained Humanoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based locomotion system for Cosmo, a custom-built humanoid robot designed for entertainment applications. Unlike traditional humanoids, entertainment robots present unique challenges due to aesthetic-driven design choices. Cosmo embodies these with a disproportionately large head (16% of total mass), limited sensing, and protective shells that considerably restrict movement. To address these challenges, we apply Adversarial Motion Priors (AMP) to enable the robot to learn natural-looking movements while maintaining physical stability. We develop tailored domain randomization techniques and specialized reward structures to ensure safe sim-to-real, protecting valuable hardware components during deployment. Our experiments demonstrate that AMP generates stable standing and walking behaviors despite Cosmo's extreme mass distribution and movement constraints. These results establish a promising direction for robots that balance aesthetic appeal with functional performance, suggesting that learning-based methods can effectively adapt to aesthetic-driven design constraints.</description>

      <title>Genesis: A Spiking Neuromorphic Accelerator With On-chip Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continual learning, the ability to acquire and transfer knowledge through a models lifetime, is critical for artificial agents that interact in real-world environments. Biological brains inherently demonstrate these capabilities while operating within limited energy and resource budgets. Achieving continual learning capability in artificial systems considerably increases memory and computational demands, and even more so when deploying on platforms with limited resources. In this work, Genesis, a spiking continual learning accelerator, is proposed to address this gap. The architecture supports neurally inspired mechanisms, such as activity-dependent metaplasticity, to alleviate catastrophic forgetting. It integrates low-precision continual learning parametersand employs a custom data movement strategy to accommodate the sparsely distributed spikes. Furthermore, the architecture features a memory mapping technique that places metaplasticity parameters and synaptic weights in a single address location for faster memory access. Results show that the mean classification accuracy for Genesis is 74.6% on a task-agnostic split-MNIST benchmark with power consumption of 17.08mW in a 65nm technology node.</description>

      <title>Smoothed Online Optimization for Target Tracking: Robust and Learning-Augmented Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Smoothed Online Optimization for Target Tracking (SOOTT) problem, a new framework that integrates three key objectives in online decision-making under uncertainty: (1) tracking cost for following a dynamically moving target, (2) adversarial perturbation cost for withstanding unpredictable disturbances, and (3) switching cost for penalizing abrupt changes in decisions. This formulation captures real-world scenarios such as elastic and inelastic workload scheduling in AI clusters, where operators must balance long-term service-level agreements (e.g., LLM training) against sudden demand spikes (e.g., real-time inference). We first present BEST, a robust algorithm with provable competitive guarantees for SOOTT. To enhance practical performance, we introduce CoRT, a learning-augmented variant that incorporates untrusted black-box predictions (e.g., from ML models) into its decision process. Our theoretical analysis shows that CoRT strictly improves over BEST when predictions are accurate, while maintaining robustness under arbitrary prediction errors. We validate our approach through a case study on workload scheduling, demonstrating that both algorithms effectively balance trajectory tracking, decision smoothness, and resilience to external disturbances.</description>

      <title>Hybrid A* Path Planning with Multi-Modal Motion Extension for Four-Wheel Steering Mobile Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Four-wheel independent steering (4WIS) systems provide mobile robots with a rich set of motion modes, such as Ackermann steering, lateral steering, and parallel movement, offering superior maneuverability in constrained environments. However, existing path planning methods generally assume a single kinematic model and thus fail to fully exploit the multi-modal capabilities of 4WIS platforms. To address this limitation, we propose an extended Hybrid A* framework that operates in a four-dimensional state space incorporating both spatial states and motion modes. Within this framework, we design multi-modal Reeds-Shepp curves tailored to the distinct kinematic constraints of each motion mode, develop an enhanced heuristic function that accounts for mode-switching costs, and introduce a terminal connection strategy with intelligent mode selection to ensure smooth transitions between different steering patterns. The proposed planner enables seamless integration of multiple motion modalities within a single path, significantly improving flexibility and adaptability in complex environments. Results demonstrate significantly improved planning performance for 4WIS robots in complex environments.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid TDMA/CSMA Protocol for Time-Sensitive Traffic in Robot Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in robotics has underscored the demand for real-time control in applications such as manufacturing, healthcare, and autonomous systems, where the timely delivery of mission-critical commands under heterogeneous robotic traffic is paramount for operational efficacy and safety. In these scenarios, mission-critical traffic follows a strict deadline-constrained communication pattern: commands must arrive within defined QoS deadlines, otherwise late arrivals can degrade performance or destabilize control loops.In this work, we demonstrate on a real-time SDR platform that CSMA, widely adopted in robotic communications,suffers severe degradation under high robot traffic loads, with contention-induced collisions and delays disrupting the on-time arrival of mission-critical packets. To address this problem, we propose an IEEE 802.11-compatible hybrid TDMA/CSMA protocol that combines TDMA's deterministic slot scheduling with CSMA's adaptability for heterogeneous robot traffic.The protocol achieves collision-free, low-latency mission-critical command delivery and IEEE 802.11 compatibility through the synergistic integration of sub-microsecond PTP-based slot synchronization-essential for establishing precise timing for TDMA, a three-session superframe with dynamic TDMA allocation for structured and adaptable traffic management,and beacon-NAV protection to preemptively secure these critical communication sessions from interference. Emulation experiments on real-time SDR testbed and Robot Operating System (ROS) simulation show that the proposed protocol reduces missed-deadline errors by 93% compared to the CSMA baseline. In high-speed robot path-tracking ROS simulations, the protocol lowers Root Mean Square (RMS) trajectory error by up to 90% compared with a CSMA baseline, all while maintaining throughput for non-critical traffic within +-2%.</description>

Abstract: Modern vehicles accumulate fragmented lifecycle records across OEMs, owners, and service centers that are difficult to verify and prone to fraud. We propose VehiclePassport, a GAIA-X-aligned digital passport anchored on blockchain with zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) for privacy-preserving verification. VehiclePassport immutably commits to manufacturing, telemetry, and service events while enabling selective disclosure via short-lived JWTs and Groth16 proofs. Our open-source reference stack anchors hashes on Polygon zkEVM at &lt;$0.02 per event, validates proofs in &lt;10 ms, and scales to millions of vehicles. This architecture eliminates paper-based KYC, ensures GDPR-compliant traceability, and establishes a trustless foundation for insurance, resale, and regulatory applications in global mobility data markets.</description>

      <title>Ignore Drift, Embrace Simplicity: Constrained Nonlinear Control through Driftless Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel technique to drive a nonlinear system to reach a target state under input constraints. The proposed controller consists only of piecewise constant inputs, generated from a simple linear driftless approximation to the original nonlinear system. First, we construct this approximation using only the effect of the control input at the initial state. Next, we partition the time horizon into successively shorter intervals and show that optimal controllers for the linear driftless system result in a bounded error from a specified target state in the nonlinear system. We also derive conditions under which the input constraint is guaranteed to be satisfied. On applying the optimal control inputs, we show that the error monotonically converges to zero as the intervals become successively shorter, thus achieving arbitrary closeness to the target state with time. Using simulation examples on classical nonlinear systems, we illustrate how the presented technique is used to reach a target state while still satisfying input constraints. In particular, we show that our method completes the task even when assumptions of the underlying theory are violated or when classical linearization-based methods may fail.</description>

Abstract: Operating an intelligent smart building automation system in 2025 is met with many challenges: hardware failures, vendor obsolescence, evolving security threats and more. None of these have been comprehensibly addressed by the industrial building nor home automation industries, limiting feasibility of operating large, truly smart automation deployments. This paper introduces KaOS, a distributed control platform for constructing robust and evolvable smart building automation systems using affordable, off-the-shelf IoT hardware. Supporting control applications and distributed system operations by leveraging containerisation and managed resource access, KaOS seeks to achieve flexibility, security, and fault tolerance without sacrificing cost-effectiveness. Initial evaluation confirms the practical feasibility of our approach, highlighting its potential to sustainably maintain and incrementally evolve building control functionalities over extended timeframes.</description>

Abstract: Rapid and accurate body weight estimation is critical in emergency medical care, as it directly influences treatment decisions, such as drug dosing, defibrillation energy selection, and fluid resuscitation. Traditional methods such as stand-on scales, length-based tapes, or transfer-based weighing scales are often impractical for immobilized patients, inaccurate, or labor-intensive and time-consuming. This paper introduces MelodyBedScale, a non-intrusive and rapid on-bed weight estimation system that leverages bed vibration induced by music. The core insight is that body weight affects the vibration transfer function of the bed-body system, which is captured using vibration sensors placed on opposite sides of the bed. First, we identify weight-sensitive frequency bands and compose clinically acceptable soft, natural music with high signal energy in these frequency bands. This music is then played through a speaker mounted on the bed to induce bed vibrations. Additionally, to efficiently capture the complex weight-vibration relationship with limited data and enhance generalizability to unseen individuals and weights, we theoretically analyze the weight-vibration relationship and integrate the results into the activation functions of the neural network for physics-informed weight regression. We evaluated MelodyBedScale on both wooden and steel beds across 11 participants, achieving a mean absolute error of up to 1.55 kg.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretic Bounds and Task-Centric Learning Complexity for Real-World Dynamic Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic nonlinear systems exhibit distortions arising from coupled static and dynamic effects. Their intertwined nature poses major challenges for data-driven modeling. This paper presents a theoretical framework grounded in structured decomposition, variance analysis, and task-centric complexity bounds.
  The framework employs a directional lower bound on interactions between measurable system components, extending orthogonality in inner product spaces to structurally asymmetric settings. This bound supports variance inequalities for decomposed systems. Key behavioral indicators are introduced along with a memory finiteness index. A rigorous power-based condition establishes a measurable link between finite memory in realizable systems and the First Law of Thermodynamics. This offers a more foundational perspective than classical bounds based on the Second Law.
  Building on this foundation, we formulate a `Behavioral Uncertainty Principle,' demonstrating that static and dynamic distortions cannot be minimized simultaneously. We identify that real-world systems seem to resist complete deterministic decomposition due to entangled static and dynamic effects. We also present two general-purpose theorems linking function variance to mean-squared Lipschitz continuity and learning complexity. This yields a model-agnostic, task-aware complexity metric, showing that lower-variance components are inherently easier to learn.
  These insights explain the empirical benefits of structured residual learning, including improved generalization, reduced parameter count, and lower training cost, as previously observed in power amplifier linearization experiments. The framework is broadly applicable and offers a scalable, theoretically grounded approach to modeling complex dynamic nonlinear systems.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Coverage Control Approach for Multiple Autonomous Off-road Vehicles in Dynamic Agricultural Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an adaptive coverage control method for a fleet of off-road and Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) operating in dynamic (time-varying) agricultural environments. Traditional coverage control approaches often assume static conditions, making them unsuitable for real-world farming scenarios where obstacles, such as moving machinery and uneven terrains, create continuous challenges. To address this, we propose a real-time path planning framework that integrates Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for obstacle detection and terrain assessment, allowing UGVs to dynamically adjust their coverage paths. The environment is modeled as a weighted directed graph, where the edge weights are continuously updated based on the UAV observations to reflect obstacle motion and terrain variations. The proposed approach incorporates Voronoi-based partitioning, adaptive edge weight assignment, and cost-based path optimization to enhance navigation efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving path planning, reducing traversal costs, and maintaining robust coverage in the presence of dynamic obstacles and muddy terrains.</description>

      <title>Safe Robust Predictive Control-based Motion Planning of Automated Surface Vessels in Inland Waterways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deploying self-navigating surface vessels in inland waterways offers a sustainable alternative to reduce road traffic congestion and emissions. However, navigating confined waterways presents unique challenges, including narrow channels, higher traffic density, and hydrodynamic disturbances. Existing methods for autonomous vessel navigation often lack the robustness or precision required for such environments. This paper presents a new motion planning approach for Automated Surface Vessels (ASVs) using Robust Model Predictive Control (RMPC) combined with Control Barrier Functions (CBFs). By incorporating channel borders and obstacles as safety constraints within the control design framework, the proposed method ensures both collision avoidance and robust navigation on complex waterways. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in safely guiding ASVs under realistic conditions, highlighting its improved safety and adaptability compared to the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Deep Reactive Policy: Learning Reactive Manipulator Motion Planning for Dynamic Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating collision-free motion in dynamic, partially observable environments is a fundamental challenge for robotic manipulators. Classical motion planners can compute globally optimal trajectories but require full environment knowledge and are typically too slow for dynamic scenes. Neural motion policies offer a promising alternative by operating in closed-loop directly on raw sensory inputs but often struggle to generalize in complex or dynamic settings. We propose Deep Reactive Policy (DRP), a visuo-motor neural motion policy designed for reactive motion generation in diverse dynamic environments, operating directly on point cloud sensory input. At its core is IMPACT, a transformer-based neural motion policy pretrained on 10 million generated expert trajectories across diverse simulation scenarios. We further improve IMPACT's static obstacle avoidance through iterative student-teacher finetuning. We additionally enhance the policy's dynamic obstacle avoidance at inference time using DCP-RMP, a locally reactive goal-proposal module. We evaluate DRP on challenging tasks featuring cluttered scenes, dynamic moving obstacles, and goal obstructions. DRP achieves strong generalization, outperforming prior classical and neural methods in success rate across both simulated and real-world settings.

      <title>Data-Driven Robust Optimization for Energy-Aware Safe Motion Planning of Electric Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12887v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we simultaneously address the problems of energy optimal and safe motion planning of electric vehicles (EVs) in a data-driven robust optimization framework. Safe maneuvers, especially in urban traffic, are characterized by frequent lateral motions, such as lane changes, overtakes and turning along curved roads. Motivated by our previous work which shows a 3-10 % increase in energy consumption due to lateral motion when an electric vehicle changes its lane once every kilometer while following standard drive cycles, we incorporate vehicle lateral dynamics in the modeling and control synthesis, which is in contrast with most prior works. In the context of safety, we leverage past data of obstacle motion to construct a future occupancy set with probabilistic guarantees, and formulate robust collision avoidance constraints with respect to such an occupancy set using convex programming duality. Consequently, we formulate a finite-horizon optimal control problem subject to robust collision avoidance constraints while penalizing resulting energy consumption, and solve it in a receding horizon fashion. Finally, we show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in reducing energy consumption and collision avoidance via numerical simulations involving curved roads and multiple obstacles. A detailed analysis of energy consumption along different components of EV motion highlights appreciable improvement under the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Near-Optimal Emission-Aware Online Ride Assignment Algorithm for Peak Demand Hours</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ridesharing has experienced significant global growth over the past decade and is becoming an integral component of modern transportation systems. However, despite their benefits, ridesharing platforms face fundamental inefficiencies that contribute to negative environmental impacts. A prominent source of such inefficiency is the deadhead miles. This issue becomes especially severe during high-demand periods, when the volume of ride requests exceeds the available driver supply, leading to suboptimal rider-to-driver assignments, longer deadhead trips, and increased emissions. Although limiting these unproductive miles can reduce emissions, doing so may increase passenger wait times due to limited driver availability, thereby degrading the overall service experience. In this paper, we introduce LARA, an online rider-to-driver assignment algorithm that dynamically adjusts the maximum allowable distance between rider and drivers and assigns ride requests accordingly. While LARA is applicable in general settings, it is particularly effective during peak demand periods, achieving reductions in both emissions and wait times. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that LARA achieves near-optimal performance in online environments, with respect to an optimal offline benchmark. Beside our theoretical analysis, our empirical evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that LARA achieves up to a 34% reduction in carbon emissions and up to a 50% decrease in rider wait times, compared to state-of-the-art baselines. While prior work has explored emission-aware ride assignment, LARA is, to our knowledge, the first algorithm to offer both rigorous theoretical guarantees and strong empirical performance.</description>

      <title>Vanishing Stacked-Residual PINN for State Reconstruction of Hyperbolic Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14222v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a more connected world, modeling multi-agent systems with hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) offers a compact, physics-consistent description of collective dynamics. However, classical control tools need adaptation for these complex systems. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) provide a powerful framework to fix this issue by inferring solutions to PDEs by embedding governing equations into the neural network. A major limitation of original PINNs is their inability to capture steep gradients and discontinuities in hyperbolic PDEs. To tackle this problem, we propose a stacked residual PINN method enhanced with a vanishing viscosity mechanism. Initially, a basic PINN with a small viscosity coefficient provides a stable, low-fidelity solution. Residual correction blocks with learnable scaling parameters then iteratively refine this solution, progressively decreasing the viscosity coefficient to transition from parabolic to hyperbolic PDEs. Applying this method to traffic state reconstruction improved results by an order of magnitude in relative $\mathcal{L}^2$ error, demonstrating its potential to accurately estimate solutions where original PINNs struggle with instability and low fidelity.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Distributionally Robust Control Based on Sinkhorn Ambiguity Sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the complexity of modern control systems increases, it becomes challenging to derive an accurate model of the uncertainty that affects their dynamics. Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) provides a powerful framework for decision-making under distributional uncertainty only using noise samples. However, while the resulting policies inherit strong probabilistic guarantees when the number of samples is sufficiently high, their performance may significantly degrade when only a few data are available. Inspired by recent results from the machine learning community, we introduce an entropic regularization to penalize deviations from a given reference distribution and study data-driven DR control over Sinkhorn ambiguity sets. We show that for finite-horizon control problems, the optimal DR linear policy can be computed via convex programming. By analyzing the relation between the ambiguity set defined in terms of Wasserstein and Sinkhorn discrepancies, we reveal that, as the regularization parameter increases, this optimal policy interpolates between the solution of the Wasserstein DR problem and that of the stochastic problem under the reference distribution. We validate our theoretical findings and the effectiveness of our approach when only scarce data are available on a numerical example.</description>

      <title>Community-Centric Multi-Criteria Assessment Framework for Energy Transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transition to low-carbon energy systems demands comprehensive technical, economic, environmental, and social evaluation tools. While numerous studies address specific aspects of energy transition, few provide an integrated framework to capture the full spectrum of impacts. This work developed a community-collaborative assessment framework that integrates intelligent energy devices with optimization-based coordination of energy assets. The proposed framework uses techno-economic, environmental, and social criteria to evaluate transition pathways. A detailed case study is performed for a remote community in Alaska to assess its applicability, where the feasibility of renewable energy transitions remains underexplored. Three distinct pathways, including heat pump and battery integration, resource coordination, and expanded community solar PV, are analyzed using a year-long dataset of demand, renewable energy, and transformer data. The analysis revealed that using heat pumps lowers the overall energy costs by 30% and carbon emissions by 28%. In addition, the share of the population spending more than 10% of their income on energy falls from 74% in the existing scenario to 40% with heat pump adoption, indicating significant affordability improvements. By combining a general, community-centric assessment framework with a data-driven case study, this work offers a practical tool for utilities, community stakeholders, and policymakers to work toward equitable and sustainable energy transitions.</description>

      <title>Gaussian behaviors: representations and data-driven control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a modeling framework for stochastic systems, termed Gaussian behaviors, that describes finite-length trajectories of a system as a Gaussian process. The proposed model naturally quantifies the uncertainty in the trajectories, yet it is simple enough to allow for tractable formulations. We relate the proposed model to existing descriptions of dynamical systems including deterministic and stochastic behaviors, and linear time-invariant (LTI) state-space models with Gaussian noise. Gaussian behaviors can be estimated directly from observed data as the empirical sample covariance. The distribution of future outputs conditioned on inputs and past outputs provides a predictive model that can be incorporated in predictive control frameworks. We show that subspace predictive control is a certainty-equivalence control formulation with the estimated Gaussian behavior. Furthermore, the regularized data-enabled predictive control (DeePC) method is shown to be a distributionally optimistic formulation that optimistically accounts for uncertainty in the Gaussian behavior. To mitigate the excessive optimism of DeePC, we propose a novel distributionally robust control formulation, and provide a convex reformulation allowing for efficient implementation.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we investigate identifiability and maximum likelihood estimation for direct system identification of networks of dynamical systems. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for network identifiability in terms of Gr\"obner bases. We show that the maximum likelihood approach is both consistent and efficient, which is in contrast to existing prediction error approaches. Moreover, our approach has wider applicability, i.e., it is applicable whenever network identifiability holds. Finally, we show that we can formulate the maximum likelihood problem without the use of a predictor, which is the key to numerically being able to solve it efficiently.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Z Transform Laplace Inversion: To Correct flaws in Signal and System Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper revisits the classical formulation of the Z-transform and its relationship to the inverse Laplace transform (L-1), originally developed by Ragazzini in sampled-data theory. It identifies a longstanding mathematical oversight in standard derivations, which typically neglect the contribution from the infinite arc in the complex plane during inverse Laplace evaluation. This omission leads to inconsistencies, especially at discontinuities such as t = 0. By incorporating the full Bromwich contour, including all boundary contributions, we restore internal consistency between L-1 and the Z-transform, aligning the corrected L-1 with results from Discrete-Time Fourier Transform (DTFT) aliasing theory. Consequently, this necessitates a structural revision of the Z-transform, inverse Laplace transform, and the behavior of the Heaviside step function at discontinuities, providing a more accurate foundation for modeling and analysis of sampled-data systems.</description>

      <title>Robust Bandwidth Estimation for Real-Time Communication with Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05785v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate bandwidth estimation (BWE) is critical for real-time communication (RTC) systems. Traditional heuristic approaches offer limited adaptability under dynamic networks, while online reinforcement learning (RL) suffers from high exploration costs and potential service disruptions. Offline RL, which leverages high-quality data collected from real-world environments, offers a promising alternative. However, challenges such as out-of-distribution (OOD) actions, policy extraction from behaviorally diverse datasets, and reliable deployment in production systems remain unsolved. We propose RBWE, a robust bandwidth estimation framework based on offline RL that integrates Q-ensemble (an ensemble of Q-functions) with a Gaussian mixture policy to mitigate OOD risks and enhance policy learning. A fallback mechanism ensures deployment stability by switching to heuristic methods under high uncertainty. Experimental results show that RBWE reduces overestimation errors by 18% and improves the 10th percentile Quality of Experience (QoE) by 18.6%, demonstrating its practical effectiveness in real-world RTC applications. The implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/jiu2021/RBWE_offline.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17325v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern power systems face new operational hurdles due to the increasing adoption of inverter-coupled distributed energy resources, which impact system stability and control. Central to these challenges is the dynamic nature of grid impedance. To address this, a novel real-time estimation algorithm based on the Discrete Fourier Transform is proposed. This algorithm is embedded within an Advanced Angle Estimation Kalman Filter framework that employs a Linear Quadratic Regulator for current control (AAEKF-LQR). The impedance data directly informs and refines the controller's phase angle estimation. Simulation analyses demonstrate robust collaboration between the estimator and controller, sustaining system stability under weak grid conditions. The technique proves capable of delivering swift and accurate impedance updates during grid variations, which is crucial for maintaining stable inverter operation</description>

      <title>Carbon Emission Flow Tracing: Fast Algorithm and California Grid Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Power systems decarbonization are at the focal point of the clean energy transition. While system operators and utility companies increasingly publicize system-level carbon emission information, it remains unclear how emissions from individual generators are transported through the grid and how they impact electricity users at specific locations. This paper presents a novel and computationally efficient approach for exact quantification of nodal average and marginal carbon emission rates, applicable to both AC and DC optimal power flow problems. The approach leverages graph-based topological sorting and directed cycle removal techniques, applied to directed graphs formed by generation dispatch and optimal power flow solutions. Our proposed algorithm efficiently identifies each generator's contribution to each node, capturing how emissions are spatially distributed under varying system conditions. To validate its effectiveness and reveal locational and temporal emission patterns in the real world, we simulate the 8,870-bus realistic California grid using actual CAISO data and the CATS model. Based on year long hourly data on nodal loads and renewable generation, obtained or estimated from CAISO public data, our method accurately estimates power flow conditions, generation mixes, and systemwide emissions, and delivers fine grained spatiotemporal emission analysis for every California county. Both our algorithm and the California study are open-sourced, providing a foundation for future research on grid emissions, planning, operations, and energy policy.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Fundamental Trade-Off Between Age of Information and Throughput in Unreliable Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper characterizes the fundamental trade-off between throughput and Age of Information (AoI) in wireless networks where multiple devices transmit status updates to a central base station over unreliable channels. To address the complexity introduced by stochastic transmission successes, we propose the throughput-AoI capacity region, which defines all feasible throughput-AoI pairs achievable under any scheduling policy. Using a second-order approximation that incorporates both mean and temporal variance, we derive an outer bound and a tight inner bound for the throughput-AoI capacity region. Furthermore, we propose a simple and low complexity scheduling policy and prove that it achieves every interior point within the tight inner bound. This establishes a systematic and theoretically grounded framework for the joint optimization of throughput and information freshness in practical wireless communication scenarios.
  To validate our theoretical framework and demonstrate the utility of the throughput-AoI capacity region, extensive simulations are implemented. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed policy significantly outperforms conventional methods across various practical network optimization scenarios. The findings highlight our approach's effectiveness in optimizing both throughput and AoI, underscoring its applicability and robustness in practical wireless networks.</description>

      <title>On the Effect of Sampling-Time Jitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This brief, aimed at practitioners, offers an analysis of the effect of sampling-time jitter, i. e., the error produced by execution-time inaccuracies. We propose reinterpreting jitter-afflicted linear time-invariant systems through equivalent jitter-free analogs. By constructing a perceived system that absorbs the effects of timing perturbations into its dynamics, we find an affine scaling of jitter. We examine both measurement and implementation scenarios, demonstrating that the presence of jitter effectively scales the system matrices. Moreover, we observe that, in the Laplace domain, jitter can be interpreted as a frequency scaling.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Robust Ageing-Aware Control of Li-ion Battery Systems with Data-Driven Formal Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rechargeable lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries are a ubiquitous element of modern technology. In the last decades, the production and design of such batteries and their adjacent embedded charging and safety protocols, denoted by Battery Management Systems (BMS), has taken central stage. A fundamental challenge to be addressed is the trade-off between the speed of charging and the ageing behavior, resulting in the loss of capacity in the battery cell. We rely on a high-fidelity physics-based battery model and propose an approach to data-driven charging and safety protocol design. Following a Counterexample-Guided Inductive Synthesis scheme, we combine Reinforcement Learning (RL) with recent developments in data-driven formal methods to obtain a hybrid control strategy: RL is used to synthesise the individual controllers, and a data-driven abstraction guides their partitioning into a switched structure, depending on the initial output measurements of the battery. The resulting discrete selection among RL-based controllers, coupled with the continuous battery dynamics, realises a hybrid system. When a design meets the desired criteria, the abstraction provides probabilistic guarantees on the closed-loop performance of the cell.</description>

      <title>Categorical semantics of compositional reinforcement learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.13687v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compositional knowledge representations in reinforcement learning (RL) facilitate modular, interpretable, and safe task specifications. However, generating compositional models requires the characterization of minimal assumptions for the robustness of the compositionality feature, especially in the case of functional decompositions. Using a categorical point of view, we develop a knowledge representation framework for a compositional theory of RL. Our approach relies on the theoretical study of the category MDP, whose objects are Markov decision processes (MDPs) acting as models of tasks. The categorical semantics models the compositionality of tasks through the application of pushout operations akin to combining puzzle pieces. As a practical application of these pushout operations, we introduce zig-zag diagrams that rely on the compositional guarantees engendered by the category MDP. We further prove that properties of the category MDP unify concepts, such as enforcing safety requirements and exploiting symmetries, generalizing previous abstraction theories for RL.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15724v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore a class of stochastic multiplayer games where each player in the game aims to optimize its objective under uncertainty and adheres to some expectation constraints. The study employs an offline learning paradigm, leveraging a pre-existing dataset containing auxiliary features. While prior research in deterministic and stochastic multiplayer games primarily explored vector-valued decisions, this work departs by considering function-valued decisions that incorporate auxiliary features as input. We leverage the law of large deviations and degree theory to establish the almost sure convergence of the offline learning solution to the true solution as the number of data samples increases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16376v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the distributed broadcast problem within the context of network communications, a critical challenge in decentralized information dissemination. We put forth a novel hypergraph-based approach to address this issue, focusing on minimizing the number of broadcasts to ensure comprehensive data sharing among all network users. The key contributions of this work include the establishment of a general lower bound for the problem using the min-cut capacity of hypergraphs, and a distributed broadcast for quasi-trees (DBQT) algorithm tailored for the unique structure of quasi-trees, which is proven to be optimal. This paper advances both network communication strategies and hypergraph theory, with implications for a wide range of real-world applications, from vehicular and sensor networks to distributed storage systems.</description>

      <title>Linearly Controlled Language Generation with Performative Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing prevalence of Large Language Models (LMs) in critical applications highlights the need for controlled language generation strategies that are not only computationally efficient but that also enjoy performance guarantees. To achieve this, we use a common model of concept semantics as linearly represented in an LM's latent space. In particular, we take the view that natural language generation traces a trajectory in this continuous semantic space, realized by the language model's hidden activations. This view permits a control-theoretic treatment of text generation in latent space, in which we propose a lightweight, gradient-free intervention that dynamically steers trajectories away from regions corresponding to undesired meanings. In particular, we propose to directly intervene the activations of the token that is being generated in embedding space in an online fashion. Crucially, we do not simply steer activations towards a desirable region. Instead, our method relies on classical techniques from control theory to precisely control activations in a context-dependent way, and guarantees that they are brought into a specific pre-defined region of embedding space that corresponds to allowed semantics. Our intervention is computed in closed-form according to an optimal controller formulation, minimally impacting generation time. This control of the activations in embedding space allows for fine-grained steering of attributes of the generated sequence. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on different objectives-- toxicity avoidance and sentiment control-- while maintaining text quality.</description>

      <title>"Iridescent" Reflective Tags to Enable Radar-based Orientation Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate orientation estimation of objects can aid in scene understanding in many applications. In this paper, we consider use cases where passive tags could be deployed to assist radar systems in estimating object orientation. Towards that end, we propose the concept of passive iridescent reflective tags that selectively reflect different wavelengths in different directions. We propose a conceptual tag design based on leaky-wave antennas. We develop a framework for signal modeling and orientation estimation with a multi-tone radar. We analyze the impact of imperfect tag location information, revealing that it minimally impacts orientation estimation accuracy. To reduce estimator complexity, we propose a radiation pointing angle-based estimator with near-optimal performance. We derive its feasible orientation estimation region and show that it depends mainly on the system bandwidth. Monte Carlo simulations validate our analytical results while evincing that the low-complexity estimator achieves near-optimal accuracy and that its feasible orientation estimation region closely matches that of the other estimators. Finally, we show that the optimal number of tones increases with the sensing time under a power budget constraint, multipath effects may be negligible, signal-to-noise ratio gains rise with the number of tones, and many radar antennas can hurt estimation performance when the signal contains very few tones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous racing demands safe control of vehicles at their physical limits for extended periods of time, providing insights into advanced vehicle safety systems which increasingly rely on intervention provided by vehicle autonomy. Participation in this field carries with it a high barrier to entry. Physical platforms and their associated sensor suites require large capital outlays before any demonstrable progress can be made. Simulators allow researches to develop soft autonomous systems without purchasing a platform. However, currently available simulators lack visual and dynamic fidelity, can still be expensive to buy, lack customisation, and are difficult to use. AARK provides three packages, ACI, ACDG, and ACMPC. These packages enable research into autonomous control systems in the demanding environment of racing to bring more people into the field and improve reproducibility: ACI provides researchers with a computer vision-friendly interface to Assetto Corsa for convenient comparison and evaluation of autonomous control solutions; ACDG enables generation of depth, normal and semantic segmentation data for training computer vision models to use in perception systems; and ACMPC gives newcomers to the field a modular full-stack autonomous control solution, capable of controlling vehicles to build from. AARK aims to unify and democratise research into a field critical to providing safer roads and trusted autonomous systems.</description>

      <title>Learning Load Balancing with GNN in MPTCP-Enabled Heterogeneous Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17118v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hybrid light fidelity (LiFi) and wireless fidelity (WiFi) networks are a promising paradigm of heterogeneous network (HetNet), attributed to the complementary physical properties of optical spectra and radio frequency. However, the current development of such HetNets is mostly bottlenecked by the existing transmission control protocol (TCP), which restricts the user equipment (UE) to connecting one access point (AP) at a time. While the ongoing investigation on multipath TCP (MPTCP) can bring significant benefits, it complicates the network topology of HetNets, making the existing load balancing (LB) learning models less effective. Driven by this, we propose a graph neural network (GNN)-based model to tackle the LB problem for MPTCP-enabled HetNets, which results in a partial mesh topology. Such a topology can be modeled as a graph, with the channel state information and data rate requirement embedded as node features, while the LB solutions are deemed as edge labels. Compared to the conventional deep neural network (DNN), the proposed GNN-based model exhibits two key strengths: i) it can better interpret a complex network topology; and ii) it can handle various numbers of APs and UEs with a single trained model. Simulation results show that against the traditional optimisation method, the proposed learning model can achieve near-optimal throughput within a gap of 11.5%, while reducing the inference time by 4 orders of magnitude. In contrast to the DNN model, the new method can improve the network throughput by up to 21.7%, at a similar inference time level.</description>

      <title>Neural Port-Hamiltonian Differential Algebraic Equations for Compositional Learning of Electrical Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11215v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop compositional learning algorithms for coupled dynamical systems, with a particular focus on electrical networks. While deep learning has proven effective at modeling complex relationships from data, compositional couplings between system components typically introduce algebraic constraints on state variables, posing challenges to many existing data-driven approaches to modeling dynamical systems. Towards developing deep learning models for constrained dynamical systems, we introduce neural port-Hamiltonian differential algebraic equations (N-PHDAEs), which use neural networks to parameterize unknown terms in both the differential and algebraic components of a port-Hamiltonian DAE. To train these models, we propose an algorithm that uses automatic differentiation to perform index reduction, automatically transforming the neural DAE into an equivalent system of neural ordinary differential equations (N-ODEs), for which established model inference and backpropagation methods exist. Experiments simulating the dynamics of nonlinear circuits exemplify the benefits of our approach: the proposed N-PHDAE model achieves an order of magnitude improvement in prediction accuracy and constraint satisfaction when compared to a baseline N-ODE over long prediction time horizons. We also validate the compositional capabilities of our approach through experiments on a simulated DC microgrid: we train individual N-PHDAE models for separate grid components, before coupling them to accurately predict the behavior of larger-scale networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the robustness of optimally controlled evolution equations with respect to spatially localized perturbations. We prove that if the involved operators are domain-uniformly stabilizable and detectable, then these localized perturbations only have a local effect on the optimal solution. We characterize this domain-uniform stabilizability and detectability for the transport equation with constant transport velocity, showing that even for unitary semigroups, optimality implies exponential damping. We extend this result to the case of a space-dependent transport velocity. Finally we leverage the results for the transport equation to characterize domain-uniform stabilizability of the wave equation. Numerical examples in one space dimension complement the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Multistage Optimization Structure in Proximal Solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an efficient structure-exploiting algorithm for multistage optimization problems. The proposed method extends existing approaches by supporting full coupling between stages and global decision variables in the cost, as well as equality and inequality constraints. The algorithm is implemented as a new backend in the PIQP solver and leverages a specialized block-tri-diagonal-arrow Cholesky factorization within a proximal interior-point framework to handle the underlying problem structure efficiently. The implementation features automatic structure detection and seamless integration with existing interfaces. Numerical experiments demonstrate significant performance improvements, achieving up to 13x speed-up compared to a generic sparse backend and matching/exceeding the performance of the state-of-the-art specialized solver HPIPM. The solver is particularly effective for applications such as model predictive control, robust scenario optimization, and periodic optimization problems.</description>

Abstract: This research provides a theoretical foundation for modeling and real-time estimation of both the pose and inertial parameters of a free-floating multi-link system with link thrusters, which are essential for safe and effective controller design and performance. First, we adapt a planar nonlinear multi-link snake robot model to represent a planar chain of bioinspired salp robots by removing joint actuators, introducing link thrusters, and allowing for non-uniform link lengths, masses, and moments of inertia. Second, we conduct a nonlinear observability analysis of the multi-link system with link thrusters, proving that the link angles, angular velocities, masses, and moments of inertia are locally observable when equipped with inertial measurement units and operating under specific thruster conditions. The analytical results are demonstrated in simulation with a three-link system.</description>

      <title>Robust Feedback Optimization with Model Uncertainty: A Regularization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Feedback optimization optimizes the steady state of a dynamical system by implementing optimization iterations in closed loop with the plant. It relies on online measurements and limited model information, namely, the input-output sensitivity. In practice, various issues including inaccurate modeling, lack of observation, or changing conditions can lead to sensitivity mismatches, causing closed-loop sub-optimality or even instability. To handle such uncertainties, we pursue robust feedback optimization, where we optimize the closed-loop performance against all possible sensitivities lying in specific uncertainty sets. We provide tractable reformulations for the corresponding min-max problems via regularizations and characterize the online closed-loop performance through the tracking error in case of time-varying optimal solutions. Simulations on a distribution grid illustrate the effectiveness of our robust feedback optimization controller in addressing sensitivity mismatches in a non-stationary environment.</description>

      <title>The Ground Cost for Optimal Transport of Angular Velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the optimal transport problem over angular velocity dynamics given by the controlled Euler equation. The solution of this problem enables stochastic guidance of spin states of a rigid body (e.g., spacecraft) over a hard deadline constraint by transferring a given initial state statistics to a desired terminal state statistics. This is an instance of generalized optimal transport over a nonlinear dynamical system. While prior work has reported existence-uniqueness and numerical solution of this dynamical optimal transport problem, here we present structural results about the equivalent Kantorovich a.k.a. optimal coupling formulation. Specifically, we focus on deriving the ground cost for the associated Kantorovich optimal coupling formulation. The ground cost is equal to the cost of transporting unit amount of mass from a specific realization of the initial or source joint probability measure to a realization of the terminal or target joint probability measure, and determines the Kantorovich formulation. Finding the ground cost leads to solving a structured deterministic nonlinear optimal control problem, which is shown to be amenable to an analysis technique pioneered by Athans et al. We show that such techniques have broader applicability in determining the ground cost (thus Kantorovich formulation) for a class of generalized optimal mass transport problems involving nonlinear dynamics with translated norm-invariant drift.</description>

      <title>Stability of Polling Systems for a Large Class of Markovian Switching Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a polling system with two queues, where a single server is attending the queues in a cyclic order and requires non-zero switching times to switch between the queues. Our aim is to identify a fairly general and comprehensive class of Markovian switching policies that renders the system stable. Potentially a class of policies that can cover the Pareto frontier related to individual-queue-centric performance measures like the stationary expected number of waiting customers in each queue; for instance, such a class of policies is identified recently for a polling system near the fluid regime (with large arrival and departure rates), and we aim to include that class. We also aim to include a second class that facilitates switching between the queues at the instance the occupancy in the opposite queue crosses a threshold and when that in the visiting queue is below a threshold (this inclusion facilitates design of `robust' polling systems). Towards this, we consider a class of two-phase switching policies, which includes the above mentioned classes. In the maximum generality, our policies can be represented by eight parameters, while two parameters are sufficient to represent the aforementioned classes. We provide simple conditions to identify the sub-class of switching policies that ensure system stability. By numerically tuning the parameters of the proposed class, we illustrate that the proposed class can cover the Pareto frontier for the stationary expected number of customers in the two queues.</description>

      <title>ComplexVCoder: An LLM-Driven Framework for Systematic Generation of Complex Verilog Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances have demonstrated the promising capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in generating register-transfer level (RTL) code, such as Verilog. However, existing LLM-based frameworks still face significant challenges in accurately handling the complexity of real-world RTL designs, particularly those that are large-scale and involve multi-level module instantiations. To address this issue, we present ComplexVCoder, an open-source LLM-driven framework that enhances both the generation quality and efficiency of complex Verilog code. Specifically, we introduce a two-stage generation mechanism, which leverages an intermediate representation to enable a more accurate and structured transition from natural language descriptions to intricate Verilog designs. In addition, we introduce a rule-based alignment method and a domain-specific retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to further improve the correctness of the synthesized code by incorporating relevant design knowledge during generation. To evaluate our approach, we construct a comprehensive dataset comprising 55 complex Verilog designs derived from real-world implementations. We also release an open-source benchmark suite for systematically assessing the quality of auto-generated RTL code together with the ComplexVCoder framework. Experimental results show that ComplexVCoder outperforms SOTA frameworks such as CodeV and RTLCoder by 14.6% and 22.2%, respectively, in terms of function correctness on complex Verilog benchmarks. Furthermore, ComplexVcoder achieves comparable generation performances in terms of functionality correctness using a lightweight 32B model (Qwen2.5), rivaling larger-scale models such as GPT-3.5 and DeepSeek-V3.</description>

      <title>Identification and Optimal Nonlinear Control of Turbojet Engine Using Koopman Eigenfunction Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10438v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gas turbine engines are complex and highly nonlinear dynamical systems. Deriving their physics-based models can be challenging because it requires performance characteristics that are not always available, often leading to many simplifying assumptions. This paper discusses the limitations of conventional experimental methods used to derive component-level and locally linear parameter-varying models, and addresses these issues by employing identification techniques based on data collected from standard engine operation under closed-loop control. The rotor dynamics are estimated using the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics. Subsequently, the autonomous part of the dynamics is mapped into an optimally constructed Koopman eigenfunction space. This process involves eigenvalue optimization using metaheuristic algorithms and temporal projection, followed by gradient-based eigenfunction identification. The resulting Koopman model is validated against an in-house reference component-level model. A globally optimal nonlinear feedback controller and a Kalman estimator are then designed within the eigenfunction space and compared to traditional and gain-scheduled proportional-integral controllers, as well as a proposed internal model control approach. The eigenmode structure enables targeting individual modes during optimization, leading to improved performance tuning. Results demonstrate that the Koopman-based controller surpasses other benchmark controllers in both reference tracking and disturbance rejection under sea-level and varying flight conditions, due to its global nature.</description>

      <title>Direct Pseudospectral Optimal Control by Orthogonal Polynomial Integral Collocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper details a methodology to transcribe an optimal control problem into a nonlinear program for generation of the trajectories that optimize a given functional by approximating only the highest order derivatives of a given system's dynamics. The underlying method uses orthogonal polynomial integral collocation by which successive integrals are taken to approximate all lower order states. Hence, one set of polynomial coefficients can represent an entire coordinate's degree of freedom. Specifically, Chebyshev polynomials of the first and second kind and Legendre polynomials are used over their associated common interpolating grids derived from the bases' roots and extrema. Simple example problems compare different polynomial bases' performance to analytical solutions. The planar circular orbit raising problem is used to verify the method with solutions obtained by other pseudospectral methods in literature. Finally, a rocket landing flip maneuver problem is solved to demonstrate the ability to solve complex problems with multiple states and control variables with constraints. Simulations establish this method's performance, and reveal that the polynomial/node choice for a given problem notably affects the performance.</description>

      <title>Bipedal Balance Control with Whole-body Musculoskeletal Standing and Falling Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Balance control is important for human and bipedal robotic systems. While dynamic balance during locomotion has received considerable attention, quantitative understanding of static balance and falling remains limited. This work presents a hierarchical control pipeline for simulating human balance via a comprehensive whole-body musculoskeletal system. We identified spatiotemporal dynamics of balancing during stable standing, revealed the impact of muscle injury on balancing behavior, and generated fall contact patterns that aligned with clinical data. Furthermore, our simulated hip exoskeleton assistance demonstrated improvement in balance maintenance and reduced muscle effort under perturbation. This work offers unique muscle-level insights into human balance dynamics that are challenging to capture experimentally. It could provide a foundation for developing targeted interventions for individuals with balance impairments and support the advancement of humanoid robotic systems.</description>

      <title>Ontology Neural Network and ORTSF: A Framework for Topological Reasoning and Delay-Robust Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19277v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advancement of autonomous robotic systems has led to impressive capabilities in perception, localization, mapping, and control. Yet, a fundamental gap remains: existing frameworks excel at geometric reasoning and dynamic stability but fall short in representing and preserving relational semantics, contextual reasoning, and cognitive transparency essential for collaboration in dynamic, human-centric environments. This paper introduces a unified architecture comprising the Ontology Neural Network (ONN) and the Ontological Real-Time Semantic Fabric (ORTSF) to address this gap. The ONN formalizes relational semantic reasoning as a dynamic topological process. By embedding Forman-Ricci curvature, persistent homology, and semantic tensor structures within a unified loss formulation, ONN ensures that relational integrity and topological coherence are preserved as scenes evolve over time. The ORTSF transforms reasoning traces into actionable control commands while compensating for system delays. It integrates predictive and delay-aware operators that ensure phase margin preservation and continuity of control signals, even under significant latency conditions. Empirical studies demonstrate the ONN + ORTSF framework's ability to unify semantic cognition and robust control, providing a mathematically principled and practically viable solution for cognitive robotics.</description>

      <title>QuadKAN: KAN-Enhanced Quadruped Motion Control via End-to-End Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address vision-guided quadruped motion control with reinforcement learning (RL) and highlight the necessity of combining proprioception with vision for robust control. We propose QuadKAN, a spline-parameterized cross-modal policy instantiated with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). The framework incorporates a spline encoder for proprioception and a spline fusion head for proprioception-vision inputs. This structured function class aligns the state-to-action mapping with the piecewise-smooth nature of gait, improving sample efficiency, reducing action jitter and energy consumption, and providing interpretable posture-action sensitivities. We adopt Multi-Modal Delay Randomization (MMDR) and perform end-to-end training with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Evaluations across diverse terrains, including both even and uneven surfaces and scenarios with static or dynamic obstacles, demonstrate that QuadKAN achieves consistently higher returns, greater distances, and fewer collisions than state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines. These results show that spline-parameterized policies offer a simple, effective, and interpretable alternative for robust vision-guided locomotion. A repository will be made available upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>A QoS Framework for Service Provision in Multi-Infrastructure-Sharing Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01694v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a framework for resource provisioning with QoS guarantees in shared infrastructure networks. Our novel framework provides tunable probabilistic service guarantees for throughput and delay. Key to our approach is a Modified Dirft-plus-Penalty (MDP) policy that ensures long-term stability while capturing short-term probabilistic service guarantees using linearized upper-confidence bounds. We characterize the feasible region of service guarantees and show that our MDP procedure achieves mean rate stability and an optimality gap that vanishes with the frame size over which service guarantees are provided. Finally, empirical simulations validate our theory and demonstrate the favorable performance of our algorithm in handling QoS in multi-infrastructure networks.</description>

      <title>Forbal: Force Balanced 2-5 Degree of Freedom Robot Manipulator Built from a Five Bar Linkage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A force balanced manipulator design based on the closed chain planar five bar linkage is developed and experimentally validated. We present 2 variants as a modular design: Forbal-2, a planar 2-DOF manipulator, and its extension to 5-DOF spatial motion called Forbal-5. The design considerations in terms of geometric, kinematic, and dynamic design that fulfill the force balance conditions while maximizing workspace are discussed. Then, the inverse kinematics of both variants are derived from geometric principles. We validate the improvements from force balancing the manipulator through comparative experiments with counter mass balanced and unbalanced configurations. The results show how the balanced configuration yields a reduction in the average reaction moments of up to 66%, a reduction of average joint torques of up to 79%, as well as a noticeable reduction in position error for Forbal-2. For Forbal-5, which has a higher end effector payload mass, the joint torques are reduced up to 84% for the balanced configuration. Experimental results validate that the balanced manipulator design is suitable for applications where the reduction of joint torques and reaction forces/moments helps achieve millimeter level precision.</description>

      <title>Optimal Damping for the 1D Wave Equation Using a Single Damper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vibrational structures are susceptible to catastrophic failures or structural damages when external forces induce resonances or repeated unwanted oscillations. One common mitigation strategy is to use dampers to suppress these disturbances. This leads to the problem of finding optimal damper viscosities and positions for a given vibrational structure. Although extensive research exists for the case of finite-dimensional systems, optimizing damper positions remains challenging due to its discrete nature. To overcome this, we introduce a novel model for the damped wave equation (at the PDE level) with a damper of viscosity $\mathfrak{g}$ at position $\mathfrak{p}$ and develop a system-theoretic input/output-based analysis in the frequency domain. In this system-theoretic formulation, while we consider average displacement as the output, for input (forcing), we analyze two separate cases, namely, the uniform and boundary forcing. For both cases, explicit formulas are derived for the corresponding transfer functions, parametrized by $\mathfrak{p}$ and $\mathfrak{g}$. This explicit parametrization by $\mathfrak{p}$ and $\mathfrak{g}$ facilitates analyzing the optimal damping problem (at the PDE level) using norms such as the $\mathcal{H}_2$ and $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ norms. We also examine limiting cases, such as when the viscosity is very large or when no external damping is present. To illustrate our approach, we present numerical examples, compare different optimization criteria, and discuss the impact of damping parameters on the damped wave equation.</description>
