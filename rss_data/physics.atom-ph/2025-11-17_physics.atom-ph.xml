      <title>Characterizing resonances in positron-sodium scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate resonances in positron-sodium scattering using the $R$-matrix propagation method formulated in hyperspherical coordinates. The interaction between the sodium core and the valence electron is described by analytical model potentials. High partial-wave resonances are calculated for collision energies up to the Na($4f$) threshold. Several resonant states of debated character are identified, and their behavior is analyzed through phase-variation studies, the associated structures in the calculated cross sections, and the characteristic patterns observed in the stability plots. The calculated dipole series of resonances, supported by the ion-dipole interaction between Na$^{\scriptscriptstyle+}$ and Ps($n=2$), shows good agreement with recent complex-scaling calculations. In addition, a sequence of quasi-dipole resonances is found to arise from the near degeneracy of the Na($4d$) and Na($4f$) states in the e$^{+}$-Na system, which accumulate geometrically toward the Na($4d$) threshold.</description>

      <title>Enhanced sensitivity to variations of fundamental constants in highly charged molecules from analytic perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasi-forbidden electronic transitions in atoms and quasi-degenerate vibronic transitions in molecules serve as powerful probes of hypothetical temporal variations of fundamental constants. Computation of the sensitivity of a transition to a variation of the fine-structure constant is conventionally performed by numerical variation of the speed of light in sophisticated electronic structure calculations, and therewith several individual calculations have to be performed. An approach is presented herein that obtains sensitivity coefficients as first order perturbation to the Dirac-Coulomb Hamiltonian and allows their computation as expectation values of the relativistic kinetic energy and rest-mass operators. These are available in essentially all \emph{ab initio} relativistic electronic structure codes. Additionally, the corresponding operators for two-component Hamiltonians are derived, explicitly for the zeroth order regular approximation Hamiltonian. The approach is applied to demonstrate great sensitivity of highly charged polar molecules that were recently proposed for high-precision spectroscopy in [Z\"ulch \emph{et al.}, arXiv:2203.10333[physics.chem-ph]]. In particular, a high sensitivity of a wealth of quasi-degenerate vibronic transitions in PaF$^{3+}$ and CeF$^{2+}$ to temporal variations of the fine-structure constant and the electron-proton mass ratio is shown.</description>

      <title>SCULPT: An Interactive Machine Learning Platform for Analyzing Multi-Particle Coincidence Data from Cold Target Recoil Ion Momentum Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present SCULPT (Supervised Clustering and Uncovering Latent Patterns with Training), a comprehensive software platform for analyzing tabulated high-dimensional multi-particle coincidence data from Cold Target Recoil Ion Momentum Spectroscopy (COLTRIMS) experiments. The software addresses critical challenges in modern momentum spectroscopy by integrating advanced machine learning techniques with physics-informed analysis in an interactive web-based environment. SCULPT implements Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for non-linear dimensionality reduction to reveal correlations in highly dimensional data. We also discuss potential extensions to deep autoencoders for feature learning, and genetic programming for automated discovery of physically meaningful observables. A novel adaptive confidence scoring system provides quantitative reliability assessments by evaluating user-selected clustering quality metrics with predefined weights that reflect each metric's robustness. The platform features configurable molecular profiles for different experimental systems, interactive visualization with selection tools, and comprehensive data filtering capabilities. Utilizing a subset of SCULPT's capabilities, we analyze photo double ionization data measured using the COLTRIMS method for 3-body dissociation of the D2O molecule, revealing distinct fragmentation channels and their correlations with physics parameters. The software's modular architecture and web-based implementation make it accessible to the broader atomic and molecular physics community, significantly reducing the time required for complex multi-dimensional analyses. This opens the door to finding and isolating rare events exhibiting non-linear correlations on the fly during experimental measurements, which can help steer exploration and improve the efficiency of experiments.</description>

      <title>Vector magnetometry using cavity-enhanced microwave readout in nitrogen-vacancy diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate $4\pi$-steradian vector magnetic field sensing using an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in a single-crystal diamond coupled to a microwave (MW) cavity. The MW cavity enhances the spin-photon coupling which enables efficient, high-contrast spin-state readout via MW interrogation and removes the need for bulky optical collection components. An applied AC bias magnetic field lifts the zero-field degeneracy of the four crystallographic NV orientations, allowing each orientation to be individually addressed and used for vector reconstruction of the magnetic field. The resulting magnetometer has a 40\% contrast (20x higher than typical for optical spin-ensemble readout) and achieves a single-axis sensitivity of 250 pT/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ which is flat from DC to 1 kHz. Noise models of the composite spin-cavity system establish MW amplitude noise as the dominant noise source and predict a thermal noise limit of 2 pT/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$.</description>

      <title>Probing the spatial distribution of k-vectors in situ with Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19157v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel method for mapping \textit{in situ} the spatial distribution of photon momentum across a laser beam using a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) as a moving probe. By displacing the BEC, we measure the photon recoil by atom interferometry at different positions in the laser beam and thus reconstruct a two-dimensional map of the local intensity and effective dispersion of the $k$ wave vector. Applied to a beam diffracted by a diaphragm, this method reveals a local \textit{extra recoil} effect, which exceeds the magnitude $h\nu/c$ of the individual plane-waves over which the beam can be decomposed. This method offers a new way to precisely characterize wavefront distortions and to evaluate one of the major systematic bias sources in quantum sensors based on atom interferometry.</description>

      <title>QED calculations of intra-$L$-shell doubly excited states in Be-like ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rigorous QED approach is employed to calculate the energies of the $2p2p\,^3P_{0,1,2}$, $2p2p\,^1D_2$, and $2p2p\,^1S_0$ states of selected Be-like highly charged ions over a wide range of nuclear-charge numbers, $18 \leqslant Z \leqslant 92$. Combined with the previously reported energies of the $2s2p \, ^3P_{0,1,2}$ and $2s2p \, ^1P_1$ states [A. V. Malyshev et al., Phys. Rev. A 110, 062824 (2024)], the obtained results are used to study various intra-$L$-shell transition energies. Strong level mixing, caused by the proximity of states with the same symmetry, is overcome by means of the QED perturbation theory for quasi-degenerate levels. The applied approach merges a rigorous perturbative QED treatment up to the second order with the consideration of electron-electron correlation contributions of the third and higher orders evaluated within the Breit approximation. The higher-order screened QED effects are estimated using the model-QED-operator approach. The nuclear-recoil and nuclear-polarization effects are also taken into account. The obtained predictions represent the most accurate theoretical description of the electronic structure of Be-like ions to date and demonstrate good agreement with available experimental data.</description>

      <title>Hybrid basis and multi-center grid method for strong-field processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a time-dependent framework that combines a hybrid Gaussian-FEDVR basis with a multicenter grid to simulate strong-field and attosecond dynamics in atoms and molecules. The method incorporates the construction of the orthonormal hybrid basis, the evaluation of electronic integrals, a unitary time-propagation scheme, and the extraction of optical and photoelectron observables. Its accuracy and robustness are benchmarked on one-electron systems such as atomic hydrogen and the dihydrogen cation ($\text{H}_{2}^{+}$) through comparisons with essentially-exact reference resutls for bound-state energies, high-harmonic generation spcetra, photoionization cross sections, and photoelectron momentum distributions. This work establishes the groundwork for its integration with quantum-chemistry methods, which are already operational but will be detailed in future work, thereby enabling ab initio simulations of correlated polyatomic systems in intense ultrafast laser fields.</description>

      <title>Structure and interactions of atoms and diatomic molecules: from ultracold gases to doped solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is the manuscript of my "Habilitation \`a diriger des recherches", where I present the research work that I have done after my PhD, defended in 2009. The manuscript is divided in two parts. The first one is dedicated to atomic-structure calculations with neutral and trivalent lanthanides, in the contexts of ultracold gases and rare-earth doped solids. The second part deals with long-range interactions in ultracold gases of alkali-metal atoms and diatomic molecules, as well as lanthanide atoms. The detailed description of long-range interactions serves to characterize ultralow-temperature phenomena, like photoassociation and collisional shielding.</description>
