      <title>Modeling of surface-state induced inter-electrode isolation of $n$-on-$p$ devices in mixed-field and $\gamma$-irradiation environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the HEP-experiments of High Luminosity upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC), the application of isolation implants like $p$-stop between $n^+$-electrodes of position sensitive $n$-on-$p$ sensors has been typically considered to counter the detrimental effect on position resolution of the accumulation of positive net oxide charge with radiation. In addition to the positively charged layer close to the Si/SiO$_2$-interface, surface damage introduced by radiation in SiO$_2$-passivated silicon particle detectors includes the accumulation of trapped-oxide-charge and interface traps. A previous study of either n/$\gamma$ (mixed field)- or $\gamma$-irradiated Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (MOS) capacitors showed evidence of substantially higher introduction rates of acceptor- and donor-type deep interface traps ($N_\textrm{it,acc/don}$) in mixed-field environment. In this work, an inter-electrode resistivity ($\rho_\textrm{int}$) TCAD-simulation study of $n$-on-$p$ sensors with and without $p$-stop isolation implants was conducted for both irradiation types. Higher levels of $\rho_\textrm{int}$ showed correlation to higher densities of deep $N_\textrm{it,acc/don}$, with the isolation performance of the mixed-field irradiated sensors becoming independent of the presence of $p$-stop implant between the $n^+$-electrodes throughout the investigated dose range up to about 100 kGy. The low introduction rates of deep $N_\textrm{it,acc/don}$ in $\gamma$-irradiated sensors resulted in high sensitivity of $\rho_\textrm{int}$ to the presence and peak doping of $p$-stop above the lowest dose of 7 kGy in the study. Because of the advantageous influence of radiation-induced accumulation of deep $N_\textrm{it}$ on the inter-electrode isolation, position sensitive $n$-on-$p$ sensors without isolation implants may be considered for future HEP-experiments where the radiation is largely due to hadrons.</description>

      <title>Time performance of Analog Pixel Test Structures with in-chip operational amplifier implemented in 65 nm CMOS imaging process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of the CERN EP R&amp;D on monolithic sensors and the ALICE ITS3 upgrade, the Tower Partners Semiconductor Co (TPSCo) 65 nm process has been qualified for use in high energy physics, and adopted for the ALICE ITS3 upgrade. An Analog Pixel Test Structure (APTS) featuring fast per pixel operational-amplifier-based buffering for a small matrix of four by four pixels, with a sensor with a small collection electrode and a very non-uniform electric field, was designed to allow detailed characterization of the pixel performance in this technology. Several variants of this chip with different pixel designs have been characterized with a (120 GeV/$c$) positive hadron beam. This result indicates that the APTS-OA prototype variants with the best performance achieve a time resolution of 63 ps with a detection efficiency exceeding 99% and a spatial resolution of 2 $\mu$m, highlighting the potential of TPSCo 65nm CMOS imaging technology for high-energy physics and other fields requiring precise time measurement, high detection efficiency, and excellent spatial resolution.</description>

      <title>Near-quantum limited axion dark matter search with the ORGAN experiment around 26 $\mu$eV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The latest result from The ORGAN Experiment, an axion haloscope is presented. This iteration of the experiment operated at millikelvin temperatures using a flux-driven Josephson parametric amplifier (JPA) for reduced noise, along with various other upgrades over previous iterations. Covering the $25.45 - 26.27\,\mu\text{eV}$ ($6.15-6.35$ GHz) mass (frequency) range, this near-quantum limited phase of ORGAN employs a conducting rod resonator and a 7-T solenoidal magnet to place the most sensitive exclusion limits on axion-photon coupling in the range to date, with $|g_{a\gamma\gamma}| \gtrsim 2.8\times10^{-13}$ at a 95% confidence level.</description>

      <title>Application of interpretable machine learning for cross-diagnostic inference on the ST40 spherical tokamak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models are exceptionally effective in capturing complex non-linear relationships of high-dimensional datasets and making accurate predictions. However, their intrinsic ``black-box'' nature makes it difficult to interpret them or guarantee ``safe behavior'' when deployed in high-risk applications such as feedback control, healthcare and finance. This drawback acts as a significant barrier to their wider application across many scientific and industrial domains where the interpretability of the model predictions is as important as accuracy. Leveraging the latest developments in interpretable machine learning, we develop a method to parameterise ``black-box'' models, effectively transforming them into ``grey-box'' models. We apply this approach to plasma diagnostics by creating a parameterised synthetic Soft X-Ray imaging $-$ Thomson Scattering diagnostic, which predicts high temporal resolution electron temperature and density profiles from the measured soft X-ray emission. The ``grey-box'' model predictions are benchmarked against the trained ``black-box'' models as well as a diverse range of plasma conditions. Our model-agnostic approach can be applied to various machine learning architectures, enabling direct comparisons of model interpretations.</description>

      <title>Switching, Amplifying, and Chirping Diode Lasers with Current Pulses for High Bandwidth Quantum Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A series of simple and low-cost devices for switching, amplifying, and chirping diode lasers based on current modulation are presented. Direct modulation of diode laser currents is rarely sufficient to establish precise amplitude and phase control over light, as its effects on these parameters are not independent. These devices overcome this limitation by exploiting amplifier saturation and dramatically outperform commonly used external modulators in key figures of merit for quantum technological applications. Semiconductor optical amplifiers operated on either rubidium D line are recast as intensity switches and shown to achieve ON:OFF ratios $&gt;10^6$ in as little as 50 ns. Current is switched to a 795 nm wavelength (Rb D1) tapered amplifier to produce optical pulses of few nanosecond duration and peak powers of 3 W at a similar extinction ratio. Fast rf pulses are applied directly to a laser diode to shift its emission frequency by up to 300 MHz in either direction and at a maximum chirp rate of 150 MHz/ns. Finally, the latter components are combined, yielding a system that produces watt-level optical pulses with arbitrary frequency chirps in the given range and &lt;2% residual intensity variation, all within 65 ns upon asynchronous demand. Such systems have broad application in atomic, molecular, and optical physics, and are of particular interest to fast experiments simultaneously requiring high power and low noise, for example quantum memory experiments with atomic vapors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13789v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sPHENIX Time Projection Chamber Outer Tracker (TPOT) is a Micromegas based detector. It is a part of the sPHENIX experiment that aims to facilitate the calibration of the Time Projection Chamber, in particular the correction of the time-averaged and beam-induced distortions of the electron drift. This paper describes the detector mission, setup, construction, installation, commissioning and performance during the first year of sPHENIX data taking.</description>

      <title>Nanodosimetric investigation of the track structure of therapeutic carbon ion radiation. Part 1: Measurement of ionization cluster size distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07581v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At the Heidelberg Ion-Beam Therapy Center, the track structure of carbon ions of therapeutic energy after penetrating layers of simulated tissue was investigated for the first time. Measurements were conducted with primary carbon ion beams of different energies and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) absorbers of different thicknesses to realize different depths in the phantom along the pristine Bragg peak. Ionization cluster size (ICS) distributions resulting from the mixed radiation field behind the PMMA absorbers were measured using an ion-counting nanodosimeter. Two different measurements were carried out: (i) variation of the PMMA absorber thickness with constant primary carbon ion energy and (ii) combined variation of PMMA absorber thickness and primary carbon ion energy such that the primary carbon ion's energy in the target volume is constant. The data analysis revealed unexpectedly high mean ICS values compared to stopping power calculations and the data measured at lower energies in earlier work. This suggests that in the measurements the primary carbon ion energies behind the PMMA absorber may have deviated considerably from the expected values obtained by the calculations. In addition, the results indicate the presence of a marked contribution of nuclear fragments to the measured ICS distributions, especially if the carbon ion does not cross the target volume.</description>

      <title>Microscale torsion resonators for short-range gravity experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measuring gravitational interactions on sub-100-$\mu$m length scales offers a window into physics beyond the Standard Model. However, short-range gravity experiments are limited by the ability to position sufficiently massive objects to within small separation distances. Here we propose mass-loaded silicon nitride ribbons as a platform for testing the gravitational inverse square law at separations currently inaccessible with traditional torsion balances. These microscale torsion resonators benefit from low thermal noise due to strain-induced dissipation dilution while maintaining compact size (&lt;100$\,\mu$g) to allow close approach. Considering an experiment combining a 40$\,\mu$g torsion resonator with a source mass of comparable size (130$\,\mu$g) at separations down to 25$\,\mu$m, and including limits from thermomechanical noise and systematic uncertainty, we predict these devices can set novel constraints on Yukawa interactions within the 1-100$\,\mu$m range.</description>
