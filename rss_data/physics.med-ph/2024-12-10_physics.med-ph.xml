      <title>Selective Enrichment of Full AAV Capsids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gene therapies using recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) have been developed to treat monogenic and acquired diseases but are currently the most expensive drugs due, in part, to high manufacturing costs. The cells producing rAAV generate substantial quantities of empty (50-90%) and partially filled capsids that must be removed prior to final formulation. The conventional separation processes are inefficient in removing empty and partially filled capsids, have low yield, scale poorly, time consuming and need additional purification steps. This article demonstrates one step separation of full capsids from a mixture of full, partially filled, and empty capsids, and other protein impurities using selective crystallization, a purification process, which is first time in protein purification and is performed without physically or chemically modifying the target component for the first time in the history of selective crystallization, and is highly-efficient, highly-scalable, and economical. Hanging-drop vapor diffusion experiments were used to scout crystallization conditions in which full and empty capsids crystallize, then to define conditions in which crystals of full, empty, or both full and empty capsids nucleate and grow. The experimental results for rAAV serotypes 5, 8, and 9 as exemplary vectors and scale-up results show that full capsids can be selectively crystallized and separated in one step from a mixture of full, partially filled, and empty capsids, and other proteins with full capsid enrichment of greater than 80%, approximately 20% higher, and yield of greater than 90%, approximately greater than 30% higher from the existing methods, keeping their biological activity intact, in a short period of time (less than 4 h), with approximately 87% reduction in processing time from the existing processing time and without the need of additional purification steps and in one round.</description>

      <title>MRI-based Head and Neck Tumor Segmentation Using nnU-Net with 15-fold Cross-Validation Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The superior soft tissue differentiation provided by MRI may enable more accurate tumor segmentation compared to CT and PET, potentially enhancing adaptive radiotherapy treatment planning. The Head and Neck Tumor Segmentation for MR-Guided Applications challenge (HNTSMRG-24) comprises two tasks: segmentation of primary gross tumor volume (GTVp) and metastatic lymph nodes (GTVn) on T2-weighted MRI volumes obtained at (1) pre-radiotherapy (pre-RT) and (2) mid-radiotherapy (mid-RT). The training dataset consists of data from 150 patients, including MRI volumes of pre-RT, mid-RT, and pre-RT registered to the corresponding mid-RT volumes. Each MRI volume is accompanied by a label mask, generated by merging independent annotations from a minimum of three experts. For both tasks, we propose adopting the nnU-Net V2 framework by the use of a 15-fold cross-validation ensemble instead of the standard number of 5 folds for increased robustness and variability. For pre-RT segmentation, we augmented the initial training data (150 pre-RT volumes and masks) with the corresponding mid-RT data. For mid-RT segmentation, we opted for a three-channel input, which, in addition to the mid-RT MRI volume, comprises the registered pre-RT MRI volume and the corresponding mask. The mean of the aggregated Dice Similarity Coefficient for GTVp and GTVn is computed on a blind test set and determines the quality of the proposed methods. These metrics determine the final ranking of methods for both tasks separately. The final blind testing (50 patients) of the methods proposed by our team, RUG_UMCG, resulted in an aggregated Dice Similarity Coefficient of 0.81 (0.77 for GTVp and 0.85 for GTVn) for Task 1 and 0.70 (0.54 for GTVp and 0.86 for GTVn) for Task 2.</description>

      <title>Continuous non-contact vital sign monitoring of neonates in intensive care units using RGB-D cameras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neonates in intensive care require continuous monitoring. Current measurement devices are limited for long-term use due to the fragility of newborn skin and the interference of wires with medical care and parental interactions. Camera-based vital sign monitoring has the potential to address these limitations and has become of considerable interest in recent years due to the absence of physical contact between the recording equipment and the neonates, as well as the introduction of low-cost devices. We present a novel system to capture vital signs while offering clinical insights beyond current technologies using a single RGB-D camera. Heart rate and oxygen saturation were measured using colour and infrared signals with mean average errors (MAE) of 7.69 bpm and 3.37%, respectively. Using the depth signals, an MAE of 4.83 breaths per minute was achieved for respiratory rate. Tidal volume measurements were obtained with a MAE of 0.61 mL. Flow-volume loops can also be calculated from camera data, which have applications in respiratory disease diagnosis. Our system demonstrates promising capabilities for neonatal monitoring, augmenting current clinical recording techniques to potentially improve outcomes for neonates.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Coincidence Time Resolution in a liquid xenon detector with silicon photomultipliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work explores the combination of liquid xenon as a scintillating medium and silicon photomultipliers as a readout in Positron Emission Tomography (PET) for enhanced Time-Of-Flight resolution. We present the results of our first prototype optimized to maximize light collection using high-PDE, VUV-sensitive sensors and to minimize time fluctuations. We report a coincidence time resolution of 281 $\pm$ 2 ps FWHM, obtained using a $^{22}$Na calibration source. This result is competitive with the current state-of-the-art PET scanners and represents a significant step forward in the development of liquid xenon as a viable alternative to conventional scintillators in PET technology.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06599v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective:To develop a no-reference image quality assessment method using automated distortion recognition to boost MRI-guided radiotherapy precision.Methods:We analyzed 106,000 MR images from 10 patients with liver metastasis,captured with the Elekta Unity MR-LINAC.Our No-Reference Quality Assessment Model includes:1)image preprocessing to enhance visibility of key diagnostic features;2)feature extraction and directional analysis using MSCN coefficients across four directions to capture textural attributes and gradients,vital for identifying image features and potential distortions;3)integrative Quality Index(QI)calculation,which integrates features via AGGD parameter estimation and K-means clustering.The QI,based on a weighted MAD computation of directional scores,provides a comprehensive image quality measure,robust against outliers.LOO-CV assessed model generalizability and performance.Tumor tracking algorithm performance was compared with and without preprocessing to verify tracking accuracy enhancements.Results:Preprocessing significantly improved image quality,with the QI showing substantial positive changes and surpassing other metrics.After normalization,the QI's average value was 79.6 times higher than CNR,indicating improved image definition and contrast.It also showed higher sensitivity in detail recognition with average values 6.5 times and 1.7 times higher than Tenengrad gradient and entropy.The tumor tracking algorithm confirmed significant tracking accuracy improvements with preprocessed images,validating preprocessing effectiveness.Conclusions:This study introduces a novel no-reference image quality evaluation method based on automated distortion recognition,offering a new quality control tool for MRIgRT tumor tracking.It enhances clinical application accuracy and facilitates medical image quality assessment standardization, with significant clinical and research value.</description>

      <title>Diff5T: Benchmarking Human Brain Diffusion MRI with an Extensive 5.0 Tesla K-Space and Spatial Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) provides critical insights into the microstructural and connectional organization of the human brain. However, the availability of high-field, open-access datasets that include raw k-space data for advanced research remains limited. To address this gap, we introduce Diff5T, a first comprehensive 5.0 Tesla diffusion MRI dataset focusing on the human brain. This dataset includes raw k-space data and reconstructed diffusion images, acquired using a variety of imaging protocols. Diff5T is designed to support the development and benchmarking of innovative methods in artifact correction, image reconstruction, image preprocessing, diffusion modelling and tractography. The dataset features a wide range of diffusion parameters, including multiple b-values and gradient directions, allowing extensive research applications in studying human brain microstructure and connectivity. With its emphasis on open accessibility and detailed benchmarks, Diff5T serves as a valuable resource for advancing human brain mapping research using diffusion MRI, fostering reproducibility, and enabling collaboration across the neuroscience and medical imaging communities.</description>

      <title>Parameterization of dose profiles of therapeutic minibeams of protons, $^{4}$He, $^{12}$C, and $^{16}$O</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single minibeams of protons, $^{4}$He, $^{12}$C and $^{16}$O in water were modeled with Geant4, and their dose distributions were parameterized with double-Gauss-Rutherford (DGR) functions. Dose distributions from arrays of 16 parallel minibeams centered on a rectangular or hexagonal grid were constructed from the parameterized minibeam profiles to simulate the lateral convergence of the minibeams resulting in a homogeneous dose field in the target tumor volume. Peak-to-valley dose ratios (PVDR) and dose-volume histograms (DVH) were calculated for the parameterized dose distributions and compared with those obtained directly from Geant4 modeling of minibeam arrays. The similarity of the results obtained by these two methods suggests that the fast calculation of dose profiles of minibeam arrays based on the DGR parameterizations proposed in this work can replace the time-consuming MC modeling in future preclinical studies and also in the development of treatment planning systems for minibeam therapy.</description>

      <title>An Exact Hemodynamic Analysis of Poiseuille Flow in Tubes of Bipolar Cylindrical Cross Sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Steady blood flow, or Poiseuille flow, through compressed or defective blood vessels presents critical challenges in hemodynamics, particularly in cardiovascular research. This study investigates a tube with a bipolar cylindrical cross section, a geometry relevant to unique hemodynamic issues such as blood flow through a bicuspid aortic valve during its oval systolic opening. A bipolar cross sectional analysis provides a more precise geometric approximation for modeling flow through such atypical vessel structures. In this paper, we derived an exact solution for the governing equations of Poiseuille flow within a bipolar cross sectional tube. The results encompass the velocity field, flow rate, and wall shear stress (WSS). The velocity profiles for blood flow in the bipolar cylindrical geometry demonstrate remarkable agreement with findings from previous studies utilizing coherent multi-scale simulations.</description>
