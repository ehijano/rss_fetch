      <title>A Bayesian Gaussian Process Dynamic Factor Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a dynamic factor model (DFM) where the latent factors are linked to observed variables with unknown and potentially nonlinear functions. The key novelty and source of flexibility of our approach is a nonparametric observation equation, specified via Gaussian Process (GP) priors for each series. Factor dynamics are modeled with a standard vector autoregression (VAR), which facilitates computation and interpretation. We discuss a computationally efficient estimation algorithm and consider two empirical applications. First, we forecast key series from the FRED-QD dataset and show that the model yields improvements in predictive accuracy relative to linear benchmarks. Second, we extract driving factors of global inflation dynamics with the GP-DFM, which allows for capturing international asymmetries.</description>

      <title>Treatment Effects of Multi-Valued Treatments in Hyper-Rectangle Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the identification of marginal treatment responses within multi-valued treatment models. Extending the hyper-rectangle model introduced by Lee and Salanie (2018), this paper relaxes restrictive assumptions, including the requirement of known treatment selection thresholds and the dependence of treatments on all unobserved heterogeneity. By incorporating an additional ranked treatment assumption, this study demonstrates that the marginal treatment responses can be identified under a broader set of conditions, either point or set identification. The framework further enables the derivation of various treatment effects from the marginal treatment responses. Additionally, this paper introduces a hypothesis testing method to evaluate the effectiveness of policies on treatment effects, enhancing its applicability to empirical policy analysis.</description>

      <title>Causal mechanism and mediation analysis for macroeconomics dynamics: a bridge of Granger and Sims causality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel concept of impulse response decomposition to disentangle the dynamic contributions of the mediator variables in the transmission of structural shocks. We justify our decomposition by drawing on causal mediation analysis and demonstrating its equivalence to the average mediation effect. Our result establishes a formal link between Sims and Granger causality. Sims causality captures the total effect, while Granger causality corresponds to the mediation effect. We construct a dynamic mediation index that quantifies the evolving role of mediator variables in shock propagation. Applying our framework to studies of the transmission channels of US monetary policy, we find that investor sentiment explains approximately 60% of the peak aggregate output response in three months following a policy shock, while expected default risk contributes negligibly across all horizons.</description>

      <title>Optimal Estimation for General Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel exact maximum likelihood (ML) estimation method for general Gaussian processes, where all parameters are estimated jointly. The exact ML estimator (MLE) is consistent and asymptotically normally distributed. We prove the local asymptotic normality (LAN) property of the sequence of statistical experiments for general Gaussian processes in the sense of Le Cam, thereby enabling optimal estimation and facilitating statistical inference. The results rely solely on the asymptotic behavior of the spectral density near zero, allowing them to be widely applied. The established optimality not only addresses the gap left by Adenstedt(1974), who proposed an efficient but infeasible estimator for the long-run mean $\mu$, but also enables us to evaluate the finite-sample performance of the existing method -- the commonly used plug-in MLE, in which the sample mean is substituted into the likelihood. Our simulation results show that the plug-in MLE performs nearly as well as the exact MLE, alleviating concerns that inefficient estimation of $\mu$ would compromise the efficiency of the remaining parameter estimates.</description>

      <title>Teacher bias or measurement error?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04200v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Subjective teacher evaluations play a key role in shaping students' educational trajectories. Previous studies have shown that students of low socioeconomic status (SES) receive worse subjective evaluations than their high SES peers, even when they score similarly on objective standardized tests. This is often interpreted as evidence of teacher bias. Measurement error in test scores challenges this interpretation. We discuss how both classical and non-classical measurement error in test scores generate a biased coefficient of the conditional SES gap, and consider three empirical strategies to address this bias. Using administrative data from the Netherlands, where secondary school track recommendations are pivotal teacher judgments, we find that measurement error explains 35 to 43% of the conditional SES gap in track recommendations.</description>
