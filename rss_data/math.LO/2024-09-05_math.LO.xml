      <title>Asymptotic dimension and hyperfiniteness of generic Cantor actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for a countable discrete group which is locally of finite asymptotic dimension, the generic continuous action on Cantor space has hyperfinite orbit equivalence relation. In particular, this holds for free groups, answering a question of Frisch-Kechris-Shinko-Vidny\'anszky.</description>

      <title>On the complexity of the Eulerian path problem for infinite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of algorithmically deciding whether a given infinite connected graph has an Eulerian path, namely, a path that uses every edge exactly once. It has been recently observed that this problem is $D_3^0$-complete for graphs that have a computable description, whereas it is $\Pi_2^0$-complete for graphs that have a highly computable description, and that this same bound holds for the class of automatic graphs. A closely related problem consists of determining the number of ends of a graph, namely, the maximum number of distinct infinite connected components the graph can be separated into after removing a finite set of edges. The complexity of this problem for highly computable graphs is known to be $\Pi_2^0$-complete as well. The connection between these two problems lies in that only graphs with one or two ends can have Eulerian paths. In this paper we are interested in understanding the complexity of the infinite Eulerian path problem in the setting where the input graphs are known to have the right number of ends. We find that in this setting the problem becomes strictly easier, and that its exact difficulty varies according to whether the graphs have one or two ends, and to whether the Eulerian path we are looking for is one-way or bi-infinite. For example, we find that deciding existence of a bi-infinite Eulerian path for one-ended graphs is only $\Pi_1^0$-complete if the graphs are highly computable, and that the same problem becomes decidable for automatic graphs. Our results are based on a detailed computability analysis of what we call the Separation Problem, which we believe to be of independent interest. For instance, as a side application, we observe that K\"onig's infinity lemma, well known to be non-effective in general, becomes effective if we restrict to graphs with finitely many ends.</description>

      <title>Bounding finite-image strings of length $\omega^k$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a well-quasi-order $X$ and an ordinal $\alpha$, the set $s^F_\alpha(X)$ of transfinite strings on $X$ with length less than $\alpha$ and with finite image is also a well-quasi-order, as proven by Nash-Williams. Before Nash-Williams proved it for general $\alpha$, however, it was proven for $\alpha&lt;\omega^\omega$ by Erd\H{o}s and Rado. In this paper, we revisit Erd\H{o}s and Rado's proof and improve upon it, using it to obtain upper bounds on the maximum linearization of $s^F_{\omega^k}(X)$ in terms of $k$ and $o(X)$, where $o(X)$ denotes the maximum linearization of $X$. We show that, for fixed $k$, $o(s^F_{\omega^k}(X))$ is bounded above by a function which can roughly be described as $(k+1)$-times exponential in $o(X)$. We also show that, for $k\le 2$, this bound is not far from tight.</description>

      <title>Forcing as a Local Method of Accessing Small Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fix a set-theoretic universe $V$. We look at small extensions of $V$ as generalised degrees of computability over $V$. We also formalise and investigate the complexity of certain methods one can use to define, in $V$, subclasses of degrees over $V$. Finally, we give a nice characterisation of the complexity of forcing within this framework.</description>

      <title>The Kaufmann--Clote question on end extensions of models of arithmetic and the weak regularity principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the end extendibility of models of arithmetic with restricted elementarity. By utilizing the restricted ultrapower construction in the second-order context, for each $n\in\mathbb{N}$ and any countable model of $\mathrm{B}\Sigma_{n+2}$, we construct a proper $\Sigma_{n+2}$-elementary end extension satisfying $\mathrm{B}\Sigma_{n+1}$, which answers a question by Clote positively. We also give a characterization of countable models of $\mathrm{I}\Sigma_{n+2}$ in terms of their end extendibility similar to the case of $\mathrm{B}\Sigma_{n+2}$. Along the proof, we will introduce a new type of regularity principles in arithmetic called the weak regularity principle, which serves as a bridge between the model's end extendibility and the amount of induction or collection it satisfies.</description>

      <title>On the universal theory of the free pseudocomplemented distributive lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that the universal theory of the free pseudocomplemented distributive lattice is decidable and a recursive axiomatization is presented. This contrasts with the case of the full elementary theory of the finitely generated free algebras which is known to be undecidable. As a by-product, a description of the pseudocomplemented distributive lattices that can be embedded into the free algebra is also obtained.</description>

      <title>Uniform extension of definable $C^{m,\omega}$-Whitney jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.09156v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that definable Whitney jets of class $C^{m,\omega}$, where $m$ is a nonnegative integer and $\omega$ is a modulus of continuity, are the restrictions of definable $C^{m,\omega}$-functions; "definable" refers to an arbitrary given o-minimal expansion of the real field. This is true in a uniform way: any definable bounded family of Whitney jets of class $C^{m,\omega}$ extends to a definable bounded family of $C^{m,\omega}$-functions. We also discuss a uniform $C^m$-version and how the extension depends on the modulus of continuity.</description>

      <title>Interpretations of syntactic fragments of theories of fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We set up general machinery to study interpretations of fragments of theories. We then apply this to existential fragments of theories of fields, and especially of henselian valued fields. As an application we prove many-one reductions between various existential theories of fields. In particular we exhibit several theories of fields many-one equivalent to the existential theory of $\mathbb{Q}$.</description>

      <title>Forcing with Language Fragments, Extending Namba Forcing, and Models of Theories with Constraints in Interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01213v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a forcing framework based on the idea of amalgamating language fragments into a theory with a canonical term model. We then demonstrate the usefulness of this framework by applying it to variants of the extended Namba problem, as well as to the analysis of models of certain theories with constraints in interpretation (TCIs). The foundations for a theory of TCIs and their models are laid in parallel to the development of our framework, and are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>On Stability and Existence of Models in Abstract Elementary Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For an abstract elementary class $\mathbf{K}$ and a cardinal $\lambda \geq LS(\mathbf{K})$, we prove under mild cardinal arithmetic assumptions, categoricity in two succesive cardinals, almost stability for $\lambda^+$-minimal types and continuity of splitting in $\lambda$, that stability in $\lambda$ is equivalent to the existence of a model in $\lambda^{++}$. The forward direction holds without any cardinal or categoricity assumptions, this result improves both [Vas18b, 12.1] and [MaYa24, 3.14].
  Moreover, we prove a categoricity theorem for abstract elementary classes with weak amalgamation and tameness under mild structural assumptions in $\lambda$. A key feature of this result is that we do not assume amalgamation or arbitrarily large models.</description>
