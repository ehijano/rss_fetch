      <title>Multiscale numerical methods for isothermal fluid models of confined plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this work is to introduce a numerical method to cope with the multiscale nature of confined plasma physics. These investigations are focused on fluid plasma description under large magnetic field. The difficulties in this context stem from intense magnetization of the plasma, inducing a severe anisotropy, possible quasi-neutrality breakdowns, which may occur locally in the plasma and, eventually, the drift regime which prevails for the description of the electrons. These characteristics bring small parameters compared to the scale of the studied device. This work is therefore devoted to highlighting the difficulties specific to this context and to developing numerical methods efficient to cope with this multiscale nature of the physics within the framework of asymptotic-preserving methods.</description>

      <title>Computation of Magnetohydrodynamic Equilibria with Voigt Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents the first numerical investigation of using Voigt regularization as a method for obtaining magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibria without the assumption of nested magnetic flux surfaces. Voigt regularization modifies the MHD dynamics by introducing additional terms that vanish in the infinite-time limit, allowing for magnetic reconnection and the formation of magnetic islands, which can overlap and produce field-line chaos. The utility of this approach is demonstrated through numerical solutions of two-dimensional ideal and resistive test problems. Our results show that Voigt regularization can significantly accelerate the convergence to solutions in resistive MHD problems, while also highlighting challenges in applying the method to ideal MHD systems. This research opens up new possibilities for developing more efficient and robust MHD equilibrium solvers, which could contribute to the design and optimization of future fusion devices.</description>

      <title>Latent Space Mapping: Revolutionizing Predictive Models for Divertor Plasma Detachment Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inherent complexity of boundary plasma, characterized by multi-scale and multi-physics challenges, has historically restricted high-fidelity simulations to scientific research due to their intensive computational demands. Consequently, routine applications such as discharge control and scenario development have relied on faster, but less accurate empirical methods. This work introduces DivControlNN, a novel machine-learning-based surrogate model designed to address these limitations by enabling quasi-real-time predictions (i.e., $\sim0.2$ ms) of boundary and divertor plasma behavior. Trained on over 70,000 2D UEDGE simulations from KSTAR tokamak equilibria, DivControlNN employs latent space mapping to efficiently represent complex divertor plasma states, achieving a computational speed-up of over $10^8$ compared to traditional simulations while maintaining a relative error below 20% for key plasma property predictions. During the 2024 KSTAR experimental campaign, a prototype detachment control system powered by DivControlNN successfully demonstrated detachment control on its first attempt, even for a new tungsten divertor configuration and without any fine-tuning. These results highlight the transformative potential of DivControlNN in overcoming diagnostic challenges in future fusion reactors by providing fast, robust, and reliable predictions for advanced integrated control systems.</description>

      <title>Runaway electron generation in disruptions mitigated by deuterium and noble gas injection in SPARC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the critical challenges in future high current tokamaks is the avoidance of runaway electrons during disruptions. Here, we investigate disruptions mitigated with combined deuterium and noble gas injection in SPARC. We use multi-objective Bayesian optimization and take into account limits on the maximum runaway current, the transported fraction of the heat loss, and the current quench time. The simulations are conducted using the numerical framework DREAM (Disruption Runaway Electron Analysis Model). We show that during deuterium operation, runaway generation can be avoided with material injection, even when we account for runaway electron generation from DD-induced Compton scattering. However, when including the latter, the operational space of successful mitigation is reduced. During deuterium-tritium operation, acceptable levels of runaway current and transported heat losses are only obtainable at the highest levels of achievable injected deuterium densities. Furthermore, disruption mitigation is found to be more favourable when combining deuterium with neon, compared to deuterium combined with helium or argon.</description>

      <title>An Electromagnetic Particle-Particle Model on Solving Relativistic Binary Collision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the significant advancements in parallel computing techniques, the particle-particle (PP) model has been effectively utilized in various plasma-related applications. However, PP has been limited for solving only electrostatic problems under Coulomb's law, by analogy to the particle-in-cell (PIC) model solving Poisson's equation. While electromagnetic PIC is common with coupled solutions of Maxwell's equations, we propose an electromagnetic (EM) PP model taking advantage of Lienard-Wiechert potentials for point charge in this paper. In addition, this EM-PP model can contribute to simulate relativistic binary collisions with high accuracy, thus its results are used as a baseline to compare with the classical Frankel's relativistic scattering angle, and the accuracy and applicable scope of Frankel's formula are discussed.</description>

      <title>Coherently enhanced radiation friction in laser-plasma collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reconsider the footprints of radiation friction in a head on collision of a bunch of relativistic charged particles with a laser pulse by demonstrating that in a dense enough bunch forward and backward radiation and radiation friction are coherently enhanced. This should make it possible to observe radiation friction effects in laser-matter interactions at much lower energies and laser intensities than accepted ever previously. A simple estimate for the energy losses of the particles in the bunch over the collision due to radiation friction in terms of laser and bunch parameters is derived and validated by comparing with the results of three dimensional particle-in-cell simulations.</description>

      <title>Interpreting AI for Fusion: an application to Plasma Profile Analysis for Tearing Mode Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI models have demonstrated strong predictive capabilities for various tokamak instabilities--including tearing modes (TM), ELMs, and disruptive events--but their opaque nature raises concerns about safety and trustworthiness when applied to fusion power plants. Here, we present a physics-based interpretation framework using a TM prediction model as a first demonstration that is validated through a dedicated DIII-D TM avoidance experiment. By applying Shapley analysis, we identify how profiles such as rotation, temperature, and density contribute to the model's prediction of TM stability. Our analysis shows that in our experimental scenario, peaked rotation profiles are lightly stabilizing, but core electron temperature and density profile shape play the primary role in TM stability. This work offers a generalizable ML-based event prediction methodology, from training to physics-driven interpretability, bridging the gap between physics understanding and opaque ML models.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of quantum relativistic diffusion via quantum walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.09791</link>
      <description>arXiv:1911.09791v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two models are first presented, of one-dimensional discrete-time quantum walk (DTQW) with temporal noise on the internal degree of freedom (i.e., the coin): (i) a model with both a coin-flip and a phase-flip channel, and (ii) a model with random coin unitaries. It is then shown that both these models admit a common limit in the spacetime continuum, namely, a Lindblad equation with Dirac-fermion Hamiltonian part and, as Lindblad jumps, a chirality flip and a chirality-dependent phase flip, which are two of the three standard error channels for a two-level quantum system. This, as one may call it, Dirac Lindblad equation, provides a model of quantum relativistic spatial diffusion, which is evidenced both analytically and numerically. This model of spatial diffusion has the intriguing specificity of making sense only with original unitary models which are relativistic in the sense that they have chirality, on which the noise is introduced: The diffusion arises via the by-construction (quantum) coupling of chirality to the position. For a particle with vanishing mass, the model of quantum relativistic diffusion introduced in the present work, reduces to the well-known telegraph equation, which yields propagation at short times, diffusion at long times, and exhibits no quantumness. Finally, the results are extended to temporal noises which depend smoothly on position.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Solving Forward and Inverse PDEs with Limited and Noisy Data: Application to Solar Corona Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I will demonstrate the effectiveness of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) when training data are scarce or noisy. The training data can be located either at the boundaries or within the domain. Additionally, PINNs can be used as an inverse method to determine unknown coefficients in the equations. This study will highlight the application of PINNs in modeling magnetohydrodynamic processes relevant to strongly magnetized plasmas, such as those found in the solar corona.</description>

      <title>Effect of interparticle fields and radiation reaction on beam dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17832v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamics of relativistic particles in an intense electromagnetic field can be described by the Landau-Lifshitz (LL) equation, where radiation reaction (RR) is accounted for via a self-force, and interparticle fields are often neglected as an approximation. However, the inclusion of interparticle fields is necessary to ensure energy-momentum conservation, particularly during coherent emission. Here, we present: (i) an analytical proof showing that the energy-momentum conservation law of the Hamilton-Rohrlich-Dirac action, which is divergence-free and describes a generic system of interacting charges, respects causality and provides physically sensible results; (ii) a simple generalization of the LL equation for many particles evaluated as a function of the total field, i.e., the sum of the external and interparticle fields. By performing first-principles numerical simulations of a neutral, relativistic bunch of electrons and positrons ($e^-/e^+$) colliding with a laser pulse, this theory is shown to satisfy energy-momentum conservation when interparticle fields and RR are simultaneously taken into account; and (iii) the combined effect of interparticle fields and RR primarily affects the tail of the particle energy distribution. Additionally, our first-principles simulations show that the effect of interparticle fields on beam energy loss becomes smaller when most of the radiated energy is incoherent.</description>

      <title>Experimental Observation of Motion of Ions in a Resonantly Driven Plasma Wakefield Accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16361v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show experimentally that an effect of motion of ions, observed in a plasma-based accelerator, depends inversely on the plasma ion mass. The effect appears within a single wakefield event and manifests itself as a bunch tail, occurring only when sufficient motion of ions suppresses wakefields. Wakefields are driven resonantly by multiple bunches, and simulation results indicate that the ponderomotive force causes the motion of ions. In this case, the effect is also expected to depend on the amplitude of the wakefields, experimentally confirmed through variations in the drive bunch charge.</description>
