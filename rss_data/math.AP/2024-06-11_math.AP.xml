      <title>Spectral properties of the Kramers-Fokker-Planck operator with a long-range potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study real resonances and embedded eigenvalues of the Kramers--Fokker--Planck operator with a long-range potential. We prove that thresholds are only possible accumulation points of eigenvalues and that the limiting absorption principle holds true for energies outside an exceptional set. We also prove that the eigenfunctions associated with discrete eigenvalues decay exponentially and those associated with embedded non-threshold ones decay polynomially.</description>

      <title>Long distance propagation of light in random media with partially coherent sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical beam propagation in random media is characterized by familiar speckle patterns generated by intricate interference effects. Such patterns may be modified and possibly attenuated for partially coherent incident beam profiles. In the weak-coupling regime of the It\^o-Schr\"odinger paraxial model of wave propagation, we show how the spatio-temporal statistics of the partially coherent beams interact with the statistics of the random medium to enhance or suppress scintillation effects.</description>

      <title>Instability of singular equilibria of a wave kinetic equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the singular Rayleigh-Jeans equilibrium of the $4$-waves kinetic turbulence equation for the three dimensional Schr\"{o}dinger equation. We first show the formation in finite time of a Dirac measure at zero frequency in the solution of the wave kinetic equation when the initial data has the form of Rayleigh-Jeans, truncated at large values of the energy. The initial value problem for the linearization around the singular Rayleigh-Jeans equilibria is then solved in several functional spaces. Then, long time convergence to a Dirac measure at the origin is described in detail for some of the solutions. This determines a basin of attraction of the Dirac measure.</description>

      <title>Global stability of large Fourier mode for 3-D anisotropic Navier-Stokes equations in cylindrical domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we first establish the global existence and stability of solutions to 3-D classical Navier-Stokes equations $(NS)$ in an infinite cylindrical domain with large Fourier mode initial data. Then we extend similar result for 3-D anisotropic Navier-Stokes equations $(ANS).$ We remark that due to the loss of vertical viscosity in $(ANS),$ the construction of the energy functionals for $(ANS)$ is much more subtle than that of $(NS).$ Compared with our previous paper for $(NS)$, we improve the polynomial decay in $k$ for the Fourier coefficients of the solution to be exponential decay in $k$ here.</description>

      <title>On Onsager's type conjecture for the inviscid Boussinesq equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Cauchy problem for the three dimensional inviscid Boussinesq system in the periodic setting. For $1\le p\le \infty$, we show that the threshold regularity exponent for $L^p$-norm conservation of temperature of this system is $1/3$, consistent with Onsager exponent. More precisely, for $1\le p\le\infty$, every weak solution $(v,\theta)\in C_tC^{\beta}_x$ to the inviscid Boussinesq equations satisfies that $\|\theta(t)\|_{L^p(\mathbb{T}^3)}=\|\theta_0\|_{L^p(\mathbb{T}^3)}$ if $\beta&gt;\frac{1}{3}$, while if $\beta&lt;\frac{1}{3}$, there exist infinitely many weak solutions $(v,\theta)\in C_tC^{\beta}_x$ such that the $L^p$-norm of temperature is not conserved. As a byproduct, we are able to construct many weak solutions in $C_tC^{\beta}_x$ for $\beta&lt;\frac{1}{3}$ displaying wild behavior, such as fast kinetic energy dissipation and high oscillation of velocity. Moreover, we also show that if a weak solution $(v, \theta)$ of this system has at least one interval of regularity, then this weak solution $(v,\theta)$ is not unique in $C_tC^{\beta}_x$ for $\beta&lt;\frac{1}{3}$.</description>

      <title>Boundary-field formulation for transient electromagnetic scattering by dielectric scatterers and coated conductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the transient scattered and transmitted fields generated when an incident electromagnetic wave impinges on a dielectric scatterer or a coated conductor embedded in an infinite space. By applying a boundary-field equation method, we reformulate the problem in the Laplace domain using the electric field equation inside the scatterer and a system of boundary integral equations for the scattered electric field in free space. To analyze this nonlocal boundary problem, we replace it by an equivalent boundary value problem. Existence, uniqueness and stability of the weak solution to the equivalent BVP are established in appropriate function spaces in terms of the Laplace transformed variable. The stability bounds are translated into time-domain estimates which determine the regularity of the solution in terms of the regularity of the problem data. These estimates can be easily converted into error estimates for a numerical discretization on the convolution quadrature for time evolution.</description>

      <title>Monge-Amp\`ere equation with Guillemin boundary condition in high dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Guillemin boundary condition appears naturally in the study of K\"ahler geometry of toric manifolds. In the present paper, the following Guillemin boundary value problem is investigated \begin{align} \label{eq1} &amp;\det D^2 u=\frac{h(x)}{\prod_{i=1}^N l_i(x)},\quad\text{in}\quad\quad P\subset\mathbb R^n, \quad\quad \quad \quad\quad \quad \quad \quad\quad (1)\\ \label{bdy1} &amp;u(x)-\sum_{i=1}^N l_i(x)\ln l_i(x)\in C^\infty(\overline{P}). \quad\quad\quad\quad \quad \quad\quad \quad \quad \quad\quad\quad (2)
  \end{align}
  Here
  \begin{equation*}
  0&lt;h(x)\in C^\infty(\overline{P}),\quad P=\cap_{i=1}^N \{l_i(x)&gt;0\}
  \end{equation*}
  is a simple convex polytope in $\mathbb R^n$. The solvability of (1)-(2) is given under the necessary and sufficient condition. The key issue in the proof is to obtain the boundary regularity of $u(x)-\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^N l_i(x)\ln l_i(x)$. Due to the difficulty caused by the structure of the equation itself and the singularity of $\partial P$, we need to pay special attention to the influence of the difference of singularity types at different positions on $\partial P$ on the behavior of $u$ in its vicinity.</description>

      <title>Singular extension of critical Sobolev mappings with values into complete Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Triggered by a recent criterion, due to A.~Petrunin [17], to check if a complete, non-compact, Riemannian manifold admits an isometric embedding into a Euclidean space with positive reach, we extend to manifolds with such property the singular extension results of B.~Bulanyi and J.~Van~Schaftingen [5] for maps in the critical, nonlinear Sobolev space $W^{m/(m+1),m+1}\left(X^m,\mathcal{N}\right)$, where $m \in \mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\}$, $\mathcal{N}$ is a compact Riemannian manifold, and $X^m$ is either the sphere $\mathbb{S}^m = \partial \mathbb{B}^{m+1}_+$, the plane $\mathbb{R}^m$, or again $\mathbb{S}^m$ but seen as the boundary sphere of the Poincar\'{e} ball model of the hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^{m+1}$. As in [5], we obtain that the extended maps satisfy an exponential weak-type Sobolev-Marcinkiewicz estimate. Finally, we provide some illustrative examples.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness of the defocusing, cubic nonlinear wave equation outside of the ball with radial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the defocusing, cubic nonlinear wave equation with zero Dirichlet boundary value in the exterior $\Omega = \R^3\backslash \bar{ B}(0,1)$. We make use of the distorted Fourier transform in \cite{LiSZ:NLS, Taylor:PDE:II} to establish the dispersive estimate and the global-in-time (endpoint) Strichartz estimate of the linear wave equation outside of the ball with radial data. As an application, we combine the Fourier truncation method as those in \cite{Bourgain98:FTM, GallPlan03:NLW, KenigPV00:NLW} with the energy method to show global well-posedness of radial solution to the defoucusing, cubic nonlinear wave equation outside of a ball in the Sobolev space $\left(\dot H^{s}_{D}(\Omega) \cap L^4(\Omega) \right)\times \dot H^{s-1}_{D}(\Omega)$ with $s&gt;3/4$. To the best of the author's knowledge, it is first result about low regularity of semilinear wave equation with zero Dirichlet boundary value on the exterior domain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05762v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider 3D Klein-Gordon-Zakharov (KGZ) and Dirac-Klein-Gordon (DKG) systems, where a common feature is that there exist both massless and massive fields in each system. We establish global existence and asymptotic behavior for both systems with a class of large data. More precisely, in the KGZ system, we allow the massless field to be large, while in the DKG system we allow the massive field to be large.</description>

      <title>Higher order fractional weighted homogeneous spaces: characterization and finer embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, for $N \geq 2, s \in (1,2), p\in (1, \frac{N}{s}), \sigma=s-1 $ and $a \in [0, \frac{N-sp}{2})$, we establish an isometric isomorphism between the higher order fractional weighted Beppo-Levi space \begin{align*}
  {\mathcal D}^{s,p}_a(\mathbb{R}^N) := \overline{\mathcal{C}_c^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^N)}^{[\cdot]_{s,p,a}} \text{ where } [u]_{s,p,a} := \left( \iint_{\mathbb{R}^N \times \mathbb{R}^N} \frac{\left| \nabla u(x) -\nabla u(y) \right|^p}{\left|x-y \right|^{N+\sigma p}} \, \frac{\mathrm{d}x}{|x|^a} \frac{\mathrm{d}y}{|y|^a} \right)^{\frac{1}{p}}, \end{align*} and higher order fractional weighted homogeneous space \begin{align*}
  \mathring{W}^{s,p}_a(\mathbb{R}^N):= \left\{u \in L_a^{p^*_s}(\mathbb{R}^N): \| \nabla u \|_{L_a^{p^*_{\sigma}}(\mathbb{R}^N)} + [u]_{s,p,a} &lt; \infty \right\} \end{align*} with the weighted Lebesgue norm \begin{align*}
  \| u \|_{L_a^{p^*_{\alpha}}(\mathbb{R}^N)}:= \left( \int_{\mathbb{R}^N} \frac{ |u(x)|^{p^*_{\alpha}}}{|x|^{\frac{2ap^*_{\alpha}}{p}}} \, {\mathrm{d}x} \right)^{\frac{1}{p^*_{\alpha}}}, \text{ where } p^*_{\alpha}=\frac{Np}{N-\alpha p} \text{ for } \alpha= s,\sigma. \end{align*} To achieve this, we prove that $\mathcal{C}_c^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^N)$ is dense in $\mathring{W}^{s,p}_a(\mathbb{R}^N)$ with respect to $[\cdot]_{s,p,a}$, and $[\cdot]_{s,p,a}$ is an equivalent norm on $\mathring{W}^{s,p}_a(\mathbb{R}^N)$. Further, we obtain a finer embedding of ${\mathcal D}^{s,p}_a(\mathbb{R}^N)$ into the Lorentz space $L^{\frac{Np}{N-sp-2a}, p}(\mathbb{R}^N)$, where $L^{\frac{Np}{N-sp-2a}, p}(\mathbb{R}^N) \subsetneq L_a^{p^*_s}(\mathbb{R}^N)$.</description>

      <title>Existence of Positive Solutions for Generalized Fractional Br\'{e}zis-Nirenberg Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the fractional Br\'{e}zis-Nirenberg type problem on whole domain $\mathbb{R}^N$ associated with the fractional $p$-Laplace operator. To be precise, we want to study the following problem: \begin{equation*}
  (-\Delta)_{p}^{s}u - \lambda w |u|^{p-2}u= |u|^{p_{s}^{*}-2}u \quad \text{in} ~\mathcal{D}^{s,p}(\mathbb{R}^{N}), \end{equation*} where $s\in (0,1),~p \in (1,\frac{N}{s}), ~p_{s}^{*}= \frac{Np}{N-sp}$ and the operator $(-\Delta)_{p}^{s}$ is the fractional $p$-Laplace operator. The space $\mathcal{D}^{s,p}(\mathbb{R}^{N})$ is the completion of $C_c^\infty(\mathbb{R}^N)$ with respect to the Gaglairdo semi-norm. In this article, we prove the existence of a positive solution to this problem by allowing the Hardy weight $w$ to change its sign.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of non-unique solutions of finite kinetic energy for the three dimensional Navier-Stokes equations is proved in the slightly supercritical hyper-dissipative setting introduced by Tao. The result is based on the convex integration techniques of Buckmaster and Vicol and extends Luo and Titi result in the slightly supercritical setting. To be able to be closer to the threshold identified by Tao, we introduce the impulsed Beltrami flows, a variant of the intermittent Beltrami flows of Buckmaster and Vicol.</description>

      <title>Strong Convergence of Vorticities in the 2D Viscosity Limit on a Bounded Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the vanishing viscosity limit from the Navier-Stokes to Euler equations on domains with boundaries, a main difficulty comes from the mismatch of boundary conditions and, consequently, the possible formation of a boundary layer. Within a purely interior framework, Constantin and Vicol showed that the two-dimensional viscosity limit is justified for any arbitrary but finite time under the assumption that on each compactly contained subset of the domain, the enstrophies are bounded uniformly along the viscosity sequence. Within this framework, we upgrade to local strong convergence of the vorticities under a similar assumption on the $p$-enstrophies, $p&gt;2$. The key novel idea is the analysis of the evolution of the weak convergence defect.</description>

      <title>Imaging of seabed topography from the scattering of water waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of reconstructing the seabed topography from observations of surface gravity waves. We formulate the problem as a classical inverse scattering problem using the mild-slope equation, and analyze the topographic dependence of the forward and inverse problem. Moreover, we propose a useful model simplification that makes the inverse problem much more tractable. As water waves allow for observations of the full wave field, it differs quite a lot from the classical inverse scattering problems, and we utilize this to prove a conditional stability result for the inverse problem. Last, we develop a simple and fast numerical inversion method and test it on synthetic data to verify our analysis.</description>

      <title>Large population limit of interacting population dynamics via generalized gradient structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter focuses on the derivation of a doubly nonlocal Fisher-KPP model, which is a macroscopic nonlocal evolution equation describing population dynamics in the large population limit. The derivation starts from a microscopic individual-based model described as a stochastic process on the space of atomic measures with jump rates that satisfy detailed balance w.r.t. to a reference measure. We make use of the so-called `cosh' generalized gradient structure for the law of the process to pass to the large population limit using evolutionary Gamma-convergence. In addition to characterizing the large population limit as the solution of the nonlocal Fisher-KPP model, our variational approach further provides a generalized gradient flow structure for the limit equation as well as an entropic propagation of chaos result.</description>

Abstract: As a continuum model for compressible fluid flows, Howard Brenner proposed the so-called Brenner-Navier-Stokes-Fourier(BNSF) system that improves some flaws of the Navier-Stokes-Fourier(NSF) system. For BNSF system, the volume velocity concept is introduced and is far different from the mass velocity of NSF, since the density of a compressible fluid is inhomogeneous. Although BNSF was introduced more than ten years ago, the mathematical study on BNSF is still in its infancy. We consider the BNSF system in the Lagrangian mass coordinates. We prove the existence and uniqueness of monotone traveling wave solutions to the BNSF system. We also present some quantitative estimates for them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we establish the well-posedness of the Cauchy problem for a class of pseudo-differential hyperbolic equations on the torus. The class considered here includes a space-like fractional order Laplacians. By applying the toroidal pseudo-differential calculus we establish regularity estimates, existence and uniqueness in the scale of the standard Sobolev spaces on the torus</description>

      <title>Perron solutions and boundary regularity for nonlocal nonlinear Dirichlet problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For nonlinear operators of fractional $p$-Laplace type, we consider two types of solutions to the nonlocal Dirichlet problem: Sobolev solutions based on fractional Sobolev spaces and Perron solutions based on superharmonic functions. These solutions give rise to two different concepts of regularity for boundary points, namely Sobolev and Perron regularity. We show that these two notions are equivalent and we also provide several characterizations of regular boundary points. Along the way, we give a new definition of Perron solutions, which is applicable to arbitrary exterior Dirichlet data $g: \Omega^c \to [-\infty,\infty]$. We obtain resolutivity and invariance results for these Perron solutions, and show that the Sobolev and Perron solutions coincide for a large class of exterior Dirichlet data. A uniqueness result for the Dirichlet problem is also obtained for the class of bounded solutions taking prescribed continuous exterior data quasieverywhere on the boundary.</description>

      <title>Mean-field games for harvesting problems: Uniqueness, long-time behaviour and weak KAM theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to study a Mean Field Game (MFG) system stemming from the harvesting of resources. Modelling the latter through a reaction-diffusion equation and the harvesters as competing rational agents, we are led to a non-local (in time and space) MFG system that consists of three equations, the study of which is quite delicate. The main focus of this paper is on the derivation of analytical results (e.g existence, uniqueness) and of long time behaviour (here, convergence to the ergodic system). We provide some explicit solutions to this ergodic system.</description>

      <title>On the biharmonic scattering by impenetrable obstacles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the direct and inverse biharmonic obstacle scattering problems in both two and three dimensions with mainly the Dirichlet boundary condition being investgated. We first derive some basic properties for the biharmonic scattering solutions, which leads to a simple criterion for the uniqueness of the direct problem. Furthermore, a new type far-field pattern for biharmonic scattering is defined, and the correspondence between the far-field pattern and scattered field is proved. Then we derive the well-posedness of the direct problem by establishing the boundary integral equation method. Finally, the inverse problem for determining the obstacle is studied. Utilizing the reciprocity relations of the far-field pattern and scattered field, we show that the obstacle can be uniquely recovered from the measurements at a fixed frequency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate on the direct and inverse scattering problem by an unbounded penetrable rough surface in a lossless medium. The cases that the transmission coefficient $\mu\neq1$ and $\mu=1$, which creates certain difficulties in the direct and inverse problem, respectively, are both considered. We first estalish the well-posedness of the direct problem using the integral equation method through an elaborate analysis. Then we carefully consider the singularity of the solutions to the problem with incident point source or hypersingular point source, where a simple and novel perspective is given for the derivation of the singularity. Finally, a global uniqueness result is proven for the inverse problem on the unique determination of the unbounded rough surface, the transmission coefficient and the wave number in the lower half plane from the measurements of the near field only on a line segment above the interface at a fixed frequency.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we review some recent results dealing with the transition between microscopic and macroscopic scales in different fields, including kinetic theory, cells movement in biology, chemotaxis, flocking phenomena and agent systems. The methodology of the mean-field approach of this study uses  the concept of marginals instead of the empirical measure paradigm.

      <title>On uniqueness in nonlocal diffuse optical tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the inverse problem of recovering the diffusion and absorption coefficients $(\sigma,q)$ in the nonlocal diffuse optical tomography equation $(-\text{div}( \sigma \nabla))^s u+q u =0$ from the (partial) Dirichlet-to-Neumann map. The purpose of this article is twofold: (i) Firstly, we show that the diffusion coefficient $\sigma$ and absorption coefficient $q$ can be recovered simultaneously. (ii) Secondly, we prove that the absorption coefficient $q$ can be determined provided $\sigma$ is known in a neighborhood of the boundary $\partial\Omega$. The key ingredients to prove these uniqueness results are the Caffarelli--Silvestre type extension technique and a novel Runge approximation related to solution spaces of two different partial differential equations, which is based on the geometric form of the Hahn--Banach theorem. The results in this work hold for any dimension $n\geq 3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove global existence of $H^2$ solutions to the Cauchy problem for the generalized derivative nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation on the 1-d torus. This answers an open problem posed by Ambrose and Simpson (2015). The key is the extraction of the terms that cause the problem in energy estimates and the construction of suitable energies so as to cancel the problematic terms out by effectively using integration by parts and the equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the asymptotic behavior of solutions to the compressible Navier-Stokes system considered on a sequence of spatial domains, whose boundaries exhibit fast oscillations with amplitude and characteristic wave length proportional to a small parameter. Imposing the full-slip boundary conditions we show that in the asymptotic limit the fluid sticks completely to the boundary, provided the oscillations are non-degenerate, meaning not oriented in a single direction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inverse scattering problem for the two-dimensional nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation $u_{tt}-\Delta u + u = \mathcal{N}(u)$ is studied. We assume that the unknown nonlinearity $\mathcal{N}$ of the equation satisfies $\mathcal{N}\in C^\infty(\mathbb{R};\mathbb{R})$, $\mathcal{N}^{(k)}(y)=O(|y|^{\max\{ 3-k,0 \}})$ ($y \to 0$) and $\mathcal{N}^{(k)}(y)=O(e^{c y^2})$ ($|y| \to \infty$) for any $k=0,1,2,\cdots$. Here, $c$ is a positive constant. We establish a reconstraction formula of $\mathcal{N}^{(k)}(0)$ ($k=3,4,5,\cdots$) by the knowledge of the scattering operator for the equation. As an application, we also give an expression for higher order G\^{a}teaux differentials of the scattering operator at 0.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $p$-Adic divergence and gradient operators are constructed giving rise to $p$-adic vertex Laplacian operators used by Z\'u\~niga in order to study Turing patterns on graphs, as well as their edge Laplacian counterparts. It is shown that the Euler characteristic of a finite graph can be expressed via traces of certain heat kernels associated with these new operators. This result is applied to the extraction of topological information from Mumford curves via heat kernels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the validity of the Phragm\`en-Lindel\"of principle for a class of elliptic equations with a potential, posed on infinite graphs. Consequently, we get uniqueness, in the class of solutions satisfying a suitable growth condition at infinity. We suppose that the {\it outer degree (or outer curvature)} of the graph is bounded from above, and we allow the potential to go to zero at infinity in a controlled way. Finally, we discuss the optimality of the condition on the potential on symmetric trees and on the integer lattice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the volume preserving flow of smooth, closed and convex hypersurfaces in the hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^{n+1}$ with speed given by a general nonhomogeneous function of the Gauss curvature. For a large class of speed functions, we prove that the solution of the flow remains convex, exists for all positive time $t\in [0,\infty)$ and converges to a geodesic sphere exponentially as $t\to\infty$ in the smooth topology. A key step is to show the $L^1$ oscillation decay of the Gauss curvature to its average along a subsequence of times going to the infinity, which combined with an argument using the hyperbolic curvature measure theory implies the Hausdorff convergence.</description>

      <title>Adversarial flows: A gradient flow characterization of adversarial attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05376v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A popular method to perform adversarial attacks on neuronal networks is the so-called fast gradient sign method and its iterative variant. In this paper, we interpret this method as an explicit Euler discretization of a differential inclusion, where we also show convergence of the discretization to the associated gradient flow. To do so, we consider the concept of p-curves of maximal slope in the case $p=\infty$. We prove existence of $\infty$-curves of maximum slope and derive an alternative characterization via differential inclusions. Furthermore, we also consider Wasserstein gradient flows for potential energies, where we show that curves in the Wasserstein space can be characterized by a representing measure on the space of curves in the underlying Banach space, which fulfill the differential inclusion. The application of our theory to the finite-dimensional setting is twofold: On the one hand, we show that a whole class of normalized gradient descent methods (in particular signed gradient descent) converge, up to subsequences, to the flow, when sending the step size to zero. On the other hand, in the distributional setting, we show that the inner optimization task of adversarial training objective can be characterized via $\infty$-curves of maximum slope on an appropriate optimal transport space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider prescribed mean curvature equations whose solutions are minimal surfaces, constant mean curvature surfaces, or capillary surfaces. We consider both Dirichlet boundary conditions for Plateau problems and nonlinear Neumann boundary conditions for capillary problems and we consider domains in $\mathbf{R}^2$ to be rectangles, disks, or annuli.
  We present spectral methods for approximating solutions of the associated boundary value problems. These are either based on Chebyshev or Chebyshev-Fourier methods depending on the geometry of the domain. The non-linearity in the prescribed mean curvature equations is treated with a Newton method. The algorithms are designed to be adaptive; if the prescribed tolerances are not met then the resolution of the solution is increased until the tolerances are achieved. 22</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the online machine learning problem of prediction with expert advice in an adversarial setting through numerical analysis of, and experiments with, a related partial differential equation. The problem is a repeated two-person game involving decision-making at each step informed by $n$ experts in an adversarial environment. The continuum limit of this game over a large number of steps is a degenerate elliptic equation whose solution encodes the optimal strategies for both players. We develop numerical methods for approximating the solution of this equation in relatively high dimensions ($n\leq 10$) by exploiting symmetries in the equation and the solution to drastically reduce the size of the computational domain. Based on our numerical results we make a number of conjectures about the optimality of various adversarial strategies, in particular about the non-optimality of the COMB strategy.</description>

Abstract: We set up, at the abstract Hilbert space setting, the general question on when an inverse linear problem induced by an operator of Friedrichs type admits solutions belonging to (the closure of) the Krylov subspace associated to such operator. Such Krylov solvability of abstract Friedrichs systems allows to predict when, for concrete differential inverse problems, truncation algorithms can or cannot reproduce the exact solutions in terms of approximants from the Krylov subspace.</description>

      <title>The Nodal Sets of Solutions to Parabolic Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the parabolic equations $\partial_t u=\partial_j\left(a^{ij}(x,t)\partial_iu\right)+b^j(x,t)\partial_ju+c(x,t)u$ in a domain of $\mathbb{R}^n$ under the condition that $a^{ij}$ are Lipschitz continuous. Consider the nodal set $Z_t=\{x: u(x,t)=0\}$ at a time $t$-slice. Simple examples show that the singular set $\mathcal{S}_t=\{x: u(x,t)=|\nabla_x u|(x,t)=0\}$ may coincide with nodal set. This makes the methods used in the study of nodal sets for elliptic equations fail, rendering the parabolic case much more complicated.
  The current strongest results in the literature establish the finiteness of the $(n-1)$-dimensional Hausdorff measure of $Z_t$, assuming either $n=1$ by Angenent or that the coefficients are time-independent and analytic by Lin. With general coefficients, the codimension-one estimate was obtained under some doubling assumption by Han-Lin but only for space-time nodal sets. In the first part, we prove that $\mathcal{H}^{n-1}(Z_t) &lt; \infty$ in full generality, i.e. for any dimension, with time-dependent coefficients and with merely Lipschitz regular leading coefficients $a^{ij}$.
  In the second part, we study the evolutionary behavior of nodal sets. When $n=1$, it is proved by Angenent that the number of nodal points is non-increasing in time. For the $n$-dimensional case, we construct examples showing that measure monotonicity fails. In contrast, we prove dimension monotonicity, i.e., the Hausdorff dimension of the nodal set is non-increasing in time. This is the first monotonicity property for nodal sets in general dimensions. All the assumptions here are sharp.</description>

      <title>A model for slowing particles in random media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a simple model in dimension $d\geq 2$ for slowing particles in random media, where point particles move in straight lines among and inside spherical identical obstacles with Poisson distributed centres. When crossing an obstacle, a particle is slowed down according to the law $\dot{V}= -\frac{\kappa}{\epsilon} S(|V|) V$, where $V$ is the velocity of the point particle, $\kappa$ is a positive constant, $\epsilon$ is the radius of the obstacle and $S(|V|)$ is a given slowing profile. With this choice, the slowing rate in the obstacles is such that the variation of speed at each crossing is of order $1$. We study the asymptotic limit of the particle system when $\epsilon$ vanishes and the mean free path of the point particles stays finite. We prove the convergence of the point particles density measure to the solution of a kinetic-like equation with a collision term which includes a contribution proportional to a $\delta$ function in $v=0$; this contribution guarantees the conservation of mass for the limit equation.</description>

      <title>Discrete vs. continuous in the semiclassical limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compare the bottom of the spectrum of discrete and continuous Schr\"odinger operators with periodic potentials with barriers at the boundaries of their fundamental domains. Our results show that these energy levels coincide in the semiclassical limit and we provide an explicit rate of convergence. We demonstrate the optimality of our results by using Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization conditions for potentials exhibiting non-degenerate wells, and by numerical experiments for more general potentials. We also investigate the dependence of the spectrum of the discrete semiclassical Schr\"odinger operator on the semiclassical parameter $h$ and show that it can be discontinuous.</description>

      <title>Wick rotation in the lapse: admissible complex metrics and the associated heat kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Wick rotation in the lapse (not in time) is introduced that interpolates between Riemannian and Lorentzian metrics on real manifolds admitting a co-dimension one foliation. The definition refers to a fiducial foliation but covariance under foliation changing diffeomorphisms is ensured. In particular, the resulting complex metrics are admissible in the sense of Kontsevich-Segal in all (fiducial and non-fiducial) foliations. This setting is used to construct a Wick rotated heat semigroup, which remains well-defined into the near Lorentzian regime. Among the results established for the Wick rotated version are: (i) Existence as an analytic semigroup uniquely determined by its sectorial generator. (ii) Construction of an integral kernel that is jointly smooth in the semigroup time and both spacetime arguments. (iii) Existence of an asymptotic expansion for the kernel's diagonal in (shifted) powers of the semigroup time whose coefficients are the Seeley-deWitt coefficients evaluated on the complex metrics. (iv) Emergence of a Schr\"{o}dinger evolution group in the strict Lorentzian limit. The toolbox includes local regularity results for admissible complex metrics.</description>

Abstract: The aim of this article is to show a local-in-time existence of a strong solution to the generalized compressible Navier-Stokes equation for arbitrarily large initial data. The goal is reached by $L^p$-theory for linearized equations which are obtained with help of the Weis multiplier theorem and can be seen as generalization of the work of Shibata and Enomoto (devoted to compressible fluids) to compressible non-Newtonian fluids.</description>

      <title>Symmetric doubly periodic gravity-capillary waves with small vorticity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.13093v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct small amplitude gravity-capillary water waves with small nonzero vorticity, in three spatial dimensions, bifurcating from uniform flows. The waves are symmetric, and periodic in both horizontal coordinates. The proof is inspired by Lortz' construction of magnetohydrostatic equilibria in reflection-symmetric toroidal domains. It relies on a global representation of the vorticity as the cross product of two gradients, and on prescribing a functional relationship between the Bernoulli function and the orbital period of the water particles. The presence of the free surface introduces significant new challenges. In particular, the resulting free boundary problem is not elliptic, and the involved maps incur a loss of regularity under Fr\'echet differentiation. Nevertheless, we show that a version of the Crandall-Rabinowitz local bifurcation method applies, by carefully tracking the loss of regularity.</description>

      <title>On the Keller-Segel models interacting with a stochastically forced incompressible viscous flow in $\mathbb{R}^2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.07217v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers the Keller-Segel model coupled to stochastic Navier-Stokes equations (KS-SNS, for short), which describes the dynamics of oxygen and bacteria densities evolving within a stochastically forced incompressible viscous flow. Our main results establish the existence and uniqueness results of global solutions (strong in the probabilistic sense and weak in the PDE sense) to the KS-SNS system in $\mathbb{R}^2$. A novel approximate KS-SNS system with proper regularization and cut-off operators in $H^s(\mathbb{R}^2)$ is introduced, and the existence of approximate solution is proved by some a priori uniform bounds and a careful analysis on the approximation scheme. Under different assumptions, two types of entropy-energy functional inequalities that seem to be new in their forms are derived, which together with the Prohorov's theorem and Jakubowski-Skorokhod theorem enable us to show that the sequence of approximate solutions converges to a global martingale weak solution. Moreover, when $\chi(\cdot)\equiv \textrm{const.}&gt;0$, we prove that the solution is pathwise unique, and hence by the Yamada-Wantanabe theorem that the KS-SNS system admits a unique global pathwise weak solution.</description>

      <title>Non-uniqueness in law of the surface quasi-geostrophic equations: the case of linear multiplicative noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The momentum formulation of the surface quasi-geostrophic equations consists of two nonlinear terms, besides the pressure term, one of which cannot be written in a divergence form. When the anti-divergence operator is applied to such nonlinear terms, in general, one cannot take advantage of the differentiation operator of order minus one unless the nonlinear terms are compactly supported away from the origin in Fourier frequency. Moreover, the two nonlinear terms of the momentum surface quasi-geostrophic equations are one derivative more singular than that of the Navier-Stokes equations. Upon employing the convex integration technique to the random partial differential equations corresponding to the momentum surface quasi-geostrophic equations forced by linear multiplicative noise, these issues create various difficulties, unseen in the deterministic scenario and even in the case the noise is additive. By making a key observation in case the solution is a shear flow and rewriting the difficult stochastic commutator error in terms of the oscillation error, we prove its non-uniqueness in law.</description>

      <title>$L^\infty$ blow-up in the Jordan-Moore-Gibson-Thompson equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Jordan-Moore-Gibson-Thompson equation
  \[
  \tau u_{ttt} + \alpha u_{tt} = \beta \Delta u_t + \gamma \Delta u + (f(u))_{tt} \] is considered in a smoothly bounded domain $\Omega \subset\mathbb{R}^n$ with $n\leq 3$, where $\tau&gt;0,\beta&gt;0,\gamma&gt;0$, and $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}$.
  Firstly, it is seen that under the assumption that $f\in C^3(\mathbb{R})$ is such that $f(0)=0$, gradient blow-up phenomena cannot occur in the sense that for any appropriately regular initial data, within a suitable framework of strong solvability, an associated Dirichlet type initial-boundary value problem admits a unique solution $u$ on a maximal time interval $(0,T_{max})$ which is such that \[
  \mbox{if $T_{max}&lt;\infty$, then } \limsup_{t\nearrow T_{max}} \|u(\cdot,t)\|_{L^\infty(\Omega)}=\infty. \] This is used to, secondly, make sure that if additionally $f$ is convex and grows superlinearly in the sense that \[
  f''\ge 0
  \mbox{ on $\mathbb{R}$,}
  \qquad
  \frac{f(\xi)}{\xi} \to +\infty
  \mbox{ as $\xi\to +\infty$}
  \qquad \mbox{and} \qquad
  \int_{\xi_0}^\infty \frac{d\xi}{f(\xi)} &lt; \infty
  \mbox{ for some $\xi_0&gt;0$,} \] then for some initial data the above solution must undergo some finite-time $L^\infty$ blow-up in the style described above.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the well-posedness of transmission problems on classes of two-sided Sobolev extension domains to give variational definitions for (boundary) layer potential operators and Neumann-Poincar{\'e} operators. These classes of domains contain Lipschitz domains, and also domains with fractal boundaries. Although our variational formulation does not involve any measures on the boundary, we recover the classical results in smooth domains by considering the surface measure on the boundary. We discuss properties of these operators and generalize basic results in imaging beyond the Lipschitz case.</description>

      <title>A priori regularity estimates for equations degenerating on nodal sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove $\textit{a priori}$ and $\textit{a posteriori}$ H\"older bounds and Schauder $C^{1,\alpha}$ estimates for continuous solutions to singular/degenerate equations with variable coefficients of type $$ \mathrm{div}\left(|u|^a A\nabla w\right)=0\qquad\mathrm{in \ }\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n, $$ where the weight $u$ solves an elliptic equation of type $\mathrm{div}\left(A\nabla u\right)=0$ with a Lipschitz-continuous and uniformly elliptic matrix $A$ and has a nontrivial, possibly singular, nodal set. Such estimates are uniform with respect to $u$ in a class of normalized solutions having bounded Almgren's frequency. More precisely, we provide $\textit{a priori}$ H\"{o}lder bounds in any space dimension, and Schauder estimates when $n=2$. When $a=2$, the results apply to the ratios of two solutions to the same PDE sharing their zero sets. Then, one can infer higher order boundary Harnack principles on nodal domains by applying the Schauder estimates for solutions to the auxiliary degenerate equation. The results are based upon a fine blow-up argument, Liouville theorems and quasiconformal maps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Omega\subset\mathbb R^2$ be a chord arc domain with small constant. We show that a nontrivial harmonic function which vanishes continuously on a relatively open set of the boundary cannot have the norm of the gradient which vanishes on a subset of positive surface measure (arc length). This result was previously known to be true, and conjectured in higher dimensions by Lin, in Lipschitz domains. Let now $\Omega\subset\mathbb R^2$ be a $C^1$ domain with Dini mean oscillations. We prove that a nontrivial harmonic function which vanishes continuously on a relatively open subset of the boundary $\partial\Omega\cap B_1$ has a finite number of critical points in $\overline\Omega\cap B_{1/2}$. The latter improves some recent results by Kenig and Zhao. Our technique involves a conformal mapping which moves the boundary where the harmonic function vanishes into an interior nodal line of a new harmonic function, after a further reflection. Then, size estimates of the critical set - up to the boundary - of the original harmonic function can be understood in terms of estimates of the interior critical set of the new harmonic function and of the critical set - up to the boundary - of the conformal mapping.</description>

      <title>Steady supersonic combustion flows with a contact discontinuity in two-dimensional finitely long nozzles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with the two-dimensional steady supersonic combustion flows with a contact discontinuity moving through a nozzle of finite length. Mathematically, it can be formulated as a free boundary value problem governed by the two -dimensional steady combustion Euler equations with a contact discontinuity as the free boundary. The main mathematical difficulties are that the contact discontinuity is a characteristic free boundary and the equations for all states are coupled with each other due to the combustion process. We first employ the Lagrangian coordinate transformation to fix the free boundary. Then by introducing the flow slope and Bernoulli function, we further reduce the fixed boundary value problem into an initial boundary value problem for a first order hyperbolic system coupled with several ordinary differential equations. A new iteration scheme is developed near the background states by employing the intrinsic structure of the equation for the mass fraction of the non-combustion gas. We show that there is a fixed point for the iteration by deriving some novel $C^{1,\alpha}$-estimates of the solutions and applying the fixed point theorem, and then the uniqueness of the fixed point is proved by a contraction argument. On the other hand, a quasi-one-dimensional approximate system is often used to simplify the two-dimensional steady supersonic combustion model. The error between these two systems is estimated. Finally, given a piece-wise $C^{1,\alpha}$-solution containing a contact discontinuity with piece-wise constant states on the entrance of the nozzle, we can show that the solution is the piece-wise constant states with a straight contact discontinuity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper concerns the free boundary problem of an epidemic model. The spatial movements of the infectious agents and the infective humans are approximated by nonlocal diffusion operators. Especially, both the growth rate of the agents and the infective rate of humans are represented by nonlocal reaction terms. Thus our model has four integral terms which bring some diffculties for the study of the corresponding principal eigenvalue problem. Firstly, using some elementray analysis instead of Krein-Rutman theorem and the variational characteristic, we obtain the existence and asymptotic behaviors of principal eigenvalue. Then a spreading-vanishing dichotomy is proved to hold, and the criteria for spreading and vanishing are derived. Lastly, comparing our results with those in the existing works, we discuss the effect of nonlocal reaction term on spreading and vanishing, finding that the more nonlocal reaction terms a model has, the harder spreading happens.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.01152v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain the hydrodynamic limit of symmetric long-jumps exclusion in $\mathbb{Z}^d$ (for $d \geq 1$), where the jump rate is inversely proportional to a power of the jump's length with exponent $\gamma+1$, where $\gamma \geq 2$. Moreover, movements between $\mathbb{Z}^{d-1} \times \mathbb{Z}_{-}^{*}$ and $\mathbb{Z}^{d-1} \times \mathbb N$ are slowed down by a factor $\alpha n^{-\beta}$ (with $\alpha&gt;0$ and $\beta\geq 0$). In the hydrodynamic limit we obtain the heat equation in $\mathbb{R}^d$ without boundary conditions or with Neumann boundary conditions, depending on the values of $\beta$ and $\gamma$. The (rather restrictive) condition in \cite{casodif} (for $d=1$) about the initial distribution satisfying an entropy bound with respect to a Bernoulli product measure with constant parameter is weakened or completely dropped.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present paper, Kato's distributional inequality with magnetic field is generalized to vector-valued functions and operator-valued vector potentials. This result is then used in non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics (QED) to show that eigenstates of the Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian satisfy a subsolution estimate, and hence that any $L^2$-exponential bound in terms of a Lipschitz function implies the corresponding pointwise exponential bound. Similar pointwise bounds are also established for the one-particle density of states that are not eigenstates.</description>

      <title>Mean-Field Analysis for Learning Subspace-Sparse Polynomials with Gaussian Input</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08948v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the mean-field flow for learning subspace-sparse polynomials using stochastic gradient descent and two-layer neural networks, where the input distribution is standard Gaussian and the output only depends on the projection of the input onto a low-dimensional subspace. We propose a basis-free generalization of the merged-staircase property in Abbe et al. (2022) and establish a necessary condition for the SGD-learnability. In addition, we prove that the condition is almost sufficient, in the sense that a condition slightly stronger than the necessary condition can guarantee the exponential decay of the loss functional to zero.</description>

      <title>On weak inverse mean curvature flow and Minkowski-type inequalities in hyperbolic space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that a proper weak solution $\{ \Omega_{t} \}_{0 \leq t &lt; \infty}$ to inverse mean curvature flow in $\mathbb{H}^{n}$, $3\leq n \leq 7$, is smooth and star-shaped by the time
  \begin{equation*}
  T= (n-1) \log \left( \frac{\text{sinh} \left( r_{+} \right)}{ \text{sinh} \left( r_{-} \right)} \right), \end{equation*} where $r_{+}$ and $r_{-}$ are the geodesic out-radius and in-radius of the initial domain $\Omega_{0}$. The argument is inspired by the Alexandrov reflection method for extrinsic curvature flows in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ due to Chow-Gulliver and uses a result of Li-Wei.
  As applications, we extend the Minkowski inequalities of Brendle-Hung-Wang and De Lima-Girao to outer-minimizing domains $\Omega_{0} \subset \mathbb{H}^{n}$ in these dimensions. From this, we also extend a Penrose-type inequality to balanced asymptotically hyperbolic graphs over the exteriors of outer-minimizing domains of $\mathbb{H}^{n}$, $3 \leq n \leq 7$.</description>

      <title>Estimation of uncertainties in the density driven flow in fractured porous media using MLMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the Multi Level Monte Carlo method to estimate uncertainties in a Henry-like salt water intrusion problem with a fracture. The flow is induced by the variation of the density of the fluid phase, which depends on the mass fraction of salt. We assume that the fracture has a known fixed location but an uncertain aperture. Other input uncertainties are the porosity and permeability fields and the recharge. In our setting, porosity and permeability vary spatially and recharge is time-dependent. For each realisation of these uncertain parameters, the evolution of the mass fraction and pressure fields is modelled by a system of non-linear and time-dependent PDEs with a jump of the solution at the fracture. The uncertainties propagate into the distribution of the salt concentration, which is an important characteristic of the quality of water resources. We show that the multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) method is able to reduce the overall computational cost compared to classical Monte Carlo methods. This is achieved by balancing discretisation and statistical errors. Multiple scenarios are evaluated at different spatial and temporal mesh levels. The deterministic solver ug4 is run in parallel to calculate all stochastic scenarios.</description>

      <title>On backward problem for a time-fractional fourth order parabolic equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09424v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the inverse problem of retrieving the initial value of a time-fractional fourth order parabolic equation from source and final time observation. The considered problem is an {\it ill-posed problem.} We obtain regularized approximations for the sought initial value by employing the quasi-boundary value method, its modified version and by Fourier truncation method(FTM). We provide both the apriori and aposteriori parameter choice strategies and derive the error estimates for all these methods under some {\it source conditions} involving some Sobolev smoothness. As an important implication of the obtained rates, we observe that for both the apriori and aposteriori cases, the rates obtained by all these three methods are same for some source sets. Moreover, we observe that in both the apriori and aposteriori cases, the FTM is free from the so-called {\it saturation effect}, whereas both the quasi-boundary value method and its generalizations possesses the saturation effect for both the cases. Further, we observe that the rates obtained by the FTM is always order optimal for all the considered source sets.</description>
