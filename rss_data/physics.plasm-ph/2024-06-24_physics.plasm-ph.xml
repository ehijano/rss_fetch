      <title>Initial imprint effect on dynamic mitigation of plasma instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We proposed a dynamic mitigation method for plasma instabilities based on a phase control to mitigate plasma instabilities and to smooth plasma non-uniformities [e.g. Phys. Plasmas, 19(2012)024503]. In plasmas, perturbation phase would be unknown in general, and instability growth rate is discussed. However, if the perturbation is introduced by, for example, an illumination non-uniformity of an input energy driver beam, the perturbation phase would be defined by the driver illumination non-uniformity itself. When the driver axis is controlled by its axis oscillation or wobbling motion, the perturbation phase would be known and controlled. By the superimposition of the growing phase-controlled perturbations, the overall plasma instability growth is mitigated. The dynamic mitigation method is effective to mitigate growths of various plasma instabilities. At the same time, it was found that the phase of the growing perturbations mitigated would be still defined by the initial imprint. In this paper, the initial imprint effect is focused on the dynamic mitigation mechanism in plasmas. The results in this paper demonstrate that the initial imprint effect is reduced by a pulse shaping of the oscillating or wobbling perturbation.</description>

      <title>Investigating Instabilities in Magnetized Low-pressure Capacitively-Coupled RF Plasma using Particle-in-Cell (PIC) Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of a uniform magnetic field on particle transport in low-pressure radio frequency (RF) capacitively coupled plasma (CCP) has been studied using a particle-in-cell (PIC) model. Three distinct regimes of plasma behavior can be identified as a function of the magnetic field. In the first regime at low magnetic fields, asymmetric plasma profiles are observed within the CCP chamber due to the effect of E x B drift. As the magnetic field increases, instabilities develop and form self-organized spoke-shaped structures that are distinctly seen within the bulk plasma closer to the sheath. In this second regime, the spoke-shaped coherent structures rotate inside the plasma chamber in the - E x B direction, where E and B are the DC electric and magnetic field vectors, respectively, and the DC electric field exists in the sheath and pre-sheath regions. The spoke rotation frequency is in the MHz range. As the magnetic field strength increases further, the rotating coherent spokes continue to exist near the sheath. The coherent structures are, however, accompanied by new small-scale incoherent structures originating and moving within the bulk plasma region away from the sheath. This is the third regime of plasma behavior. The threshold values of the magnetic field between these regimes were found not to vary with changing plasma reactor geometry (e.g., area ratio between ground and powered electrodes) or the use of an external capacitor between the RF-powered electrode and the RF source. The threshold values of the magnetic field between these regimes shift toward higher values with increasing gas pressure. This paper provides guidance on the upper limit of the magnetic field for instability-free operation in low-pressure CCP-based semiconductor deposition and etch systems that use the external magnetic field for plasma uniformity control.</description>

      <title>The Unexpected Lack of Asymmetry in the Horizon-Scale Image of Sagittarius A*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ring-like images of the two supermassive black holes captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) provide powerful probes of the physics of accretion flows at horizon scales. Specifically, the brightness asymmetry in the images carries information about the angular velocity profile of the inner accretion flow and the inclination of the observer, owing to the Doppler boosts photons experience at their site of emission. In this paper, we develop a method for quantifying the brightness asymmetry of black-hole images in the Fourier domain, which can be measured directly from interferometric data. We apply this method to current EHT data and find that the image of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) has an unusually low degree of asymmetry that is even lower than that inferred for M87. We then use a covariant semi-analytic model to obtain constraints on the inclinations and velocity profiles of the inner accretion flow for Sgr A*. We find that the lack of significant brightness asymmetry forces the observer inclination to uncomfortably small values ($6-10^\circ$), if the plasma velocity follows Keplerian profiles. Alternatively, larger inclination angles can be accommodated if the plasma velocities are significantly sub-Keplerian and the black hole is not spinning rapidly.</description>

      <title>Cross-scale energy transfer from fluid-scale Alfv\'en waves to kinetic-scale ion acoustic waves in the Earth's magnetopause boundary layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In space plasmas, large-amplitude Alfv\'en waves can drive compressive perturbations, accelerate ion beams, and lead to plasma heating and the excitation of ion acoustic waves at kinetic scales. This energy channelling from fluid to kinetic scales represents a complementary path to the classical turbulent cascade. Here, we present observational and computational evidence to validate this hypothesis by simultaneously resolving the fluid-scale Alfv\'en waves, kinetic-scale ion acoustic waves, and their imprints on ion velocity distributions in the Earth's magnetopause boundary layer. We show that two coexisting compressive modes, driven by the magnetic pressure gradients of Alfv\'en waves, not only accelerate the ion tail population to the Alfv\'en velocity, but also heat the ion core population near the ion acoustic velocity and generate Debye-scale ion acoustic waves. Thus, Alfv\'en-acoustic energy channeling emerges as a viable mechanism for plasma heating near plasma boundaries where large-amplitude Alfv\'en waves are present.</description>

      <title>An asymptotic Grad-Shafranov equation for quasisymmetric stellarators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08022v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A first-order model is derived for quasisymmetric stellarators where the vacuum field due to coils is dominant, but plasma-current-induced terms are not negligible and can contribute to magnetic differential equations, with $\beta$ of the order of the ratio of induced to vacuum fields. Under these assumptions, it is proven that the aspect ratio must be large and a simple expression can be obtained for the lowest-order vacuum field. The first-order correction, which involves both vacuum and current-driven fields, is governed by a Grad-Shafranov equation and the requirement that flux surfaces exist. These two equations are not always consistent, and so this model is generally overconstrained, but special solutions exist that satisfy both equations simultaneously. One family of such solutions are the first-order near-axis solutions. Thus, the first-order near-axis model is a subset of the model presented here. Several other solutions outside the scope of the near-axis model are also found. A case study comparing one such solution to a VMEC-generated solution shows good agreement.</description>
