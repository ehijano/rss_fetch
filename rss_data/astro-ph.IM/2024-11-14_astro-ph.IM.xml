      <title>Application of Machine Learning Methods for Detecting Atypical Structures in Astronomical Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper explores the use of various machine learning methods to search for heterogeneous or atypical structures on astronomical maps. The study was conducted on the maps of the cosmic microwave background radiation from the Planck mission obtained at various frequencies. The algorithm used found a number of atypical anomalous structures in the actual maps of the Planck mission. This paper details the machine learning model used and the algorithm for detecting anomalous structures. A map of the position of such objects has been compiled. The results were compared with known astrophysical processes or objects. Future research involves expanding the dataset and applying various algorithms to improve the detection and classification of outliers.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear techniques for few-mode wavefront sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present several nonlinear wavefront sensing techniques for few-mode sensors, all of which are empirically calibrated and agnostic to the choice of wavefront sensor. The first class of techniques involves a straightforward extension of the linear phase retrieval scheme to higher order; the resulting Taylor polynomial can then be solved using the method of successive approximations, though we discuss alternate methods such as homotopy continuation. In the second class of techniques, a model of the WFS intensity response is created using radial basis function interpolation. We consider both forward models, which map phase to intensity and can be solved with nonlinear least-squares methods such as the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, as well as backwards models which directly map intensity to phase and do not require a solver. We provide demonstrations for both types of techniques in simulation using a quad-cell sensor and a photonic lantern wavefront sensor as examples. Next, we demonstrate how the nonlinearity of an arbitrary sensor may studied using the method of numerical continuation, and apply this technique both to the quad-cell sensor and a photonic lantern sensor. Finally, we briefly consider the extension of nonlinear techniques to polychromatic sensors.</description>

      <title>Coupled-mode theory for astrophotonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coupled-mode theory (CMT) is a powerful tool for simulating near-harmonic systems. In telecommunications, variations of the theory have been used extensively to study waveguides, both analytically and through numerical modelling. Analogous mathematical techniques to the CMT are also widely used in quantum mechanics. The purpose of this work is to collect different formulations of the CMT and their underlying connections to quantum mechanical techniques, and to showcase their utility in modelling slowly varying waveguides including directional couplers and photonic lanterns. My choice of example waveguides is motivated by the astronomical applications of such devices in starlight nulling, wavefront sensing, and high-resolution spectroscopy. I first provide a brief review of the standard form of the CMT, applicable for waveguides with fixed eigenmodes. Next, I show that the CMT also applies for slowly varying waveguides, and demonstrate the close relation between the CMT and several well-known approximation methods from quantum mechanics, as well as concepts like geometric phase. Finally, I present a verification of my analysis, in the form of the numerical package cbeam.</description>

      <title>Increasing the sensitivity of stellar intensity interferometry with optical telescopes: First laboratory test of spectral multiplexing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a preliminary laboratory test of a setup designed to measure Hanbury Brown and Twiss-type intensity correlations from a chaotic light source using five spectral channels simultaneously. After averaging the zero-delay correlation peaks from all channels, we obtain an improvement of the signalto-noise ratio fairly consistent with theory. The goal is to demonstrate the feasibility and scalability of this technique to improve the sensitivity of stellar intensity interferometry using optical telescopes.</description>

      <title>Detection and classification of radio sources with deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present three different applications, based on deep learning methodologies, that we are developing to support the scientific analysis conducted within the ASKAP-EMU and MeerKAT radio surveys. One employs instance segmentation frameworks to detect compact and extended radio sources and imaging artefacts from radio continuum images. Another application uses gradient boosting decision trees and convolutional neural networks to classify compact sources into different astronomical classes using combined radio and infrared multi-band images. Finally, we discuss how self-supervised learning can be used to obtain valuable radio data representations for source detection, and classification studies.</description>

      <title>The Galactica database: an open, generic and versatile tool for the dissemination of simulation data in astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Galactica simulation database is a platform designed to assist computational astrophysicists with their open science approach based on FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles. It offers the means to publish their numerical simulation projects, whatever their field of application or research theme and provides access to reduced datasets and object catalogs online. The application implements the Simulation Datamodel IVOA standard. To provide the scientific community indirect access to raw simulation data, Galactica can generate, on an "on-demand" basis, custom high-level data products to meet specific user requirements. These data products, accessible through online WebServices, are produced remotely from the raw simulation datasets. To that end, the Galactica central web application communicates with a high-scalability ecosystem of data-processing servers called Terminus by means of an industry-proven asynchronous task management system. Each Terminus node, hosted in a research institute, a regional or national supercomputing facility, contributes to the ecosystem by providing both the storage and the computational resources required to store the massive simulation datasets and post-process them to create the data products requested on Galactica, hence guaranteeing fine-grained sovereignty over data and resources. This distributed architecture is very versatile, it can be interfaced with any kind of data-processing software, written in any language, handling raw data produced by every type of simulation code used in the field of computational astrophysics. Its generality and versatility, together with its excellent scalability makes it a powerful tool for the scientific community to disseminate numerical models in astrophysics in the exascale era.</description>

      <title>Regression for Astronomical Data with Realistic Distributions, Errors and Non-linearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have developed a new regression technique, the maximum likelihood (ML)-based method and its variant, the KS-test based method, designed to obtain unbiased regression results from typical astronomical data. A normalizing flow model is employed to automatically estimate the unobservable intrinsic distribution of the independent variable as well as the unobservable correlation between uncertainty level and intrinsic value of both independent and dependent variables from the observed data points in a variational inference based empirical Bayes approach. By incorporating these estimated distributions, our method comprehensively accounts for the uncertainties associated with both independent and dependent variables. Our test on both mock data and real astronomical data from PHANGS-ALMA and PHANGS-JWST demonstrates that both the ML based method and the KS-test based method significantly outperform the existing widely-used methods, particularly in cases of low signal-to-noise ratios. The KS-test based method exhibits remarkable robustness against deviations from underlying assumptions, complex intrinsic distributions, varying correlations between uncertainty levels and intrinsic values, inaccuracies in uncertainty estimations, outliers, and saturation effects. We recommend the KS-test based method as the preferred choice for general applications, while the ML based method is suggested for small samples with sizes of $N &lt; 100$. A GPU-compatible Python implementation of our methods, nicknamed ``raddest'', will be made publicly available upon acceptance of this paper.</description>

      <title>AstroM$^3$: A self-supervised multimodal model for astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While machine-learned models are now routinely employed to facilitate astronomical inquiry, model inputs tend to be limited to a primary data source (namely images or time series) and, in the more advanced approaches, some metadata. Yet with the growing use of wide-field, multiplexed observational resources, individual sources of interest often have a broad range of observational modes available. Here we construct an astronomical multimodal dataset and propose AstroM$^3$, a self-supervised pre-training approach that enables a model to learn from multiple modalities simultaneously. Specifically, we extend the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) model to a trimodal setting, allowing the integration of time-series photometry data, spectra, and astrophysical metadata. In a fine-tuning supervised setting, our results demonstrate that CLIP pre-training improves classification performance for time-series photometry, where accuracy increases from 84.6% to 91.5%. Furthermore, CLIP boosts classification accuracy by up to 12.6% when the availability of labeled data is limited, showing the effectiveness of leveraging larger corpora of unlabeled data. In addition to fine-tuned classification, we can use the trained model in other downstream tasks that are not explicitly contemplated during the construction of the self-supervised model. In particular we show the efficacy of using the learned embeddings for misclassifications identification, similarity search, and anomaly detection. One surprising highlight is the "rediscovery" of Mira subtypes and two Rotational variable subclasses using manifold learning and dimension reduction algorithm. To our knowledge this is the first construction of an $n&gt;2$ mode model in astronomy. Extensions to $n&gt;3$ modes is naturally anticipated with this approach.</description>

      <title>Audience Reach of Scientific Data Visualizations in Planetarium-Screened Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantifying the global reach of planetarium dome shows presents significant challenges due to the lack of standardized viewership tracking mechanisms across diverse planetarium venues. We present an analysis of the global impact of dome shows, presenting data regarding four documentary films from a single visualization lab. Specifically, we designed and administered a viewership survey of four long-running shows that contained cinematic scientific visualizations. Reported survey data shows that between 1.2 - 2.6 million people have viewed these four films across the 68 responding planetariums (mean: 1.9 million). When we include estimates and extrapolate for the 315 planetariums that licensed these shows, we arrive at an estimate of 16.5 - 24.1 million people having seen these films (mean: 20.3 million).</description>

      <title>Spatially Resolved Galaxy-Dust Modeling with Coupled Data-Driven Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A notorious problem in astronomy is the recovery of the true shape and spectral energy distribution (SED) of a galaxy despite attenuation by interstellar dust embedded in the same galaxy. This problem has been solved for a few hundred nearby galaxies with exquisite data coverage, but these techniques are not scalable to the billions of galaxies soon to be observed by large wide-field surveys like LSST, Euclid, and Roman. We present a method for jointly modeling the spatially resolved stellar and dust properties of galaxies from multi-band images. To capture the diverse geometries of galaxies, we consider non-parametric morphologies, stabilized by two neural networks that act as data-driven priors: the first informs our inference of the galaxy's underlying morphology, the second constrains the galaxy's dust morphology conditioned on our current estimate of the galaxy morphology. We demonstrate with realistic simulations that we can recover galaxy host and dust properties over a wide range of attenuation levels and geometries. We successfully apply our joint galaxy-dust model to three local galaxies observed by SDSS. In addition to improving estimates of unattenuated galaxy SEDs, our inferred dust maps will facilitate the study of dust production, transport, and destruction.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Solar Neutrino and Astro-Particle PhYsics (SNAPPY) Cubesat is expected to launch in 2025 and it will carry into a polar orbit a prototype test detector for solar neutrino background studies while over the Earth's poles for the neutrino Solar Orbiting Laboratory future project ($\nu$SOL). During this flight it is possible to do other science measurements. One of these is an improved study of the solar wind particles through improved particle identification and energy measurements. This study aimed to understand how well could the solar wind particles be identified using the planned detector but instead of using the veto array as an anti-coincidence it would be used as a $\Delta$E energy sampling of a phoswich particle ID system.</description>

      <title>Estimating Stellar Atmospheric Parameters and [{\alpha}/Fe] for LAMOST O-M type Stars Using a Spectral Emulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we developed a spectral emulator based on the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory Stellar Library (MaStar) and a grouping optimization strategy to estimate effective temperature (T_eff), surface gravity (log g), metallicity ([Fe/H]) and the abundance of alpha elements with respect to iron ([alpha/Fe]) for O-M-type stars within the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) low-resolution spectra. The primary aim is to use a rapid spectral-fitting method, specifically the spectral emulator with the grouping optimization strategy, to create a comprehensive catalog for stars of all types within LAMOST, addressing the shortcomings in parameter estimations for both cold and hot stars present in the official LAMOST AFGKM-type catalog. This effort is part of our series of studies dedicated to establishing an empirical spectral library for LAMOST. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is effectively applicable to parameter prediction for LAMOST, with the single-machine processing time within $70$ hr. We observed that the internal error dispersions for T_eff, log g, [Fe/H], and [alpha/Fe] across different spectral types lie within the ranges of $15-594$ K, $0.03-0.27$ dex, $0.02-0.10$ dex, and $0.01-0.04$ dex, respectively, indicating a good consistency. A comparative analysis with external data highlighted deficiencies in the official LAMOST catalog and issues with MaStar parameters, as well as potential limitations of our method in processing spectra with strong emission lines and bad pixels. The derived atmospheric parameters as a part of this work are available at https://nadc.china-vo.org/res/r101402/ .</description>

      <title>Production of GEM-like structures using laser-cutting techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To enhance the ionization yield of liquid argon time projection chambers (LArTPC) used in dark matter and neutrino experiments it was proposed the use of dopants in LAr, with ionization energies below the scintillation threshold of Ar. While dual-phase LArTPCs have excellent sensitivity to single ionization electrons, their compatibility with photosensitive dopants is hindered by gas-phase electroluminescence photons ionizing the dopants, leading to a positive feedback loop. This can be addressed by optically decoupling the gaseous and liquid phases with a barrier that transmits electrons. A possible solution relies on the use of a pair of structures based on Gaseous Electron Multipliers(GEMs) with misaligned holes. Rather than amplifying electron signals in gas pockets within their holes, their holes will be filled with LAr and a low biasing voltage, so that incident drifting electrons are drawn into the holes but not amplified. Instead, amplification will occur in the gas phase above the structures. Its core element is a GEM-like structure machined from polyethylene naphthalate(PEN). Since PEN scintillates in the visible spectrum, the risk of increased radioactivity due to the larger mass compared to traditional wire grids is negated by the potential to veto its own radioactivity. As such, these structures may also be a useful alternative to wire grids. In this work, we report the newest developments on the production of GEM-like structures using laser-based techniques, namely the manufacture of the first batch PEN and PMMA-based GEM-like structures. This process allows low-cost, reproducible fabrication of a high volume of such structures. In addition to being a low radioactive technique, we expect that it will allow the scaling up of the production of these structures at a reduced cost. First tests indicate good electrical stability, while the performance assessment is still ongoing.</description>

      <title>Identifying Spicules in Mg II: Statistics and Comparisons with H{\alpha}</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sun's chromosphere is a critical region to understand when considering energy and mass deposition into the transition region and corona, but many of the smaller, faster events which transport a portion of this mass and energy are still difficult to observe, identify and model. Solar Spicules are small, spike-like events in the solar chromosphere that have the potential to transfer energy and mass to the transition region, but whose energetic origins are still being researched. Chromospheric spicule activity on-disk can be identified by observing temporary excursions in the red and blue wings of chromospheric emission lines. Researchers have demonstrated this in Hydrogen~Alpha (H{\alpha}, 6563 {\AA}), Ca II (8542 {\AA}, k 3934 {\AA}), Mg II (h 2803 {\AA}, k 2796 {\AA}), and Si IV (1394 {\AA}, 1405 {\AA}) spectral observations, with the vast majority of identification efforts focused on lower chromospheric observations of H$\alpha$ and Ca II. Because any spicules which deposit mass and energy into the transition region must necessarily pass through the upper chromosphere, observations from this region such as Mg II or Hydrogen Lyman Alpha (Ly$\alpha$ 1216 {\AA}) in enough quantity to perform proper statistics will be critical to fully characterizing spicules' impact on mass and energy transfer in the Sun. This research proposes a definition with numerical limits for how spicules appear in Mg II wavelengths, tunes an algorithm for automatically detecting spicules in Mg II spectral observations, and uses K Means Clustering to identify and display the full range of spicule spectrum shapes. This work will help allow statistical studies on spicules in the upper chromosphere to be as thorough as those of the lower chromosphere, allowing researchers to better understand the physical nature of spicules and their role in energy transfer and deposition in the solar atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Vision foundation models: can they be applied to astrophysics data?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11175v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision foundation models, which have demonstrated significant potential in multimedia applications, are often underutilized in the natural sciences. This is primarily due to mismatches between the nature of domain-specific scientific data and the typical training data used for foundation models, leading to distribution shift. Scientific images can have unique structure and characteristics, and researchers often face the challenge of optimizing model performance with only a few hundred or thousand labeled examples. Furthermore, the choice of vision foundation model can be non-trivial, as each model exhibits unique strengths and limitations, influenced by differences in architecture, training procedures, and the datasets used for training. In this work, we evaluate the application of various vision foundation models to images from optical and radio astronomy. Our results show that use of certain foundation models improves the classification accuracy of optical galaxy images compared to conventional supervised training. Similarly, we achieve equivalent or better performance in object detection tasks with radio images. However, their performance in classifying radio galaxy images is generally poor and often inferior to traditional supervised training results. These findings suggest that selecting suitable vision foundation models for astrophysics applications requires careful consideration of the model characteristics and alignment with the specific requirements of the downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Detection of Thermal Emission at Millimeter Wavelengths from Low-Earth Orbit Satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03374v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detection of satellite thermal emission at millimeter wavelengths is presented using data from the 3rd-Generation receiver on the South Pole Telescope (SPT-3G). This represents the first reported detection of thermal emission from artificial satellites at millimeter wavelengths. Satellite thermal emission is shown to be detectable at high signal-to-noise on timescales as short as a few tens of milliseconds. An algorithm for downloading orbital information and tracking known satellites given observer constraints and time-ordered observatory pointing is described. Consequences for cosmological surveys and short-duration transient searches are discussed, revealing that the integrated thermal emission from all large satellites does not contribute significantly to the SPT-3G survey intensity map. Measured satellite positions are found to be discrepant from their two-line element (TLE) derived ephemerides up to several arcminutes which may present a difficulty in cross-checking or masking satellites from short-duration transient searches.</description>

      <title>Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST) Science: Solar and stellar observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00920v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observations at (sub-)millimeter wavelengths offer a complementary perspective on our Sun and other stars, offering significant insights into both the thermal and magnetic composition of their chromospheres. Despite the fundamental progress in (sub-)millimeter observations of the Sun, some important aspects require diagnostic capabilities that are not offered by existing observatories. In particular, simultaneous observations of the radiation continuum across an extended frequency range would facilitate the mapping of different layers and thus ultimately the 3D structure of the solar atmosphere. Mapping large regions on the Sun or even the whole solar disk at a very high temporal cadence would be crucial for systematically detecting and following the temporal evolution of flares, while synoptic observations, i.e., daily maps, over periods of years would provide an unprecedented view of the solar activity cycle in this wavelength regime. As our Sun is a fundamental reference for studying the atmospheres of active main sequence stars, observing the Sun and other stars with the same instrument would unlock the enormous diagnostic potential for understanding stellar activity and its impact on exoplanets. The Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST), a single-dish telescope with 50\,m aperture proposed to be built in the Atacama desert in Chile, would be able to provide these observational capabilities. Equipped with a large number of detector elements for probing the radiation continuum across a wide frequency range, AtLAST would address a wide range of scientific topics including the thermal structure and heating of the solar chromosphere, flares and prominences, and the solar activity cycle. In this white paper, the key science cases and their technical requirements for AtLAST are discussed.</description>

      <title>PICZL: Image-based Photometric Redshifts for AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computing photo-z for AGN is challenging, primarily due to the interplay of relative emissions associated with the SMBH and its host galaxy. SED fitting methods, effective in pencil-beam surveys, face limitations in all-sky surveys with fewer bands available, lacking the ability to capture the AGN contribution to the SED accurately. This limitation affects the many 10s of millions of AGN clearly singled out and identified by SRG/eROSITA. Our goal is to significantly enhance photometric redshift performance for AGN in all-sky surveys while avoiding the need to merge multiple data sets. Instead, we employ readily available data products from the 10th Data Release of the Imaging Legacy Survey for DESI, covering &gt; 20,000 deg$^{2}$ with deep images and catalog-based photometry in the grizW1-W4 bands. We introduce PICZL, a machine-learning algorithm leveraging an ensemble of CNNs. Utilizing a cross-channel approach, the algorithm integrates distinct SED features from images with those obtained from catalog-level data. Full probability distributions are achieved via the integration of Gaussian mixture models. On a validation sample of 8098 AGN, PICZL achieves a variance $\sigma_{\textrm{NMAD}}$ of 4.5% with an outlier fraction $\eta$ of 5.6%, outperforming previous attempts to compute accurate photo-z for AGN using ML. We highlight that the model's performance depends on many variables, predominantly the depth of the data. A thorough evaluation of these dependencies is presented in the paper. Our streamlined methodology maintains consistent performance across the entire survey area when accounting for differing data quality. The same approach can be adopted for future deep photometric surveys such as LSST and Euclid, showcasing its potential for wide-scale realisation. With this paper, we release updated photo-z (including errors) for the XMM-SERVS W-CDF-S, ELAIS-S1 and LSS fields.</description>

      <title>MUltiplexed Survey Telescope: Perspectives for Large-Scale Structure Cosmology in the Era of Stage-V Spectroscopic Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The MUltiplexed Survey Telescope (MUST) is a 6.5-meter telescope under development. Dedicated to highly-multiplexed, wide-field spectroscopic surveys, MUST observes over 20,000 targets simultaneously using 6.2-mm pitch positioning robots within a ~5 deg2 field of view. MUST aims to carry out the first Stage-V spectroscopic survey in the 2030s to map the 3D Universe with over 100 million galaxies and quasars, spanning from the nearby Universe to redshift z~5.5, corresponding to around 1 billion years after the Big Bang. To cover this extensive redshift range, we present an initial conceptual target selection algorithm for different types of galaxies, from local bright galaxies, luminous red galaxies, and emission line galaxies to high-redshift (2 &lt; z &lt; 5.5) Lyman-break galaxies. Using Fisher forecasts, we demonstrate that MUST can address fundamental questions in cosmology, including the nature of dark energy, test of gravity theories, and investigations into primordial physics. This is the first paper in the series of science white papers for MUST, with subsequent developments focusing on additional scientific cases such as galaxy and quasar evolution, Milky Way physics, and dynamic phenomena in the time-domain Universe.</description>
