      <title>Site Evaluation and Cost Estimation for Cosmic Explorer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic Explorer (CE) is a proposed next generation gravitational-wave observatory that would be sited in the United States. As of 2025, CE is in its design phase, with plans to begin operations in the 2030s together with the Einstein Telescope in Europe. CE's reference design consists of two widely separated L-shaped detectors, one with 20km arms and one with 40km arms, each based on technology proven by the National Science Foundation's highly successful Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO). There are unique challenges associated with identifying locations suitable for hosting Cosmic Explorer in the conterminous United States, not least of which is the order of magnitude upscaling of the observatory with respect to the 4km LIGO observatories. Cosmic Explorer's approach to site evaluation integrates physical, social and cultural criteria. Here we present improvements to the Cosmic Explorer Location Search (CELS) code used to identify and assess locations where CE would have low construction costs incurred by the geology, geography and topography of the land. We also report on efforts to integrate astrophysical requirements established by the Cosmic Explorer Science Traceability Matrix into the site evaluation process. National-level results are presented and combined with results from a related National Suitability Analysis to provide a list of locations that are preliminarily promising for a 40km CE.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms of Internal Crosstalk in Silicon Photomultipliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) have been widely adopted for photon detection in next-generation dark matter and neutrino detection experiments. Internal crosstalk, resulting from secondary photons produced during charge avalanches, is a significant noise mechanism in SiPMs and is likely to impact the performance of physics detectors. This work presents experimental data for trends in crosstalk probability with temperature and overvoltage for two different SiPM devices, and demonstrates a novel method for identifying the source mechanisms of crosstalk avalanches. This is done by using measurements of avalanche triggering probabilities for different charge carrier types to identify the device regions in which crosstalk avalanches are produced. This is possible because crosstalk photons absorbed in n-doped regions will produce hole-triggered avalanches, and those absorbed in p-doped regions will produce electron-triggered avalanches. Thus crosstalk probability can be related to device structure to assess the effectiveness of existing crosstalk mitigation methods. We identify optical reflections from the device surface as a significant source of crosstalk, likely to dominate in devices with effective crosstalk mitigation in bulk. Lastly, a diagnostic technique is presented to identify and reduce crosstalk in novel SiPM structures.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of cosmic-ray muon events with CUORE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the in-situ 3D reconstruction of through-going muons in the CUORE experiment, a cryogenic calorimeter array searching for neutrinoless double beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay, leveraging the segmentation of the detector. Due to the slow time response of the detector, time-of-flight estimation is not feasible. Therefore, the track reconstruction is performed using a multi-objective optimization algorithm that relies on geometrical information from the detector as a whole. We measure the integral flux of cosmic-ray muons underground at the {\it Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso}, and find our value to be in good agreement with other experiments that have performed a similar measurement. To our knowledge, this work represents the first demonstration of 3D particle tracking and reconstruction of through-going muons with per-event angular determination in a millikelvin cryogenic detector array. The analysis performed for this work will be critical for validating the muon-related background in CUPID, a next-generation $0\nu\beta\beta$ experiment, and for follow-up studies on detector response and on delayed products induced by cosmic-ray muons.</description>

      <title>Upgrades of the ATLAS Zero Degree Calorimeter System for Run 3 at the Large Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experimental studies of ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) depend crucially on Zero Degree Calorimeters (ZDCs) that measure neutrons produced at near-beam rapidity in nucleus-nucleus collisions. In hadronic nuclear collisions these neutrons are mainly spectator neutrons, those that do not scatter from opposing nucleons during the collision. As a result, the ZDCs provide a vital probe of heavy ion collision geometry. The ZDCs are also essential in the study of ultra-peripheral collisions that are initiated by photons associated with the electric fields of one or both nuclei. Coherent photon emission typically leaves the photon emitter intact, making the observation of no ZDC signal, on one or both sides, a tag of such processes. The ATLAS ZDCs, built prior to Run 1 were substantially upgraded for LHC Run 3. The primary upgrades included replacement of the quartz Cherenkov radiator with $\text{H}_2$-doped fused silica rods; installation of fast air-core signal cables between the ZDC and the ATLAS USA15 cavern; new LED-based calibration system; and new electronics implemented for readout and fully-digital triggering. The ZDCs were also augmented with new "Reaction Plane Detectors" (RPDs) designed to measure the transverse centroid of multi-neutron showers to allow event-by-event reconstruction of the directed-flow plane in nuclear collisions. The Run~3 ZDC detectors, including the RPDs, are described in detail with emphasis on aspects that are new for Run~3.</description>

      <title>Implementation of Prototype Permanent Microundulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the implementation of two types of helical microundulators with a 6 mm period, built from axially magnetized helices fabricated from a single piece of rare-earth magnet. The first device, composed of two oppositely magnetized longitudinal helices, produces a transverse on-axis field exceeding 0.93 T. The second, a hybrid design with two oppositely longitudinally pre-magnetized rare-earth helices alternating with two unmagnetized steel helices, reaches about 1.5 T on axis. Both devices have a 1 mm bore, which required dedicated field-measurement techniques. When used in compact FELs from terahertz to X-ray, such microundulators can provide higher electron oscillation amplitude and radiated power than planar microundulators of similar period. As an illustrative case, we present an ultra-compact SASE XFEL concept in which the studied hybrid helical microundulator can provide approximately 48 GW of radiation power at a wavelength of about 5 angstrom.</description>

      <title>A Compact Two-Dimensional Radiation Detector for Educational Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in low-cost, portable cosmic-ray detectors have broadened citizen-science engagement in particle physics studies. Imaging applications such as muography, however, remain largely inaccessible because existing detectors typically require tens to hundreds of sensors, making them costly and complex. This gap underscores the need for a compact imaging detector.
  In this study, we developed SAKURA, a palm-sized two-dimensional muon scintillation detector that uses only four silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) and can be built for less than 1,000 USD. Its spatial resolution was evaluated using a 5 GeV/c muon beam at CERN's T10 beamline in September 2024, yielding 13.4 mm along the x-axis and 7.48 mm along the y-axis. The entire study, including designing and testing the detector, and analysing data, was undertaken by high school students, demonstrating that SAKURA makes radiation imaging accessible and practical even for non-specialists with the help of some professional scientists.</description>

      <title>First Production of Skipper-CCD Modules for the DAMIC-M Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The DAMIC-M experiment will search for sub-GeV dark matter particles with a large array of silicon skipper charge-coupled devices (CCDs) at the Modane Underground Laboratory (LSM) in France. After five years of development, we recently completed the production of 28 CCD modules at the University of Washington, each consisting of four 9-megapixel skipper CCDs. Material screening and background controls were implemented to meet stringent radio-purity targets, while extensive testing was employed to select science-grade CCDs for the modules and confirm their excellent performance after fabrication. Further testing at LSM will select 26 of these modules (${\sim}$350 g active mass) to be installed and operated in the DAMIC-M detector in early 2026.</description>

      <title>Room Temperature Single Photon Detection at 1550 nm using van der Waals Heterojunction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-photon detectors (SPDs) are crucial in applications ranging from space, biological imaging to quantum communication and information processing. The SPDs that operate at room temperature are of particular interest to broader application space as the energy overhead introduced by the cryogenic cooling can be avoided. Although silicon-based single photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) are well matured and operate at room temperature, the bandgap limitation restricts their operation at telecommunication wavelength (1550 nm) and beyond. InGaAs-based SPADs, on the other hand, are sensitive to 1550 nm photons, but suffer from relatively lower efficiency, high dark count rate, afterpulsing probability, and pose hazards to the environment from the fabrication process. In this work, we demonstrate how we can leverage the properties of nanomaterials to address these challenges and realise a room temperature single-photon detector capable of operating at 1550 nm. We achieve this by coupling a low bandgap ($\sim 350~meV$) absorber (black phosphorus) to a sensitive van der Waals probe that is capable of detecting discrete electron fluctuation. We optimize the device for operation at $1550~nm$ and demonstrate an overall quantum efficiency of $21.4\%$ (estimated as $42.8\%$ for polarized light), and a minimum dark count of $\sim 720~Hz$ at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Hanbury Brown-Twiss interference with massively parallel spectral multiplexing for broadband light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-photon interference in the spectral domain is a powerful resource for quantum technologies, enabling both precision measurements and scalable entanglement distribution. Here, we report the first demonstration of massively parallel, wavelength-resolved photon bunching, revealing Hanbury Brown-Twiss correlations across 100 independent spectral channels. These observations are enabled by a fast, data-driven single-photon spectrometer that achieves 40 pm spectral and 40 ps temporal resolution over a 10 nm bandwidth, allowing simultaneous access to spectro-temporal photon correlations without the need for narrowband filtering. This approach preserves photon flux while enabling high-dimensional quantum interference measurements across a broad spectrum. Our results establish frequency-multiplexed two-photon interference as a scalable and throughput-efficient platform for quantum-enhanced photonic technologies, with applications ranging from stellar intensity interferometry to broadband entanglement swapping in quantum networks.</description>

      <title>3D-printed components for electron-ion trapping: Tests of functionality and ultra-high vacuum compatibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the ultra-high vacuum compatibility of a microwave-driven electron trap and an atomic oven (for atomic beam generation) fabricated through 3D printing via Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF). The trap integrates into a coaxial microwave cavity, enabling stable, narrow-band, high-amplitude oscillations of the electric field at the electrodes. The design also supports simultaneous trapping of ions. The oven performs well in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) environments without significant outgassing. In addition to achieving the UHV regime for 3D-printed components, pressure variations and their potential impact on electron-ion trapping experiments were investigated over a month. Our results show that experiments with electrons photodetached from trapped and laser-cooled ions are feasible with the trap and oven manufactured by the L-PBF method. These findings establish a foundation for future experiments in microwave detection and the study of low-energy ion-electron interactions at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Optically interrogated liquid crystal-based, charge-mode accelerometer telemetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A hybrid optoelectronic vibration sensing system is presented, combining a conventional charge-mode piezoelectric accelerometer with an optical fiber interface via a liquid crystal-based electrical-to-optical transducer. This configuration allows the accelerometer's electrical output to be converted into an optical signal, enabling remote signal transmission over optical fiber. The same fiber could also be used to supply power to the system, offering a compact and interference-resistant solution suitable for challenging environments such as those with high voltages or explosive risks. Experimental results demonstrate a displacement resolution ranging from \Delta z = 0.015 nm at 0.160 nm displacement, up to \Delta z = 0.720 nm at 351 nm displacement, or equivalently, from \alpha = 0.0005 m/s2 to 0.057 m/s2 in acceleration. Despite undergoing electrical-to-optical and optical-to-electrical signal conversion, the system maintains high sensitivity, low noise levels, and signal integrity. This proof-of-concept optically interrogated accelerometer highlights a path toward reducing sensor infrastructure requirements by eliminating the need for conventional power supplies and electromagnetic shielding, which are typically required in fully electrical accelerometer systems.</description>

Abstract: We compare methods for signal classification applied to voltage traces from transition-edge sensors (TES) which are photon-number resolving detectors fundamental for accessing quantum advantages in information processing, communication and metrology. We quantify the impact of numerical analysis on the distinction of such signals. Furthermore, we explore dimensionality reduction techniques to create interpretable and precise photon-number embeddings. We demonstrate that the preservation of local data structures of some nonlinear methods is an accurate way to achieve unsupervised classification of TES traces. We do so by considering a confidence metric that quantifies the overlap of the photon-number clusters inside a latent space. Furthermore, we demonstrate that for our dataset previous methods such as the signal's area and principal component analysis can resolve up to 16 photons with confidence above $90\%$ while nonlinear techniques can resolve up to 21 with the same confidence threshold. Also, we showcase implementations of neural networks to leverage information within local structures, aiming to increase confidence in assigning photon numbers. Finally, we demonstrate the advantage of some nonlinear methods to detect and remove outlier signals.</description>

      <title>Timing characterization of MALTA and MALTA2 pixel detectors using Micro X-ray source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The MALTA monolithic active pixel detector is developed to address some of the challenges anticipated in future high-energy physics detectors. As part of its characterization, we conducted timing studies necessary to provide a figure of merit for this family of monolithic pixel detectors. MALTA has a metal layer in front-end electronics, and the conventional laser technique is not suitable for timing studies due to the reflection of the laser from the metallic surface. X-rays have been employed as a more effective alternative for penetration through these layers. The triggered X-ray set-up is designed to study timing measurements of monolithic detectors. The timing response of the X-ray set-up is characterized using an LGAD. The timing response of the MALTA and MALTA2 pixel detectors is studied, and the best response time of MALTA2 pixel detectors is measured at about 2.6 ns.</description>

      <title>Single-photon counting pixel detector for soft X-rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04437v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Soft X-ray experiments at synchrotron light sources are essential for a wide range of research fields. However, commercially available detectors for this energy range often cannot deliver the necessary combination of quantum efficiency, signal-to-noise ratio, dynamic range, speed, and radiation hardness within a single system. While hybrid detectors have addressed these challenges effectively in the hard X-ray regime, specifically with single photon counting pixel detectors extensively used in high-performance synchrotron applications, similar solutions are desired for energies below 2 keV.
  In this work, we introduce the first single-photon-counting hybrid pixel detector capable of detecting X-ray energies as low as 550 eV, utilizing the internal amplification of Low-Gain Avalanche Diode (LGAD) sensors. This detector is thoroughly characterized in terms of Signal-to-Noise Ratio and Detective Quantum Efficiency. We demonstrate its capabilities through ptychographic imaging at MAX IV 4th generation synchrotron light source at the Fe L$_3$-edge (707 eV), showcasing the enhanced detection performance of the system. This development sets a new benchmark for soft X-ray applications at synchrotrons, paving the way for significant advancements in imaging and analysis at lower photon energies.</description>

      <title>Sub-keV Electron Recoil Calibration for Macroscopic Cryogenic Calorimeters using a Novel X-ray Fluorescence Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Percent-level calibration of cryogenic macro-calorimeters with energy thresholds below 100~eV are crucial for light Dark Matter (DM) searches and reactor neutrino studies based on coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS). This paper presents a novel calibration source based on X-ray fluorescence (XRF) of light elements. It uses a $^{55}$Fe source to irradiate a two-staged target arrangement, emitting characteristic emission lines from 677\,eV to 6.5\,keV. We demonstrate the potential of this new XRF source to calibrate a 0.75 gram CaWO$_4$ crystal of the NUCLEUS and CRAB experiments. Additionally, we introduce CryoLab, an advanced analysis tool for cryogenic detector data, featuring robust methods for data processing, calibration, and high-level analysis, implemented in MATLAB and HDF5. We also present a phenomenological model for energy resolution, which incorporates statistical contributions, systematic effects, and baseline noise, enabling a novel approach to evaluating athermal phonon collection efficiency in macro-calorimeters based on transition edge sensors (TES).</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Delivered Spill Structure of Medical Proton and Carbon-Ion Beams at MedAustron using a High Frequency Silicon Carbide Readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11593v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Medical synchrotrons are often used for testing instrumentation in high-energy physics or non-clinical research in medical physics. In many applications of medical synchrotrons, such as microdosimetry and ion imaging, precise knowledge of the spill structure and instantaneous particle rate is crucial. Conventional ionization chambers, while omnipresent in clinical settings, suffer from limitations in charge resolution and integration time, making single-particle detection at high dose rates unfeasible. To address these limitations, we present a beam detection setup based on a silicon carbide (SiC) sensor and a monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC), capable of detecting single particles with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) pulse duration of 500 ps. At the MedAustron ion therapy center, we characterized the spill structure of proton and carbon-ion beams delivered to the irradiation room beyond the timescale of the maximum ion revolution frequency in the synchrotron. The resulting data offer valuable insights into the beam intensity at small time scales and demonstrate the capabilities of SiC-based systems for high-flux beam monitoring.</description>

      <title>Extended thermal cycling of ATLAS ITk strip modules with and without stress mitigating interposers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates critical mechanical failures during stand-alone thermocycling of ATLAS Inner Tracker strip pre-production modules. Five modules undergo extended thermocycling after adequately levelling thermal chucks and introducing interlocks for unattended operation. Module bow evolution is tracked via regular sensor metrology. All five modules exhibit bow increases with a mean of $146\pm 27~\mu$m when raising maximum cycling temperatures from $20^\circ$C to $40^\circ$C. Four such modules exhibit sensor fractures when cycled to $-44^\circ$C. A stress-mitigating layer of silicone gel and Kapton film interposer is introduced to three further modules, with detailed quality control data establishing electromechanical viability. No significant bow change of $1\pm 10~\mu$m is observed after ten cycles between $[+40, -44]^\circ$C relative to $[+20, -44]^\circ$C. Two interposer modules undergo 200 thermocycles up to $[+56, -44]^\circ$C without fracturing. This decreased sensor deformation and fracturing is interpreted as evidence for reduced thermal stress.</description>

      <title>Comparative Simulation of CEvNS Recoil Observables in Geant4 Using Germanium, Argon, and Xenon Targets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06519v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a Geant4-based simulation study of Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering (CEvNS) for three commonly used detector targets: Germanium, Argon, and Xenon. A custom CEvNS model was implemented, including differential cross sections and Helm form factors. Recoil energy spectra, angular distributions, and form factor effects were analyzed using ROOT. The results reveal expected trends: heavier nuclei lead to lower recoil energies and increased form factor suppression. This work provides a simulation framework to support future theoretical and experimental studies in neutrino physics and dark matter searches.</description>

      <title>Spiral Tuning of Wire-metamaterial Cavity for Plasma Haloscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18145v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Axions are hypothetical particles that provide a compelling solution to two major mysteries in modern physics: the strong CP problem and the nature of dark matter. The plasma haloscope has been proposed as a promising approach for probing the higher-mass regime for dark matter axions by employing a periodic arrangement of conducting wires. In this work, we introduce a novel tuning mechanism for such wire-based structures by arranging the wires into a spiral configuration. This design enables continuous frequency tuning of 25% with a single central rotation while maintaining the form factor. It also achieves scanning speeds several times faster than traditional tuning approaches, primarily due to the circular perimeter geometry, making it well suited for solenoidal magnet bores. To validate the concept, we fabricated a prototype cavity with six spiral arms and experimentally demonstrated its feasibility, obtaining frequency tuning in close agreement with numerical simulations.</description>
