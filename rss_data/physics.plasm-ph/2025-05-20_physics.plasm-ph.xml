      <title>A new approach for solving the problem of creation of inverse electron distribution function and practical recommendations for experimental searches for such media in glow discharges with hollow and flat cathodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach for creating an inverse electron distribution function (EDF). Based on the obtained criteria for the formation of an inverse EDF in a non-uniform plasma, studies are conducted in low- and medium-pressure glow discharges with flat and hollow cathodes. The results of the numerical modeling and theoretical analysis are used to present reliable criteria and scaling for the evaluation of the possible inversion of the EDF under specific conditions. By solving the nonlocal Boltzmann kinetic equation in energy and coordinate variables, it is shown that the simplest way to implement the inversion of the EDF is in a glow discharge with a hollow cathode. For such discharges, practical recommendations are developed and specific conditions for the experimental detection of an inverse EDF are identified.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal plasma hologram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first experimental realization of a four-dimensional (4D) plasma hologram capable of recording and reconstructing the full spatiotemporal information of intense laser pulses. The holographic encoding is achieved through the interference of a long object pulse and a counter-propagating short reference pulse, generating an ionized plasma grating that captures both spatial and temporal characteristics of the laser field. A first-order diffractive probe enables the retrieval of encoded information, successfully reconstructing the spatiotemporal profiles of Gaussian and Laguerre-Gaussian beams. The experiment demonstrates the ability to encode artificial information into the laser pulse via spectral modulation and retrieve it through plasma grating diffraction, high-lighting potential applications in ultraintense optical data processing. Key innovations include a single-shot, background-free method for direct far-field spatiotemporal measurement and the obser-vation of laser focus propagation dynamics in plasma. The plasma grating exhibits a stable lifetime of 30-40 ps and supports high repetition rates, suggesting usage for high-speed optical switches and plasmatic analog memory. These advancements establish plasma holography as a robust platform for ultrafast laser manipulation, with implications for secure optical communication, analog computing,and precision spatiotemporal control of high-intensity lasers.</description>

      <title>Interaction of a spatially uniform electron beam with a rotational magnetic hole in a form of a Harris current sheet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we use particle-in-cell (PIC) numerical simulations to study interaction of a spatially uniform electron beam with a rotational magnetic hole in a form of a Harris current sheet. We vary width of the Harris current sheet to investigate how this affects the quasi-linear relaxation, i.e. plateau formation of the bump-on-tail unstable electron beam. We find that when width of the Harris current sheet approaches and becomes smaller than the electron gyro-radius, quasi-linear relaxation becomes hampered and a positive slope in the electron velocity distribution function (VDF) persists. We explain this by the effects of non-conservation of electron magnetic moment, which, as recent works suggest, can maintain the positive slope of the VDF. In part, this can explain why some electron beams in the solar wind travel much longer distances than predicted by the quasi-linear theory, at least in those cases when the electron beams slide along the current sheets that are abundant when the different-speed solar wind streams interact with each other.</description>

      <title>Plasma refilling of the lunar wake: plasma-vacuum interactions, electrostatic shocks, and electromagnetic instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A plasma void forms downstream of the Moon when the solar wind impacts the lunar surface. This void gradually refills as the solar wind passes by, forming the lunar wake. We investigate this refilling process using a fully kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation. The early stage of refilling follows plasma-vacuum interaction theory, characterized by exponential decay of plasma density into the wake, along with ion acceleration and cooling in the expansion direction. Our PIC simulation confirms these theoretical predictions. In the next stage of the refilling process, the counter-streaming supersonic ion beams collide, generating Debye-scale electrostatic shocks at the wake's center. These shocks decelerate and thermalize the ion beams while heating electrons into flat-top velocity distributions along magnetic field lines. Additionally, fast magnetosonic waves undergo convective growth via anomalous cyclotron resonance as they co-propagate with temperature-anisotropic ion beams toward the wake's center. Electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves may also be excited through normal cyclotron resonance, counter-propagating with these anisotropic ion beams. Our findings provide new insights into the kinetic aspects of lunar wake refilling and may enhance interpretation of spacecraft observations.</description>

      <title>Electric fields and waves in the Venus nightside magnetosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On November 6, 2024, the Parker Solar Probe flew past Venus to make the first accurate electric field measurement in the nightside Venusian magnetosphere. To achieve this result, the electric field antennas were current biased in a way never before experienced by an electric field detector. This biasing requirement, that the positive bias current in the Venus shadow be about equal to the electron thermal current, is discussed and illustrated. About one minute of useful electric f ield data in the eight-minute nightside magnetosphere crossing was obtained, during which the only feature observed was a few Hz signal. This result, along with the magnetic field measurements, showed that there were few if any electromagnetic waves, such as low-frequency electromagnetic turbulence or whistlers, in the nightside crossing. Instead, a few Hertz, purely electrostatic signal was found. This suggests that the interaction of the solar wind with an unmagnetized body having an ionosphere may be different from that of previously studied magnetized bodies. In the sunlit flanks, many electromagnetic wave modes were observed. These results describe the first step in the proper technique for future measurements of electric fields in shadow.</description>

      <title>Solar-cycle Variability of Composite Geometry in the Solar Wind Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The composite geometry and spectral anisotropy of the solar wind turbulence are very important topics in the investigations of solar wind. In this work, we use the magnetic field and plasma data from Wind spacecraft measured during 1995 January to 2023 December, which covers more than two solar cycles, to systematically investigate these subjects in the context of solar-cycle variability. The so-called spectrum ratio test and spectrum anisotropy test are employed to determine the three-dimensional (3D) geometry of the solar wind turbulence. Both the tests reveal that the solar wind turbulence is dominated by the two-dimensional (2D) component (~80% by turbulence energy). More interestingly, we find that the fraction of slab turbulence increases with the rising sunspot number, and the correlation coefficient between the slab fraction and the sunspot number is 0.61 (ratio test result) or 0.65 (anisotropy test result). This phenomenon suggests that the increasing solar activity (signified by sunspot number) causes increasing slab component in the solar wind turbulence. The relationship between spectral anisotropy and solar activity is discussed and explained. The enhancement of slab fraction is associated with the intensified interplanetary magnetic field magnitude and the increased Alfven speed during the rise phases of the solar cycles. Our findings will be very helpful for achieving a better understanding of the 3D composite geometry and spectral anisotropy of the solar wind turbulence, and especially of their solar-cycle variability.</description>

      <title>On the stability analysis of cooling functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To model the temperature evolution of optically thin astrophysical environments at MHD scales, radiative and collisional cooling rates are typically either pre-tabulated or fit into a functional form and then input into MHD codes as a radiative loss function. Thermal balance requires estimates of the analogous heating rates, which are harder to calculate, and due to uncertainties in the underlying dissipative heating processes, these rates are often simply parameterized. The resulting net cooling function defines an equilibrium curve that varies with density and temperature. Such cooling functions can make the gas prone to thermal instability (TI), which will cause departures from equilibrium. There has been no systematic study of thermally unstable parameter space for nonequilibrium states. Motivated by our recent finding that there is a related linear instability, catastrophic cooling instability, that can dominate over TI, here we carry out such a study. We show that Balbus' instability criteria for TI can be used to define a critical cooling rate, $\Lambda_c$, that permits a nonequilibrium analysis of cooling functions through the mapping of TI zones. We furthermore extend Balbus' criteria to account for thermal conduction. Upon applying a $\Lambda_c$-based stability analysis to coronal loop simulations, we find that loops undergoing periodic episodes of coronal rain formation are linearly unstable to catastrophic cooling instability, while TI is stabilized by thermal conduction.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic particle acceleration in Alfv\'enic turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Alfv\'enic turbulence is an effective mechanism for particle acceleration in strongly magnetized, relativistic plasma. In this study, we investigate a scenario where turbulent plasma is influenced by a strong guide magnetic field, resulting in highly anisotropic turbulent fluctuations. In such cases, the magnetic moments of particles are conserved, which means that acceleration can only occur along the direction of the magnetic field. Consistent with previous analytic studies, we find through PIC simulations of magnetically dominated pair plasma that the momenta of accelerated particles are closely aligned with the magnetic field lines. Notably, the alignment angle decreases as particle energy increases, potentially limited only by the inherent curvature and gradients of the turbulent magnetic fluctuations. This finding has significant implications for interpreting the synchrotron radiation emitted by highly accelerated particles.</description>

      <title>Enhanced energy gain through higher-order resonances during direct laser acceleration with superluminal phase velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultra-high intensity laser-plasma interactions can produce ultra-relativistic electrons via direct laser acceleration, assisted by quasi-static plasma magnetic and electric fields. These fields transversely confine electron motion and induce betatron oscillations. The net energy gain is strongly influenced by the interplay between two frequencies: the betatron frequency and the frequency of laser field oscillations experienced by the electron. Prior work has shown that energy gain is enabled by a resonance between the betatron oscillations and the oscillations of the laser field. In particular, higher-order resonances occur when the laser field completes multiple cycles during one betatron oscillation, allowing additional regimes of energy transfer beyond the fundamental (betatron) resonance. In this work, we demonstrate that such resonances become particularly effective when the laser's phase velocity is superluminal. Although the two frequencies generally evolve differently with increasing electron energy, which leads to detuning, a superluminal phase velocity introduces a non-monotonic frequency ratio with a global minimum. This minimum allows sustained frequency matching over a broad energy range, thereby enabling enhanced energy gain. As the phase velocity increases, the betatron resonance becomes ineffective due to premature frequency detuning. At the same time, higher-order resonances become increasingly effective, emerging as the dominant mechanisms for enhanced energy gain in this regime of direct laser acceleration.</description>

      <title>Particle Acceleration in Collisionless Magnetically Arrested Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first collisionless realization of two-dimensional axisymmetric black hole accretion consistent with a persistent magnetically arrested disk state. The accretion flow, consisting of an ion-electron disk plasma combined with magnetospheric pair creation effects, is simulated using first-principles general-relativistic particle-in-cell methods. The simulation is evolved over significant dynamical timescales during which a quasi-steady accretion state is reached with several magnetic flux eruption cycles. We include a realistic treatment of inverse Compton scattering and pair production, which allows for studying the interaction between the collisionless accretion flow and pair-loaded jet. Our findings indicate that magnetic flux eruptions associated with equatorial magnetic reconnection within the black hole magnetosphere and the formation of spark gaps are locations of maximal particle acceleration. Flux eruptions, starting near the central black hole, can trigger Kelvin-Helmholtz-like vortices at the jet-disk interface that facilitate efficient mixing between disk and jet plasma in this region. Transient periods of increased pair production following magnetic flux eruptions and reconnection events are responsible for most of the highly accelerated particles.</description>

      <title>Petahertz-bandwidth spectral combs from the amplified spontaneous emission of a collisional plasma-based x-ray laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08930v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The possibility of generating spectral combs of petahertz bandwidth is demonstrated from amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) of a collisional plasma-based x-ray laser when its active medium is irradiated with a linearly polarized near-infrared (IR) laser field. It is shown that at a sufficiently high IR-field intensity these combs correspond to a sequence of subfemtosecond beats of extreme ultraviolet (XUV) radiation of a deterministic shape. At the same time, at a lower IR-field intensity ASE remains quasimonochromatic, but its frequency shifts as a result of the IR-field-induced quadratic Stark effect. In this case, the frequency tuning range of XUV radiation is approximately twice the frequency of the modulating IR field. In addition, modulation by the IR field leads to amplitude and frequency discrimination of the polarization components of ASE, parallel and orthogonal to the IR field. The possibility of observing these effects is analyzed for a collisional plasma x-ray laser based on neon-like Ti12+ ions with an unperturbed ASE wavelength of 32.6 nm and a modulating field with a wavelength of 1 {\mu}m and an intensity in the range of 10^16 - 10^17 W/cm^2.</description>
