      <title>Rise and Fall of Anderson Localization By Lattice Vibrations: A Time-Dependent Machine Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intricate relationship between electrons and the crystal lattice is a linchpin in condensed matter, traditionally described by the Fr\"ohlich model encompassing the lowest-order lattice-electron coupling. Recently developed quantum acoustics emphasizing the wave nature of lattice vibrations has enabled the exploration of previously uncharted territories of electron-lattice interaction, not accessible with conventional tools such as perturbation theory. In this context, our agenda here is two-fold. First, we showcase the application of machine learning methods to categorize various interaction regimes within the subtle interplay of electrons and the dynamical lattice landscape. Second, we shed light on a nebulous region of electron dynamics identified by the machine learning approach and then attribute it to transient localization, where strong lattice vibrations result in a momentary Anderson prison for electronic wavepackets, later released by the evolution of the lattice. Overall, our research illuminates the spectrum of dynamics within the Fr\"ohlich model, such as transient localization, which has been suggested as a pivotal factor contributing to the mysteries surrounding strange metals. Furthermore, this paves the way for utilizing time-dependent perspectives in machine learning for designing materials with tailored electron-lattice properties.</description>

      <title>Dirac spin liquid in quantum dipole arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We predict that the gapless $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid naturally emerges in a two-dimensional array of quantum dipoles. In particular, we demonstrate that the dipolar XY model$\unicode{x2014}$realized in both Rydberg atom arrays and ultracold polar molecules$\unicode{x2014}$hosts a quantum spin liquid ground state on the kagome lattice. Large-scale density matrix renormalization group calculations indicate that this spin liquid exhibits signatures of gapless, linearly-dispersing spinons, consistent with the $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid. We identify a route to adiabatic preparation via staggered on-site fields and demonstrate that this approach can prepare cold spin liquids within experimentally realistic time-scales. Finally, we propose a number of novel signatures of the Dirac spin liquid tailored to near-term quantum simulators, including termination-dependent edge modes and the Friedel response to a local perturbation.</description>

      <title>Neural-network-supported basis optimizer for the configuration interaction problem in quantum many-body clusters: Feasibility study and numerical proof</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A deep-learning approach to optimize the selection of Slater determinants in configuration interaction calculations for condensed-matter quantum many-body systems is developed. We exemplify our algorithm on the discrete version of the single-impurity Anderson model with up to 299 bath sites. Employing a neural network classifier and active learning, our algorithm enhances computational efficiency by iteratively identifying the most relevant Slater determinants for the ground-state wavefunction. We benchmark our results against established methods and investigate the efficiency of our approach as compared to other basis truncation schemes. Our algorithm demonstrates a substantial improvement in the efficiency of determinant selection, yielding a more compact and computationally manageable basis without compromising accuracy. Given the straightforward application of our neural network-supported selection scheme to other model Hamiltonians of quantum many-body clusters, our algorithm can significantly advance selective configuration interaction calculations in the context of correlated condensed matter.</description>

      <title>Uncommon magnetic ordering in the quantum magnet Yb$_{3}$Ga$_{5}$O$_{12}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The antiferromagnetic structure of Yb$_{3}$Ga$_{5}$O$_{12}$ is identified by neutron diffraction experiments below the previously-known transition at $T_{\lambda}=54$ mK. The magnetic propagation vector is found to be ${\bf k}=(1/2, 1/2, 0)$, an unusual wave-vector in the garnet structure. The associated complex magnetic structure highlights the role of exchange interactions in a nearly isotropic system dominated by dipolar interactions and finds echos with exotic structures theoretically proposed. Reduced values of the ordered moments may indicate significant quantum fluctuations in this effective spin-1/2 geometrically frustrated magnet.</description>

      <title>Reduced QED with few planes and fermion gap generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formalism of reduced quantum electrodynamics is generalized to the case of heterostructures composed of few atomically thick layers and the corresponding effective (2+1)-dimensional gauge theory is formulated. This dimensionally reduced theory describes charged fermions confined to $N$ planes and contains $N$ vector fields with Maxwell`s action modified by non-local form factors whose explicit form is determined. Taking into account the polarization function, the explicit formulae for the screened electromagnetic interaction are presented in the case of two and three layers. For a heterostructure with two atomically thick layers and charged fermions described by the massless Dirac equation, the dynamical gap generation of the excitonic type is studied. It is found that additional screening due to the second layer increases the value of the critical coupling constant for the gap generation compared to that in graphene.</description>

      <title>Prediction of dual quantum spin Hall insulator in NbIrTe4 monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dual quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI) is a newly discovered topological state in the 2D material TaIrTe4, exhibiting both a traditional Z2 band gap at charge neutrality point and a van Hove singularity (VHS) induced correlated Z2 band gap with weak doping. Inspired by the recent progress in theoretical understanding and experimental measurements, we predicted a promising dual QSHI in the counterpart material of the NbIrTe4 monolayer by first-principles calculations. In addition to the well-known band inversion at the charge neutrality point, two new band inversions were found after CDW phase transition when the chemical potential is near the VHS, one direct and one indirect Z2 band gap. The VHS-induced non-trivial band gap is around 10 meV, much larger than that from TaIrTe4. Furthermore, since the new generated band gap is mainly dominated by the 4d orbitals of Nb, electronic correlation effects should be relatively stronger in NbIrTe4 as compared to TaIrTe4. Therefore, the dual QSHI state in the NbIrTe4 monolayer is expected to be a good platform for investigating the interplay between topology and correlation effects.</description>

      <title>Neural Quantum States in Variational Monte Carlo Method: A Brief Summary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, variational Monte Carlo method based on neural quantum states for spin systems is reviewed. Using a neural network as the wave function allows for a more generalized expression of various types of interactions, including highly non-local interactions, which are closely related to its non-linear activation functions. Additionally, neural networks can represent relatively complex wave functions with relatively small computational resources when dealing with higher-dimensional systems, which is undoubtedly a "flattening" advantage. In quantum-state tomography, the representation method of neural quantum states has already achieved significant results, hinting at its potential in handling larger-sized systems.</description>

      <title>Antiferromagnetic order in a layered magnetic topological insulator MnBi$_2$Se$_4$ probed by resonant soft x-ray scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quasi-two-dimensional magnetic topological insulator MnBi$_2$Se$_4$, stabilized via non-equilibrium molecular beam epitaxy, is investigated by resonant soft x-ray scattering. Kiessig fringes are observed, confirming a high sample quality and a thin film thickness of 10 septuple layers ($\sim$13 nm). An antiferromagnetic Bragg peak is observed at the structurally forbidden reflection, whose magnetic nature is validated by studying its temperature, energy, and polarization dependence. Through a detailed analysis, an A-type antiferromagetic order with in-plane moments is implied. This alternative spin structure in MnBi$_2$Se$_4$, in contrast to the Ising antiferromagnetic states in other magnetic topological insulators, might be relevant for hosting new topological states.</description>

      <title>Photoinduced phase switching from Mott insulator to metallic state in the quarter-filled Peierls-Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing the exact diagonalization method, we investigate the one-dimensional Peierls-Hubbard model at quarter filling, where it manifests as an antiferromagnetic Mott insulator in units of dimers. By increasing the on-site Coulomb repulsion U, we observe a significant suppression of the Drude peak, based on a nonequilibrium linear response theory capable of capturing the zero-frequency (Drude) weight of the optical conductivity under periodic boundary conditions. However, after the ultrafast photoirradiation of this model with large U, we detect a distinct enhancement of the Drude peak, signifying the onset of a photoinduced insulator-metal transition. Comparing these dynamics with the half-filled Hubbard model and a noninteracting spinless half-filled Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model (corresponding to the quarter-filled Peierls-Hubbard model with infinite U), we propose a novel mechanism for the photoinduced metallic state: the empty-occupied and double-occupied dimers serve as the photoinduced charge carriers, akin to the holons and doublons in Hubbard model.</description>

      <title>Floquet engineering nearly flat bands through quantum-geometric light-matter coupling with surface polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate Floquet engineering in a sawtooth chain -- a minimal model hosting a nearly flat band endowed with nontrivial quantum geometry -- coupled to driven surface polaritons. In this paradigmatic flat band model, light-matter coupling to a flat band is enabled by quantum geometry despite the vanishing band velocity and band curvature. We show that light polarization and finite momentum transfer in polaritonic settings provide sufficient tunability to flatten or unflatten bands, with sometimes drastic band structure modifications beyond what is attainable with laser pulses in free space. Possible implications for light-driven phenomena in prototypical flat-band moir\'e or kagome materials are discussed.</description>

      <title>Unusual low-temperature behavior in the half-filled band of the one-dimensional extended Hubbard model in atomic limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a kind of finite-temperature pseudo-transition was observed in several quasi-one-dimensional models. In this work, we consider a genuine one-dimensional extended Hubbard model in the atomic limit, influenced by an external magnetic field and with the arbitrary number of particles controlled by the chemical potential. The one-dimensional extended Hubbard model in the atomic limit was initially studied in the seventies and has been investigated over the past decades, but it still surprises us today with its fascinating properties. We rigorously analyze its low-temperature behavior using the transfer matrix technique and provide accurate numerical results. Our analysis confirms that there is an anomalous behavior in the half-filled band, specifically occurring between the alternating pair ($AP$) and paramagnetic ($PM$) phases at zero temperature. Previous investigations did not deeply identify this anomalous behavior, maybe due to the numerical simplicity of the model, but from analytical point of view this is not so easy to manipulate algebraically because one needs to solve an algebraic cubic equation. In this study, we explore this behavior and clearly distinguish the pseudo-transition, which could easily be mistaken with a real phase transition. This anomalous behavior mimics features of both first- and second-order phase transitions. However, due to its nature, we cannot expect a finite-temperature phase transition in this model.</description>

      <title>Signatures of spinon dynamics and phase structure of dipolar-octupolar quantum spin ices in two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how sharp signatures of fractionalization emerge in nonlinear spectroscopy experiments on spin liquids with separated energy scales. Our model is that of dipolar-octupolar rare earth pyrochlore materials, prime candidates for realising quantum spin ice. This family of three dimensional quantum spin liquids exhibits fractionalization of spin degrees of freedom into spinons charged under an emergent $U(1)$ gauge field. We show that the technique of two dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS) can identify clear signatures of fractionalised spinon dynamics in dipolar-octupolar quantum spin ices. However, at intermediate temperatures, spinon dynamics are heavily constrained in the presence of an incoherent spin background, leading to a broad 2DCS response. At lower temperatures, a sharp signal emerges as the system enters a coherent spin liquid state. This lower temperature signal can in turn distinguish between zero-flux and $\pi$-flux forms of quantum spin ice.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic hybridization in CeRhSn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optical conductivity $\sigma(\omega,T)$ of CeRhSn was studied by broadband infrared spectroscopy. Temperature-dependent spectral weight transfer occurs over high energy ($0.8\,$eV) and temperature (${\sim}500\,$K) scales, classifying CeRhSn as a mixed valent compound. The optical conductivity reveals a substantial anisotropy in the electronic structure. Renormalization of $\sigma(\omega,T)$ occurs as a function of temperature to a coherent Kondo state with concomitant effective mass generation. Associated spectroscopic signatures were reproduced remarkably well by the combination of density functional theory and dynamical mean field theory using a momentum-independent self energy. The theory shows that the anisotropy for energies $&gt;10\,$meV is mainly driven by the bare three-dimensional electronic structure that is renormalized by local electronic correlations. The possible influence of magnetic frustration and quantum criticality is restricted to lower energies.</description>

      <title>Transformer neural networks and quantum simulators: a hybrid approach for simulating strongly correlated systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Owing to their great expressivity and versatility, neural networks have gained attention for simulating large two-dimensional quantum many-body systems. However, their expressivity comes with the cost of a challenging optimization due to the in general rugged and complicated loss landscape. Here, we present a hybrid optimization scheme for neural quantum states (NQS) that involves a data-driven pretraining with numerical or experimental data and a second, Hamiltonian-driven optimization stage. By using both projective measurements from the computational basis as well as expectation values from other measurement configurations such as spin-spin correlations, our pretraining gives access to the sign structure of the state, yielding improved and faster convergence that is robust w.r.t. experimental imperfections and limited datasets. We apply the hybrid scheme to the ground state search for the 2D transverse field Ising model and the 2D dipolar XY model on $6\times 6$ and $10\times 10$ square lattices with a patched transformer wave function, using numerical and experimental data from a programmable Rydberg quantum simulator [Chen et al., Nature 616 (2023)], with snapshots of the quantum system obtained from the different measurement configurations, and show that the information from the second basis highly improves the performance. Our work paves the way for a reliable and efficient optimization of neural quantum states.</description>

      <title>Fermion Mass Generation without Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the generation of fermion mass in a context where interactions break a discrete chiral symmetry. Then, fermion mass is not protected by a symmetry, no symmetry is broken by the generation of mass, and a vanishing mass no longer enhances a symmetry. We elaborate these scenarios for template fermionic and Yukawa theories in three dimensions where mass can be generated either by fluctuations, strong dynamics, or the vacuum expectation value of a scalar field. We find that fluctuation-induced contributions to fermion mass are parametrically suppressed in the number of fermion flavours $N$. The generation of fermion mass then takes the form of a rapid crossover which turns into a second order quantum phase transition for large $N$, much like in settings with fundamental chiral symmetry. We further discuss theories where fermion mass can be generated spontaneously without breaking any symmetry other than scale symmetry. Implications of our findings are discussed.</description>

      <title>Holographic description of an anisotropic Dirac semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Holographic quantum matter exploits the AdS/CFT correspondence to study systems in condensed matter physics. An example of these systems are strongly correlated semimetals, which feature a rich phase diagram structure. In this work, we present a holographic model for a Dirac semimetal in $2+1$ dimensions that features a topological phase transition. Our construction relies on deforming a relativistic UV fixed point with some relevant operators that explicitly break rotations and some internal symmetries. The phase diagram for different values of the relevant coupling constants is obtained. The different phases are characterized by distinct dispersion relations for probe fermionic modes in the AdS geometry. We find semi-metallic phases characterized by the presence of Dirac cones and an insulating phase featuring a mass gap with a mild anisotropy. Remarkably, we find as well an anisotropic semi-Dirac phase characterized by a massless a fermionic excitation dispersing linearly in one direction while quadratically in the other.</description>

Abstract: Learning faithful representations of quantum states is crucial to fully characterizing the variety of many-body states created on quantum processors. While various tomographic methods such as classical shadow and MPS tomography have shown promise in characterizing a wide class of quantum states, they face unique limitations in detecting topologically ordered two-dimensional states. To address this problem, we implement and study a heuristic tomographic method that combines variational optimization on tensor networks with randomized measurement techniques. Using this approach, we demonstrate its ability to learn the ground state of the surface code Hamiltonian as well as an experimentally realizable quantum spin liquid state. In particular, we perform numerical experiments using MPS ans\"atze and systematically investigate the sample complexity required to achieve high fidelities for systems of sizes up to $48$ qubits. In addition, we provide theoretical insights into the scaling of our learning algorithm by analyzing the statistical properties of maximum likelihood estimation. Notably, our method is sample-efficient and experimentally friendly, only requiring snapshots of the quantum state measured randomly in the $X$ or $Z$ bases. Using this subset of measurements, our approach can effectively learn any real pure states represented by tensor networks, and we rigorously prove that random-$XZ$ measurements are tomographically complete for such states.</description>

Abstract: The dynamics described by the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian typically capture the short-term behavior of open quantum systems before quantum jumps occur. In contrast, the long-term dynamics, characterized by the Lindblad master equation (LME), drive the system towards a non-equilibrium steady state (NESS), which is an eigenstate with zero energy of the Liouvillian superoperator, denoted as $\mathcal{L}$. Conventionally, these two types of evolutions exhibit distinct dynamical behaviors. However, in this study, we challenge this common belief and demonstrate that the effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian can accurately represent the long-term dynamics of a critical two-level open quantum system. The criticality of the system arises from the exceptional point (EP) of the effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Additionally, the NESS is identical to the coalescent state of the effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. We apply this finding to a series of critical open quantum systems and show that a local dissipation channel can induce collective alignment of all spins in the same direction. This direction can be well controlled by modulating the quantum jump operator. The corresponding NESS is a product state and maintains long-time coherence, facilitating quantum control in open many-body systems. This discovery paves the way for a better understanding of the long-term dynamics of critical open quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an explicit formula for the thermodynamic potential of the AdS dyonic black brane solution with an axio-dilaton hair, which was discovered in an extension of the $(3+1)$d Gubser-Rocha model enjoying S-duality. From the thermodynamic potential, we can compute the magnetization and the magnetic susceptibilities of the dyonic solution. The result of the magnetization is negative implying that the system is diamagnetic. Subsequently, we consider a specific neutral limit of the dyonic solution. In this setup, we find that the system exhibits spontaneous breaking of a global $U(1)$ symmetry. The order parameter is given by a complex operator which is dual to the axio-dilaton field in the bulk. Interestingly, the system has a finite Hall conductivity even in the absence of the external magnetic field, and it is related to the phase of the complex operator.</description>

      <title>Impact of rotational symmetry breaking on $d$-wave superconductivity in Hubbard models for cuprate and nickelate superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments have revealed the substantial impact of broken rotational symmetry on the superconductivity. In the pursuit of understanding the role played by this symmetry breaking particularly in cuprate and nickelate superconductors on their superconductivity, we investigated two characteristic symmetry breaking mechanisms arising from (1) structurally orthogonal distortions from $C_4$ to $C_2$ symmetry and (2) anisotropic hybridization between $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital and an additional metallic band within the framework of the Hubbard model by employing dynamic cluster quantum Monte Carlo calculations. We discovered that the anisotropy is generically detrimental to the $d$-wave pairing so that the experimental findings of much lower superconducting $T_c$ of infinite-layer nickelates compared with the cuprates may be connected to the intrinsic anisotropy. Our exploration sheds light on the fundamental anisotropy factors governing superconductivity in nickelates and cuprates and offer insights contributing to the broader understanding of unconventional superconductors in anisotropic environment.</description>

      <title>Local structural distortions drive magnetic molecular field in a compositionally complex spinel oxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A core challenge in understanding high entropy oxides (HEOs) is how these systems, with five or more cations at a crystallographic site, can withstand local distortions while preserving a uniform structure on a larger scale. We address this for spinel HEO by comparatively examining extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) on (Mn$_{0.2}$Co$_{0.2}$Ni$_{0.2}$Cu$_{0.2}$Zn$_{0.2}$)Cr$_2$O$_4$ ($A^5$Cr$_2$O$_4$) and its parent counterparts $A$Cr$_2$O$_4$ ($A$= Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn). Unlike the HEO with rock-salt structure, the element-specific distortions in disordered sublattice go beyond the first neighbor here. Moreover, the tetragonal distortion around the Cu$^{2+}$ ion, known as a textbook example of the Jahn-Teller effect, is highly reduced in $A^5$Cr$_2$O$_4$ compared to CuCr$_2$O$_4$. Despite variations in the A-O bond lengths, the inter-cationic distances remained remarkably similar. This affirms a high level of flexibility in the positioning of oxygen, enabling them to adapt to the overall cubic symmetry. Despite containing multiple magnetic ions, the Curie-Weiss temperature and effective magnetic moments of $A^5$Cr$_2$O$_4$ are similar to those of NiCr$_2$O$_4$. This can be attributed to both materials' comparable local bond lengths around Cr, as evidenced by EXAFS analysis. This study conclusively presents a method for elucidating how local structural distortions influence the macroscopic properties of compositionally complex quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Prethermalization in the PXP Model under Continuous Quasiperiodic Driving</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments realizing long-lived non-equilibrium states in aperiodically driven quantum many-body systems, we investigate the dynamics of a quasiperiodically driven Rydberg atom chain in the strong Rydberg blockage regime. In this regime, the system is kinetically constrained and the `PXP' model describes its dynamics. Even without driving, the PXP model exhibits many-body scarring and resultant persistent oscillations for dynamics originating from the N\'{e}el-ordered initial state. We demonstrate that a rich array of dynamical behaviors emerge when the system is subjected to a continuous drive. In the high-frequency regime, the system exhibits revivals and oscillations for the N\'{e}el ordered initial state both for periodic and quasi-periodic drives. We trace the origin of this non-ergodicity to an effective PXP Hamiltonian for both of these driving protocols in this regime. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the behavior of the fidelity and the entanglement entropy is non-monotonic at low frequencies in the high-amplitude regime. This leads to several re-entrant scarring transitions both for both the N\'{e}el-ordered and the fully polarized initial state. Our results demonstrate that continuous quasi-periodic drive protocols can provide a promising route to realize prethermal phases of matter in kinetically constrained systems.</description>

Abstract: We introduce an effective field theory (EFT) for conformal impurity by considering a pair of transversely displaced impurities and integrating out modes with mass inversely proportional to the separation distance. This EFT captures the universal signature of the impurity seen by a heavy local operator. We focus on the case of conformal boundaries and derive universal formulas from this EFT for the boundary structure constants at high energy. We point out that the more familiar thermal EFT for conformal field theory is a special case of this EFT with distinguished conformal boundaries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.01299v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A many-body quantum system with varying parameters can exhibit two distinct quantum states within the same energy shell. This allows for a dynamic transition from the ground state of the pre-quench Hamiltonian to a steady state of the post-quench Hamiltonian. We investigate the dynamic response of the ground states in a two-layer half-filled Hubbard model to a perpendicular electric field. We demonstrate that the steady state exhibits conductivity when the field is in resonance with the on-site repulsion, while the initial state is a Mott-insulating state. Additionally, the two layers exhibit identical conducting behavior due to the formation of long-lived dopings, as evidenced by the charge fluctuation. The key factor in achieving this dynamic transition is the cooperative interplay between on-site interactions and the resonant field, rather than the individual roles they play. Our findings offer an alternative mechanism for field-induced conductivity in strongly correlated systems.</description>

Abstract: We derive Lorentz-invariant four-fermion interactions, including Nambu-Jona-Lasinio type and superconducting type, which are widely studied in high-energy physics, from the honeycomb lattice Hamiltonian with Hubbard interaction. We investigate the phase transitions induced by these two interactions and consider the effects of the chemical potential and magnetic flux (Haldane mass term) on these phase transitions. We find that the charge-density-wave and superconductivity generated by the attractive interactions are mainly controlled by the chemical potential, while the magnetic flux delimits the domain of phase transition. Our analysis underscores the influence of the initial topological state on the phase transitions, a facet largely overlooked in prior studies. We present experimental protocols using cold atoms to verify our theoretical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06732v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The locally noncentrosymmetric heavy fermion superconductor CeRh$_2$As$_2$ has attracted considerable interests due to its rich superconducting phases, accompanied by a quadrupole density wave and pronounced antiferromagnetic excitations. To understand the underlying physics, we here report measurements from high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission. Our results reveal fine splittings of the conduction bands related to the locally noncentrosymmetric structure, as well as a quasi-two-dimensional Fermi surface (FS) with strong $4f$ contributions. The FS exhibits nesting with an in-plane vector $({\pi}/a, {\pi}/a)$, which is facilitated by the van Hove singularity near $\bar X$ that arises from the characteristic conduction-$f$ hybridization. The FS nesting provides a natural explanation for the observed antiferromagnetic excitations at $({\pi}/a, {\pi}/a)$, which could be intimately connected to its unconventional superconductivity. Our experimental results are well supported by density functional theory plus dynamical mean field theory calculations, which can capture the strong correlation effects. Our study not only provides spectroscopic proof of the key factors underlying the field-induced superconducting transition, but also uncovers the critical role of FS nesting and lattice Kondo effect in the intertwined spin and charge fluctuations.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the observation of partial magnetic order in kagome-based magnets, we study the classical kagome Ising antiferromagnet, known as kagome spin ice, including further-neighbor interactions at zero and finite temperature. While the nearest-neighbor model displays an extensive ground-state degeneracy, various symmetry-breaking states can appear upon including additional couplings. Among these, peculiar partially ordered states have been proposed. We present results from large-scale Monte-Carlo simulations, establishing that such partial order is stabilized by third-neighbor couplings along the hexagon diagonals. We show that these states arise due to the emergence of one-dimensional chains in an entirely frustrated environment, and that they are stable with respect to further couplings. We discuss their finite-temperature properties in detail, highlight the magnetic states' peculiarities depending on the diagonal couplings' sign, and suggest observing these states using thermodynamic probes.</description>

      <title>Phase diagram of the interacting Haldane model with spin-dependent sublattice potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17813v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the exact-diagonalization (ED) and mean-field (MF) approaches, we investigate the ground-state phase diagram of the interacting Haldane model on the honeycomb lattice, incorporating spin-dependent sublattice potentials $\Delta_{\sigma,\alpha}$. Here $\alpha=\text{A}$,$\text{B}$ and $\sigma=\uparrow$,$\downarrow$ denote the sublattice and spin components, respectively. Setting $\Delta_{\sigma,\text{A}}=+\Delta$ ($-\Delta$) and $\Delta_{\sigma,\text{B}}$$=-\Delta$ ($+\Delta$) for $\sigma=\uparrow$ ($\downarrow$) results in the system favoring a spin ordered state. Conversely, introducing the nearest-neighbor Coulomb interaction can induce charge ordering in the system. Due to the competition between these factors, we observe that in both ED and MF approaches, an exotic state with Chern number $C=1$ survives amidst two locally ordered phases and a topologically ordered phase with $C=2$. In the ED method, various properties, such as the fidelity metric, the excitation gap and the structure factors, are employed to identify critical points. In the MF method, using a sufficiently large lattice size, we define the local order parameters and band gaps to characterize the phase transitions. The interacting Haldane model and the spin-dependent lattice potential may be experimentally realized in an ultracold atom gas, providing a potential means to detect this intriguing state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05031v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study dimerization transitions in a frustrated spin-3 chain with next-nearest neighbor and three-site interactions. We show that two independent coupling constants of the model are sufficient to fine-tune the system to the critical point in the Wess-Zumino-Witten SU(2)$_6$ universality class. This critical point appears as the end point of an extended SU(2)$_4$ critical line. This implies that the renormalization group flow lead to the critical theory with the largest level $k$ such that the number of relevant operators is reduced by one and the parity of the level is preserved. Furthermore, we argue that due to the presence of marginal operator there is only one point in the SU(2)$_6$ universality class. In addition, we report the appearance of non-magnetic Ising transition between the topologically trivial uniform and dimerized phases. This transition takes place within the singlet sector, while magnetic gap remains open.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11434v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The application of twist engineering in van der Waals magnets has opened new frontiers in the field of two-dimensional magnetism, yielding distinctive magnetic domain structures. Despite the introduction of numerous theoretical methods, limitations persist in terms of accuracy or efficiency due to the complex nature of the magnetic Hamiltonians pertinent to these systems. In this study, we introduce a deep-learning approach to tackle these challenges. Utilizing customized, fully connected networks, we develop two deep-neural-network kernels that facilitate efficient and reliable analysis of twisted van der Waals magnets. Our regression model is adept at estimating the magnetic Hamiltonian parameters of twisted bilayer CrI3 from its magnetic domain images generated through atomistic spin simulations. The generative model excels in producing precise magnetic domain images from the provided magnetic parameters. The trained networks for these models undergo thorough validation, including statistical error analysis and assessment of robustness against noisy injections. These advancements not only extend the applicability of deep-learning methods to twisted van der Waals magnets but also streamline future investigations into these captivating yet poorly understood systems.</description>

The 3D phase diagram showing the evolution of competing phases with $B$, interaction strength and an out-of-plane electric field is presented at electron fillings that follow the Diophantine equation along Chern number $-\text{sign}\left(B\right)$ line, that is pointing away from the charge neutral filling, where we find prominent Chern insulators consistent with the experiments. We also explain the experimental absence of prominent Chern insulators along the Chern number $+\text{sign}\left(B\right)$ line.</description>

      <title>Nematic, chiral and topological superconductivity in transition metal dichalcogenides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2110.10172v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study a realistic model for superconductivity in twisted bilayer WSe$_{2}$, where electron pairing arises from spin-valley fluctuations in the weak-coupling regime. Our model comprises both the full continuum model moir\'{e} bandstructure and a short-ranged repulsive interaction. By calculating the spin-valley susceptibility, we identify a Fermi surface nesting feature near half-filling of the top-most moir\'{e} band, which induces significantly enhanced spin-valley fluctuations. We then analyze the dominant Kohn-Luttinger pairing instabilities due to these spin-valley fluctuations and show that the leading instability corresponds to a two-component order parameter, which can give rise to nematic, chiral and topological superconductivity. As our findings are asymptotically exact for small interaction strengths, they provide a viable starting point for future studies of superconductivity in twisted transition metal dichalcogenide bilayers.</description>

      <title>The Schwinger-Keldysh Coset Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The coset construction is a tool for systematically building low energy effective actions for Nambu-Goldstone modes. This technique is typically used to compute time-ordered correlators appropriate for $S$-matrix computations for systems in their ground state. In this paper, we extend this technique to the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, which enables one to calculate a wider variety of correlators and applies also to systems in a mixed state. We focus our attention on internal symmetries and demonstrate that, after identifying the appropriate symmetry breaking pattern, Schwinger-Keldysh effective actions for Nambu-Goldstone modes can be constructed using the standard rules of the coset construction. Particular emphasis is placed on the thermal state and ensuring that correlators satisfy the KMS relation. We also discuss explicitly the power counting scheme underlying our effective actions. We comment on the similarities and differences between our approach and others that have previously appeared in the literature. In particular, our prescription does not require the introduction of additional ``diffusive'' symmetries and retains the full non-linear structure generated by the coset construction. We conclude with a series of explicit examples, including a computation of the finite-temperature two-point functions of conserved spin currents in non-relativistic paramagnets, antiferromagnets, and ferromagnets. Along the way, we also clarify the discrete symmetries that set antiferromagnets apart from ferromagnets, and point out that the dynamical KMS symmetry must be implemented in different ways in these two systems.</description>

      <title>Solving Conformal Defects in 3D Conformal Field Theory using Fuzzy Sphere Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01903v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Defects in conformal field theory (CFT) are of significant theoretical and experimental importance. The presence of defects theoretically enriches the structure of the CFT, but at the same time, it makes it more challenging to study, especially in dimensions higher than two. Here, we demonstrate that the recently-developed theoretical scheme, \textit{fuzzy (non-commutative) sphere regularization}, provides a powerful lens through which one can dissect the defect of 3D CFTs in a transparent way. As a notable example, we study the magnetic line defect of 3D Ising CFT and clearly demonstrate that it flows to a conformal defect fixed point. We have identified 6 low-lying defect primary operators, including the displacement operator, and accurately extract their scaling dimensions through the state-operator correspondence. Moreover, we also compute one-point bulk correlators and two-point bulk-defect correlators, which show great agreement with predictions of defect conformal symmetry, and from which we extract various bulk-defect operator product expansion coefficients. Our work demonstrates that the fuzzy sphere offers a powerful tool for exploring the rich physics in 3D defect CFTs.</description>

      <title>Orbital-Dependent Electron Correlation in Double-Layer Nickelate La3Ni2O7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The latest discovery of high temperature superconductivity near 80K in La3Ni2O7 under high pressure has attracted much attention. Many proposals are put forth to understand the origin of superconductivity.The determination of electronic structures is a prerequisite to establish theories to understand superconductivity in nickelates but is still lacking. Here we report our direct measurement of the electronic structures of La3Ni2O7 by high-resolution angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy. The Fermi surface and band structures of La3Ni2O7 are observed and compared with the band structure calculations. Strong electron correlations are revealed which are orbital- and momentum dependent. A flat band is formed from the Ni-3dz2 orbitals around the zone corner which is ~50meV below the Fermi level and exhibits the strongest electron correlation. In many theoretical proposals, this band is expected to play the dominant role in generating superconductivity in La3Ni2O7. Our observations provide key experimental information to understand the electronic structure and origin of high temperature superconductivity in La3Ni2O7.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03127v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quest to identify and observe Majorana fermions in physics and condensed-matter systems remains an important challenge. Here, we introduce a qubit (spin-$1/2$) from the occurrence of two delocalized zero-energy Majorana fermions in a model of two spins-$1/2$ on the Bloch sphere within the fractional one-half topological state. We address specific protocols in time with circularly polarized light and the protection of this delocalized spin-$1/2$ state related to quantum information protocols. We also show how disorder can play a positive and important role allowing singlet-triplet transitions and resulting in an additional elongated region for the fractional phase, demonstrating the potential of this platform related to applications in topologically protected quantum information. We generalize our approach with an array and Majorana fermions at the edges in a ring geometry.</description>

      <title>Dynamical quantum phase transitions following a noisy quench</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study how time-dependent energy fluctuations impact the dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) following a noisy ramped quench of the transverse magnetic field in a quantum Ising chain. By numerically solving the stochastic Schr\"odinger equation of the mode-decoupled fermionic Hamiltonian of the problem, we identify two generic scenarios: Depending on the amplitude of the noise and the rate of the ramp, the expected periodic sequence of noiseless DQPTs may either be uniformly shifted in time or else replaced by a disarray of closely spaced DQPTs. Guided by an exact noise master equation, we trace the phenomenon to the interplay between noise-induced excitations which accumulate during the quench and the near-adiabatic dynamics of the massive modes of the system. Our analysis generalizes to any 1D fermionic two-band model subject to a noisy quench.</description>

      <title>Elastic Softening in Synthetic Diamonds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03377v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study reveals a novel phenomenon demonstrating the elastic softening of synthetic diamonds when cooled to very low temperatures below 1 K. We present the results of ultrasonic measurements of single-crystalline synthetic diamonds without irradiation, namely type-IIa (colorless) and Ib (yellow) diamonds grown by high-pressure-high-temperature synthesis as well as type-IIa diamond grown by chemical vapor deposition. We observed divergent decreasing of the elastic stiffness constant $C_{44}$ in all samples at low temperatures down to 20 mK. We argue for the existence of electric quadrupolar degrees of freedom with the irreducible representation of T$_2$ in diamond as the origin of this elastic softening and the possible ground state preserves local T$_d$ symmetry down to around absolute zero. Of the ground states of atomic vacancies in diamond proposed thus far, the only relevant one is the positively charged single atomic vacancy V$^+$, which has not been observed in the previous optical measurements in the irradiated diamonds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08642v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient and accurate algorithm for partition function, free energy and thermal entropy calculations is of great significance in statistical physics and quantum many-body physics. Here we present an unbiased but low-technical-barrier algorithm within the quantum Monte Carlo framework, which has exceptionally high accuracy and no systemic error. Compared with the conventional specific heat integral method and Wang-Landau sampling algorithm, our method can obtain a much more accurate result of the sub-leading coefficient of the entropy. This method can be widely used in both classical and quantum Monte Carlo simulations and is easy to be parallelized on computer.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Protected Topological Phases of Mixed States in the Doubled Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13280v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interplay of symmetry and topology in quantum many-body mixed states has recently garnered significant interest. In a phenomenon not seen in pure states, mixed states can exhibit average symmetries -- symmetries that act on component states while leaving the ensemble invariant. In this work, we systematically characterize symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases of short-range entangled (SRE) mixed states of spin systems -- protected by both average and exact symmetries -- by studying their pure Choi states in a doubled Hilbert space, where the familiar notions and tools for SRE and SPT pure states apply. This advantage of the doubled space comes with a price: extra symmetries as well as subtleties around how hermiticity and positivity of the original density matrix constrain the possible SPT invariants. Nevertheless, the doubled space perspective allows us to obtain a systematic classification of mixed-state SPT (MSPT) phases. We also investigate the robustness of MSPT invariants under symmetric finite-depth quantum channels, the bulk-boundary correspondence for MSPT phases, and the consequences of the MSPT invariants for the separability of mixed states and the symmetry-protected sign problem. In addition to MSPT phases, we study the patterns of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of mixed states, including the phenomenon of exact-to-average SSB, and the order parameters that detect them. Mixed state SSB is related to an ingappability constraint on symmetric Lindbladian dynamics.</description>

      <title>Bipartite Sachdev-Ye Models with Read-Saleur Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an SU(M)-symmetric disordered bipartite spin model with unusual characteristics. Although superficially similar to the Sachdev-Ye model, it has several markedly different properties for M&gt;2. In particular, it has a large non-trivial nullspace whose dimension grows exponentially with system size. The states in this nullspace are frustration-free, and are ground states when the interactions are ferromagnetic. The exponential growth of the nullspace leads to Hilbert-space fragmentation and a violation of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. We demonstrate that the commutant algebra responsible for this fragmentation is a non-trivial subalgebra of the Read-Saleur commutant algebra of certain nearest-neighbour models such as the spin-1 biquadratic spin chain. We also discuss the low-energy behaviour of correlations for the disordered version of this model in the limit of a large number of spins and large M, using techniques similar to those applied to the SY model. We conclude by generalizing the Shiraishi-Mori embedding formalism to non-local models, and apply it to turn some of our nullspace states into quantum many-body scars.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Resolution in non-Lorentzian Field Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Starting from the computation of Symmetry Resolved Entanglement Entropy (SREE) for boosted intervals in a two dimensional Conformal Field Theory, we compute the same in various non-Lorentzian limits, viz, Galilean and Carrollian Conformal Field Theory in same number of dimensions. We approach the problem both from a limiting perspective and by using intrinsic symmetries of respective non-Lorentzian conformal algebras. In particular, we calculate the leading order terms, logarithmic terms, and the $\mathcal{O}(1)$ terms and explicitly show exact compliance with $\textit{equipartition of entanglement}$, even in the non-Lorentzian system. Keeping in mind the holographic origin of SREE for the Carrollian limit, we further compute SREE for BMS$_{3}$-Kac-Moody, which couples a $U(1)\times U(1)$ theory with bulk gravity.</description>
