      <title>A new suite of Lund-tree observables to resolve jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a class of collider observables, named Lund-Tree Shapes (LTS), defined from declustering trees originating from the Lund jet plane representation of the QCD radiation pattern in multi-jet scattering processes. At the differential level, they are continuous global variables akin classical event shapes and $n\to n+1$ jet-resolution parameters, which probe the geometry and hierarchical structure of the radiation in an event. At the integrated, cumulative level, they naturally define $n$ jet rates, providing a jet-multiplicity-based characterisation of multi-jet final states. Their definition applies to scattering processes with any number of resolved jets in the final state, as well as to groomed jets. They are thus usable as resolution variables in the context of higher-order calculations via phase-space slicing, matching fixed-order calculations to parton showers, and testing the logarithmic accuracy of shower algorithms. From a theoretical viewpoint, such observables feature a simple all-order structure and are free of non-global logarithmic corrections. As an initial application, we derive next-to-next-to-leading-logarithmic accurate predictions for processes with two QCD legs at $e e$, $pp$ and $e p$ colliders, and matched predictions to next-to-next-to-leading order for the LHC, discussing aspects of collider phenomenology.</description>

      <title>WIMP Meets ALP: Coherent Freeze-Out of Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the cosmological history of a weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) coupled to a light axion-like particle (ALP) via a quadratic coupling. Although the coupling is too feeble to thermalize the ALP, coherent forward scattering between the two sectors induces temperature-dependent mass shifts that substantially modify both WIMP freeze-out and ALP misalignment dynamics, giving rise to a novel coherent freeze-out mechanism. At high temperatures, the WIMP thermal bath spontaneously breaks the symmetry of the ALP potential, displacing the field to a new vacuum. The resulting back-reaction reduces the WIMP effective mass and delays its freeze-out. Depending on the strength of the coupling, symmetry restoration occurs via either a first-order phase transition (FOPT) or a crossover. In the FOPT regime, dark matter consists solely of WIMPs, whose delayed freeze-out permits annihilation cross sections up to two (five) orders of magnitude above the standard value for $s$-wave ($p$-wave) annihilation, while still yielding the correct relic density. In the crossover regime, both WIMP and ALP can contribute to dark matter. Remarkably, we find an "ALP miracle": a Planck-suppressed quadratic coupling yields an ALP abundance comparable to the observed dark matter density, largely independent of its initial displacement and mass.</description>

      <title>Radiative Neutrino Mass Generation and Dark Matter through Vector-like Leptons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a radiative three-loop framework for neutrino mass generation, employing an asymmetric Yukawa coupling between two new scalar $SU(2)_L$ doublets and vector-like lepton doublets. Dark matter candidates arise from the scalar sector of one of the doublets and play a crucial role in the generation of neutrino masses through their nonzero scalar mixing. The singly charged scalar sector undergoes an analogous mixing structure. A single generation of vector-like leptons yields three nondegenerate neutrino masses as a consequence of the asymmetric Yukawa combinations entering the neutrino mass matrix. The model is tested against dark matter phenomenology, neutrino mass and mixing data, and the charged lepton flavor-violating process $\mu \rightarrow e \gamma$, showing compatibility with current bounds and leading to experimentally accessible predictions.</description>

      <title>Competition of $\chi_{c}(2P)$ quarkonia and continuum in $e^+ e^- \to e^+ e^- D \bar{D}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the production of $D \bar{D}$ pairs in $e^+ e^-$ collisions, where $D$ refers to either $D^0$ or $D^+$. The continuum mechanism with the $t/u$-channel vector-meson $D^*$ exchanges are considered. The results of the calculation depend on the parameter of the off-shell form-factor for the virtual $D^*$ mesons. The $D^* D \gamma$ coupling constants are found from the $D^* \to D \gamma$ decays. We find relatively large contribution for the $D^0 {\bar D}^0$ channel and much smaller contribution in the $D^+ D^-$ channel. In the second case we consider also the $D^{\pm}$ exchanges. We conclude that the bump at $M_{D^0 {\bar D}^0} = 3.8$ GeV observed by the Belle and BaBar Collaborations has rather continuum origin than it corresponds to the broad resonance $\chi_{c0}(3860)$. We discuss also production of the $\chi_{c2}(3930)$ resonance which is a candidate for the $\chi_{c2}(2P)$ state. This state can decay into both $D \bar{D}$ channels, however the branching fractions are not well known at present. From a comparison of our model results to the BaBar data we find $B(\chi_{c2}(3930) \to D \bar{D}) = 0.58 \pm 0.13$ using the two-photon width $\Gamma_{\gamma \gamma} = 0.544$ keV (obtained for the Buchm\"uller-Tye potential) evaluated within the light-front approach (NRQCD limit). Our finding of $\Gamma_{\gamma \gamma} \times B(\chi_{c2}(3930) \to D \bar{D}) = 0.32 \pm 0.07$ keV is close to the Belle and BaBar results. Realistic predictions of the differential distributions in several variables and integrated cross-sections are given for the Belle II kinematics.</description>

      <title>Next-to-leading order analysis of $J/\psi + \gamma$ production in photon-photon collisions at CEPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically investigate the production of $J/\psi + \gamma$ in $\gamma\gamma$ collisions at next-to-leading order in $\alpha_s$ within nonrelativistic QCD (NRQCD) factorization. Calculations for CEPC energy region show the resolved photon contribution is negligible, while the direct photon process dominates, yielding substantial annual $J/\psi$ yields. Significant modifications to $J/\psi$ polarization parameters emerge from color-octet mechanisms, and different NRQCD long distance matrix elements (LDMEs) further yield distinct polarization patterns. Furthermore, the polarization predictions are highly sensitive to the $^3P_J^{[8]}$ LDME, while being insensitive to the $^1S_0^{[8]}$ and $^3S_1^{[8]}$ LDMEs. Leveraging the cleaner environment of $e^+e^-$ collisions versus hadronic processes, the production of $J/\psi$ associated with a photon in $\gamma\gamma$ collisions provides a high-precision platform to test LDMEs universality and resolve longstanding $J/\psi$ polarization puzzles.</description>

      <title>Rescaled Leptonic Unitary Triangles and Rephasing Invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of neutrino physics has made significant progress in measuring the strength and frequency of neutrino and antineutrino oscillations in the past two decades. It is clear that the amplitudes involved in the neutrino oscillation probabilities are all phase-reshaping invariants of the quartet forms of the elements of the PMNS mixing matrix. We show in this paper how these quartet observables can be directly linked to the rescaled leptonic unitarity triangles within the framework of three active neutrinos. We provide a systematic discussion of the nine CP-conserving quartets ${\cal R}^{}_{\gamma k} \equiv {\rm Re} \left [ V^{}_{\alpha i} V^{}_{\beta j} V^{*}_{\alpha j} V^{*}_{\beta i}\right ] $ along with the universal Jarlskog invariant of CP violation ${\cal J} \equiv \sum_\gamma \epsilon^{}_{\alpha\beta\gamma} \sum_k \epsilon^{}_{ijk} \; {\rm Im} \left [ V^{}_{\alpha i} V^{}_{\beta j} V^{*}_{\alpha j} V^{*}_{\beta i} \right ]$, and place particular emphasis on the matter effect on these quartets. In addition to the well-known Naumov relation for the Jarlskog invariant ${\cal J}$, similar relations connecting ${\cal R}$ in vacuum and its effective counterparts $\widetilde{\cal R}$ in matter are introduced and examined in detail. We find that the effective CP-conserving invariants $\widetilde{\cal R}^{}_{\alpha i}$ in matter can be regarded as linear combinations of their vacuum counterparts. With the latest global fit data of neutrino masses and mixing elements, numerical analyses are carried out to give an intuitive understanding of how these phase-rephasing invariants evolve as the matter density increases.</description>

      <title>Charm associated production of the pseudoscalar Higgs boson $h''$ in the MCPM' at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss charm associated production of the pseudoscalar Higgs boson $h''$ in the MCPM'. In our analysis we assume $m_{h''}$ = 95.4 GeV, which corresponds to an enhancement observed by the CMS collaboration in the $\gamma \gamma$ channel. As discussed recently, the MCPM' is consistent with the CMS enhancement. In this model the $h''$ Higgs boson of this mass decays dominantly into $c \bar c$ jets. The cross section for the associated $h''$ production in $p p \to h'' c \bar c$ is found to be almost as big as that for the Drell-Yan (DY) $c \bar c \to h''$ production, much larger than that for two-gluon fusion $g g \to h''$. Since in the MCPM' the dominant $h''$ decay is into the $c \bar c$ channel we have to deal with the $p p \to c \bar c c \bar c$ process with $c$ and $\bar c$ jets. In addition to the signal processes, we have sizeable single parton scattering (SPS) and double parton scattering (DPS) nonresonant background. In our analysis we include diagrams of gluon-gluon fusion $g g \to h''$ which lead to the $c \bar c c \bar c$ final state. We discuss also the possible role of the reaction $p p \to h'' h''$. Assuming 100\% c and $\bar c$ jet tagging we discuss in detail how to improve the signal-to-background ratio. Our analysis shows promising resonance-like enhancements and relatively large cross sections in the $c \bar c c \bar c$ channel within the MCPM'. The ALICE-3 project would be ideal in the future to perform the experimental studies corresponding to the theoretical studies discussed here.</description>

      <title>Formation of primordial black holes through Q-balls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the primordial black hole (PBH) formation from Q-balls that are non-topological solitons in scalar field theories. We develop a formula for calculating the density perturbations from the Q-ball charge distribution. We also re-examine the condition for the PBH formation in the matter-dominated era and show that the previously derived formula for super-horizon density fluctuations can be applied to the sub-horizon density perturbations. As an example, we consider the Q-balls in the case of gauge-mediated supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking, whose charge distribution was obtained by the lattice simulation. We find that the density perturbations are large enough to produce a significant number of PBHs with mass $10^{-15}\,M_\odot -5\times 10^{-12}\, M_\odot$, which can explain all the dark matter in the universe. In the context of supersymmetry, this mass range corresponds to the SUSY breaking scale $\sim 10^6$ GeV, which is consistent with the SUSY particle masses $\sim 10$ TeV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gradient-flow formalism provides a framework for the direct determination of moments of parton distribution functions (PDFs) from lattice QCD calculations. Their conversion from the gradient-flow scheme to $\overline{\text{MS}}$ requires the matching coefficients of the short-flow-time expansion, which can be computed perturbatively. We determine these coefficients for the first six non-singlet PDF moments up to next-to-next-to-leading order in the strong coupling.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the Spectator Effect on Light Nuclei Production in Nucleus-Nucleus Collisions at High Baryon Density Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The light nuclei yields and yield ratios, as sensitive probes of the QCD phase transition, have been precisely measured at various collision energies.However, due to limited detector acceptance, the full $p_{\rm T}$ integral yield often requires extrapolation of the measured transverse momentum spectra to the unmeasured low-$p_{\rm T}$ region via functional fitting.Simulations with the AMPT-HC transport model and an after-burner coalescence approach indicate a significant low-$p_{\rm T}$ enhancement in peripheral collisions or forward rapidities, primarily originating from spectator nucleons.Consequently, conventional extrapolations tend to underestimate the true light nuclei yields.</description>

      <title>Parameter Inference from Final-State Entanglement in Higgs Decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The decay out-states of unstable Standard Model (SM) particles provide a unique, well-defined intrinsic quantum-information probe of the SM parameter space. We use Higgs decays as a test case: after tracing out kinematics, we compute entanglement among final-state spins and colors across all decay channels and impose a near-maximal entanglement-entropy criterion. This criterion yields quantitative indications for fundamental parameters. Within the SM, the entanglement entropy exhibits a global maximum close to the observed Higgs mass and the measured $W$ mass, the latter being equivalent to the $SU(2)_L$ gauge coupling. In a two-parameter kappa framework, applying the same criterion points to an SM-like balance between vector and fermion couplings, constraining the ratio of the sector-wide rescalings. These results suggest that entanglement extremality can serve as a complementary handle on fundamental parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Polynomial Observable Prediction Exchange Format, POPxf, a structured, machine-readable data format for the publication and exchange of semi-analytical theoretical predictions in high energy physics. The format is designed to encode observables that can be expressed in terms of polynomials in model parameters, with particular emphasis on Effective Field Theory applications. All relevant assumptions and metadata are recorded explicitly, and the treatment of uncertainties and correlations is flexible enough to capture parameter-dependent effects. The format aims to improve reproducibility, facilitate global fits and reinterpretations, and streamline the use of theoretical predictions across the particle physics community.</description>

      <title>Quantum artificial intelligence for pattern recognition at high-energy colliders: Tales of Three "Quantum's"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing applications are an emerging field in high-energy physics. Its ambitious fusion with artificial intelligence is expected to deliver significant efficiency gains over existing methods and/or enable computation from a fundamentally different perspective. High-energy physics is a big data science that utilizes large-scale facilities, detectors, high-performance computing, and its worldwide networks. The experimental workflow consumes a significant amount of computing resources, and its annual cost will continue to grow exponentially at future colliders. In particular, pattern recognition is one of the most crucial and computationally intensive tasks. Three types of quantum computing technologies, i.e., quantum gates, quantum annealing, and quantum-inspired, are all actively investigated for high-energy physics applications, and each has its pros and cons. This article reviews the current status of quantum computing applications for pattern recognition at high-energy colliders.</description>

      <title>Growth of Cosmic Strings with Field-Dependent Tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel mechanism to produce a cosmic network of fundamental superstrings based on a time-varying string tension has been recently proposed. It has been found that fundamental superstrings can grow in a kinating background driven by the rolling of the volume modulus of Type IIB string compactifications towards the minimum of its potential. In this talk, I will generalise this analysis using dynamical systems techniques. First, I will analyse the cosmological growth of strings with a field-dependent tension in a Universe filled with a perfect fluid, finding a growth region in the phase space of this system. This machinery is then applied to both fundamental superstrings and effective strings obtained from wrapping $p$-branes on $(p-1)$- dimensional cycles. I will show how cosmological growth can be achieved in both cases not only in kinating backgrounds, but also in scaling fixed points. This talk is based on arXiv:2502.14953.</description>

      <title>Hybrid-spin decoupling for noise-resilient DC quantum sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The excellent sensitivities of quantum sensors are a double-edged sword: minuscule quantities can be observed, but any undesired signal acts as noise. This is challenging when detecting quantities that are obscured by such noise. Decoupling sequences improve coherence times and hence sensitivities, though only AC signals in narrow frequency bands are distinguishable. Alternatively, comagnetometers operate gaseous spin mixtures at high temperatures in the self-compensating regime to counteract slowly varying noise. These are applied with great success in various exotic spin-interaction searches. Here, we propose a method that decouples specific DC fields from DC and AC magnetic noise. It requires any spin cluster where the effect on each individual spin is different for the target field and local magnetic fields, which allows for a different approach compared to comagnetometers. The presented method has several key advantages, including an orders-of-magnitude increase in noise frequencies to which we are resistant. We explore electron-spin nuclear-spin pairs in nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond, with a focus on their merit for light dark-matter searches. Other applications include gradient sensing, quantum memory, and gyroscopes.</description>

      <title>EFT meets CFT: Multiloop renormalization of higher-dimensional operators in general $\boldsymbol{\phi^4}$ theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The renormalization of composite operators is a fundamental aspect of quantum field theory, relevant for the description of phase transitions and high energy phenomenology. We calculate the anomalous dimensions of a large set of operators in any scalar $\phi^4$ theory in $d=4-\varepsilon$ dimensions, up to five loops in most cases. The results have applications in both effective field theory (EFT) and conformal field theory (CFT). As an EFT application, we extract the five-loop renormalization group (RG) equations of the Higgs sector of the Standard Model EFT at dimension six, and up to two loops at dimension eight, aligning our operator basis with custodial symmetry violation. Additionally, for CFT, by resumming the $\varepsilon$-expanded results at the fixed-point, we determine the entire low-lying spectrum (i.e. up to dimension six and Lorentz rank two) of the Ising, $O(n)$ and hypercubic scalar CFTs. Our work enables future conformal bootstrap studies for numerous theories of interest. We include introductions to EFT and CFT, and we illustrate our method and the structure in RG mixing matrices in several illuminating examples, which may also be of general interest. All results in the general theory are publicly available and we describe a systematic path towards applying them to more complicated CFTs.</description>

      <title>In-depth analysis of the clustering of dark matter particles around primordial black holes. Part II. Analytical prescriptions for spikes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are very appealing dark matter (DM) candidates. It is highly plausible though, should they exist, that they would not make up all of the DM. Several studies showed that if the rest of DM is made of thermal particles, then these should accumulate around such PBHs, leading to the formation of very dense spikes in the radiation era. We contributed a detailed analytical study about this phenomenon, providing clear explanations as for the origin of scaling relations in the form of power-law density profiles with up to 3 different spectral indices, i.e. $3/4$, $3/2$, and $9/4$, and 4 asymptotic regimes. Here, we further derive an approximate analytical solution that enables fast numerical predictions for the density profiles of these spikes. We also address the specific case of self-annihilating DM species and derive new approximate analytical formulae. Our approximate density yields the correct annihilation rate within $\pm 15\%$ precision. We then focus on indirect detection in the cosmic microwave background and in extragalactic gamma-rays. We shed new and subtle light on how mutually exclusive PBHs and self-annihilating DM species can really be. In particular, the discovery of a population of sub-solar PBHs would set stringent constraints on the $s$-wave annihilation cross-section of these particles, a point so far missed in the literature.</description>

      <title>GSpyNetTreeS: a machine learning solution for glitch localization in time and frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data from ground-based gravitational wave detectors are often contaminated by non-Gaussian instrumental artifacts or detector noise transients. Unbiased source property estimation relies on the ability to correctly identify and characterize these artifacts and remove them if necessary. To this end, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration has implemented candidate vetting for all significant candidates to identify the presence of artifacts and assess the need for mitigation. The current candidate vetting process requires human experts to identify the frequency ranges and the time windows associated with any data quality issues present. Differences in judgment between human experts may cause inconsistency, making results difficult to reproduce across gravitational wave events. We present GSpyNetTreeS, an extension to GSpyNetTree based on the You Only Look Once algorithm, for the automatic detection, classification, and time-frequency localization of detector noise transients. As a proof of concept, we tested GSpyNetTreeS's performance on the data collected by the LIGO detectors during the third observing run for gravitational waves as well as common detector glitch classes included in GSpyNetTree: Blip, Low frequency blip, Low frequency line and Scratchy. We also demonstrated that GSpyNetTreeS is capable of accurately identifying common glitch classes and capturing the frequency and time information associated with detected detector noise transients, establishing its potential as an automatic event validation tool for LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's observing runs.</description>

      <title>Self-bound quark stars with a first-order two-to-three flavor phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate self-bound quark stars in a flavor-dependent quark-mass density-dependent (QMDD) model with an excluded-volume correction. We chart the parameter space at zero pressure to identify self-bound regimes, including cases with a first-order $ud \to uds$ transition, and construct cold, $\beta$-equilibrated stellar sequences via the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations. The excluded-volume parameter $\kappa$ controls the stiffness of the equation of state and thus masses, radii, tidal deformabilities, and moments of inertia. Intermediate repulsion typically reconciles $M_{\max} \gtrsim 2\,M_\odot$ with current radius/tidal constraints, with hybrid self-bound objects more compatible than pure strange-quark stars. We identify three EOS-insensitive trends $-$ dimensionless moment of inertia vs. compactness, tidal deformability vs. compactness, and gravitational vs. baryonic compactness $-$ whose explicit $\kappa$-dependence largely disappears in dimensionless form (the first two being notably tighter than the third). These results provide model-guided priors and tools for discriminating between hadronic and self-bound EOS families with multimessenger data.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Admixed White Dwarfs: A Single-Fluid Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the influence of an admixed fermionic dark matter (DM) component on the equilibrium structure of white dwarfs (WDs), with particular emphasis on the effects of varying the DM particle mass ($m_{\rm DM}$) and DM fraction ($f_{\rm DM}$). Notably, we employ a single-fluid approximation for the first time in this context, wherein the baryonic and DM contributions to the total energy density and pressure are treated within a unified framework, assuming non-interacting fermionic DM in hydrostatic equilibrium with baryons. We examine how variations in $m_{\mathrm{DM}}$ and $f_\mathrm{DM}$ modify the equation of state (EoS), the mass-radius relationship, and the internal mass and pressure distributions of WDs. Our results show that the presence of DM softens the EoS, with lighter DM particles providing stronger pressure support and leading to more extended stellar structures. Increasing the DM mass fraction leads to a more compact configuration, reducing both the radius and maximum mass of the WD. We further demonstrate that heavier DM particles enhance stellar compactness and can eventually drive the star toward gravitational instability. Moreover, the analysis of mass-radius relationships reveals that while small fractions of DM are consistent with observed WD masses, the radii predicted by our models are smaller than observations, suggesting additional influences such as rotation or magnetic fields. Our stability analysis confirms that the inclusion of dark matter does not lead to instability within the expected parameter space, indicating that white dwarfs admixed with dark matter can remain dynamically stable under certain conditions. These findings show that even a small admixture of DM can modify the structural properties and stability limits of WDs, providing a potential indirect astrophysical probe of DM particle properties.</description>

      <title>Covariance spectrum of MAXI J1820+070: On the nature of the Comptonizing flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the covariance spectrum of the black hole X-ray binary MAXI J1820+070 during its hard state. For the first time, we extend coherence and covariance studies into the hard X-ray band up to 150 keV. We detect a clear drop in coherence above 30 keV on both short- and long-timescales relative to the 2-10 keV reference band. To investigate the origin of the coherent variability, we simultaneously fit the short- and long-timescale covariances and the time-averaged spectra with a Comptonization model. Surprisingly, the electron temperature associated with long-timescale variability is significantly higher than that on short timescales. Moreover, the temperature on long timescales remains relatively constant throughout the hard state, whereas the short-timescale temperature evolves with X-ray luminosity. We attribute the drop in coherence to multiple sources of seed photons, i.e., the blackbody and synchrotron photons. The independence between these two photon fields leads to the drop in coherence. To explain the lower electron temperature on short timescales, we propose a two-Comptonization framework in which short-timescale variability arises from a vertically extended central region, while long-timescale variability originates at larger radii. The elevated geometry of the inner region leads to illumination primarily by cooler outer-disk photons, yielding a lower electron temperature. In this case, the evolution of the height of the elevated region could explain the evolution of the electron temperature associated with the coherent variability throughout the hard state.</description>

      <title>Effect of the Memory Burden on Primordial Black Hole Hot Spots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When primordial black holes (PBHs) evaporate, they deposit energy in the surrounding plasma, leading to temperature gradients, or hot spots, that evolve during the evaporation process. Motivated by recent studies suggesting that a memory burden may slow down PBH evaporation, we explore how a suppression of the evaporation rate affects the morphology of such hot spots. We include such a suppression in the form of transfer functions and derive general formulas for the hot-spot core temperature and radius. Applying our results to illustrative scenarios, we find that in the vanilla memory burden scenario in which the evaporation rate and Hawking temperature are exactly constant, the hot-spot temperature is substantially lowered. Nonetheless, we show that alternative scenarios may lead to sizeable hot spots with morphologies that differ significantly from the semi-classical case.</description>

      <title>Subtleties of non-Abelian D-brane actions and their effect on holographic heavy-light meson spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the holographic description of heavy light mesons in the D3-D7 system at zero temperature, analyzing the dynamics of the coupled probe D7 branes through the non-Abelian Dirac-Born-Infeld action. Distinct quark masses are realized by separating the flavor branes, producing holographic flavor hierarchies. We refine the calculation made in previous works: we impose Hermiticity on the induced metric and fix the expansion of the determinant for matrix valued fields. Implementing these improvements yields modified fluctuation equations and quantitatively different meson spectra: the scalar modes become heavier while the vector modes become lighter, removing the degeneracy reported in the literature. At finite 't Hooft coupling, we also observe a qualitatively different dependence of the vector modes on the quark masses. The resulting prescription provides a consistent, broadly applicable framework for incorporating non-Abelian flavor dynamics into holographic models and can be readily extended to situations away from the vacuum.</description>

      <title>How Significant are Cosmological Collider Signals in the Planck Data?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for primordial non-Gaussianities (PNG) is theoretically well motivated but remains observationally challenging. Tight constraints with low significance for the standard non-Gaussian shapes suggest that detection may lie beyond the reach of near-future experiments. However, tests of PNG are highly template-dependent. From a theory perspective, a whole new family of bispectrum shapes arise in the cosmological collider program, with distinct signatures of heavy particles during inflation. In this work, we provide a class of simplified collider templates for these particles that encompasses a broader range of masses, sound speeds, and interactions. We propose that, given the current state of observations, the most effective strategy to search for PNG signals is through orthogonalizing the collider templates, such that they are uncorrelated with the tightly constrained single field predictions. Using the Modal pipeline and Planck CMB data, we perform a systematic parameter scan of the collider templates with the most significant result reaching $2.4\sigma$ for spin-0, after taking into account the look-elsewhere effect; indicative results for spin-1 and spin-2 peak near 2$\sigma$. These results indicate that, with refined collider templates and improved data analysis strategies, there are credible prospects with forthcoming observations to detect PNG and also rule out single field inflation.</description>

      <title>The Width of an Electron-Capture Neutrino Wave Packet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the size of an electron neutrino wave packet emerging from an electron capture decay using the formalism of open quantum systems. This quantitative result is based on methodology that we have previously used to predict the width of an electron antineutrino wave packet from a beta-decaying nucleus, adapted for the different initial states in electron capture and beta decay. These predictions are now becoming relevant to experimental probes of the neutrino width, for example indirectly through precision spectroscopic studies of the nuclear recoil. We provide a translation between a recent Beryllium Electron capture in Superconducting Tunnel junctions Experiment (BeEST) measurement of the daughter nuclear recoil spectrum from $\mathrm{^{7}Be}$ electron capture decay ($e^- + \mathrm{^{7}Be}\rightarrow\mathrm{^{7}Li+\nu_e}$) and a constraint on the outgoing neutrino width. According to our analysis, the direct limit on the neutrino wave packet width from electron capture decay using the recent BeEST result should map to $\sigma_{\nu,x}&gt;6.2\,\mathrm{pm}$. We determine that a hard upper limit on the wave packet width exists at $\sigma_{\nu,x}\sim2.7\,\mathrm{nm}$, based on the relative momentum between the electron and nucleus. However, we find that the localization is most likely driven by the embedding of the decaying atom in the tantalum crystal lattice resulting in a width scale of approximately $\sigma_{\nu,x}\sim10$~pm, motivated by data from X-ray diffraction and M$\ddot{\mathrm{o}}$ssbauer spectroscopy, which lies intriguingly close to the current bound.</description>

Abstract: The $t$-channel singularity is a divergence in the scattering amplitude which occurs when a stable particle propagating in $t$-channel scattering process becomes an on-shell state. Such situations appear either in the system of collider experiments or in the context of the cosmological particle production. No scheme which is generally applicable is known. In this work, we propose a new formulation to identify and remove the source of the divergence. The scheme is fully analytical and various applications can be expected. This work provides a valuable tool in this research field.</description>

      <title>Dark energy and QCD instanton vacuum in Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The standard model of the universe, $\lambda$CDM, is based on the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker metric with a flat three-dimensional coordinate space and the Friedmann equations~\cite{ParticleDataGroup:2024cfk}. The cosmological constant $\lambda$ provides the cancellation of the matter field contributions in the flat (Minkowski) space, as was proposed long ago in 1967 by Zeldovich. The dynamical dark energy appears on the surface of the vacuum energy of matter fields at the flat (Minkowski) space. Within the Standard Model, the gluon Yang-Mills (YM) fields are playing a specific role since the properties of their vacuum, where there is the presence of the gluon condensate, provide the nonperturbative vacuum energy. It is natural to apply the successful instanton liquid model (ILM) of the QCD vacuum and its lowest excitations. Our aim is to calculate the contribution of gluon YM fields to the dark energy density. We find that the universe metric is generating the QCD vacuum excitation, which gives the contribution to the dark energy density. But this one may hardly play a central role in the dynamics of the universe, since its timescale is too small. We also find the equation-of-state parameters $w_0=-1,\,\,\,w_a=0$ in accordance with $\lambda$CDM, while the newest data, analyzed at~\cite{Shajib:2025tpd}, give them at least in the range $-0.91 &lt;w_0&lt; -0.73,\,\,\,\,-1.05&lt; w_a &lt;- 0.65$. They are requesting a contribution from an ultralight scalars such an axions, or from YM field topological configurations with the nontrivial holonomy due to the deviation from a pure de Sitter state ~\cite{VanWaerbeke:2025shm}.</description>

      <title>Identification of $D^*_2(3000)$ as the $D_2^*(2^3P_2)$ and exploring potential of undiscovered $2^+$ mesons via $B$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14140v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following the discovery of the $D^*_2(3000)$, its mass and full width have been extensively studied. Yet its nature remains undetermined to date. Since it was discovered through nonleptonic decay of $B$ meson and the corresponding cascade process, we therefore in this paper investigate the nonleptonic and semileptonic decays of $B$ meson to $J^P = 2^+$ charmed mesons using the Bethe-Salpeter equation approach. Our calculations on nonleptonic $B$ decays reveal that the unconfirmed resonance $D^*_2(3000)$ aligns well with $D^*_2(2^3P_2)$ predictions. Other candidates, including $D^*_2(1^3F_2)$, $D^*_2(3^3P_2)$, and $D^*_2(2^3F_2)$, are excluded due to their very small branching ratios in $B$ decays. Considering that the $D^*_2(1F)$, $D^*_2(3P)$, and $D^*_2(2F)$ have not yet been experimentally observed, we investigate the feasibility of their detection in $B$-meson decays.</description>

      <title>Existence of nuclear modifications on longitudinal-transverse structure function ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been assumed that nuclear modification does not exist in the longitudinal-transverse structure function ratio $R_N=F_L^N/(2xF_1^N)$ in lepton deep inelastic scattering. This assumption is widely used in obtaining structure functions of the ``nucleon" from nuclear data such as the deuteron ones. However, nuclear modifications do exist theoretically at least at medium- and large-$x$ regions because nucleons in a nucleus move in any direction, which is not necessary the longitudinal direction of the virtual-photon or weak-boson momentum in lepton scattering. Because of this transverse motion, the nucleon's transverse and longitudinal structure functions should mix with each other in nuclei with the mixture probability proportional to the nucleon's transverse momentum squared $\vec p_T^{\,\, 2}/Q^2$. In this work, numerical results are explicitly shown on such nuclear modifications in the deuteron. These nuclear modifications are important for determining precise structure functions of the nucleon. Furthermore, modifications of $R_N$ should be investigated also at small $x$ by the future electron-ion collider to find interesting gluon dynamics in nuclei. Hopefully, this nuclear effect on $R_N$ could be found by future experimental measurements at lepton accelerator facilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The COMPASS Collaboration recently reported the observation of strange-meson spectra in the reaction $K^- + p \to K^- \pi^- \pi^+ + p$ and found $K_3$ and $K_4$ states, with masses of $2119 \pm 13 ^{+45}_{-12}$ MeV and $2210 \pm 40 ^{+80}_{-30}$ MeV, respectively. This discovery has significantly renewed interest, prompting a detailed and systematic study of high-spin kaons. In this work, we analyze the mass spectrum and the Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka-allowed two-body strong decay properties of high-spin kaons having $J^P=3^{\pm}, 4^{\pm}$, and $5^{\pm}$ within the framework of the modified Godfrey-Isgur model and the $^3P_0$ model. Moreover, we identify critical decay channels, which may serve as useful guidance for future experimental studies.</description>

      <title>Feebly Interacting Particles: FIPs at LHCb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the establishment and maturation of the experimental programs searching for new physics with sizeable couplings at the LHC, there is an increasing interest in the broader particle and astrophysics community for exploring the physics of light and feebly-interacting particles as a paradigm complementary to a New Physics sector at the TeV scale and beyond. FIPs@LHCb continues the successful series of the FIPs workshops, FIPs 2020 and FIPs 2022. The main focus of the workshop was to explore the LHCb potential to search for FIPs thanks to the new software trigger deployed during the recent upgrade. Equally important goals of the workshop were to update the available parameter space in the commonly used FIPs benchmarks by including recent results from the high energy physics community and to discuss recent theory progress necessary for a more accurate definition of observables related to FIP benchmarks. This document presents the summary of the talks presented at the workshops and the outcome of subsequent discussions.</description>

      <title>Divergence in tracing the flavors of astrophysical neutrinos: can JUNO help IceCube?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the flavor fractions $(\eta^{}_e , \eta^{}_\mu , \eta^{}_\tau)$ for ultrahigh-energy neutrinos originating from a remote astrophysical source by using their flavor ratios $(f^{}_e , f^{}_\mu , f^{}_\tau)$ observed at a neutrino telescope, and find that a potential divergence may appear in inferring the values of $\eta^{}_\mu$ and $\eta^{}_\tau$ as an unavoidable consequence of the approximate $\mu$-$\tau$ interchange symmetry of lepton flavor mixing. We illustrate such an effect by applying our formula to the IceCube all-sky neutrino flux data ranging from 5 TeV to 10 PeV in the naive assumption that the relevant sources have a common flavor composition. We show that only $\eta^{}_e$ and $\eta^{}_\mu + \eta^{}_\tau$ can be extracted from the measurements of $f^{}_e$, $f^{}_\mu$ and $f^{}_\tau$ if the $\mu$-$\tau$ flavor symmetry is exact, and the JUNO and Daya Bay precision antineutrino oscillation data will help a lot in this connection.</description>

      <title>On the non-uniqueness of the energy-momentum and spin currents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02127v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The macroscopic energy-momentum and spin densities of relativistic spin hydrodynamics are obtained from the ensemble average of their respective microscopic definitions (quantum operators). These microscopic definitions suffer from ambiguities, meaning that one may obtain different forms of symmetric energy-momentum tensor and spin tensor through pseudogauge transformations (or, in other words, Belinfante improvement procedure). However, this ambiguity may be fixed if we obtain these currents using Noether's second theorem instead of widely used Noether's first theorem. The second theorem fixes the super-potential determined by local symmetry, thereby selecting a unique physically consistent pseudogauge. In this article, we use Noether's second theorem to derive energy-momentum and spin currents without the need of pseudogauge transformations for free Dirac massive particles with spin one-half.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spontaneous conversion of muonium to antimuonium is one of the interesting charged lepton flavor violation phenomena offering a sensitive probe of potential new physics and serving as a tool to constrain the parameter space beyond the Standard Model. The Muonium-to-Antimuonium Conversion Experiment (MACE) is designed to utilize a high-intensity muon beam, a Michel electron magnetic spectrometer, a positron transport system, and a positron detection system, to either discover or constrain this rare process with a conversion probability of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-13})$. This article presents an overview of the theoretical framework as well as a detailed description of the experimental design for the search for muonium-to-antimuonium conversion.</description>

      <title>Coulomb interacting Bose-Einstein correlations in Fourier space</title>

Abstract: In high-energy heavy-ion physics experiments, a state of matter is created that existed in the early Universe: the quark-gluon plasma. This strongly interacting matter exists in today's experiments only within a range of a few femtometers and for a duration of a few femtometers per speed of light, making its resolution with optical tools impossible. However, there is a method that allows for a closer look into the structure of the quark-gluon plasma: femtoscopy. Initially used in astronomy, femtoscopy is based on the quantum mechanical indistinguishability of identical particles, which causes them to arrive at detectors in a correlated manner. The measurable correlation is related to the spacetime structure of the particle-emitting source, which in heavy-ion physics is the quark-gluon plasma created in collisions. For free particles, a relatively simple relationship exists between the source and the correlation (essentially a Fourier transform). However, this relationship becomes complex when accurately accounting for the repulsive Coulomb interaction between final-state electrically charged particles. Our paper presents a new method that is more precise than previously used ones, yet less computationally demanding, especially for the exotic source function shapes. Mathematically, the method is interesting because it exactly handles many emerging integrals and limits. Practically, it is ready for use in experimental analyses.</description>

      <title>Probing Nucleon-$\Omega_{\rm ccc}$Interaction via Lattice QCD at Physical Quark Masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10388v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the S-wave interactions between the nucleon ($N$) and the triply charmed Omega baryon ($\Omega_{\mathrm{ccc}}$) using (2+1)-flavor lattice QCD with a physical pion mass ($m_\pi \simeq 137.1$ MeV) on a lattice volume $\simeq (8.1~\mathrm{fm})^3$. The charm quark is implemented with a relativistic heavy-quark action at its physical mass. Employing the time-dependent HAL QCD method, the $N$-$\Omega_{\mathrm{ccc}}$ potentials in the spin-1 ($^3\mathrm{S}_1$) and spin-2 ($^5\mathrm{S}_2$) channels are extracted. In both channels, overall attraction is found with the scattering parameters, $a_0 = 0.56(0.13)\left(^{+0.26}_{-0.03}\right)$ fm and $r_{\mathrm{eff}} = 1.60(0.05)\left(^{+0.04}_{-0.12}\right)$ fm for the $^3\mathrm{S}_1$ channel, and
  $a_0 = 0.38(0.12)\left(^{+0.25}_{-0.00}\right)$ fm and $r_{\mathrm{eff}} = 2.04(0.10)\left(^{+0.03}_{-0.22}\right)$ fm for the $^5\mathrm{S}_2$ channel, indicating the absence of a dibaryon bound state. The extracted potentials are further decomposed into spin-independent and spin-dependent components. The spin-independent potential is a dominant component and features a short-range attractive core and a long-range attractive tail, while the spin-dependent potential shows short-range attraction (repulsion) in the spin-1 (spin-2) channel. Qualitative comparisons with previous studies of the $N$-$J/\psi$ and $N$-$\Omega_{\rm{sss}}$ systems at $m_\pi \simeq 146$ MeV are provided, emphasizing the role of heavy-hadron chromo-polarizability arising from soft-gluon exchange between the nucleon and flavor-singlet hadrons. The charm quark mass dependence of the $N$-$\Omega_{\rm ccc}$ potential is investigated as well.</description>

      <title>Heptagon Symbols at Five Loops and All-Loop Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09669v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the symbol bootstrap program for the seven-particle MHV and NMHV amplitudes in planar $\mathcal{N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills (SYM) based on the alphabet associated with the $E_6$ cluster algebra. After imposing integrability, cluster adjacency (or extended Steinmann), first- and last-entry conditions, the solution space is already highly restrictive: e.g. for MHV case there are exactly $1,1,2,3,4$ parity-invariant solutions for $L=1,2,\cdots, 5$, which automatically satisfy dihedral symmetry. Remarkably, after further requiring a well-defined collinear limit, we find a unique solution for both MHV and NMHV sectors where all coefficients (e.g. more than $3.1\times 10^{10}$ for MHV at $L=5$) turn out to be integers. Furthermore, we observe recurrent patterns for coefficients of special words in $E_6$ symbols mirroring those found for the $C_2$ symbol of three-point form factors, which lead to numerous predictions in the form of all-loop sequences. As an initial application, we show that these sequences uniquely fix the MHV symbol through five loops without input from collinear limits. Given the simplicity and surprisingly strong constraining power of both physical constraints and the newly observed sequences, we conjecture that there is a unique symbol satisfying these constraints at any loop order.</description>
