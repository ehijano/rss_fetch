      <title>Universality of the Weyl-Heisenberg symmetry and its covariant quantisations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Weyl-Heisenberg symmetries originate from translation invariances of various manifolds viewed as phase spaces, e.g. Euclidean plane, semi-discrete cylinder, torus, in the two-dimensional case, and higher-dimensional generalisations. In this review we describe, on an elementary level, how this symmetry emerges through displacement operators and standard Fourier analysis, and how their unitary representations are used both in Signal Analysis (time-frequency techniques, Gabor transform) and in quantum formalism (covariant integral quantizations and semi-classical portraits). An example of application of the formalism to the Majorana stellar constellation in the plane is presented.</description>

      <title>Metric-induced nonhermitian physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I consider the long-standing issue of the hermicity of the Dirac equation in curved spacetime metrics. Instead of imposing hermiticity by adding ad hoc terms, I renormalize the field by a scaling function, which is related to the determinant of the metric, and then regularize the renormalized field on a discrete lattice. I found that, for time-independent and diagonal metrics such as the Rindler, de~Sitter, and anti-de~Sitter metrics, the Dirac equation returns a hermitian or pseudohermitian ($\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric) Hamiltonian when properly regularized on the lattice. Notably, the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry is unbroken in the pseudohermitian cases, assuring a real energy spectrum with unitary time evolution. Conversely, considering a more general class of time-dependent metrics, which includes the Weyl metric, the Dirac equation returns a nonhermitian Hamiltonian with nonunitary time evolution. Arguably, this nonhermicity is physical, with the time dependence of the metric corresponding to local nonhermitian processes on the lattice and nonunitary growth or decay of the time evolution of the field. This suggests a duality between nonhermitian gain and loss phenomena and spacetime contractions and expansions. This metric-induced nonhermiticity unveils an unexpected connection between spacetime metric and nonhermitian phases of matter.</description>

      <title>Automatically Refining Assertions for Efficient Debugging of Quantum Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As new advancements in the field of quantum computing lead to the development of increasingly complex programs, approaches to validate and debug these programs are becoming more important. To this end, methods employed in classical debugging, such as assertions for testing specific properties of a program's state, have been adapted for quantum programs. However, to efficiently debug quantum programs, it is key to properly place these assertions. This usually requires a deep understanding of the program's underlying mathematical properties, constituting a time-consuming manual task for developers. To address this problem, this work proposes methods for automatically refining assertions in quantum programs by moving them to more favorable positions in the program or by placing new assertions that help to further narrow down potential error locations. This allows developers to take advantage of rich and expressive assertions that greatly improve the debugging experience without requiring them to place these assertions manually in an otherwise tedious manner. An open-source implementation of the proposed methods is available at https://github.com/cdatum/mqt-debugger.</description>

      <title>Scaling and logic in the color code on a superconducting quantum processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error correction is essential for bridging the gap between the error rates of physical devices and the extremely low logical error rates required for quantum algorithms. Recent error-correction demonstrations on superconducting processors have focused primarily on the surface code, which offers a high error threshold but poses limitations for logical operations. In contrast, the color code enables much more efficient logic, although it requires more complex stabilizer measurements and decoding techniques. Measuring these stabilizers in planar architectures such as superconducting qubits is challenging, and so far, realizations of color codes have not addressed performance scaling with code size on any platform. Here, we present a comprehensive demonstration of the color code on a superconducting processor, achieving logical error suppression and performing logical operations. Scaling the code distance from three to five suppresses logical errors by a factor of $\Lambda_{3/5}$ = 1.56(4). Simulations indicate this performance is below the threshold of the color code, and furthermore that the color code may be more efficient than the surface code with modest device improvements. Using logical randomized benchmarking, we find that transversal Clifford gates add an error of only 0.0027(3), which is substantially less than the error of an idling error correction cycle. We inject magic states, a key resource for universal computation, achieving fidelities exceeding 99% with post-selection (retaining about 75% of the data). Finally, we successfully teleport logical states between distance-three color codes using lattice surgery, with teleported state fidelities between 86.5(1)% and 90.7(1)%. This work establishes the color code as a compelling research direction to realize fault-tolerant quantum computation on superconducting processors in the near future.</description>

      <title>Correlations, Spectra and Entaglement Transitions in Ensembles of Matrix Product States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate ensembles of Matrix Product States (MPSs) generated by quantum circuit evolution followed by projection onto MPSs with a fixed bond dimension $\chi$. Specifically, we consider ensembles produced by: (i) random sequential unitary circuits, (ii) random brickwork unitary circuits, and (iii) circuits involving both unitaries and projective measurements. In all cases, we characterize the spectra of the MPS transfer matrix and show that, for the first two cases in the thermodynamic limit, they exhibit a finite universal value of the spectral gap in the limit of large $\chi$, albeit with different spectral densities. We show that a finite gap in this limit does not imply a finite correlation length, as the mutual information between two large subsystems increases with $\chi$ in a manner determined by the entire shape of the spectral density. The latter differs for different types of circuits, indicating that these ensembles of MPS retain relevant physical information about the underlying microscopic dynamics. In particular, in the presence of monitoring, we demonstrate the existence of a measurement-induced entanglement transition (MIPT) in MPS ensembles, with the averaged dimension of the transfer matrix's null space serving as the effective order parameter.</description>

      <title>Dissipative Phase Transition in the Two-Photon Dicke Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the dissipative phase transition of the two-photon Dicke model, a topic that has garnered significant attention recently. Our analysis reveals that while single-photon loss does not stabilize the intrinsic instability in the model, the inclusion of two-photon loss restores stability, leading to the emergence of superradiant states which coexist with the normal vacuum states. Using a second-order cumulant expansion for the photons, we derive an analytical description of the system in the thermodynamic limit which agrees well with the exact calculation results. Additionally, we present the Wigner function for the system, shedding light on the breaking of the Z4-symmetry inherent in the model. These findings offer valuable insights into stabilization mechanisms in open quantum systems and pave the way for exploring complex nonlinear dynamics in two-photon Dicke models.</description>

      <title>Generation of the Complete Bell Basis via Hong-Ou-Mandel Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical vector modes (VMs), characterized by spatially varying polarization distributions, have become essential tools across microscopy, metrology, optical trapping, nanophotonics, and optical communications. The Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) effect, a fundamental two-photon interference phenomenon in quantum optics, offers significant potential to extend the applications of VMs beyond the classical regime. Here, we demonstrate the simultaneous generation of all four Bell states by exploiting the HOM interference of VMs. The resulting Bell states exhibit spatially tailored distributions that are determined by the input modes. These results represent a significant step in manipulating HOM interference within structured photons, offering promising avenues for high-dimensional quantum information processing and in particular high-dimensional quantum communication, quantum sensing, and advanced photonic technologies reliant on tailored quantum states of light.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation of the Dicke-Ising Model via Digital-Analog Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Dicke-Ising model, one of the few paradigmatic models of matter-light interaction, exhibits a superradiant quantum phase transition above a critical coupling strength. However, in natural optical systems, its experimental validation is hindered by a "no-go theorem''. Here, we propose a digital-analog quantum simulator for this model based on an ensemble of interacting qubits coupled to a single-mode photonic resonator. We analyze the system's free energy landscape using field-theoretical methods and develop a digital-analog quantum algorithm that disentangles qubit and photon degrees of freedom through a parity-measurement protocol. This disentangling enables the emulation of a photonic Schr\"odinger cat state, which is a hallmark of the superradiant ground state in finite-size systems and can be unambiguously probed through the Wigner tomography of the resonator's field.</description>

      <title>Braiding for the win: Harnessing braiding statistics in topological states to win quantum games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlocal quantum games provide proof of principle that quantum resources can confer advantage at certain tasks. They also provide a compelling way to explore the computational utility of phases of matter on quantum hardware. In a recent manuscript [Hart et al., arXiv:2403.04829] we demonstrated that a toric code resource state conferred advantage at a certain nonlocal game, which remained robust to small deformations of the resource state. In this manuscript we demonstrate that this robust advantage is a generic property of resource states drawn from topological or fracton ordered phases of quantum matter. To this end, we illustrate how several other states from paradigmatic topological and fracton ordered phases can function as resources for suitably defined nonlocal games, notably the three-dimensional toric-code phase, the X-cube fracton phase, and the double-semion phase. The key in every case is to design a nonlocal game that harnesses the characteristic braiding processes of a quantum phase as a source of contextuality. We unify the strategies that take advantage of mutual statistics by relating the operators to be measured to order and disorder parameters of an underlying generalized symmetry-breaking phase transition. Finally, we massively generalize the family of games that admit perfect strategies when codewords of homological quantum error-correcting codes are used as resources.</description>

      <title>Multi-user QKD using quotient graph states derived from continuous-variable dual-rail cluster states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multipartite entangled states are fundamental resources for multi-user quantum cryptographic tasks. Despite significant advancements in generating large-scale continuous-variable (CV) cluster states, particularly the dual-rail cluster state because of its utility in measurement-based quantum computation, its application in quantum cryptography has remained largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce a novel protocol for generating three user conference keys using a CV dual-rail cluster state. We develop the concept of a quotient graph state by applying a node coloring scheme to the infinite dual-rail graph, resulting in a six-mode pure graph state suitable for cryptographic applications. Our results demonstrate that the proposed protocol achieves performance close to that of GHZ-based protocols for quantum conference key agreement (QCKA), with GHZ states performing slightly better. However, a key advantage of our protocol lies in its ability to generate bipartite keys post-QCKA, a feature not achievable with GHZ states. Additionally, compared to a downstream access network using two-mode squeezed vacuum states, our protocol achieves superior performance in generating bipartite keys. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to the finite-size regime and consider the impact of using impure squeezed states for generating the multipartite entangled states, reflecting experimental imperfections. Our findings indicate that even with finite resources and non-ideal state preparation, the proposed protocol maintains its advantages. We also introduce a more accurate method to estimate the capacity of a protocol to generate bipartite keys in a quantum network.</description>

      <title>Observation of extrinsic topological phases in Floquet photonic lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrete-step walks describe the dynamics of particles in a lattice subject to hopping or splitting events at discrete times. Despite being of primordial interest to the physics of quantum walks, the topological properties arising from their discrete-step nature have been hardly explored. Here we report the observation of topological phases unique to discrete-step walks. We use light pulses in a double-fibre ring setup whose dynamics maps into a two-dimensional lattice subject to discrete splitting events. We show that the number of edge states is not simply described by the bulk invariants of the lattice (i.e., the Chern number and the Floquet winding number) as would be the case in static lattices and in lattices subject to smooth modulations. The number of edge states is also determined by a topological invariant associated to the discrete-step unitary operators acting at the edges of the lattice. This situation goes beyond the usual bulk-edge correspondence and allows manipulating the number of edge states without the need to go through a gap closing transition. Our work opens new perspectives for the engineering of topological modes for particles subject to quantum walks.</description>

      <title>A simple yet accurate stochastic approach to the quantum phase noise of nanolasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanolasers operating at low power levels are strongly affected by intrinsic quantum noise, affecting both intensity fluctuations and laser coherence. Starting from semi-classical rate equations and making a simple hypothesis for the phase of the laser field, a simple stochastic model for the laser quantum noise is suggested. The model is shown to agree quantitatively with quantum master equations for microscopic lasers with a small number of emitters and with classical Langevin equations for macroscopic systems. In contrast, neither quantum master equations nor classical Langevin equations adequately address the mesoscopic regime. The stochastic approach is used to calculate the linewidth throughout the transition to lasing, where the linewidth changes from being dominated by the particle-like nature of photons below threshold to the wave-like nature above threshold, where it is strongly influenced by index fluctuations enhancing the linewidth.</description>

      <title>Efficient construction of witnesses of stellar rank of nonclassical states of light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stellar hierarchy of quantum states of light classifies the states according to the Fock-state resources that are required for their generation together with unitary Gaussian operations. States with stellar rank n can be also equivalently referred to as genuinely n-photon quantum non-Gaussian states. Here we present an efficient method for construction of general witnesses of the stellar rank. The number of parameters that need to be optimized in order to determine the witness does not depend on the stellar rank and it scales quadratically with the number of modes. We illustrate the procedure by constructing stellar rank witnesses based on pairs of Fock state probabilities and also based on pairs of fidelities with superpositions of coherent states.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating dynamic surface codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A remarkable characteristic of quantum computing is the potential for reliable computation despite faulty qubits. This can be achieved through quantum error correction, which is typically implemented by repeatedly applying static syndrome checks, permitting correction of logical information. Recently, the development of time-dynamic approaches to error correction has uncovered new codes and new code implementations. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate three time-dynamic implementations of the surface code, each offering a unique solution to hardware design challenges and introducing flexibility in surface code realization. First, we embed the surface code on a hexagonal lattice, reducing the necessary couplings per qubit from four to three. Second, we walk a surface code, swapping the role of data and measure qubits each round, achieving error correction with built-in removal of accumulated non-computational errors. Finally, we realize the surface code using iSWAP gates instead of the traditional CNOT, extending the set of viable gates for error correction without additional overhead. We measure the error suppression factor when scaling from distance-3 to distance-5 codes of $\Lambda_{35,\text{hex}} = 2.15(2)$, $\Lambda_{35,\text{walk}} = 1.69(6)$, and $\Lambda_{35,\text{iSWAP}} = 1.56(2)$, achieving state-of-the-art error suppression for each. With detailed error budgeting, we explore their performance trade-offs and implications for hardware design. This work demonstrates that dynamic circuit approaches satisfy the demands for fault-tolerance and opens new alternative avenues for scalable hardware design.</description>

      <title>Quantum expectation value estimation by doubling the number of qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Expectation value estimation is ubiquitous in quantum algorithms. The expectation value of a Hamiltonian, which is essential in various practical applications, is often estimated by measuring a large number of Pauli strings on quantum computers and performing classical post-processing. In the case of $n$-qubit molecular Hamiltonians in quantum chemistry calculations, it is necessary to evaluate $O(n^4)$ Pauli strings, requiring a large number of measurements for accurate estimation. To reduce the measurement cost, we assess an existing idea that uses two copies of an $n$-qubit quantum state of interest and coherently measures them in the Bell basis, which enables the simultaneous estimation of the absolute values of expectation values of all the $n$-qubit Pauli strings. We numerically investigate the efficiency of energy estimation for molecular Hamiltonians of up to 12 qubits. The results show that, when the target precision is no smaller than tens of milli-Hartree, this method requires fewer measurements than conventional sampling methods. This suggests that the method may be useful for many applications that rely on expectation value estimation of Hamiltonians and other observables as well when moderate precision is sufficient.</description>

      <title>Quantum Homogenization as a Quantum Steady State Protocol on NISQ Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum homogenization is a reservoir-based quantum state approximation protocol, which has been successfully implemented in state transformation on quantum hardware. In this work we move beyond that and propose the homogenization as a novel platform for quantum state stabilization and information protection. Using the Heisenberg exchange interactions formalism, we extend the standard quantum homogenization protocol to the dynamically-equivalent ($\mathtt{SWAP}$)$^\alpha$ formulation. We then demonstrate its applicability on available noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) processors by presenting a shallow quantum circuit implementation consisting of a sequence of $\mathtt{CNOT}$ and single-qubit gates. In light of this, we employ the Beny-Oreshkov generalization of the Knill-Laflamme (KL) conditions for near-optimal recovery channels to show that our proposed ($\mathtt{SWAP}$)$^\alpha$ quantum homogenization protocol yields a completely positive, trace preserving (CPTP) map under which the code subspace is correctable. Therefore, the protocol protects quantum information contained in a subsystem of the reservoir Hilbert space under CPTP dynamics.</description>

      <title>A Novel Pseudo-Spectral Time-Domain Theory of Magnetic Neutron Scattering Illustrated Using A Uniformly Magnetized Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A universal numerical method is developed for the investigation of magnetic neutron scattering. By applying the pseudospectral-time-domain (PSTD) algorithm to the spinor version of the Schr\"odinger equation, the evolution of the spin-state of the scattered wave can be solved in full space and time. This extra spin degree of freedom brings some unique new features absent in the numerical theory on the scalar wave scatterings [1]. Different numerical stability condition has to be re-derived due to the coupling between the different spin states. As the simplest application, the neutron scattering by the magnetic field of a uniformly magnetized sphere is studied. The PSTD predictions are compared with those from the Born-approximation. This work not only provides a systematic tool for analyzing spin-matter interactions, but also builds the forward model for testing novel neutron imaging methodologies, such as the newly developed thermal neutron Fourier-transform ghost imaging.</description>

      <title>TorchQC -- A framework for efficiently integrating machine and deep learning methods in quantum dynamics and control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning has been revolutionizing our world over the last few years and is also increasingly exploited in several areas of physics, including quantum dynamics and control.The need for a framework that brings together machine learning models and quantum simulation methods has been quite high within the quantum control field, with the ultimate goal of exploiting these powerful computational methods for the efficient implementation of modern quantum technologies. The existing frameworks for quantum system simulations, such as QuTip and QuantumOptics.jl, even though they are very successful in simulating quantum dynamics, cannot be easily incorporated into the platforms used for the development of machine learning models, like for example PyTorch. The TorchQC framework introduced in the present work comes exactly to fill this gap. It is a new library written entirely in Python and based on the PyTorch deep learning library. PyTorch and other deep learning frameworks are based on tensors, a structure that is also used in quantum mechanics. This is the common ground that TorchQC utilizes to combine quantum physics simulations and deep learning models.TorchQC exploits PyTorch and its tensor mechanism to represent quantum states and operators as tensors, while it also incorporates all the tools needed to simulate quantum system dynamics. All necessary operations are internal in the PyTorch library, thus TorchQC programs can be executed in GPUs, substantially reducing the simulation time. We believe that the proposed TorchQC library has the potential to accelerate the development of deep learning models directly incorporating quantum simulations, enabling the easier integration of these powerful techniques in modern quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>AI-Enabled Rapid Assembly of Thousands of Defect-Free Neutral Atom Arrays with Constant-time-overhead</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assembling increasingly larger-scale defect-free optical tweezer-trapped atom arrays is essential for quantum computation and quantum simulations based on atoms. Here, we propose an AI-enabled, rapid, constant-time-overhead rearrangement protocol, and we experimentally assemble defect-free 2D and 3D atom arrays with up to 2024 atoms with a constant time cost of 60 ms. The AI model calculates the holograms for real-time atom rearrangement. With precise controls over both position and phase, a high-speed spatial light modulator moves all the atoms simultaneously. This protocol can be readily used to generate defect-free arrays of tens of thousands of atoms with current technologies, and become a useful toolbox for quantum error correction.</description>

Abstract: In this review article we summarize all experiments claiming quantum computational advantage to date. Our review highlights challenges, loopholes, and refutations appearing in subsequent work to provide a complete picture of the current statuses of these experiments. In addition, we also discuss theoretical computational advantage in example problems such as approximate optimization and recommendation systems.

Abstract: Here we present a derivation of the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) for an overdamped Lorentz-Drude environment containing an undamped oscillator (LDUO-HEOM). The new approach avoids the artifact of superfluous damping inherent in underdamped spectral densities.

      <title>Topological eigenvalues braiding and quantum state transfer near a third-order exceptional point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems exhibit a variety of unique features rooted in the presence of exceptional points (EP). The distinct topological structure in the proximity of an EP gives rise to counterintuitive behaviors absent in Hermitian systems, which emerge after encircling the EP either quasistatically or dynamically. However, experimental exploration of EP encirclement in quantum systems, particularly those involving high-order EPs, remains challenging due to the difficulty of coherently controlling more degrees of freedom. In this work, we experimentally investigate the eigenvalues braiding and state transfer arising from the encirclement of EP in a three-dimensional non-Hermitian quantum system using superconducting circuits. We characterize the second- and third-order EPs through the coalescence of eigenvalues. Then we reveal the topological structure near the EP3 by quasistatically encircling it along various paths with three independent parameters, which yields the eigenvalues braiding described by the braid group $B_3$. Additionally, we observe chiral state transfer between three eigenstates under a fast driving scheme when no EPs are enclosed, while time-symmetric behavior occurs when at least one EP is encircled. Our findings offer insights into understanding non-Hermitian topological structures and the manipulation of quantum states through dynamic operations.</description>

      <title>Opportunities and limitations of explaining quantum machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A common trait of many machine learning models is that it is often difficult to understand and explain what caused the model to produce the given output. While the explainability of neural networks has been an active field of research in the last years, comparably little is known for quantum machine learning models. Despite a few recent works analyzing some specific aspects of explainability, as of now there is no clear big picture perspective as to what can be expected from quantum learning models in terms of explainability. In this work, we address this issue by identifying promising research avenues in this direction and lining out the expected future results. We additionally propose two explanation methods designed specifically for quantum machine learning models, as first of their kind to the best of our knowledge. Next to our pre-view of the field, we compare both existing and novel methods to explain the predictions of quantum learning models. By studying explainability in quantum machine learning, we can contribute to the sustainable development of the field, preventing trust issues in the future.</description>

      <title>Space-time Peer-to-Peer Distribution of Multi-party Entanglement for Any Quantum Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph states are a class of important multiparty entangled states, of which bell pairs are the special case. Realizing a robust and fast distribution of arbitrary graph states in the downstream layer of the quantum network can be essential for further large-scale quantum networks. We propose a novel quantum network protocol called P2PGSD inspired by the classical Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network to efficiently implement the general graph state distribution in the network layer, which demonstrates advantages in resource efficiency and scalability over existing methods for sparse graph states. An explicit mathematical model for a general graph state distribution problem has also been constructed, above which the intractability for a wide class of resource minimization problems is proved and the optimality of the existing algorithms is discussed. In addition, we proposed the spacetime network inspired by the symmetry from relativity for memory management in network problems and used it to improve our proposed algorithm. The advantages of our protocols are confirmed by numerical simulations showing an improvement of up to 50\% for general sparse graph states, paving the way for a resource-efficient multiparty entanglement distribution across any network topology.</description>

      <title>Gaussian boson sampling for binary optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary optimization is a fundamental area in computational science, with wide-ranging applications from logistics to cryptography, where the tasks are often formulated as Quadratic or Polynomial Unconstrained Binary Optimization problems (QUBO/PUBO). In this work, we propose to use a parametrized Gaussian Boson Sampler (GBS) with threshold detectors to address such problems. We map general PUBO instance onto a quantum Hamiltonian and optimize the Conditional Value-at-Risk of its energy with respect to the GBS ansatz. In particular, we observe that, when the algorithm reduces to standard Variational Quantum Eigensolver, the cost function is analytical. Therefore, it can be computed efficiently, along with its gradient, for low-degree polynomials using only classical computing resources. Numerical experiments on 3-SAT and Graph Partitioning problems show significant performance gains over random guessing, providing a first proof of concept for our proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Quantum computing in spin-adapted representations for efficient simulations of spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploiting inherent symmetries is a common and effective approach to speed up the simulation of quantum systems. However, efficiently accounting for non-Abelian symmetries, such as the $SU(2)$ total-spin symmetry, remains a major challenge. In fact, expressing total-spin eigenstates in terms of the computational basis can require an exponentially large number of coefficients. In this work, we introduce a novel formalism for designing quantum algorithms directly in an eigenbasis of the total-spin operator. Our strategy relies on the symmetric group approach in conjunction with a truncation scheme for the internal degrees of freedom of total-spin eigenstates. For the case of the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model, we show that this formalism yields a hierarchy of spin-adapted Hamiltonians, for each truncation threshold, whose ground-state energy and wave function quickly converge to their exact counterparts, calculated on the full model. These truncated Hamiltonians can be encoded with sparse and local qubit Hamiltonians that are suitable for quantum simulations. We demonstrate this by developing a state-preparation schedule to construct shallow quantum-circuit approximations, expressed in a total-spin eigenbasis, for the ground states of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian in different symmetry sectors.</description>

      <title>Efficient optical cat state generation using squeezed few-photon superposition states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical Schr\"{o}dinger cat states are non-Gaussian states with applications in quantum technologies, such as for building error-correcting states in quantum computing. Yet the efficient generation of high-fidelity optical Schr\"{o}dinger cat states is an outstanding problem in quantum optics. Here, we propose using squeezed superpositions of zero and two photons, $|\theta\rangle = \cos{(\theta/2)}|0\rangle + \sin{(\theta/2)}|2\rangle$, as ingredients for protocols to efficiently generate high-fidelity cat states. We present a protocol using linear optics with success probability $P\gtrsim 50\%$ that can generate cat states of size $|\alpha|^2=5$ with fidelity $F&gt;0.99$. The protocol relies only on detecting single photons and is remarkably tolerant of loss, with $2\%$ detection loss still achieving $F&gt;0.98$ for cats with $|\alpha|^2=5$. We also show that squeezed $\theta$ states are ideal candidates for nonlinear photon subtraction using a two-level system with near deterministic success probability and fidelity $F&gt;0.98$ for cat states of size $|\alpha|^2=5$. Schemes for generating $\theta$ states using quantum emitters are also presented. Our protocols can be implemented with current state-of-the-art quantum optics experiments.</description>

      <title>Quantum circuit synthesis with SQiSW</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main task of quantum circuit synthesis is to efficiently and accurately implement specific quantum algorithms or operations using a set of quantum gates, and optimize the circuit size. It plays a crucial role in Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum computation. Most prior synthesis efforts have employed CNOT or CZ gates as the 2-qubit gates. However, the SQiSW gate, also known as the square root of iSWAP gate, has garnered considerable attention due to its outstanding experimental performance with low error rates and high efficiency in 2-qubit gate synthesis. In this paper, we investigate the potential of the SQiSW gate in various synthesis problems by utilizing only the SQiSW gate along with arbitrary single-qubit gates, while optimizing the overall circuit size. For exact synthesis, the upper bound of SQiSW gates to synthesize arbitrary 3-qubit and $n$-qubit gates are 24 and $\frac{139}{192}4^n(1+o(1))$ respectively, which relies on the properties of SQiSW gate in Lie theory and quantum shannon decomposition. We also introduce an exact synthesis scheme for Toffoli gate using only 8 SQiSW gates, which is grounded in numerical observation. More generally, with respect to numerical approximations, we propose and provide a theoretical analysis of a pruning algorithm to reduce the size of the searching space in numerical experiment to $\frac{1}{12}+o(1)$ of previous size, helping us reach the result that 11 SQiSW gates are enough in arbitrary 3-qubit gates synthesis up to an acceptable numerical error.</description>

      <title>Multiplexed Readout of Superconducting Qubits Using a 3D Re-entrant Cavity Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hardware efficient methods for high fidelity quantum state measurements are crucial for superconducting qubit experiments, as qubit numbers grow and feedback and state reset begin to be employed for quantum error correction. We present a 3D re-entrant cavity filter designed for frequency-multiplexed readout of superconducting qubits. The cavity filter is situated out of the plane of the qubit circuit and capacitively couples to an array of on-chip readout resonators in a manner that can scale to large qubit arrays. The re-entrant cavity functions as a large-linewidth bandpass filter with intrinsic Purcell filtering. We demonstrate the concept with a four-qubit multiplexed device.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithms for Stochastic Differential Equations: A Schr\"odingerisation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers are known for their potential to achieve up-to-exponential speedup compared to classical computers for certain problems.To exploit the advantages of quantum computers, we propose quantum algorithms for linear stochastic differential equations, utilizing the Schr\"odingerisation method for the corresponding approximate equation by treating the noise term as a (discrete-in-time) forcing term. Our algorithms are applicable to stochastic differential equations with both Gaussian noise and $\alpha$-stable L\'evy noise. The gate complexity of our algorithms exhibits an $\mathcal{O}(d\log(Nd))$ dependence on the dimensions $d$ and sample sizes $N$, where its corresponding classical counterpart requires nearly exponentially larger complexity in scenarios involving large sample sizes. In the Gaussian noise case, we show the strong convergence of first order in the mean square norm for the approximate equations. The algorithms are numerically verified for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes, geometric Brownian motions, and one-dimensional L\'evy flights.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Realization of Majorana Zero Modes in a Particle-Conserving Ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a scheme to realize a topological superconducting system supporting Majorana zero modes, within a number-conserving framework suitable for optical-lattice experiments. Our approach builds on the engineering of pair-hopping processes on a ladder geometry, using a sequence of pulses that activate single-particle hopping in a time-periodic manner. We demonstrate that this dynamic setting is well captured by an effective Hamiltonian that preserves the parity symmetry, a key requirement for the stabilization of Majorana zero modes. The phase diagram of our system is determined using a bosonization theory, which is then validated by a numerical study of the topological bulk gap and entanglement spectrum using matrix product states. Our results indicate that Majorana zero modes can be stabilized in a large parameter space, accessible in optical-lattice experiments.</description>

      <title>Revealing Hidden States in Quantum Dot Array Dynamics: Quantum Polyspectra Versus Waiting Time Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum dots (QDs) are pivotal for the development of quantum technologies, with applications ranging from single-photon sources for secure communication to quantum computing infrastructures. Understanding the electron dynamics within these QDs is essential for characterizing their properties and functionality. Here, we show how by virtue of the recently introduced quantum polyspectral analysis of transport measurements, the complex transport measurements of multi-electron QD systems can be analyzed. This method directly relates higher-order temporal correlations of a raw quantum point contact (QPC) current measurement to the Liouvillian of the measured quantum system. By applying this method to the two-level switching dynamics of a double QD system, we reveal a hidden third state, without relying on the identification of quantum jumps or prior assumptions about the number of involved quantum states. We show that the statistics of the QPC current measurement can identically be described by different three-state Markov models, each with significantly different transition rates. Furthermore, we compare our method to a traditional analysis via waiting-time distributions for which we prove that the statistics of a three-state Markov model is fully described without multi-time waiting-time distributions even in the case of two level switching dynamics. Both methods yield the same parameters with a similar accuracy. The quantum polyspectra method, however, stays applicable in scenarios with low signal-to-noise, where the traditional full counting statistics falters. Our approach challenges previous assumptions and models, offering a more nuanced understanding of QD dynamics and paving the way for the optimization of quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Harnessing energy transitions for low-temperature thermometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a scheme to extend the range and precision of temperature measurements employing a qubit chain governed by Heisenberg $XX$ and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions. Our approach leverages the absence of coherences in the probe qubit's density matrix, enabling the probe to act as a detector for distinct transition frequencies within the system. By systematically tuning system parameters, we show that the number of measurable transition frequencies - and consequently, the quantum Fisher information (QFI) peaks - grows linearly with the size of the qubit chain. This linear scaling offers a scalable pathway for thermometry, allowing the measurement of a broad range of temperatures with a single probe qubit. We begin by investigating a two-qubit system coupled via the same interactions, demonstrating that the allowed energy transitions result in different temperature sensitivity profiles characterized by single and multiple peaks in QFI. Finally, we extend our analysis to a chain of an arbitrary number of ancilla qubits and find that adding more energy transitions can further widen the temperature estimation range, making it possible to estimate the ultralow temperatures through the emergence of an arbitrary number of peaks in QFI. Our findings highlight the potential of qubit chain systems as efficient and precise tools for low-temperature quantum thermometry.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Quantum Coherence and Non-Classical Correlations in Open Quantum System Coupled to a Squeezed Thermal Bath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the intricate dynamics of quantum coherence and non-classical correlations in a two-qubit open quantum system coupled to a squeezed thermal reservoir. By exploring the correlations between spatially separated qubits, we unravel the complex interplay between quantum correlations and decoherence induced by the reservoir. Our findings demonstrate that non-classical correlations such as quantum consonance, quantum discord, local quantum uncertainty, and quantum Fisher information are highly sensitive to the collective regime. These insights identify key parameters for optimizing quantum metrology and parameter estimation in systems exposed to environmental interactions. Furthermore, we quantify these quantum correlations in the context of practical applications such as quantum teleportation, using the two metrics viz. maximal teleportation fidelity and fidelity deviation. This work bridges theoretical advancements with real-world applications, offering a comprehensive framework for leveraging quantum resources under the influence of environmental decoherence.</description>

      <title>Efficient Experimental Qudit State Estimation via Point Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Point tomography is a new approach to the problem of state estimation, which is arguably the most efficient and simple method for modern high-precision quantum information experiments. In this scenario, the experimenter knows the target state that their device should prepare, except that intrinsic systematic errors will create small discrepancies in the state actually produced. By introducing a new kind of informationally complete measurement, dubbed Fisher-symmetric measurements, point tomography determines deviations from the expected state with optimal efficiency. In this method, the number of outcomes of a measurement saturating the Gill-Massar limit for reconstructing a $d$-dimensional quantum states can be reduced from $\sim 4d-3$ to only $2d-1$ outcomes. Thus, providing better scalability as the dimension increases. Here we demonstrate the experimental viability of point tomography. Using a modern photonic platform constructed with state-of-the-art multicore optical fiber technology, we generate 4-dimensional quantum states and implement seven-outcome Fisher-symmetric measurements. Our experimental results exhibit the main feature of point tomography, namely a precision close to the Gill-Massar limit with a single few-outcome measurement. Specifically, we achieved a precision of $3.8/N$ while the Gill-Massar limit for $d=4$ is $3/N$ ($N$ being the ensemble size).</description>

      <title>Short two-qubit pulse sequences for exchange-only spin qubits in 2D layouts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exchange-only (EO) spin qubits in quantum dots offer an expansive design landscape for architecting scalable device layouts. The study of two-EO-qubit operations, which involve six electrons in six quantum dots, has so far been limited to a small number of the possible configurations, and previous works lack analyses of design considerations and implications for quantum error correction. Using a simple and fast optimization method, we generate complete pulse sequences for CX, CZ, iSWAP, leakage-controlled CX, and leakage-controlled CZ two-qubit gates on 450 unique planar six-dot topologies and analyze differences in sequence length (up to 43% reduction) across topology classes. In addition, we show that relaxing constraints on post-operation spin locations can yield further reductions in sequence length; conversely, constraining these locations in a particular way generates a CXSWAP operation with minimal additional cost over a standard CX. We integrate this pulse library into the Intel quantum stack and experimentally verify pulse sequences on a Tunnel Falls chip for different operations in a linear-connectivity device to confirm that they work as expected. Finally, we explore architectural implications of these results for quantum error correction. Our work guides hardware and software design choices for future implementations of scalable quantum dot architectures.</description>

      <title>Quantum chaos on the separatrix of the periodically perturbed Harper model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the relation between a classical periodic Hamiltonian system and an associated discrete quantum system on a torus in phase space. The model is a sinusoidally perturbed Harper model and is similar to the sinusoidally perturbed pendulum. Separatrices connecting hyperbolic fixed points in the unperturbed classical system become chaotic under sinusoidal perturbation. We numerically compute eigenstates of the Floquet propagator for the associated quantum system. For each Floquet eigenstate we compute a Husimi distribution in phase space and an energy and energy dispersion from the expectation value of the unperturbed Hamiltonian operator. The Husimi distribution of each Floquet eigenstate resembles a classical orbit with a similar energy and similar energy dispersion. Chaotic orbits in the classical system are related to Floquet eigenstates that appear ergodic. For a hybrid regular and chaotic system, we use the energy dispersion to separate the Floquet eigenstates into ergodic and integrable subspaces. The distribution of quasi-energies in the ergodic subspace resembles that of a random matrix model. The width of a chaotic region in the classical system is estimated by integrating the perturbation along a separatrix orbit. We derive a related expression for the associated quantum system from the averaged perturbation in the interaction representation evaluated at states with energy close to the separatrix.</description>

      <title>Emergence of unidirectionality and phase separation in optically dense emitter ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transmission of light through an ensemble of two-level emitters in a one-dimensional geometry is commonly described by one of two emblematic models of quantum electrodynamics (QED): the driven-dissipative Dicke model or the Maxwell-Bloch equations. Both exhibit distinct features of phase transitions and phase separations, depending on system parameters such as optical depth and external drive strength. Here, we explore the crossover between these models via a parent spin model from bidirectional waveguide QED, by varying positional disorder among emitters. Solving mean-field equations and employing a second-order cumulant expansion for the unidirectional model -- equivalent to the Maxwell-Bloch equations -- we study phase diagrams, the emitter's inversion, and transmission depending on optical depth, drive strength, and spatial disorder. We find in the thermodynamic limit the emergence of phase separation with a critical value that depends on the degree of spatial order but is independent of inhomogeneous broadening effects. Even far from the thermodynamic limit, this critical value marks a special point in the emitter's correlation landscape of the unidirectional model and is also observed as a maximum in the magnitude of inelastically transmitted photons. We conclude that a large class of effective one-dimensional systems without tight control of the emitter's spatial ordering can be effectively modeled using a unidirectional waveguide approach.</description>

      <title>Testing the presence of balanced and bipartite components in a sparse graph is QMA1-hard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining whether an abstract simplicial complex, a discrete object often approximating a manifold, contains multi-dimensional holes is a task deeply connected to quantum mechanics and proven to be QMA1-hard by Crichigno and Kohler. This task can be expressed in linear algebraic terms, equivalent to testing the non-triviality of the kernel of an operator known as the Combinatorial Laplacian. In this work, we explore the similarities between abstract simplicial complexes and signed or unsigned graphs, using them to map the spectral properties of the Combinatorial Laplacian to those of signed and unsigned graph Laplacians. We prove that our transformations preserve efficient sparse access to these Laplacian operators. Consequently, we show that key spectral properties, such as testing the presence of balanced components in signed graphs and the bipartite components in unsigned graphs, are QMA1-hard. These properties play a paramount role in network science. The hardness of the bipartite test is relevant in quantum Hamiltonian complexity, as another example of testing properties related to the eigenspace of a stoquastic Hamiltonians are quantumly hard in the sparse input model for the graph.</description>

      <title>Estimating the impact of light pollution on quantum communication between QEYSSat and Canadian quantum ground station sites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Satellite to ground quantum communication typically operates at night to reduce background signals, however it remains susceptible to noise from light pollution of the night sky. In this study we compare several methodologies for determining whether a Quantum Ground Station (QGS) site is viable for exchanging quantum signals with the upcoming Quantum Encryption and Science Satellite (QEYSSat) mission. We conducted ground site characterization studies at three locations in Canada: Waterloo, Ontario, Calgary, Alberta, and Priddis, Alberta. Using different methods we estimate the background counts expected to leak into the satellite-ground quantum channel, and determined whether the noise levels could prevent a quantum key transfer. We also investigate how satellite data recorded from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) can help estimate conditions of a particular site, and find reasonable agreement with the locally recorded data. Our results indicate that the Waterloo, Calgary, and Priddis QGS sites should allow both quantum uplinks and downlinks with QEYSSat, despite their proximity to urban centres. Furthermore, our approach allows the use of satellite borne instrument data (VIIRS) to remotely and efficiently determine the potential of a ground site.</description>

      <title>Quantum Compilation Toolkit for Rydberg Atom Arrays with Implications for Problem Hardness and Quantum Speedups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and implement a comprehensive quantum compilation toolkit for solving the maximum independent set (MIS) problem on quantum hardware based on Rydberg atom arrays. Our end-to-end pipeline involves three core components to efficiently map generic MIS instances onto Rydberg arrays with unit-disk connectivity, with modules for graph reduction, hardware compatibility checks, and graph embedding. The first module (reducer) provides hardware-agnostic and deterministic reduction logic that iteratively reduces the problem size via lazy clique removals. We find that real-world networks can typically be reduced by orders of magnitude on sub-second time scales, thus significantly cutting down the eventual load for quantum devices. Moreover, we show that reduction techniques may be an important tool in the ongoing search for potential quantum speedups, given their ability to identify hard problem instances. In particular, for Rydberg-native MIS instances, we observe signatures of an easy-hard-easy transition and quantify a critical degree indicating the onset of a hard problem regime. The second module (compatibility checker) implements a hardware compatibility checker that quickly determines whether or not a given input graph may be compatible with the restrictions imposed by Rydberg quantum hardware. The third module (embedder) describes hardware-efficient graph embedding routines to generate (approximate) encodings with controllable overhead and optimized ancilla placements. We exemplify our pipeline with experiments run on the QuEra Aquila device available on Amazon Braket. In aggregate, our work provides a set of tools that extends the class of problems that can be tackled with near-term Rydberg atom arrays.</description>

      <title>Single-Photon Advantage in Quantum Cryptography Beyond QKD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum cryptography, fundamental laws of quantum physics are exploited to enhance the security of cryptographic tasks. Quantum key distribution is by far the most studied protocol to date, enabling the establishment of a secret key between trusted parties. However, there exist many practical use-cases in communication networks, which also involve parties in distrustful settings. The most fundamental quantum cryptographic building block in such a distrustful setting is quantum coin flipping, which provides an advantage compared to its classical equivalent. So far, few experimental studies on quantum coin flipping have been reported, all of which used probabilistic quantum light sources facing fundamental limitations. Here, we experimentally implement a quantum strong coin flipping protocol using single-photon states and demonstrate an advantage compared to both classical realizations and implementations using faint laser pulses. We achieve this by employing a state-of-the-art deterministic single-photon source based on the Purcell-enhanced emission of a semiconductor quantum dot in combination with fast polarization-state encoding enabling a quantum bit error ratio below 3%, required for the successful execution of the protocol. The reduced multi-photon emission yields a smaller bias of the coin flipping protocol compared to an attenuated laser implementation, both in simulations and in the experiment. By demonstrating a single-photon quantum advantage in a cryptographic primitive beyond QKD, our work represents a major advance towards the implementation of complex cryptographic tasks in a future quantum internet.</description>

      <title>Quantum teleportation of cat states with binary-outcome measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a teleportation protocol involving beam splitting operations and binary-outcome measurements, such as parity measurements. These operations have a straightforward implementation using the dispersive regime of the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian, making our protocol suitable for a broad class of platforms, including trapped ions, circuit quantum electrodynamics and acoustodynamics systems. In these platforms homodyne measurements of the bosonic modes are less natural than dispersive measurements, making standard continuous variable teleportation unsuitable. In our protocol, Alice is in possession of two bosonic modes and Bob a single mode. An entangled mode pair between Alice and Bob is created by performing a beam splitter operation on a cat state. An unknown qubit state encoded by cat states is then teleported from Alice to Bob after a beamsplitting operation, measurement sequence, and a conditional correction. In the case of multiple measurements, near-perfect fidelity can be obtained. We discuss the optimal parameters in order to maximize the fidelity under a variety of scenarios.</description>

      <title>Quantum SWAP gate realized with CZ and iSWAP gates in a superconducting architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is advantageous for any quantum processor to support different classes of two-qubit quantum logic gates when compiling quantum circuits, a property that is typically not seen with existing platforms. In particular, access to a gate set that includes support for the CZ-type, the iSWAP-type, and the SWAP-type families of gates, renders conversions between these gate families unnecessary during compilation as any two-qubit Clifford gate can be executed using at most one two-qubit gate from this set, plus additional single-qubit gates. We experimentally demonstrate that a SWAP gate can be decomposed into one iSWAP gate followed by one CZ gate, affirming a more efficient compilation strategy over the conventional approach that relies on three iSWAP or three CZ gates to replace a SWAP gate. Our implementation makes use of a superconducting quantum processor design based on fixed-frequency transmon qubits coupled together by a parametrically modulated tunable transmon coupler, extending this platform's native gate set so that any two-qubit Clifford unitary matrix can be realized using no more than two two-qubit gates and single-qubit gates.</description>

      <title>General tradeoff relation of fundamental quantum limits for linear multiparameter estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear measurement is an important class of measurements for sensing classical signals including gravitational wave (GW), dark matter, infrared ray, rotation rate, etc. In this Letter, we focus on multiparameter linear measurement and establish a general tradeoff relation that tightly constrains the fundamental quantum limits of two independent parameters in a monochromatic classical signal detected by any linear quantum device. Such a tradeoff relation is universal and fundamental for multiparameter linear measurement since arising from Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. Compared with the Holevo Cram\'er-Rao bound, our tradeoff bound can completely identify the dependence between the attainable precision limits on estimated parameters. The dependence becomes more obvious such that the individual precision can not simultaneously reach the quantum limit as the so-called incompatible coefficient rises. Eventually, we find a necessary condition under which an optimal measurement protocol can saturate the general tradeoff relation, and show that the measurement phase can be tuned for adjusting different precision weight. This result is related to many applications, particularly detuned GW sensors for searching post-merger remnants due to the direct relation between the detuned frequency and incompatible coefficient.</description>

      <title>Enhancing dynamic range through quantum deamplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Balancing high sensitivity with a broad dynamic range (DR) is a fundamental challenge in measurement science, as improving one often compromises the other. While traditional quantum metrology has prioritized enhancing local sensitivity, a large DR is crucial for applications such as atomic clocks, where extended phase interrogation times contribute to wider phase range. In this Letter, we introduce a novel quantum deamplification mechanism that extends DR at a minimal cost of sensitivity. Our approach uses two sequential spin-squeezing operations to generate and detect an entangled probe state, respectively. We demonstrate that the optimal quantum interferometer limit can be approached through two-axis counter-twisting dynamics. Further expansion of DR is possible by using sequential quantum deamplification interspersed with phase encoding processes. Additionally, we show that robustness against detection noise can be enhanced by a hybrid sensing scheme that combines quantum deamplification with quantum amplification. Our protocol is within the reach of state-of-the-art atomic-molecular-optical platforms, offering a scalable, noise-resilient pathway for entanglement-enhanced metrology.</description>

      <title>Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics in Finite-Bandwidth Squeezed Reservoir</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light-matter interaction with squeezed vacuum has received much interest for the ability to enhance the native interaction strength between an atom and a photon with a reservoir assumed to have an infinite bandwidth. Here, we study a model of parametrically driven cavity quantum electrodynamics (cavity QED) for enhancing light-matter interaction while subjected to a finite-bandwidth squeezed vacuum drive. Our method is capable of unveiling the effect of relative bandwidth as well as squeezing required to observe the anticipated anti-crossing spectrum and enhanced cooperativity without the ideal squeezed bath assumption. Furthermore, we analyze the practicality of said models when including intrinsic photon loss due to resonators imperfection. With these results, we outline the requirements for experimentally implementing an effectively squeezed bath in solid-state platforms such as InAs quantum dot cavity QED such that \textit{in situ} control and enhancement of light-matter interaction could be realized.</description>

      <title>Eigenstate Preparation on Quantum Computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis investigates quantum algorithms for eigenstate preparation, with a focus on solving eigenvalue problems such as the Schrodinger equation by utilizing near-term quantum computing devices. These problems are ubiquitous in several scientific fields, but more accurate solutions are specifically needed as a prerequisite for many quantum simulation tasks. To address this, we establish three methods in detail: quantum adiabatic evolution with optimal control, the Rodeo Algorithm, and the Variational Rodeo Algorithm. The first method explored is adiabatic evolution, a technique that prepares quantum states by simulating a quantum system that evolves slowly over time. The adiabatic theorem can be used to ensure that the system remains in an eigenstate throughout the process, but its implementation can often be infeasible on current quantum computing hardware. We employ a unique approach using optimal control to create custom gate operations for superconducting qubits and demonstrate the algorithm on a two-qubit IBM cloud quantum computing device. We then explore an alternative to adiabatic evolution, the Rodeo Algorithm, which offers a different approach to eigenstate preparation by using a controlled quantum evolution that selectively filters out undesired components in the wave function stored on a quantum register. We show results suggesting that this method can be effective in preparing eigenstates, but its practicality is predicated on the preparation of an initial state that has significant overlap with the desired eigenstate. To address this, we introduce the novel Variational Rodeo Algorithm, which replaces the initialization step with dynamic optimization of quantum circuit parameters to increase the success probability of the Rodeo Algorithm. The added flexibility compensates for instances in which the original algorithm can be unsuccessful, allowing for better scalability.</description>

      <title>Reservoir engineering to protect quantum coherence in tripartite systems under dephasing noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of quantum 2.0, a key technological challenge lies in preserving coherence within quantum systems. Quantum coherence is susceptible to decoherence because of the interactions with the environment. Dephasing is a process that destroys the coherence of quantum states, leading to a loss of quantum information. In this work, we explore the dynamics of the relative entropy of coherence for tripartite pure and mixed states in the presence of structured dephasing environments at finite temperatures. Our findings demonstrate that the system's resilience to decoherence depends on the bath configuration. Specifically, when each qubit interacts with an independent environment, the dynamics differ from those observed with a shared bath. In a Markov, memoryless environment, coherence in both pure and mixed states decays, whereas coherence is preserved in the presence of reservoir memory.</description>

      <title>Faulty States can be used in Cat Code Error Correction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bosonic codes have seen a resurgence in interest for applications as varied as fault tolerant quantum architectures, quantum enhanced sensing, and entanglement distribution. Cat codes have been proposed as low-level elements in larger architectures, and the theory of rotationally symmetric codes more generally has been significantly expanded in the recent literature. The fault-tolerant preparation and maintenance of cat code states as a stand-alone quantum error correction scheme remains however limited by the need for robust state preparation and strong inter-mode interactions. In this work, we consider the teleportation-based correction circuit for cat code quantum error correction. We show that the class of acceptable ancillary states is broader than is typically acknowledged, and exploit this to propose the use of many-component "bridge" states which, though not themselves in the cat code space, are nonetheless capable of syndrome extraction in the regime where non-linear interactions are a limiting factor.</description>

      <title>Performance of Variational Algorithms for Local Hamiltonian Problems on Random Regular Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We design two variational algorithms to optimize specific 2-local Hamiltonians defined on graphs. Our algorithms are inspired by the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm. We develop formulae to analyze the energy achieved by these algorithms with high probability over random regular graphs in the infinite-size limit, using techniques from [arXiv:2110.14206]. The complexity of evaluating these formulae scales exponentially with the number of layers of the algorithms, so our numerical evaluation is limited to a small constant number of layers. We compare these algorithms to simple classical approaches and a state-of-the-art worst-case algorithm. We find that the symmetry inherent to these specific variational algorithms presents a major \emph{obstacle} to successfully optimizing the Quantum MaxCut (QMC) Hamiltonian on general graphs. Nonetheless, the algorithms outperform known methods to optimize the EPR Hamiltonian of [arXiv:2209.02589] on random regular graphs, and the QMC Hamiltonian when the graphs are also bipartite. As a special case, we show that with just five layers of our algorithm, we can already prepare states within 1.62% error of the ground state energy for QMC on an infinite 1D ring, corresponding to the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg spin chain.</description>

      <title>Experimental Demonstration of Logical Magic State Distillation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realizing universal fault-tolerant quantum computation is a key goal in quantum information science. By encoding quantum information into logical qubits utilizing quantum error correcting codes, physical errors can be detected and corrected, enabling substantial reduction in logical error rates. However, the set of logical operations that can be easily implemented on such encoded qubits is often constrained, necessitating the use of special resource states known as 'magic states' to implement universal, classically hard circuits. A key method to prepare high-fidelity magic states is to perform 'distillation', creating them from multiple lower fidelity inputs. Here we present the experimental realization of magic state distillation with logical qubits on a neutral-atom quantum computer. Our approach makes use of a dynamically reconfigurable architecture to encode and perform quantum operations on many logical qubits in parallel. We demonstrate the distillation of magic states encoded in d=3 and d=5 color codes, observing improvements of the logical fidelity of the output magic states compared to the input logical magic states. These experiments demonstrate a key building block of universal fault-tolerant quantum computation, and represent an important step towards large-scale logical quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Neutral atom transport and transfer between optical tweezers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We focus on the optimization of neutral atom transport and transfer between optical tweezers, both critical steps towards the implementation of quantum processors and simulators. We consider four different types of experimentally relevant pulses: piece-wise linear, piece-wise quadratic, minimum jerk, and a family of hybrid linear and minimum jerk ramps. We also develop a protocol using Shortcuts to Adiabaticity (STA) techniques that allows us to include the effects of static traps. By computing a measure of the error after transport and two measures of the heating for transient times, we provide a systematic characterization of the performance of all the considered pulses and show that our proposed STA protocol outperforms the experimentally inspired pulses. After pulse shape optimization we find a lower threshold for the total time of the protocol that is compatible with the limit below which the increase in the vibrational excitations exceeds half of the amount of states hosted by the moving tweezer. Since the obtained lower bound for the atom capturing or releasing stage is 9 times faster than the one reported in state-of-the-art experiments, we interpret our results as a wake-up call towards the importance of the inclusion and optimization of the transfer between tweezers, which may be the largest bottleneck to speed. For the two pulses having the best performance (minimum jerk and STA), we determine optimal regions in the experimentally accessible parameters to implement high fidelity transport pulses. Finally, our STA results prove that a modulation in the depth of the moving tweezer designed to counteract the effect of the static traps reduces errors and allows for shorter pulse duration. To motivate the use of our STA pulse in future experiments, we provide a simple analytical approximation for the tweezer position and depth controls.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the Page curve and resolving the black hole information puzzle in terms of the entanglement dynamics of black holes has been a key question in fundamental physics. In principle, the current quantum computing can provide insights into the entanglement dynamics of black holes within some simplified models. In this regard, we utilize quantum computers to investigate the entropy of Hawking radiation using the qubit transport model, a toy qubit model of black hole evaporation. Specifically, we implement the quantum simulation of the scrambling dynamics in black holes using an efficient random unitary circuit. Furthermore, we employ the swap-based many-body interference protocol for the first time and the randomized measurement protocol to measure the entanglement entropy of Hawking radiation qubits in IBM's superconducting quantum computers. Our findings indicate that while both entanglement entropy measurement protocols accurately estimate the R\'enyi entropy in numerical simulation, the randomized measurement protocol has a particular advantage over the swap-based many-body interference protocol in IBM's superconducting quantum computers. Finally, by incorporating quantum error mitigation techniques, we establish that the current quantum computers are robust tools for measuring the entanglement entropy of complex quantum systems and can probe black hole dynamics within simplified toy qubit models.</description>

      <title>Universal quantum computation via scalable measurement-free error correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that universal quantum computation can be made fault-tolerant in a scenario where the error-correction is implemented without mid-circuit measurements. To this end, we introduce a measurement-free deformation protocol of the Bacon-Shor code to realize a logical $\mathit{CCZ}$ gate, enabling a universal set of fault-tolerant operations. Independently, we demonstrate that certain stabilizer codes can be concatenated in a measurement-free way without having to rely on a universal logical gate set. This is achieved by means of the disposable Toffoli gadget, which realizes the feedback operation in a resource-efficient way. For the purpose of benchmarking the proposed protocols with circuit-level noise, we implement an efficient method to simulate non-Clifford circuits consisting of few Hadamard gates. In particular, our findings support that below-breakeven logical performance is achievable with a circuit-level error rate below $10^{-3}$. Altogether, the deformation protocol and the Toffoli gadget provide a blueprint for a fully fault-tolerant architecture without any feed-forward operation, which is particularly suited for state-of-the-art neutral-atom platforms.</description>

      <title>Quantum Frequency Conversion of $\mu s$-long Photons from the Visible to the Telecom-C-Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Frequency Conversion (QFC) is a widely used technique to interface atomic systems with the telecom band in order to facilitate propagation over longer distances in fiber. Here we demonstrate the difference-frequency conversion from 606 nm to 1552 nm of microsecond-long weak coherent pulses at the single photon level compatible with Pr$^{3+}$:Y$_2$SiO$_5\,$ quantum memories, with high-signal to noise ratio. We use a single step difference frequency generation process with a continuous-wave pump at 994 nm in a MgO:ppLN-waveguide and ultra-narrow spectral filtering down to a bandwidth of 12.5 MHz. With this setup, we achieve the conversion of weak coherent pulses of duration up to 13.6 $\mu s$ with a device efficiency of about 25% and a signal-to-noise ratio &gt;460 for 10 $\mu s$-long pulses containing one photon on average. This signal-to-noise ratio is large enough to enable a high-fidelity conversion of qubits emitted from an emissive quantum memory based on Pr$^{3+}$:Y$_2$SiO$_5\,$ and to realize an interface with quantum processing nodes based on narrow-linewidth cavity-enhanced trapped ions.</description>

      <title>A Finite-Time Quantum Otto Engine subject to Control Noise and Enhancement Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the development of any quantum technology comes a need for precise control of quantum systems. Here, we evaluate the impact of control noise on a quantum Otto cycle. Whilst it is postulated that noiseless quantum engines can approach maximal Otto efficiency in finite times, the existence of white noise on the controls is shown to negatively affect average engine performance. Two methods of quantum enhancement, counterdiabatic driving and quantum lubrication, are implemented and found to improve the performance of the noisy cycle only in specified parameter regimes. To gain insight into performance fluctuations, projective energy measurements are used to construct a noise-averaged probability distribution without assuming full thermalisation or adiabaticity. From this, the variances in thermodynamic currents are observed to increase as average power and efficiency improve, and are also shown to be consistent with known bounds from thermodynamic uncertainty relations. Lastly, by comparing the average functioning of the unmonitored engine to a projectively-measured engine cycle, the role of coherence in work extraction for this quantum engine model is investigated.</description>

      <title>Zero energy modes with gaussian, exponential, or polynomial decay: Exact solutions in hermitian and nonhermitian regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological zero modes in topological insulators or superconductors are exponentially localized at the phase transition between a topologically trivial and nontrivial phase. These modes are solutions of a Jackiw-Rebbi equation modified with an additional term which is quadratic in the momentum. Moreover, localized fermionic modes can also be induced by harmonic potentials in superfluids and superconductors or in atomic nuclei. Here, by using inverse methods, we consider in the same framework exponentially-localized zero modes, as well as gaussian modes induced by harmonic potentials (with superexponential decay) and polynomially decaying modes (with subexponential decay), and derive the explicit and analytical form of the modified Jackiw-Rebbi equation (and of the Schr\"odinger equation) which admits these modes as solutions. We find that the asymptotic behavior of the mass term is crucial in determining the decay properties of the modes. Furthermore, these considerations naturally extend to the nonhermitian regime. These findings allow us to classify and understand topological and nontopological boundary modes in topological insulators and superconductors.</description>

      <title>Quantum entropy and QCD factorization for low-$Q^2$ $\nu$DIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deeply inelastic scattering (DIS) is an essential process for exploring the structure of visible matter and testing the standard model. At the same time, the theoretical interpretation of DIS measurements depends on QCD factorization theorems whose validity deteriorates at the lower values of $Q^2$ and $W^2$ typical of neutrino DIS in accelerator-based oscillation searches. For this reason, progress in understanding the origin and limits of QCD factorization is invaluable to the accuracy and precision of predictions for these upcoming neutrino experiments. In these short proceedings, we introduce a novel approach based on the quantum entropy associated with continuous distributions in QCD, using it to characterize the limits of factorization theorems relevant for the description of neutrino DIS. This work suggests an additional avenue for dissecting factorization-breaking dynamics through the quantum entropy, which could also play a role in quantum simulations of related systems.</description>

      <title>Many-body spectral transitions through the lens of variable-range SYK2 model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model is a cornerstone in the study of quantum chaos and holographic quantum matter. Real-world implementations, however, deviate from the idealized all-to-all connectivity, raising questions about the robustness of its chaotic properties. In this work, we investigate a quadratic SYK model with distance-dependent interactions governed by a power-law decay. By analytically and numerically studying the spectral form factor (SFF), we uncover how the single particle transitions manifest in the many-body system. While the SFF demonstrates robustness under slightly reduced interaction ranges, further suppression leads to a breakdown of perturbation theory and new spectral regimes, marked by a higher dip and the emergence of a secondary plateau. Our results highlight the interplay between single-particle criticality and many-body dynamics, offering new insights into the quantum chaos-to-localization transition and its reflection in spectral statistics.</description>

      <title>Massive graviton dark matter searches with long-baseline atom interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atom interferometers offer exceptional sensitivity to ultra-light dark matter (ULDM) through their precise measurement of phenomena acting on atoms. While previous work has established their capability to detect scalar and vector ULDM, their potential for detecting spin-2 ULDM remains unexplored. This work investigates the sensitivity of atom interferometers to spin-2 ULDM by considering several frameworks for massive gravity: a Lorentz-invariant Fierz-Pauli case and two Lorentz-violating scenarios. We find that coherent oscillations of the spin-2 ULDM field induce a measurable phase shift through three distinct channels: coupling of the scalar mode to atomic energy levels, and vector and tensor effects that modify the propagation of atoms and light. Atom interferometers uniquely probe all of these effects, while providing sensitivity to a different mass range from laser interferometers. Our results demonstrate the potential of atom interferometers to advance the search for spin-2 dark matter through accessing unexplored parameter space and uncovering new interactions between ULDM and atoms.</description>

      <title>Planon-modular fracton orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are now many examples of gapped fracton models, which are defined by the presence of restricted-mobility excitations above the quantum ground state. However, the theory of fracton orders remains in its early stages, and the complex landscape of examples is far from being mapped out. Here we introduce the class of planon-modular (p-modular) fracton orders, a relatively simple yet still rich class of quantum orders that encompasses several well-known examples of type I fracton order. The defining property is that any non-trivial point-like excitation can be detected by braiding with planons. From this definition, we uncover a significant amount of general structure, including the assignment of a natural number (dubbed the weight) to each excitation of a p-modular fracton order. We identify simple new phase invariants, some of which are based on weight, which can easily be used to compare and distinguish different fracton orders. We also study entanglement renormalization group (RG) flows of p-modular fracton orders, establishing a close connection with foliated RG. We illustrate our general results with an analysis of several exactly solvable fracton models that we show to realize p-modular fracton orders, including Z_n versions of the X-cube, anisotropic, checkerboard, 4-planar X-cube and four color cube (FCC) models. We show that each of these models is p-modular and compute its phase invariants. We also show that each example admits a foliated RG at the level of its non-trivial excitations, which is a new result for the 4-planar X-cube and FCC models. We show that the Z_2 FCC model is not a stack of other better-studied models, but predict that the Z_n FCC model with n odd is a stack of 10 4-planar X-cubes, possibly plus decoupled layers of 2d toric code. We also show that the Z_n checkerboard model for n odd is a stack of three anisotropic models.</description>

      <title>Quantum Fisher Information Reveals UV-IR Mixing in the Strange Metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The density-density response in optimally doped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ has recently been shown to exhibit conformal symmetry. Using, the experimentally inferred conformal dynamic susceptibility, we compute the resultant quantum Fisher information (QFI), a witness to multi-partite entanglement. In contrast to a Fermi liquid in which the QFI is approximately temperature independent much below the Fermi energy scale, we find that the QFI increases as a power law at low temperatures but ultimately extrapolates to a constant at $T=0$. The constant is of the form, $\omega_g^{2\Delta}$, where $\Delta$ is the conformal dimension and $\omega_g$ is the UV cutoff which is on the order of the pseudogap. As this constant {depends on both UV and IR properties}, it illustrates that multipartite entanglement in a strange metal exhibits UV-IR mixing, a benchmark feature of doped Mott insulators as exemplified by dynamical spectral weight transfer. We conclude with a discussion of the implication of our results for low-energy reductions of the Hubbard model.</description>

      <title>Time-Reversal Symmetry-Protected Coherent Control of Ultracold Molecular Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent control of atomic and molecular scattering relies on the preparation of colliding particles in superpositions of internal states, establishing interfering pathways that can be used to tune the outcome of a scattering process. However, incoherent addition of different partial wave contributions to the integral cross sections (partial wave scrambling), commonly encountered in systems with complex collisional dynamics, poses a significant challenge, often limiting control. This work demonstrates that time-reversal symmetry can overcome these limitations by constraining the relative phases of S-matrix elements, thereby protecting coherent control against partial wave scrambling, even for collisions mediated by highly anisotropic interactions. Using the example of ultracold O$_2$-O$_2$ scattering, we show that coherent control is robust against short-range dynamical complexity. Furthermore, the time-reversal symmetry also protects the control against a distribution of collisional energy. These findings show that ultracold scattering into the final states that are time-reversal-invariant, such as the J = 0, M = 0 rotational state, can always be optimally controlled by using time-reversal-invariant initial superpositions. Beyond the ultracold regime, we observe significant differences in the controllability of crossed-molecular beam vs. trap experiments with the former being easier to control, emphasizing the cooperative role of time-reversal and permutation symmetries in maintaining control at any temperature. These results open new avenues for the coherent control of complex inelastic collisions and chemical reactions both in and outside of the ultracold regime.</description>

      <title>Enhanced second-order sideband generation and slow-fast light via coupled opto- and magnomechanical microspheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this research, we investigate second-order sideband generation (SSG) and slow-fast light using a hybrid system comprised of two coupled opto- and magnomechanical microspheres, namely a YIG sphere and a silica sphere. The YIG sphere hosts a magnon mode and a vibration mode induced by magnetostriction, whereas the silica sphere has an optical whispering gallery mode and a mechanical mode coupled via optomechanical interaction. The mechanical modes of both spheres are close in frequency and are coherently coupled by the straightway physical contact between the two microspheres. We use a perturbation approach to solve the Heisenberg-Langevin equations, offering an analytical framework for transmission rate and SSG. Using experimentally feasible settings, we demonstrate that the transmission rate and SSG are strongly dependent on the magnomechanical, optomechanical, and mechanics mechanics coupling strengths (MMCS) between the two microspheres. The numerical results show that increasing the MMCS can enhance both the transmission rate and SSG efficiency, resulting in gain within our system. Our findings, in particular, reveal that the efficiency of the SSG can be effectively controlled by cavity detuning, decay rate, and pump power. Notably, our findings suggest that modifying the system parameters can alter the group delay, thereby regulating the transition between fast and slow light propagation, and vice versa. Our protocol provides guidelines for manipulating nonlinear optical properties and controlling light propagation, with applications including optical switching, information storage, and precise measurement of weak signals.</description>

      <title>Soft edges: the many links between soft and edge modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Boundaries in gauge theory and gravity give rise to symmetries and charges at both finite and asymptotic distance. Due to their structural similarities, it is often held that soft modes are some kind of asymptotic limit of edge modes. Here, we show in Maxwell theory that there is an arguably more interesting relationship between the \emph{asymptotic} symmetries and their charges, on one hand, and their \emph{finite-distance} counterparts, on the other, without the need of a limit. Key to this observation is to embed the finite region in the global spacetime and identify edge modes as dynamical $\rm{U}(1)$-reference frames for dressing subregion variables. Distinguishing \emph{intrinsic} and \emph{extrinsic} frames, according to whether they are built from field content in- or outside the region, we find that non-trivial corner symmetries arise only for extrinsic frames. Further, the asymptotic-to-finite relation requires asymptotically charged ones (like Wilson lines). Such frames, called \emph{soft edges}, extend to asymptotia and realize the corner charge algebra by ``pulling in'' the asymptotic one from infinity. Realizing an infinite-dimensional algebra requires a new set of \emph{soft boundary conditions}, relying on the distinction between extrinsic and intrinsic data. We identify the subregion Goldstone mode as the relational observable between extrinsic and intrinsic frames and clarify the meaning of vacuum degeneracy. We also connect the asymptotic memory effect with a more operational \emph{quasi-local} one. A main conclusion is that the relationship between asymptotia and finite distance is \emph{frame-dependent}; each choice of soft edge mode probes distinct cross-boundary data of the global theory. Our work combines the study of boundary symmetries with the program of dynamical reference frames and we anticipate that core insights extend to Yang-Mills theory and gravity.</description>

      <title>Persistent current in a non-Hermitian Hatano-Nelson ring: Disorder-induced amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal hopping induces a synthetic magnetic flux which leads to the non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm effect. Since non-Hermitian Hamiltonians possess both real and imaginary eigenvalues, this effect allows the observation of real and imaginary persistent currents in a ring threaded by the synthetic flux~\cite{nrh8}. Motivated by this, we investigate the behavior of persistent currents in a disordered Hatano-Nelson ring with anti-Hermitian intradimer hopping. The disorder is diagonal and we explore three distinct models, namely the Aubry-Andr\'{e}-Harper model, the Fibonacci model, both representing correlated disorder, and an uncorrelated (random) model. We conduct a detailed analysis of the energy spectrum and examine the real and imaginary parts of the persistent current under various conditions such as different ring sizes and filling factors. Interestingly, we find that real and imaginary persistent currents exhibit amplification in the presence of correlated disorder. This amplification is also observed in certain individual random configurations but vanishes after configuration averaging. Additionally, we observe both diamagnetic and paramagnetic responses in the current behavior and investigate aspects of persistent currents in the absence of disorder that have not been previously explored. Interestingly, we find that the intradimer bonds host only imaginary currents, while the interdimer bonds carry only real currents.</description>

      <title>Relational Observables in Group Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct relational observables in group field theory (GFT) in terms of covariant positive operator-valued measures (POVMs), using techniques developed in the context of quantum reference frames. We focus on matter quantum reference frames; this can be generalized to other types of frames within the same POVM-based framework. The resulting family of relational observables provides a covariant framework to extract localized observables from GFT, which is typically defined in a perspective-neutral way. Then, we compare this formalism with previous proposals for relational observables in GFT. We find that our quantum reference frame-based relational observables overcome the intrinsic limitations of previous proposals while reproducing the same continuum limit results concerning expectation values of the number and volume operators on coherent states. Nonetheless, there can be important differences for more complex operators, as well as for other types of GFT states. Finally, we also use a specific class of POVMs to show how to project states and operators from the more general perspective-neutral GFT Fock space to a perspective-dependent one where a scalar matter field plays the role of a relational clock.</description>

      <title>Quantum chaos, localization and phase transitions in random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The energy level statistics of uniform random graphs are studied, by treating the graphs as random tight-binding lattices. The inherent random geometry of the graphs and their dynamical spatial dimensionality, leads to various quantum chaotic and localized phases and transitions between them. Essentially the random geometry acts as disorder, whose strength is characterized by the ratio of edges over vertices R in the graphs. For dense graphs, with large ratio R, the spacing between successive energy levels follows the Wigner-Dyson distribution, leading to a quantum chaotic behavior and a metallic phase, characterized by level repulsion. For ratios near R=0.5, where a large dominating component in the graph appears, the level spacing follows the Poisson distribution with level crossings and a localized phase for the respective wavefunctions lying on the graph. For intermediate ratios R we observe a phase transition between the quantum chaotic and localized phases characterized by a semi-Poisson distribution. The values R of the critical regime where the phase transition occurs depend on the energy of the system. Our analysis shows that physical systems with random geometry, for example ones with a fluctuating/dynamical spatial dimension, contain novel universal phase transition properties, similar to those occuring in more traditional phase transitions based on symmetry breaking mechanisms, whose universal properties are strongly determined by the dimensionality of the system.</description>

      <title>Impact of Josephson junction array modes on fluxonium readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dispersive readout of superconducting qubits is often limited by readout-drive-induced transitions between qubit levels. While there is a growing understanding of such effects in transmon qubits, the case of highly nonlinear fluxonium qubits is more complex. We theoretically analyze measurement-induced state transitions (MIST) during the dispersive readout of a fluxonium qubit. We focus on a new mechanism: a simultaneous transition/excitation involving the qubit and an internal mode of the Josephson junction array in the fluxonium circuit. Using an adiabatic Floquet approach, we show that these new kinds of MIST processes can be relevant when using realistic circuit parameters and relatively low readout drive powers. They also contribute to excess qubit dephasing even after a measurement is complete. In addition to outlining basic mechanisms, we also investigate the dependence of such transitions on the circuit parameters. We find that with a judicious choice of frequency allocations or coupling strengths, these parasitic processes can most likely be avoided.</description>

      <title>Rydberg states and new resonant states of the imidogen molecule NH: pathways for nitrogen release</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutral resonant states of molecules play a very important role in the dissociation dynamics and other electronic processes that occur via intermediate capture into these states. With the goal of identifying resonant states, and their corresponding widths, of the imidogen molecule NH as a function of internuclear distance, we have performed detailed R-matrix calculations on the e + NH+ system. In a previous work, we had identified bound states of NH and Feshbach resonances in the e + NH+ system at a single geometry, namely the NH+ equilibrium Re = 2.0205 a0 . Here we present a much more detailed work by repeating the calculation on over 60 internuclear distances to obtain the corresponding potential energy curves. The bound states for nine symmetries have been detailed many of which, particularly the singlet states, were never studied before. Several resonant states of different symmetries, which were unknown until now, have been systematically identified and their widths calculated in the present work, which proved much more challenging due to presence of many avoided crossings. It is hoped that the bound and the new resonant states obtained here will open up other molecular dynamics studies, since for several dissociative processes, although experimental data existed for more than a decade, these are still uncorroborated due to absence of molecular data, and hence subsequent theoretical calculations.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative exciton transfer rate analysis of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson photosynthetic complex under reduced and oxidised conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional optical spectroscopy experiments have shown that exciton transfer pathways in the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) photosynthetic complex differ drastically under reduced and oxidised conditions, suggesting a functional role for collective vibronic mechanisms that may be active in the reduced form but attenuated in the oxidised state. Higgins et al. [PNAS 118 (11) e2018240118 (2021)] used Redfield theory to link the experimental observations to altered exciton transfer rates due to oxidative onsite energy shifts that detune excitonic energy gaps from a specific vibrational frequency of the bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) a. Using a memory kernel formulation of the hierarchical equations of motion, we present non-perturbative estimations of transfer rates that yield a modified physical picture. Our findings indicate that onsite energy shifts alone cannot reproduce the observed rate changes in oxidative environments, either qualitatively or quantitatively. By systematically examining combined changes both in site energies and the local environment for the oxidised complex, while maintaining consistency with absorption spectra, our results suggest that vibronic tuning of transfer rates may indeed be active in the reduced complex. However, we achieve qualitative, but not quantitative, agreement with the experimentally measured rates. Our analysis indicates potential limitations of the FMO electronic Hamiltonian, which was originally derived by fitting spectra to second-order cumulant and Redfield theories. This suggests that reassessment of these electronic parameters with a non-perturbative scheme, or derived from first principles, is essential for a consistent and accurate understanding of exciton dynamics in FMO under varying redox conditions.</description>

      <title>Individual assembly of two-species Rydberg molecules using optical tweezers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new approach to investigating Rydberg molecules by demonstrating the formation and characterization of individual Rb$^{*}$Cs Rydberg molecules using optical tweezers. By employing single-atom detection of Rb and Cs, we observe molecule formation via correlated loss of both species and study the formation dynamics with single-particle resolution. We control the interatomic distances by manipulating the relative wavefunction of atom pairs using the tweezer intensity, optimizing the coupling to molecular states and exploring the effect of the tweezer on these states. Additionally, we demonstrate molecule association with atoms trapped in separate tweezers, paving the way for state-selective assembly of polyatomic molecules. The observed binding energies, molecular alignment, and bond lengths are in good agreement with theory. Our approach is broadly applicable to Rydberg tweezer platforms, expanding the range of available molecular systems and enabling the integration of Rydberg molecules into existing quantum science platforms.</description>

      <title>Recurrence method in Non-Hermitian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel and systematic recurrence method for the energy spectra of non-Hermitian systems under open boundary conditions based on the recurrence relations of their characteristic polynomials. Our formalism exhibits better accuracy and performance on multi-band non-Hermitian systems than numerical diagonalization or the non-Bloch band theory. It also provides a targeted and efficient formulation for the non-Hermitian edge spectra. As demonstrations, we derive general expressions for both the bulk and edge spectra of multi-band non-Hermitian models with nearest-neighbor hopping and under open boundary conditions, such as the non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger and Rice-Mele models and the non-Hermitian Hofstadter butterfly - 2D lattice models in the presence of non-reciprocity and perpendicular magnetic fields, which is only made possible by the significantly lower complexity of the recurrence method. In addition, we use the recurrence method to study non-Hermitian edge physics, including the size-parity effect and the stability of the topological edge modes against boundary perturbations. Our recurrence method offers a novel and favorable formalism to the intriguing physics of non-Hermitian systems under open boundary conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photocurrent-induced harmonics appear in gases and solids due to tunnel ionization of electrons in strong fields and subsequent acceleration. In contrast to three-step harmonic emission, no return to the parent ions is necessary. Here we show that the same mechanism produces harmonics in metallic nanostructures in strong fields. Furthermore, we demonstrate how strong local field gradient, appearing as a consequence of the field enhancement, affects photocurrent-induced harmonics. This influence can shed light at the state of electron as it appears in the continuum, in particular, to its initial velocity.</description>

      <title>Categorical Symmetries in Spin Models with Atom Arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Categorical symmetries have recently been shown to generalize the classification of phases of matter, significantly broadening the traditional Landau paradigm. To test these predictions, we propose a simple spin chain model that encompasses all gapped phases and second-order phase transitions governed by the categorical symmetry $\mathsf{Rep}(D_8)$. This model not only captures the essential features of non-invertible phases but is also straightforward enough to enable practical realization. Specifically, we outline an implementation using neutral atoms trapped in optical tweezer arrays. Employing a dual-species setup and Rydberg blockade, we propose a digital simulation approach that can efficiently implement the many-body evolution in several nontrivial quantum phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum extremal island rule allows us to compute the Page curves of Hawking radiation in semi-classical gravity. In this work, we study the connection between these calculations and the thermalisation of chaotic quantum many-body systems, using a coarse-grained description of entanglement dynamics known as the entanglement membrane. Starting from a double-holographic model of eternal two-sided asymptotically AdS$_d$ ($d&gt;2$) black hole each coupled to a flat $d$-dimensional bath, we show that the entanglement dynamics in the late-time, large-subregion limit is described by entanglement membrane, thereby establishing a quantitative equivalence between a semi-classical gravity and a chaotic quantum many-body system calculation of the Page curve.</description>

      <title>Coherent spin-1 dynamics encoded in the rotational states of ultracold molecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rotational states of ultracold polar molecules possess long radiative lifetimes, microwave-domain coupling, and tunable dipolar interactions. Coherent dynamics between pairs of rotational states have been used to demonstrate simple models of quantum magnetism and to manipulate quantum information stored as qubits. The availability of numerous rotational states has led to many proposals to implement more complicated models of quantum magnetism, higher-dimensional qudits, and intricate state networks as synthetic dimensions; however, these are yet to be experimentally realised. The primary issue limiting their implementation is the detrimental effect of the optical trapping environment on coherence, which is not easily mitigated for systems beyond two levels. To address this challenge, we investigate the applicability of magic-wavelength optical tweezer traps to facilitate multitransition coherence between rotational states. We demonstrate simultaneous second-scale coherence between three rotational states. Utilising this extended coherence, we perform multiparameter estimation using a generalised Ramsey sequence and demonstrate coherent spin-1 dynamics encoded in the rotational states. Our work paves the way to implementing proposed quantum simulation, computation, and metrology schemes that exploit the rich rotational structure of ultracold polar molecules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been conjectured that the size of the black hole interior captures the quantum gate complexity of the underlying boundary evolution. In this short note we aim to provide a further microscopic evidence for this by directly relating the area of a certain codimension-two surface traversing the interior to the depth of the quantum circuit. Our arguments are based on establishing such relation rigorously at early times using the notion of operator Schmidt rank and then extrapolating it to later times by mapping bulk surfaces to cuts in the circuit representation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.08825v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A core challenge for superconducting quantum computers is to scale up the number of qubits in each processor without increasing noise or cross-talk. Distributed quantum computing across small qubit arrays, known as chiplets, can address these challenges in a scalable manner. We propose a chiplet architecture over microwave links with potential to exceed monolithic performance on near-term hardware. Our methods of modeling and evaluating the chiplet architecture bridge the physical and network layers in these processors. We find evidence that distributing computation across chiplets may reduce the overall error rates associated with moving data across the device, despite higher error figures for transfers across links. Preliminary analyses suggest that latency is not substantially impacted, and that at least some applications and architectures may avoid bottlenecks around chiplet boundaries. In the long-term, short-range networks may underlie quantum computers just as local area networks underlie classical datacenters and supercomputers today.</description>

      <title>A statistical model for quantum spin and photon number states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.13535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The most irreducible way to represent information is a sequence of two symbols. In this paper, we construct quantum states using this basic building block. Specifically, we show that the probabilities that arise in quantum theory can be reduced to counting more fundamental ontic states, which we interpret as event networks and model using sequences of 0's and 1's. A completely self contained formalism is developed for the purpose of organizing and counting these ontic states, which employs the finite cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}_2 = \{0, 1\}$, basic set theory, and combinatorics. This formalism is then used to calculate probability distributions associated with particles of arbitrary spin interacting with sequences of two rotated Stern-Gerlach detectors. These calculations are compared with the predictions of non-relativistic quantum mechanics and shown to deviate slightly. This deviation can be made arbitrarily small and does not lead to violations of relevant no-go theorems, such as Bell's inequalities, the Kochen-Specker theorem, or the PBR theorem. The proposed model is then extended to an optical system involving photon number states passing through a beam splitter. Leveraging recent advancements in high precision experiments on these systems, we then propose a means of testing the new model using a tabletop experiment.</description>

Abstract: Understanding the influence of measurements on the properties of many-body systems is a fundamental problem in quantum mechanics and for quantum technologies. This paper explores how a finite density of stochastic local measurement modifies a given state's entanglement structure. Considering various measurement protocols, we explore the typical quantum correlations of their associated projected ensembles arising from the ground state of the quantum Ising model. Using large-scale numerical simulations, we demonstrate substantial differences among inequivalent measurement protocols. Surprisingly, we observe that forced on-site measurements can enhance both bipartite and multipartite entanglement. We present a phenomenological toy model and perturbative calculations to analytically support these results. Furthermore, we extend these considerations to the non-Hermitian Ising model, naturally arising in optically monitored systems, and we show that its qualitative entanglement features are not altered by a finite density of projective measurements. Overall, these results reveal a complex phenomenology where local quantum measurements do not simply disentangle degrees of freedom, but may actually strengthen the entanglement in the system.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary Polynomial Separations in Trainable Quantum Machine Learning</title>

Abstract: Recent theoretical results in quantum machine learning have demonstrated a general trade-off between the expressive power of quantum neural networks (QNNs) and their trainability; as a corollary of these results, practical exponential separations in expressive power over classical machine learning models are believed to be infeasible as such QNNs take a time to train that is exponential in the model size. We here circumvent these negative results by constructing a hierarchy of efficiently trainable QNNs that exhibit unconditionally provable, polynomial memory separations of arbitrary constant degree over classical neural networks -- including state-of-the-art models, such as Transformers -- in performing a classical sequence modeling task. This construction is also computationally efficient, as each unit cell of the introduced class of QNNs only has constant gate complexity. We show that contextuality -- informally, a quantitative notion of semantic ambiguity -- is the source of the expressivity separation, suggesting that other learning tasks with this property may be a natural setting for the use of quantum learning algorithms.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Importance of Non-Shortest Paths in Quantum Networks</title>

Abstract: Quantum networks (QNs) exhibit stronger connectivity than predicted by classical percolation, yet the origin of this phenomenon remains unexplored. Here, we apply a statistical physics model -- concurrence percolation -- to uncover the origin of stronger connectivity on hierarchical scale-free networks, the ($U,V$) flowers. These networks allow full analytical control over path connectivity through two adjustable path-length parameters, $U \leq V$. This precise control enables us to determine critical exponents well beyond current simulation limits, revealing that classical and concurrence percolations, while both satisfying the hyperscaling relation, fall into distinct universality classes. This distinction arises from how they "superpose" parallel, non-shortest path contributions into overall connectivity. Concurrence percolation, unlike its classical counterpart, is sensitive to non-shortest paths and shows higher resilience to detours as these paths lengthen. This enhanced resilience is also observed in real-world hierarchical, scale-free Internet networks. Our findings highlight a crucial principle for QN design: when non-shortest paths are abundant, they notably enhance QN connectivity beyond what is achievable with classical percolation.</description>

      <title>Image Classification with Rotation-Invariant Variational Quantum Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms are gaining attention as an early application of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. One of the main problems of variational methods lies in the phenomenon of Barren Plateaus, present in the optimization of variational parameters. Adding geometric inductive bias to the quantum models has been proposed as a potential solution to mitigate this problem, leading to a new field called Geometric Quantum Machine Learning. In this work, an equivariant architecture for variational quantum classifiers is introduced to create a label-invariant model for image classification with $C_4$ rotational label symmetry. The equivariant circuit is benchmarked against two different architectures, and it is experimentally observed that the geometric approach boosts the model's performance. Finally, a classical equivariant convolution operation is proposed to extend the quantum model for the processing of larger images, employing the resources available in NISQ devices.</description>

Abstract: In the Hermitian regime, the Wannier-Stark ladder characterizes the eigenstates of an electron in a periodic potential with an applied static electric field. In this work, we extend this concept to the complex regime for a periodic non-Hermitian system under a linear potential. We show that although the energy levels can be complex, they are still equally spaced by a real Bloch frequency. This ensures single-particle Bloch oscillations with a damping (or growing) rate. The system can also support standard two-particle Bloch oscillations under certain conditions. We propose two types of dimerized non-Hermitian systems to demonstrate our results. In addition, we also propose a scheme to demonstrate the results of electron-pair dynamics in a single-particle 2D $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric square lattice.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Accuracy of Interferometric Quantum Measurements under Conservation Laws</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A (target) quantum system is often measured through observations performed on a second (meter) system to which the target is coupled. In the presence of global conservation laws holding on the joint meter-target system, the Wigner-Araki-Yanase theorem and its generalizations predict a lower-bound on the measurement's error (Ozawa's bound). While practically negligible for macroscopic meters, it becomes relevant for microscopic ones. Here, we propose a simple interferometric setup, arguably within reach of present technology, in which a flying particle (a microscopic quantum meter) is used to measure a qubit by interacting with it in one arm of the interferometer. In this scenario, the globally conserved quantity is the total energy of particle and qubit. We show how the measurement error, $\varepsilon$, is linked to the non-stationary nature of the measured observable and the finite duration of the target-meter interaction while Ozawa's bound, $\varepsilon_{\mathrm B}$, only depends on the momentum uncertainty of the meter's wavepacket. When considering short wavepackets with respect to the evolution time of the qubit, we show that $\varepsilon/\varepsilon_{\mathrm B}$ is strictly tied to the position-momentum uncertainty of the meter's wavepacket and $\varepsilon/\varepsilon_{\mathrm B} \rightarrow 1$ only when employing Gaussian wavepackets. On the contrary, long wavepackets of any shape lead to $\varepsilon/\varepsilon_{\mathrm B} \rightarrow \sqrt{2}$. In addition to their fundamental relevance, our findings have important practical consequences for optimal resource management in quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>QOSST: A Highly-Modular Open Source Platform for Experimental Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18637v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) enables secret key exchange between two remote parties with information-theoretic security rooted in the laws of quantum physics. Encoding key information in continuous variables (CV), such as the values of quadrature components of coherent states of light, brings implementations much closer to standard optical communication systems, but this comes at the price of significant complexity in the digital signal processing techniques required for operation at low signal-to-noise ratios. In this work, we wish to lower the barriers to entry for CV-QKD experiments associated to this difficulty by providing a highly modular, open source software that is in principle hardware agnostic and can be used in multiple configurations. We benchmarked this software, called QOSST, using an experimental setup with a locally generated local oscillator, frequency multiplexed pilots and RF-heterodyne detection, and obtained state-of-the-art secret key rates of the order of Mbit/s over metropolitan distances at the asymptotic limit. We hope that QOSST can be used to stimulate further experimental advances in CV-QKD and be improved and extended by the community to achieve high performance in a wide variety of configurations.</description>

      <title>Wave Function Collapse, Lorentz Invariance, and the Third Postulate of Relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The changes that quantum states undergo during measurement are both probabilistic and nonlocal. These two characteristics complement one another to insure compatibility with relativity and maintain conservation laws. Nonlocal entanglement relations provide a means to enforce conservation laws in a probabilistic theory, while the probabilistic nature of nonlocal effects prevents the superluminal transmission of information. In order to explain these measurement-induced changes in terms of fundamental physical processes it is necessary to take these two key characteristics into account. One way to do this is to modify the Schroedinger equation by adding stochastic, nonlinear terms. A number of such proposals have been made over the past few decades. A recently proposed equation based on the assumption that wave function collapse is induced by a sequence of correlating interactions of the kind that constitute measurements has been shown to maintain strict adherence to conservation laws in individual instances, and has also eliminated the need to introduce any new, ad hoc physical constants. In this work it is shown that this modified Schroedinger equation is naturally Lorentz invariant. It is further argued that the additional spacetime structure that it requires provides a way to implement the assumption that spacelike-separated operators (and measurements) commute, and that this assumption of local commutativity should be regarded as a third postulate of relativity.</description>

      <title>On the applicability of Kolmogorov's theory of probability to the description of quantum phenomena. Part I: Foundations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05710v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is a common view that von Neumann laid the foundations of a "quantum probability theory" with his axiomatization of quantum mechanics (QM). As such, it is regarded a generalization of the "classical probability theory" due to Kolmogorov. Outside of quantum physics, however, Kolmogorov's axioms enjoy universal applicability. This raises the question of whether quantum physics indeed requires such a generalization of our conception of probability or if von Neumann's axiomatization of QM was contingent on the absence of a general theory of probability in the 1920s.
  In this work I argue in favor of the latter position. In particular, I show that for non-relativistic $N$-body quantum systems subject to a time-independent scalar potential, it is possible to construct a mathematically rigorous theory based on Kolmogorov's axioms and physically natural random variables, which reproduces central predictions of QM. The respective theories are distinct, so that an empirical comparison may be possible. Moreover, the approach can in principle be adapted to other classes of quantum-mechanical models.
  Part II of this series discusses the empirical violation of Bell inequalities in the context of this approach. Part III addresses the projection postulate and the question of measurement.</description>

      <title>Dissipation-induced bound states as a two-level system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Potential wells are employed to constrain quantum particles into forming discrete energy levels, acting as artificial few-level systems. In contrast, an anti-parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetric system can have a single pair of real energy levels, while all the remaining levels are unstable due to the negative imaginary part of the energy. In this work, we investigate the formation of bound states in a tight-binding chain induced by a harmonic imaginary potential. Exact solutions show that the real parts of energy levels are equidistant, while the imaginary parts are semi-negative definite and equidistant. This allows for the formation of an effective two-level system. For a given initial state with a wide range of profiles, the evolved state always converges to a superposition of two stable eigenstates. In addition, these two states are orthogonal under the Dirac inner product and can be mutually switched by applying a $\pi$ pulse of a linear field. Our finding provides an alternative method for fabricating quantum devices through dissipation.</description>

Abstract: Continuous variables (CV) offer a promising platform for the development of various applications, such as quantum communication, computing, and sensing, and CV graph states represent a family of powerful entangled resource states for all these areas. In many of these protocols, a crucial aspect is the certification of the quantum state subsequently used. While numerous protocols exist, most rely on assumptions unrealistic for physical continuous variable states, such as infinite precision in quadrature measurement or the use of states requiring infinite squeezing. In this work, we adapt existing protocols to deal with these unavoidable considerations, and use them to certify their application for different quantum information tasks. More specifically, we show how CV graph states can be efficiently verified and certified even in a noisy and imperfect setting. We then discuss how our findings impact the usability of states obtained after the protocol for different applications, including quantum teleportation, computing, and sensing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present two applications where open system quantum simulation is the preferred approach on a quantum computer. We choose concrete parameters for the problems in such a way that the application value, which we call utility, can be obtained from the solution directly. The scientific utility is exemplified by a computation of nonequilibrium behavior of Ca$_3$Co$_2$O$_6$, which is studied in \$2M MagLab experiments. For industrial utility, we develop a methodology that allows researchers of various backgrounds to estimate the economic value of an emerging technology consistently. Our approach predicts \$400M utility for the applications of materials with a Metal-Insulator Transition. We focus on the transport calculation in the Hubbard model as the simplest problem that needs to be solved in a large-scale material search. The resource estimates for both problems suffer from a large required runtime, which motivates us to propose novel algorithm optimizations, taking advantage of the translation invariance and the parallelism of the T-gate application. Finally, we introduce several planted solution problems and their obfuscated versions as a benchmark for future quantum devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multipartite entanglement, linking multiple nodes simultaneously, is a higher-order correlation that offers advantages over pairwise connections in quantum networks (QNs). Creating reliable, large-scale multipartite entanglement requires entanglement routing, a process that combines local, short-distance connections into a long-distance connection, which can be considered as a transformation of network topology. Here, we address the question of whether a QN can be topologically transformed into another via entanglement routing. Our key result is an exact mapping from multipartite entanglement routing to Nash-Williams's graph immersion problem, extended to hypergraphs. This generalized hypergraph immersion problem introduces a partial order between QN topologies, permitting certain topological transformations while precluding others, offering discerning insights into the design and manipulation of higher-order network topologies in QNs.</description>

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) requires significant quantum resources to address practical real-world problems. When the underlying quantum information exhibits hierarchical structures in the data, limitations persist in training complexity and generalization. Research should prioritize both the efficient design of quantum architectures and the development of learning strategies to optimize resource usage. We propose a framework called quantum curriculum learning (Q-CurL) for quantum data, where the curriculum introduces simpler tasks or data to the learning model before progressing to more challenging ones. Q-CurL exhibits robustness to noise and data limitations, which is particularly relevant for current and near-term noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. We achieve this through a curriculum design based on quantum data density ratios and a dynamic learning schedule that prioritizes the most informative quantum data. Empirical evidence shows that Q-CurL significantly enhances training convergence and generalization for unitary learning and improves the robustness of quantum phase recognition tasks. Q-CurL is effective with broad physical learning applications in condensed matter physics and quantum chemistry.</description>

Abstract: Quantum data centres (QDCs) could overcome the scalability challenges of modern quantum computers. Single-processor monolithic quantum computers are affected by increased cross talk and difficulty of implementing gates when the number of qubits is increased. In a QDC, multiple quantum processing units (QPUs) are linked together over short distances, allowing the total number of computational qubits to be increased without increasing the number of qubits on any one processor. In doing so, the error incurred by operations at each QPU can be kept small, however additional noise will be added to the system due to the latency cost and errors incurred during inter-QPU entanglement distribution. We investigate the relative impact of these different types of noise using a classically simulated QDC with two QPUs and compare the robustness to noise of the two main ways of implementing remote gates, cat-comm and TP-comm. We find that considering the quantity of gates or inter-QPU entangled links is often inadequate to predict the output fidelity from a quantum circuit and infer that an improved understanding of error propagation during distributed quantum circuits may represent a significant optimisation opportunity for compilation.</description>

      <title>CUAOA: A Novel CUDA-Accelerated Simulation Framework for the QAOA</title>

Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a prominent quantum algorithm designed to find approximate solutions to combinatorial optimization problems, which are challenging for classical computers. In the current era, where quantum hardware is constrained by noise and limited qubit availability, simulating the QAOA remains essential for research. However, existing state-of-the-art simulation frameworks suffer from long execution times or lack comprehensive functionality, usability, and versatility, often requiring users to implement essential features themselves. Additionally, these frameworks are primarily restricted to Python, limiting their use in safer and faster languages like Rust, which offer, e.g., advanced parallelization capabilities. In this paper, we develop a GPU accelerated QAOA simulation framework utilizing the NVIDIA CUDA toolkit. This framework offers a complete interface for QAOA simulations, enabling the calculation of (exact) expectation values, direct access to the statevector, fast sampling, and high-performance optimization methods using an advanced state-of-the-art gradient calculation technique. The framework is designed for use in Python and Rust, providing flexibility for integration into a wide range of applications, including those requiring fast algorithm implementations leveraging QAOA at its core. The new framework's performance is rigorously benchmarked on the MaxCut problem and compared against the current state-of-the-art general-purpose quantum circuit simulation frameworks Qiskit and Pennylane as well as the specialized QAOA simulation tool QOKit. Our evaluation shows that our approach outperforms the existing state-of-the-art solutions in terms of runtime up to multiple orders of magnitude. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/JFLXB/cuaoa and Zenodo.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Multipartite Entanglement Structure of Non-Gaussian Continuous-Variable States with a Single Evolution Operator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12554v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multipartite entanglement is an essential resource for quantum information tasks, but characterizing entanglement structures in continuous variable systems remains challenging, especially in multimode non-Gaussian scenarios. In this work, we introduce an efficient method for detecting multipartite entanglement structures in continuous-variable states. Based on the quantum Fisher information, we propose a systematic approach to identify an optimal encoding operator that can capture the quantum correlations in multimode non-Gaussian states. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on over $10^5$ randomly generated multimode-entangled quantum states, achieving a very high success rate in entanglement detection. Additionally, the robustness of our method can be considerably enhanced against losses by expanding the set of accessible operators. This work provides a general framework for characterizing entanglement structures in diverse continuous variable systems, enabling a number of experimentally relevant applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum calculus with two bases, as powers of the Golden and the Silver ratio, relates Fibonacci divisor derivative with Binet formula of Fibonacci divisor number operator, acting in Fock space of quantum states.It provides a tool to study the hierarchy of Golden oscillators with energy spectrum in form of Fibonacci divisor numbers. We generalize this model to supersymmetric number operator and corresponding Binet formula for supersymmetric Fibonacci divisor number operator. The operator determines the Hamiltonian of hierarchy of supersymmetric Golden oscillators, acting in fermion-boson Hilbert space and belonging to N=2 supersymmetric algebra. The eigenstates of the super Fibonacci divisor number operator are double degenerate and can be characterized by a point on the super-Bloch sphere. By the supersymmetric Fibonacci divisor annihilation operator, we construct the hierarchy of supersymmetric coherent states as eigenstates of this operator. Entanglement of fermions with bosons in these states is calculated by the concurrence, represented by the Gram determinant and hierarchy of Golden exponential functions. We show that the reference states and corresponding von Neumann entropy, measuring fermion-boson entanglement, are characterized completely by the powers of the Golden ratio. The simple geometrical classification of entangled states by the Frobenius ball and meaning of the concurrence as double area of parallelogram in Hilbert space are given.</description>

Abstract: Understanding how macroscopic systems exhibit irreversible thermal behavior has been a long-standing challenge, first brought to prominence by Boltzmann. Recent advances have established rigorous conditions for isolated quantum systems to equilibrate to a maximum entropy state, contingent upon weak assumptions. These theorems, while powerful, apply for a sudden quench. However, natural processes involve finite-time perturbations or quenches, which raises a crucial question: Can these systems still equilibrate under more realistic, finite-time dynamics? In this work, we extend the established results to account for finite-time quenches, demonstrating that even under finite-time perturbations, the system will equilibrate provided it populates many significant energy levels. While the mathematical proof is more intricate than in the instantaneous case, the physical conclusion remains the same: sufficient perturbation leads to equilibration. Our results provide a broader and more physically realistic framework for understanding thermalization in isolated quantum systems</description>

      <title>Thermalization and hydrodynamic long-time tails in a Floquet system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We systematically investigate whether classical hydrodynamic field theories can predict the long-time dynamics of many-particle quantum systems. As an example, we investigate numerically and analytically the time evolution of a chain of spins (or qubits) subject to a stroboscopic dynamics. The time evolution is implemented by a sequence of local and nearest-neighbor gates which conserve the total magnetization. The long-time dynamics of such a system is believed to be describable by a hydrodynamics field theory, which, importantly, includes the effect of noise. Based on a field theoretical analysis and symmetry arguments, we map each operator in the spin model to corresponding fields in hydrodynamics. This allows us to predict which expectation values decay exponentially, and which of them decay with a hydrodynamics long-time tail. We illustrate these findings by studying the time evolution of all 255 Hermitian operators which can be defined on four neighboring sites. We show that all operators not protected by hydrodynamics decay exponentially and investigate a selected set of slowly decaying operators.</description>

      <title>Optimal estimates of trace distance between bosonic Gaussian states and applications to learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gaussian states of bosonic quantum systems enjoy numerous technological applications and are ubiquitous in nature. Their significance lies in their simplicity, which in turn rests on the fact that they are uniquely determined by two experimentally accessible quantities, their first and second moments. But what if these moments are only known approximately, as is inevitable in any realistic experiment? What is the resulting error on the Gaussian state itself, as measured by the most operationally meaningful metric for distinguishing quantum states, namely, the trace distance? In this work, we fully resolve this question by demonstrating that if the first and second moments are known up to an error $\varepsilon$, the trace distance error on the state also scales as $\varepsilon$, and this functional dependence is optimal. To prove this, we establish tight bounds on the trace distance between two Gaussian states in terms of the norm distance of their first and second moments. As an application, we improve existing bounds on the sample complexity of tomography of Gaussian states.</description>

Abstract: Quantum machine learning is considered one of the current research fields with immense potential. In recent years, Havl\'i\v{c}ek et al. [Nature 567, 209-212 (2019)] have proposed a quantum machine learning algorithm with quantum-enhanced feature spaces, which effectively addressed a binary classification problem on a superconducting processor and offered a potential pathway to achieving quantum advantage. However, a straightforward binary classification algorithm falls short in solving multiclass classification problems. In this paper, we propose a quantum algorithm that rigorously demonstrates that quantum kernel methods enhance the efficiency of multiclass classification in real-world applications, providing quantum advantage. To demonstrate quantum advantage, we design six distinct quantum kernels within the quantum algorithm to map input data into quantum state spaces and estimate the corresponding quantum kernel matrices. The results from quantum simulations reveal that the quantum algorithm outperforms its classical counterpart in handling six real-world multiclass classification problems. Furthermore, we leverage a variety of performance metrics to comprehensively evaluate the classification and generalization performance of the quantum algorithm. The results demonstrate that the quantum algorithm achieves superior classification and better generalization performance relative to classical counterparts.</description>

      <title>Efficient Classical Computation of Single-Qubit Marginal Measurement Probabilities to Simulate Certain Classes of Quantum Algorithms</title>

Abstract: Classical simulations of quantum circuits are essential for verifying and benchmarking quantum algorithms, particularly for large circuits, where computational demands increase exponentially with the number of qubits. Among available methods, the classical simulation of quantum circuits inspired by density functional theory -- the so-called QC-DFT method, shows promise for large circuit simulations as it approximates the quantum circuits using single-qubit reduced density matrices to model multi-qubit systems. However, the QC-DFT method performs very poorly when dealing with multi-qubit gates. In this work, we introduce a novel CNOT "functional" that leverages neural networks to generate unitary transformations, effectively mitigating the simulation errors observed in the original QC-DFT method. For random circuit simulations, our modified QC-DFT enables efficient computation of single-qubit marginal measurement probabilities, or single-qubit probability (SQPs), and achieves lower SQP errors and higher fidelities than the original QC-DFT method. Despite some limitations in capturing full entanglement and joint probability distributions, we find potential applications of SQPs in simulating Shor's and Grover's algorithms for specific solution classes. These findings advance the capabilities of classical simulations for some quantum problems and provide insights into managing entanglement and gate errors in practical quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Universal graph representation of stabilizer codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a representation of $[[n, k]]$ stabilizer codes as semi-bipartite graphs wherein $k$ ``input'' nodes map to $n$ ``output'' nodes, such that output nodes may connect to each other but input nodes may not. We prove that this graph representation is in bijection with tableaus and give an efficient compilation algorithm that transforms tableaus into graphs. We then show that this map is efficiently invertible, which gives a new universal recipe for code construction by way of finding graphs with sufficiently nice properties.
  The graph representation gives insight into both code construction and algorithms. To the former, we argue that graphs provide a flexible platform for building codes particularly at smaller (non-asymptotic) scales. We construct as examples constant-size codes, e.g. a $[[54, 6, 5]]$ code and a family of roughly $[[n, \frac{n}{\log n}, \log n]]$ codes. We also leverage graphs in a probabilistic analysis to extend the quantum Gilbert-Varshamov bound into a three-way distance-rate-weight tradeoff. To the latter, we show that key coding algorithms -- distance approximation, weight reduction, and decoding -- are unified as instances of a single optimization game on a graph. Moreover, key code properties such as distance, weight, and encoding circuit depth, are all controlled by the graph degree. We give efficient algorithms for producing simple encoding circuits whose depths scale as twice the degree and for implementing logical diagonal and certain Clifford gates with non-constant but reduced depth. Finally, we construct a simple efficient decoding algorithm and prove a performance guarantee for a certain class of graphs, including the roughly $[[n, \frac{n}{\log n}, \log n]]$ code. These results give evidence that graphs are generically useful for the study of stabilizer codes and their practical implementations.</description>

Abstract: We study the dynamics of entanglement asymmetry in periodically driven quantum systems. Using a periodically driven XY chain as a model for a driven integrable quantum system, we provide semi-analytic results for the behavior of the dynamics of the entanglement asymmetry, $\Delta S$, as a function of the drive frequency. Our analysis identifies special drive frequencies at which the driven XY chain exhibits dynamic symmetry restoration and displays quantum Mpemba effect over a long timescale; we identify an emergent approximate symmetry in its Floquet Hamiltonian which plays a crucial role for realization of both these phenomena. We follow these results by numerical computation of $\Delta S$ for the non-integrable driven Rydberg atom chain and obtain similar emergent-symmetry-induced symmetry restoration and quantum Mpemba effect in the prethermal regime for such a system. Finally, we provide an exact analytic computation of the entanglement asymmetry for a periodically driven conformal field theory (CFT) on a strip. Such a driven CFT, depending on the drive amplitude and frequency, exhibits two distinct phases, heating and non-heating, that are separated by a critical line. Our results show that for $m$ cycles of a periodic drive with time period $T$, $\Delta S \sim \ln mT$ [$\ln (\ln mT)$] in the heating phase [on the critical line] for a generic CFT; in contrast, in the non-heating phase, $\Delta S$ displays small amplitude oscillations around it's initial value as a function of $mT$. We provide a phase diagram for the behavior of $\Delta S$ for such driven CFTs as a function of the drive frequency and amplitude.</description>

Abstract: Enhancing the precision of a thermodynamic process inevitably necessitates a thermodynamic cost, a principle formulated as the thermodynamic uncertainty relation. The thermodynamic uncertainty relation states that the relative variance of thermodynamic currents, calculated as the variance divided by the squared mean, decreases as entropy production increases. This means that if entropy production were allowed to become infinitely large, the relative variance could approach zero. However, it is evident that realizing infinitely large entropy production is infeasible in reality. In this Letter, we establish the ultimate limits of precision for open quantum thermal machines operating within a finite-dimensional system and environment. We derive bounds on the relative variance and the expectation of observables, applicable to any unitary evolution of the composite system. These bounds are governed by the \textit{minimum eigenvalue factor}, which serves as a maximal entropy production attainable by the quantum dynamics and parallels the concept of dynamical activity in classical stochastic thermodynamic. Additionally, we investigate how quantum coherence in the initial environmental state affects these fundamental bounds, showing that the presence of coherence can actually improve the ultimate precision limits. Our findings provide insights into fundamental limits on the precision of quantum thermal machines and the role of quantum effects in thermodynamic processes.</description>

Abstract: Quantum reservoirs have great potential as they utilize the complex real-time dissipative dynamics of quantum systems for information processing and target time-series generation without precise control or fine-tuning of the Hamiltonian parameters. Nonetheless, their realization is challenging as quantum hardware with appropriate dynamics, robustness to noise, and ability to produce target steady states is required. To that end, we propose the disordered quantum homogenizer as an alternative platform, and prove it satisfies the necessary and sufficient conditions - stability and contractivity - of the reservoir dynamics, necessary for solving machine learning tasks with time-series input data streams. The results indicate that the quantum homogenization protocol, physically implementable as either nuclear magnetic resonance ensemble or a photonic system, can potentially function as a reservoir computer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the most unconventional features of topological phases of matter is the emergence of quasiparticles with exotic statistics, such as non-Abelian anyons in two dimensional systems. Recently, a different type of exotic particle statistics that is consistently defined in any dimension, called parastatistics, is also shown to be possible in a special family of topological phases. However, the physical significance of emergent parastatistics still remains elusive. Here we demonstrate a distinctive physical consequence of parastatistics by proposing a challenge game that can only be won using physical systems hosting paraparticles, as passing the challenge requires the two participating players to secretly communicate in an indirect way by exploiting the nontrivial exchange statistics of the quasiparticles. The winning strategy using emergent paraparticles is robust against noise, as well as the most relevant class of eavesdropping via local measurements. This provides both an operational definition and an experimental identity test for paraparticles, alongside a potential application in secret communication.</description>

      <title>99.9%-fidelity in measuring a superconducting qubit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the significant progress in superconducting quantum computation over the past years, quantum state measurement still lags nearly an order of magnitude behind quantum gate operations in speed and fidelity. The main challenge is that the strong coupling and readout signal used to probe the quantum state may also introduce additional channels which may cause qubit state transitions. Here, we design a novel architecture to implement the long-sought longitudinal interaction scheme between qubits and resonators. This architecture not only provides genuine longitudinal interaction by eliminating residual transversal couplings, but also introduces proper nonlinearity to the resonator that can further minimize decay error and measurement-induced excitation error. Our experimental results demonstrate a measurement fidelity of 99.8% in 202 ns without the need for any first-stage amplification. After subtracting the residual preparation errors, the pure measurement fidelity is above 99.9%. Our scheme is compatible with the multiplexing readout scheme and can be used for quantum error correction.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic hybrid magnonic circuits based on spalled YIG thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10660v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Yttrium iron garnet (YIG) magnonics has garnered significant research interest because of the unique properties of magnons (quasiparticles of collective spin excitation) for signal processing. In particular, hybrid systems based on YIG magnonics show great promise for quantum information science due to their broad frequency tunability and strong compatibility with other platforms. However, their broad applications have been severely constrained by substantial microwave loss in the gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) substrate at cryogenic temperatures. In this study, we demonstrate that YIG thin films can be spalled from YIG/GGG samples. Our approach is validated by measuring hybrid devices comprising superconducting resonators and spalled YIG films, which exhibits anti-crossing features that indicate strong coupling between magnons and microwave photons. Such new capability of separating YIG thin films from GGG substrates via spalling, and the integrated superconductor-YIG devices represent a significant advancement for integrated magnonic devices, paving the way for advanced magnon-based coherent information processing.</description>

      <title>Individual Addressing and State Readout of Trapped Ions Utilizing Radio-Frequency Micromotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Excess "micromotion" of trapped ions due to the residual radio-frequency (rf) trapping field at their location is often undesirable and is usually carefully minimized. Here, we induce precise amounts of excess micromotion on individual ions by adjusting the local static electric field they experience. Micromotion modulates the coupling of an ion to laser fields, ideally tuning it from its maximum value to zero as the ion is moved away from the trap's rf null. We use tunable micromotion to vary the Rabi frequency of stimulated Raman transitions over two orders of magnitude, and to individually control the rates of resonant fluorescence from three ions under global laser illumination without any changes to the driving light fields. The technique is amenable to situations where addressing individual ions with focused laser beams is challenging, such as tightly packed linear ion strings or two-dimensional ion arrays illuminated from the side.</description>

      <title>Quantum entanglement and Bell inequality violation at colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07972v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of entanglement in particle physics has been gathering pace in the past few years. It is a new field that is providing important results about the possibility of detecting entanglement and testing Bell inequality at colliders for final states as diverse as top-quark, $\tau$-lepton pairs and $\Lambda$-baryons, massive gauge bosons and vector mesons. In this review, after presenting definitions, tools and basic results that are necessary for understanding these developments, we summarize the main findings -- as published by the beginning of year 2024 -- including analyses of experimental data in $B$ meson decays and top-quark pair production. We include a detailed discussion of the results for both qubit and qutrits systems, that is, final states containing spin one-half and spin one particles. Entanglement has also been proposed as a new tool to constrain new particles and fields beyond the Standard Model and we introduce the reader to this promising feature as well.</description>

      <title>Quantum reference frames, measurement schemes and the type of local algebras in quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop an operational framework, combining relativistic quantum measurement theory with quantum reference frames (QRFs), in which local measurements of a quantum field on a background with symmetries are performed relative to a QRF. This yields a joint algebra of quantum-field and reference-frame observables that is invariant under the natural action of the group of spacetime isometries. For the appropriate class of quantum reference frames, this algebra is parameterised in terms of crossed products. Provided that the quantum field has good thermal properties (expressed by the existence of a KMS state at some nonzero temperature), one can use modular theory to show that the invariant algebra admits a semifinite trace. If furthermore the quantum reference frame has good thermal behaviour (expressed in terms of the properties of a KMS weight) at the same temperature, this trace is finite. We give precise conditions for the invariant algebra of physical observables to be a type $II_1$ factor. Our results build upon recent work of Chandrasekaran, Longo, Penington and Witten [JHEP $\mathbf{2023}$, 82 (2023)], providing both a significant mathematical generalisation of these findings and a refined operational understanding of their model.</description>

      <title>Rigged Hilbert Space formulation for quasi-Hermitian composite systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discussion in this study delves into Dirac's bra-ket formalism for a quasi-Hermitian quantum composite system based on the rigged Hilbert space (RHS). We establish an RHS with a positive definite metric suitable for a quasi-Hermite composite system. The obtained RHS is utilized to construct the bra and ket vectors for the non-Hermite composite system and produce the spectral decomposition of the quasi-Hermitian operator. We show that the symmetric relations regarding quasi-Hermitian operators can be extended to dual spaces, and all descriptions obtained using the bra-ket formalism are completely developed in the dual spaces. Our methodology is applied to a non-Hermitian harmonic oscillator composed of conformal multi-dimensional many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Generalized Hertz action and quantum criticality of two-dimensional Fermi systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We reassess the structure of the effective action and quantum critical singularities of two-dimensional Fermi systems characterized by the ordering wavevector $\vec{Q}= \vec{0}$. By employing infrared cutoffs on all the massless degrees of freedom, we derive a generalized form of the Hertz action, which does not suffer from problems of singular effective interactions. We demonstrate that the Wilsonian momentum-shell renormalization group (RG) theory capturing the infrared scaling should be formulated keeping $\vec{Q}$ as a flowing, scale-dependent quantity. At the quantum critical point, scaling controlled by the dynamical exponent $z=3$ is overshadowed by a broad scaling regime characterized by a lower value of $z \approx 2$. This in particular offers an explanation of the results of quantum Monte Carlo simulations pertinent to the electronic nematic quantum critical point.</description>

      <title>Ultralight dark matter detection with levitated ferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15330v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Levitated ferromagnets act as ultraprecise magnetometers, which can exhibit high quality factors due to their excellent isolation from the environment. These instruments can be utilized in searches for ultralight dark matter candidates, such as axionlike dark matter or dark-photon dark matter. In addition to being sensitive to an axion-photon coupling or kinetic mixing, which produce physical magnetic fields, ferromagnets are also sensitive to the effective magnetic field (or "axion wind") produced by an axion-electron coupling. While the dynamics of a levitated ferromagnet in response to a DC magnetic field have been well studied, all of these couplings would produce AC fields. In this work, we study the response of a ferromagnet to an applied AC magnetic field and use these results to project their sensitivity to axion and dark-photon dark matter. We pay special attention to the direction of motion induced by an applied AC field, in particular, whether it precesses around the applied field (similar to an electron spin) or librates in the plane of the field (similar to a compass needle). We show that existing levitated ferromagnet setups can already have comparable sensitivity to an axion-electron coupling as comagnetometer or torsion balance experiments. In addition, future setups can become sensitive probes of axion-electron coupling, dark-photon kinetic mixing, and axion-photon coupling, for ultralight dark matter masses $m_\mathrm{DM}\lesssim\mathrm{feV}$.</description>

      <title>Boundaries of universality of thermal collisions for atom-atom scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermal rate coefficients for some atomic collisions have been observed to be remarkably independent of the details of interatomic interactions at short range. This makes these rate coefficients universal functions of the long-range interaction parameters and masses, which was previously exploited to develop a self-defining atomic sensor for ambient pressure. Here, we employ rigorous quantum scattering calculations to examine the response of thermally averaged rate coefficients for atom-atom collisions to changes in the interaction potentials. We perform a comprehensive analysis of the universality, and the boundaries thereof, by treating the quantum scattering observables as probabilistic predictions determined by a distribution of interaction potentials. We show that there is a characteristic change of the resulting distributions of rate coefficients, separating light, few-electron atoms and heavy, polarizable atoms. We produce diagrams that illustrate the boundaries of the thermal collision universality at different temperatures and provide guidance for future experiments seeking to exploit the universality.</description>

      <title>Formation, Prevalence, and Stability of Bouncing-Ball Scars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07709v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum scars correspond to enhanced probability densities along unstable classical periodic orbits. In recent years, research on quantum scars has extended to various systems including the many-body regime. In this work we focus on the formation, prevalence, and stability of linear "bouncing-ball" (BB) scars in two-dimensional (2D) quantum wells. These scars have relevance as effective and controllable channels in quantum transport. We utilize imaginary time propagation to solve the 2D Schr\"odinger equation within an arbitrary external confining potential, specifically the quantum well model with external perturbations. We show how BB scars begin to emerge with a single perturbative peak, such as a repulsive bump or attractive dip that simulates the effect of a charged nanotip in the system. We then identify the optimal size of the perturbative peak to maximize the prevalence of these scars. Finally, we investigate the stability of BB scars against external noise and find that some of them are remarkably robust. This suggests promising opportunities for further applications of BB scars in quantum transport.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional quantum dynamics with explicitly correlated Gaussian wave packets using Rothe's method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a previous publication [J. Chem. Phys., 161, 044105 (2024)], it has been shown that Rothe's method can be used to solve the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation (TDSE) for the hydrogen atom in a strong laser field using time-dependent Gaussian wave packets. Here, we generalize these results, showing that Rothe's method can propagate arbitrary numbers of thawed, complex-valued, explicitly correlated Gaussian functions (ECGs) with dense correlation matrices for systems with varying dimensionality. We consider the multidimensional Henon-Heiles potential, and show that the dynamics can be quantitatively reproduced using only 30 Gaussians in 2D, and that accurate spectra can be obtained using 20 Gaussians in 2D and 30 to 40 Gaussians in 3D and 4D. Thus, the relevant multidimensional dynamics can be described at high quality using only a small number of ECGs that give a very compact representation of the wave function. This efficient representation, along with the demonstrated ability of Rothe's method to propagate Gaussian wave packets in strong fields and ECGs in complex potentials, paves the way for accurate molecular dynamics calculations beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation in strong fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This collection of perspective pieces captures recent advancements and reflections from a dynamic research community dedicated to bridging quantum gravity, hydrodynamics, and emergent cosmology. It explores four key research areas: (a) the interplay between hydrodynamics and cosmology, including analog gravity systems; (b) phase transitions, continuum limits and emergent geometry in quantum gravity; (c) relational perspectives in gravity and quantum gravity; and (d) the emergence of cosmological models rooted in quantum gravity frameworks. Each contribution presents the distinct perspectives of its respective authors. Additionally, the introduction by the editors proposes an integrative view, suggesting how these thematic units could serve as foundational pillars for a novel theoretical cosmology framework termed "hydrodynamics on superspace".</description>

      <title>Interaction-induced phase transitions and critical phases in nonreciprocal non-Hermitian quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian phenomena, such as exceptional points, non-Hermitian skin effects, and topologically nontrivial phases, have attracted continued attention. In this work, we reveal how interactions and nonreciprocal hopping could collectively influence the behavior of two interacting bosons on quasiperiodic lattices. Focusing on the Bose-Hubbard model with Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper quasiperiodic modulations and hopping asymmetry, we discover that the interaction could enlarge the localization transition point of the noninteracting system into a critical phase, in which localized doublons formed by bosonic pairs can coexist with delocalized states. Under the open boundary condition, the bosonic doublons could further show non-Hermitian skin effects, realizing doublon condensation at the edges, and their direction of skin-localization can be flexibly tuned by the hopping parameters. A framework is developed to characterize the spectral, localization, and topological transitions accompanying these phenomena. Our work advances the understanding of localization and topological phases in non-Hermitian systems, particularly in relation to multiparticle interactions.</description>
