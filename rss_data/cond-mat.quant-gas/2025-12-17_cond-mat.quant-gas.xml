      <title>Interferometric probe for the zeros of the many-body wavefunction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nodal surfaces of the many-body wavefunction are fundamental geometric features that encode critical information regarding particle statistics and their interaction. Directly probing these structures, particularly in correlated quantum systems, remains a significant experimental challenge. Here, we provide rigorous results on the structure of the many-body wavefunction and propose to use an interferometric technique to probe its zeros in ultra-cold atomic systems. Specifically, we refer to the so-called heterodyne interferometric reconstruction of the phase of the many-body wavefunction. We prove that the sought nodal surfaces show up as specific discontinuities in the interference fringes. Following Leggett, both `symmetry-dictated' nodal surfaces, due to particle statistics, and `non-symmetry dictated' nodal surfaces emerging from interaction effects, can be probed. We demonstrate how the spin degrees of freedom, effectively modifying the structure of the nodal surfaces of the many-body wavefunction, leave distinct fingerprints in the resulting interference pattern. Our work addresses important features of the structure of the many-body wavefunction that are broadly relevant for quantum science ranging from conceptual aspects to computational questions of extended systems and quantum simulation.</description>

      <title>From Bose glass to many-body localization in a one-dimensional disordered Bose gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the finite-temperature phase diagram of a one-dimensional disordered Bose gas using bosonization and the nonperturbative functional renormalization group (RG). We discuss two different scenarios, based on distinct truncations of the effective action. In the first scenario, the Bose glass is destabilized at any finite temperature, giving rise to a normal fluid. Nevertheless, one can distinguish a low-temperature glassy regime, where disorder plays an important role on intermediate length and time scales, from a high-temperature regime, where disorder becomes irrelevant. In the second scenario, below a temperature $T_c$, the RG flow exhibits a singularity at a finite value of the RG momentum scale. We propose that this singularity signals a lack of thermalization and the existence of a localized phase for $T&lt;T_c$. We provide a description of this low-temperature localized phase within a droplet picture and highlight a number of possible similarities with characteristics of many-body localized phases, including non-thermal behavior, avalanche instabilities and many-body resonances, the structure of the many-body spectrum, and slow dynamics in the ergodic phase. The normal fluid above $T_c$, and below a crossover temperature $T_g$, exhibits glassy properties on intermediate scales.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle projection method for dynamically unstable Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general formalism for performing a time-dependent Bogoliubov analysis of a dynamically unstable Bose-Einstein condensate, which extends the quasiparticle projection method of Morgan et al. [Phys. Rev. A 57, 3818 (1998)] to cases with a complex spectrum. By introducing the proper left eigenvectors associated with each regime, we construct a biorthogonal basis. While the usual Bogoliubov normalization $\langle u | u \rangle - \langle v | v \rangle = 1$ may not hold in this basis, it still allows for a complete mode decomposition and an accurate reconstruction of arbitrary perturbations over time. This approach extends the applicability of the Bogoliubov framework beyond the stable regime, providing a consistent analysis of the time evolution of unstable condensates. As a proof of concept, we apply the method to a one-dimensional condensate with attractive interactions, which is dynamically unstable and evolves into nonstationary localized structures seeded by small perturbations.</description>

      <title>Shell-shaped Bose-Einstein condensates: Dynamics, excitations, and thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shell-shaped Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) represent a paradigmatic instance of quantum fluids in hollow geometries exhibiting phenomena that bridge from ultracold atomic to astrophysical realms. In this work, we present a comprehensive survey of the dynamics, thermodynamics, and collective excitations of shell-shaped BECs, synthesizing two decades of our group's theoretical work in light of recent experimental breakthroughs. We begin by analyzing the evolution of a BEC from filled-sphere to hollow-shell geometries, illustrating the necessity of microgravity conditions to avoid gravitational sag. We then analyze collective modes structure across this evolution and pinpoint a universal dip in the frequency spectra as well as mode reconfiguration due to inner-surface excitations as robust signatures of the hollowing-out transition. Turning to vortex physics, we show that the closed-surface topology enforces vortex-antivortex configurations in shell-shaped BECs and that the natural annihilation of these pairs can be stabilized by rotation, with the critical rotation rate depending on shell thickness. In the thermodynamic domain, we investigate the interplay between shell inflation and the BEC phase transition, where adiabatic expansions lead to condensate depletion. This behavior motivates a study of the nonequilibrium dynamics of shell-shaped BECs; we perform such a study by constructing a time-dependent dynamic technique that can capture the evolution in both adiabatice and non-adiabatic regimes. Finally, we review recent experimental realizations of shell-shaped BECs, including the landmark creation of ultracold shells aboard the International Space Station, and outline prospects for exploring quantum fluids in curved geometries.</description>

      <title>Quantum fields in a cold atomic simulator: relaxation and phase locking in tunnel-coupled 1D bosonic quasi-condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a prime example of simulating interacting relativistic QFT with cold atoms: the realisation of the sine-Gordon model by tunnel-coupled quasi-1D Bose gases. While experiments have shown that it can realise the sine-Gordon model in equilibrium, studies of non-equilibrium dynamics have revealed a phase-locking behaviour that stands in contrast to predictions from sine-Gordon field theory. Here, we examine a one-dimensional field-theoretic model of the system and find that the phase-locking behaviour can be understood in terms of the presence of the longitudinal harmonic trap, and that the additional degrees of freedom known to be present in the experiment do not appear to play a significant role. Therefore, the experimental setup provides a good simulator of the sine-Gordon quantum field theory, even out of equilibrium, if the inhomogeneous background induced by the trap is taken into account. Furthermore, our results support the idea that modifying the longitudinal trap to a box shape should result in agreement with standard sine-Gordon dynamics. The main remaining open issues are to account for 3D corrections and model the effect of the boundaries.</description>

      <title>Spin Faraday Waves in Periodically Modulated Spin-Orbit-Coupled Bose Gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the formation of Spin Faraday waves in spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensate under the stripe phase and explores the dispersion relation under three different phases. We discover that the SFW exhibit temporal and spatial patterns when the interaction is modulated periodically, and appear with resonant waves and higher order harmonics. SFW can be excited even when the modulation frequency resonates with the trap frequency. Furthermore, we study the dispersion relation of these Faraday modes through periodic modulation, which agrees well with our theoretical results under three quantum phases. Our work indicates novel physical phenomena originating from the introduction of spin-orbit coupling and provides a possible method for studying the dispersion of Bose gases.</description>

      <title>Dipolar quantum gases: from 3D to Low dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dipolar quantum gases, encompassing atoms and molecules with significant dipole moments, exhibit unique long-range and anisotropic dipole-dipole interactions (DDI), distinguishing them from systems dominated by short-range contact interactions. This review explores their behavior across dimensions, focusing on magnetic atoms in quasi-2D in comparison to 3D. In 3D, strong DDI leads to phenomena like anisotropic superfluidity, quantum droplets stabilized by Lee-Huang-Yang corrections, and supersolid states with density modulations. In 2D, we discuss a new scenario where DDI induces angle-dependent Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions and potential supersolidity, as suggested by recent experimental realizations of strongly dipolar systems in quasi-2D geometries. We identify key challenges for future experimental and theoretical work on strongly dipolar 2D systems. The review concludes by highlighting how these unique 2D dipolar systems could advance fundamental research as well as simulate novel physical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Leggett's bound and superfluidity in strongly interacting bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A density-based superfluid bound called Leggett's bound has been proved to be a good estimator of the superfluid fraction for cold atomic gases in the mean-field regime. Here, we investigate the accuracy of such bound in the strongly interacting regime, where the mean-field approach fails. Combining quantum Monte Carlo, Gross-Pitaevskii equation and field-theory calculations, we demonstrate that the bound serves as a reliable estimator of the superfluid fraction for strongly interacting bosons at 2D-1D dimensional crossover at low temperatures. By further presenting two counterexamples where the bound predicts trivial results, we shed light on the conditions under which the Leggett's bound serves as a good predictor.</description>

      <title>From few- to many-body physics: Strongly dipolar molecular Bose-Einstein condensates and quantum fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in molecular cooling have enabled the realization of strongly dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) of molecules, and BECs of many different molecular species may become experimentally accessible in the near future. Here, we explore the unique properties of such BECs and the new insights they may offer into dipolar quantum fluids and many-body physics. We explore which parameter regimes can realistically be achieved using currently available experimental techniques, discuss how to implement these techniques, and outline which molecular species are particularly well suited to explore exotic new states of matter. We further determine how state-of-the-art beyond mean-field theories, originally developed for weakly dipolar magnetic gases, can be pushed to their limits and beyond, and what other long-standing questions in the field of dipolar physics may realistically come within reach using molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation using Trotterized disorder Hamiltonians in a single-mode optical cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: All-to-all interacting and disordered many-body systems are notoriously hard to simulate on quantum platforms, as interactions are commonly mediated by auxiliary degrees of freedom that lower the amount of disorder, introducing undesired correlations. In this work, we show how a Trotterization scheme can be effectively utilized to densify the disorder of the model. In particular, we study the statistical properties of the resulting model, as well as Trotterization errors in the simulation that affect the time evolution and dynamical observables. As a concrete example, we propose an implementation via a single-mode cavity QED platform of the complex Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. We analyze several features of the effective model, such as the distribution of the effective couplings, the number of interacting sites, state preparation, and the behavior of quantum chaos probes. We conclude this work with a detailed investigation of the robustness of our findings against dissipation, both analytically and numerically.</description>

      <title>Discrete time crystals enabled by Floquet strong Hilbert space fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrete time crystals (DTCs) are non-equilibrium phases of matter that break the discrete time-translation symmetry and is characterized by a robust subharmonic response in periodically driven quantum systems. Here, we explore the DTC in a disorder-free, periodically kicked XXZ spin chain, which is stabilized by the Floquet strong Hilbert space fragmentation. We numerically show the period-doubling response of the conventional DTC order, and uncover a multiple-period response with beating dynamics due to the coherent interplay of multiple $\pi$-pairs in the Floquet spectrum of small-size systems. The lifetime of the DTC order exhibits independence of the driving frequency and a power-law dependence on the ZZ interaction strength. It also grows exponentially with the system size, as a hallmark of the strong fragmentation inherent to the Floquet model. We analytically reveal the approximate conservation of the magnetization and domain-wall number in the Floquet operator for the emergent strong fragmentation, which is consistent with numerical results of the dimensionality ratio of symmetry subspaces. The rigidity and phase regime of the DTC order are identified through finite-size scaling of the Floquet-spectrum-averaged mutual information, as well as via dynamical probes. Our work establishes the Floquet Hilbert space fragmentation as a disorder-free mechanism for sustaining nontrivial temporal orders in out-of-equilibrium quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analogue gravity explores how collective excitations in condensed matter systems can reproduce the behavior of fields in curved spacetimes. An important example is the acoustic black holes that can occur for sound in a moving fluid. In these lecture notes, we focus on atomic Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), quantum fluids that provide an interesting platform for analogue gravity studies thanks to their accurate theoretical description, remarkable experimental control, and ultralow temperatures that allow the quantum nature of sound to emerge. We give a pedagogical introduction to analogue black holes and the theoretical description of BECs and their elementary excitations, which behave as quantum fields in curved spacetimes. We then apply these tools to survey the current understanding of black-hole superradiance and analogue Hawking radiation, including explicit examples and numerical methods.</description>

      <title>Engineering Zeeman-manifold quintets using state-dependent light shifts in neutral atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general method for engineering qudits through individually addressable transitions between Zeeman sublevels, achieved by combining a large linear Zeeman shift with a state-dependent light shift. This approach lifts the degeneracy between adjacent states while simultaneously tuning their energy splittings into the radio-frequency (RF) domain, enabling coherent manipulation within the Zeeman manifold using experimentally accessible drive frequencies. As a concrete realization, we investigate the implementation of an $SU(5)$ \emph{quintet} encoded in the Zeeman sublevels of the long-lived $^3\mathrm{P}_2$ state of neutral $\mathrm{^{88}Sr}$ atoms confined in far-detuned, $\sigma^{-}$-polarized optical tweezers. Using realistic experimental parameters, we numerically demonstrate full control of the \emph{quintet} manifold, including initialization into a specific $SU(5)$ basis state via a multi-photon transfer, coherent state- and site-selective single-qudit rotations driven by RF fields, and fast state-selective optical readout. Our simulations predict state-preparation fidelities of $\mathcal{F} \simeq 0.99$ within $\sim 1~\mu \rm{s}$, single-qudit gate fidelities of $\mathcal{F} \simeq 0.99$ with $\pi$-pulse durations of $\sim 2.5~\mu \rm{s}$, and fast destructive imaging with durations below $10~\mu \rm{s}$. These results establish a broadly applicable framework for high-fidelity control of Zeeman sublevel-encoded qudits and highlight the $^3\mathrm{P}_2$ manifold in strontium as a promising platform for scalable qudit-based quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Coherent Transport in Two-Dimensional Disordered Potentials under Spatially Uniform SU(2) Gauge Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study interference effects in the dynamics of a spin $1/2$ particle propagating in two dimensions in a disordered potential and subject to a generalized spin-orbit coupling. With the particle initially in a spin-polarized plane wave state, in the short-time regime, before the spin and momentum distributions reach their steady states, we observe a transient backscattering peak offset from the exact backscattering direction, coexisting with a coherent backscattering dip. We present an intuitive explanation of this momentum offset using a non-Abelian gauge transformation. We also describe the full time evolution of the transient peak, from its buildup to its decay with a precise prediction of the dephasing time within a perturbative framework for multiple scattering. Our results can be applied to general spatially uniform SU(2) gauge fields, including the synthetic gauge field in ultracold atoms.</description>

Abstract: We calculate the spin correlations that result from the motion of a single dopant in the hard-core Fermi-Hubbard model, as the geometry evolves from a square to a triangular lattice. In particular, we consider the square lattice with an additional hopping along one diagonal, whose strength is continuously varied. We use a high-temperature expansion which expresses the partition function as a sum over closed paths taken by the dopant. We sample thousands of diagrams in the space of closed paths using the quantum Monte Carlo approach of Raghavan and Elser [1,2], which is free of finite-size effects and allows us to simulate temperatures as low as $T \sim 0.3|t|$, even in cases where there is a sign problem. For the case of a hole dopant, we find a crossover from kinetic ferromagnetism to kinetic antiferromagnetism as the geometry is tuned from square to triangular, which can be observed in current quantum gas microscopes.</description>
