      <title>Micro-scale Electrostatic Structures formed on the Rough Surfaces of the Moon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is widely accepted that the surface potential of the lunar dayside is "on average" several to 10 V positive due to photoelectron emission in addition to the solar wind plasma precipitation. Recent studies, however, have shown that an insulating and rough regolith layer tends to make positive and negative charges separated and irregularly distributed on sub-Debye-length scales. The local charge separation then gives rise to an intense and structured electrostatic field. Such micro-scale electrostatic structures lie in the innermost part of the photoelectron sheath and may contribute to the mobilization of the charged dust particles. Since the electrostatic structures can take different states depending on the topography of the lunar surface, it is necessary to update the research approach. We have launched a research group to develop an integrated assessment framework that includes theoretical and numerical modeling, on-orbit observations, ground-based testing, and the development of charging measurement instruments, with the ultimate goal of comprehensively understanding the surface charging processes on the Moon.</description>

      <title>Embedded State Estimation for Optimization of Cislunar Space Domain Awareness Constellation Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The traffic in cislunar space is expected to increase over the coming years, leading to a higher likelihood of conjunction events among active satellites, orbital debris, and non-cooperative satellites. This increase necessitates enhanced space domain awareness (SDA) capabilities that include state estimation for targets of interest. Both Earth surface-based and space-based observation platforms in geosynchronous orbit or below face challenges such as range, exclusion, and occlusion that hinder observation. Motivated by the need to place space-based observers in the cislunar space regime to overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a cislunar SDA constellation design and analysis framework that integrates state estimation into an optimization problem for determining the placement of observers for optimal state estimation performance on a set of targets. The proposed multi-observer placement optimization problem samples from a range of possible target orbits. Upon convergence, the optimized constellation is validated against a broader set of targets to assess its effectiveness. Two comparative analyses are presented to evaluate the effects of changes in the sensor tasking procedure and sensor fidelity on the optimized constellation, comparing these to a single observer baseline case. The results demonstrate that the optimized constellations can provide accurate state estimation for various orbit families.</description>

      <title>Photospheric hot spots at solar coronal loop footpoints revealed by hyperspectral imaging observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Poynting flux generated by random shuffling of photospheric magnetic footpoints is transferred through the upper atmosphere of the Sun where the plasma is heated to over 1 MK in the corona. High spatiotemporal resolution observations of the lower atmosphere at the base of coronal magnetic loops are crucial to better understand the nature of the footpoint dynamics and the details of magnetic processes that eventually channel energy into the corona. Here we report high spatial resolution ($\sim$0.1\arcsec) and cadence (1.33 s) hyperspectral imaging of the solar H$\alpha$ line, acquired by the Microlensed Hyperspectral Imager prototype installed at the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope, that reveal photospheric hot spots at the base of solar coronal loops. These hot spots manifest themselves as H$\alpha$ wing enhancements, occurring on small spatial scales of $\sim$0.2\arcsec, and timescales of less than 100 s. By assuming that the H$\alpha$ wings and the continuum form under the local thermodynamic equilibrium condition, we inverted the H$\alpha$ line profiles and found that the hot spots are compatible with a temperature increase of about 1000 K above the ambient quiet-Sun temperature. The H$\alpha$ wing integrated Stokes $V/I$ maps indicate that hot spots are related to magnetic patches with field strengths comparable to or even stronger than the surrounding network elements. But they do not show the presence of parasitic polarity magnetic field that would support the interpretation that these hot spots are reconnection-driven Ellerman bombs. Therefore, we interpret these features as proxies of locations where convection-driven magnetic field intensification in the photosphere can lead to energy transfer into higher layers. We suggest that such hot spots at coronal loop footpoints may be indicative of the specific locations and onset of energy flux injection into the upper atmosphere.</description>
