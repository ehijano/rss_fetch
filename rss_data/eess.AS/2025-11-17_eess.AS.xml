      <title>Towards Attribution of Generators and Emotional Manipulation in Cross-Lingual Synthetic Speech using Geometric Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of finegrained traceback of emotional and manipulation characteristics from synthetically manipulated speech. We hypothesize that combining semantic-prosodic cues captured by Speech Foundation Models (SFMs) with fine-grained spectral dynamics from auditory representations can enable more precise tracing of both emotion and manipulation source. To validate this hypothesis, we introduce MiCuNet, a novel multitask framework for fine-grained tracing of emotional and manipulation attributes in synthetically generated speech. Our approach integrates SFM embeddings with spectrogram-based auditory features through a mixed-curvature projection mechanism that spans Hyperbolic, Euclidean, and Spherical spaces guided by a learnable temporal gating mechanism. Our proposed method adopts a multitask learning setup to simultaneously predict original emotions, manipulated emotions, and manipulation sources on the EmoFake dataset (EFD) across both English and Chinese subsets. MiCuNet yields consistent improvements, consistently surpassing conventional fusion strategies. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first study to explore a curvature-adaptive framework specifically tailored for multitask tracking in synthetic speech.</description>

      <title>Curved Worlds, Clear Boundaries: Generalizing Speech Deepfake Detection using Hyperbolic and Spherical Geometry Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we address the challenge of generalizable audio deepfake detection (ADD) across diverse speech synthesis paradigms-including conventional text-to-speech (TTS) systems and modern diffusion or flow-matching (FM) based generators. Prior work has mostly targeted individual synthesis families and often fails to generalize across paradigms due to overfitting to generation-specific artifacts. We hypothesize that synthetic speech, irrespective of its generative origin, leaves behind shared structural distortions in the embedding space that can be aligned through geometry-aware modeling. To this end, we propose RHYME, a unified detection framework that fuses utterance-level embeddings from diverse pretrained speech encoders using non-Euclidean projections. RHYME maps representations into hyperbolic and spherical manifolds-where hyperbolic geometry excels at modeling hierarchical generator families, and spherical projections capture angular, energy-invariant cues such as periodic vocoder artifacts. The fused representation is obtained via Riemannian barycentric averaging, enabling synthesis-invariant alignment. RHYME outperforms individual PTMs and homogeneous fusion baselines, achieving top performance and setting new state-of-the-art in cross-paradigm ADD.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Voices, Real Threats: Evaluating Large Text-to-Speech Models in Generating Harmful Audio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern text-to-speech (TTS) systems, particularly those built on Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs), generate high-fidelity speech that faithfully reproduces input text and mimics specified speaker identities. While prior misuse studies have focused on speaker impersonation, this work explores a distinct content-centric threat: exploiting TTS systems to produce speech containing harmful content. Realizing such threats poses two core challenges: (1) LALM safety alignment frequently rejects harmful prompts, yet existing jailbreak attacks are ill-suited for TTS because these systems are designed to faithfully vocalize any input text, and (2) real-world deployment pipelines often employ input/output filters that block harmful text and audio.
  We present HARMGEN, a suite of five attacks organized into two families that address these challenges. The first family employs semantic obfuscation techniques (Concat, Shuffle) that conceal harmful content within text. The second leverages audio-modality exploits (Read, Spell, Phoneme) that inject harmful content through auxiliary audio channels while maintaining benign textual prompts. Through evaluation across five commercial LALMs-based TTS systems and three datasets spanning two languages, we demonstrate that our attacks substantially reduce refusal rates and increase the toxicity of generated speech.
  We further assess both reactive countermeasures deployed by audio-streaming platforms and proactive defenses implemented by TTS providers. Our analysis reveals critical vulnerabilities: deepfake detectors underperform on high-fidelity audio; reactive moderation can be circumvented by adversarial perturbations; while proactive moderation detects 57-93% of attacks. Our work highlights a previously underexplored content-centric misuse vector for TTS and underscore the need for robust cross-modal safeguards throughout training and deployment.</description>

      <title>Proactive Hearing Assistants that Isolate Egocentric Conversations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce proactive hearing assistants that automatically identify and separate the wearer's conversation partners, without requiring explicit prompts. Our system operates on egocentric binaural audio and uses the wearer's self-speech as an anchor, leveraging turn-taking behavior and dialogue dynamics to infer conversational partners and suppress others. To enable real-time, on-device operation, we propose a dual-model architecture: a lightweight streaming model runs every 12.5 ms for low-latency extraction of the conversation partners, while a slower model runs less frequently to capture longer-range conversational dynamics. Results on real-world 2- and 3-speaker conversation test sets, collected with binaural egocentric hardware from 11 participants totaling 6.8 hours, show generalization in identifying and isolating conversational partners in multi-conversation settings. Our work marks a step toward hearing assistants that adapt proactively to conversational dynamics and engagement.

      <title>CO-VADA: A Confidence-Oriented Voice Augmentation Debiasing Approach for Fair Speech Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bias in speech emotion recognition (SER) systems often stems from spurious correlations between speaker characteristics and emotional labels, leading to unfair predictions across demographic groups. Many existing debiasing methods require model-specific changes or demographic annotations, limiting their practical use. We present CO-VADA, a Confidence-Oriented Voice Augmentation Debiasing Approach that mitigates bias without modifying model architecture or relying on demographic information. CO-VADA identifies training samples that reflect bias patterns present in the training data and then applies voice conversion to alter irrelevant attributes and generate samples. These augmented samples introduce speaker variations that differ from dominant patterns in the data, guiding the model to focus more on emotion-relevant features. Our framework is compatible with various SER models and voice conversion tools, making it a scalable and practical solution for improving fairness in SER systems.</description>

      <title>SPUR: A Plug-and-Play Framework for Integrating Spatial Audio Understanding and Reasoning into Large Audio-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spatial perception is central to auditory intelligence, enabling accurate understanding of real-world acoustic scenes and advancing human-level perception of the world around us. While recent large audio-language models (LALMs) show strong reasoning over complex audios, most operate on monaural inputs and lack the ability to capture spatial cues such as direction, elevation, and distance. We introduce SPUR, a lightweight, plug-in approach that equips LALMs with spatial perception through minimal architectural changes. SPUR consists of: (i) a First-Order Ambisonics (FOA) encoder that maps (W, X, Y, Z) channels to rotation-aware, listener-centric spatial features, integrated into target LALMs via a multimodal adapter; and (ii) SPUR-Set, a spatial QA dataset combining open-source FOA recordings with controlled simulations, emphasizing relative direction, elevation, distance, and overlap for supervised spatial reasoning. Fine-tuning our model on the SPUR-Set consistently improves spatial QA and multi-speaker attribution while preserving general audio understanding. SPUR provides a simple recipe that transforms monaural LALMs into spatially aware models. Extensive ablations validate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>MUDAS: Mote-scale Unsupervised Domain Adaptation in Multi-label Sound Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) is essential for adapting machine learning models to new, unlabeled environments where data distribution shifts can degrade performance. Existing UDA algorithms are designed for single-label tasks and rely on significant computational resources, limiting their use in multi-label scenarios and in resource-constrained IoT devices. Overcoming these limitations is particularly challenging in contexts such as urban sound classification, where overlapping sounds and varying acoustics require robust, adaptive multi-label capabilities on low-power, on-device systems. To address these limitations, we introduce Mote-scale Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Sounds (MUDAS), a UDA framework developed for multi-label sound classification in resource-constrained IoT settings. MUDAS efficiently adapts models by selectively retraining the classifier in situ using high-confidence data, minimizing computational and memory requirements to suit on-device deployment. Additionally, MUDAS incorporates class-specific adaptive thresholds to generate reliable pseudo-labels and applies diversity regularization to improve multi-label classification accuracy. In evaluations on the SONYC Urban Sound Tagging (SONYC-UST) dataset recorded at various New York City locations, MUDAS demonstrates notable improvements in classification accuracy over existing UDA algorithms, achieving good performance in a resource-constrained IoT setting.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the NAO: Extending Capabilities of Legacy Robots for Long-Term Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Legacy (unsupported) robotic platforms often lose research utility when manufacturer support ends, preventing integration of modern sensing, speech, and interaction capabilities. We present the Enhanced NAO, a revitalized version of Aldebaran's NAO robot featuring upgraded beamforming microphones, RGB-D and thermal cameras, and additional compute resources in a fully self-contained package. This system combines cloud-based and local models for perception and dialogue, while preserving the NAO's expressive body and behaviors. In a pilot user study validating conversational performance, the Enhanced NAO delivered significantly higher conversational quality and elicited stronger user preference compared to the NAO AI Edition, without increasing response latency. The added visual and thermal sensing modalities established a foundation for future perception-driven interaction. Beyond this implementation, our framework provides a platform-agnostic strategy for extending the lifespan and research utility of legacy robots, ensuring they remain valuable tools for human-robot interaction.</description>

      <title>Golden Tonnetz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For example, in the chromatic circle, the twelve tones are represented by twelve points on a circle, and in Tonnetz, the relationships among harmonies are represented by a triangular lattice. Recently, we have shown that several arrangements of tones on the regular icosahedron can be associated with chromatic scales, whole-tone scales, major tones, and minor tones through the golden ratio. Here, we investigate another type of connection between music and the golden ratio. We show that there exists an arrangement of 7 tones on a golden triangle that can represent a given major/minor scale and its tonic, dominant, and subdominant chords by golden triangles. By applying this finding, we propose ``golden Tonnetz" which represents all the major/minor scales and triads by the golden triangles or gnomons and also represents relative, parallel, and leading-tone exchange transformations in Neo-Riemannian theory by transformations among the golden triangles and gnomons</description>

      <title>Melodia: Training-Free Music Editing Guided by Attention Probing in Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-music generation technology is progressing rapidly, creating new opportunities for musical composition and editing. However, existing music editing methods often fail to preserve the source music's temporal structure, including melody and rhythm, when altering particular attributes like instrument, genre, and mood. To address this challenge, this paper conducts an in-depth probing analysis on attention maps within AudioLDM 2, a diffusion-based model commonly used as the backbone for existing music editing methods. We reveal a key finding: cross-attention maps encompass details regarding distinct musical characteristics, and interventions on these maps frequently result in ineffective modifications. In contrast, self-attention maps are essential for preserving the temporal structure of the source music during its conversion into the target music. Building upon this understanding, we present Melodia, a training-free technique that selectively manipulates self-attention maps in particular layers during the denoising process and leverages an attention repository to store source music information, achieving accurate modification of musical characteristics while preserving the original structure without requiring textual descriptions of the source music. Additionally, we propose two novel metrics to better evaluate music editing methods. Both objective and subjective experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior results in terms of textual adherence and structural integrity across various datasets. This research enhances comprehension of internal mechanisms within music generation models and provides improved control for music creation.</description>
