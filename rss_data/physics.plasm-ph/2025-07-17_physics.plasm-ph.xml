      <title>Ultrafast ps--TALIF and streak camera diagnostics of atomic hydrogen in a helium microplasma jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Picosecond two-photon absorption laser induced fluorescence (ps--TALIF) is combined with a streak camera ($\sim$1 ps highest temporal resolution) to probe the effective lifetime ($\tau_{eff_{H(n=3)}}$) and absolute density ($N_H$) of atomic hydrogen in the effluent of a helium atmospheric-pressure microplasma jet ($\mu$APPJ). This approach allows for improved temporal resolution compared to conventional nanosecond diagnostics, enabling measurements of $\tau_{eff_{H(n=3)}}$ as small as 50 ps, the corresponding $N_H$ reaching down to $10^{14} cm^{-3}$. Atomic densities are calibrated by performing identical ps--TALIF measurements in krypton gas contained in a custom-built low-pressure cuvette. Physical mechanisms that may be involved in the TALIF scheme such as photoionisation and/or stimulated emission are also assessed, ensuring reliable studies. The determined $\tau_{eff_{H(n=3)}}$ and $N_H$ increase with the helium flow rate ($Q_{He}$) in the range $Q_{He}=0.3-1$ slm. Both quantities are maximized near the exit nozzle of the $\mu$APPJ, obtaining values below 400 ps and $6x10^{14} cm^{-3}$, respectively. As the axial distance increases, $\tau_{eff_{H(n=3)}}$ declines with a rate of $\approx$65 ps/mm for $Q_{He}=1$ slm which is about 3 times smaller than for $Q_{He}=0.3$ slm. These findings reveal a strong correlation between the experimentally-measured $\tau_{eff_{H(n=3)}}$ and the local air entrainment into the jet as indicated by their comparison with calculated effective lifetimes based on published quenching rates. Furthermore, operating the $\mu$APPJ in the burst mode allows for the estimation of the residence time ($t_{res}$) of ground state H--atoms in the helium gas channel, which is larger for $Q_{He}=0.3$ slm ($t_{res} \approx 1.2 ms$) compared to $Q_{He}=1$ slm ($t_{res} \approx 0.5 ms$). H-atoms consumption in the gas channel can be affected by diffusion and mechanisms involving neutral ground-state and metastable species among others. Furthermore, based on an error propagation analysis, density uncertainty as high as 64% (depending on the operating condition) is revealed. This mainly originates in the ratio of the two-photon absorption cross sections of Kr and H atoms ( $\sigma^{(2)}Kr$ / $\sigma^{(2)}H$) which has not yet been measured in the picosecond regime. Nevertheless, the combined utilisation of ps--TALIF and streak camera diagnostics demonstrates high sensitivity and temporal resolution for directly probing key reactive species in atmospheric pressure microplasmas.</description>

      <title>Analytic neutron wall loading from spin-polarized fusion in axisymmetric geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-polarized nuclei can be used to enhance the fusion reaction rate, preferentially direct neutrons and alpha particles, or do some combination of these. In this paper we present formulas for the neutron wall load (NWL) on the walls of an axisymmetric torus with a convex cross section from filamentary ring sources with arbitrary fuel polarizations and arbitrary local magnetic field directions. While the NWL does not include neutron scattering, which would require a more sophisticated treatment, these formulas can be evaluated very quickly. This can help a fusion machine designer build intuition about the effects of spin-polarization on neutron wall loading. The formulas are also fully differentiable, so they could be included in a fusion systems optimization code. As an example, we present sets of first wall shapes optimized to have a uniform NWL for each of the main polarization modes.</description>

      <title>Scaling of thin wire cylindrical compression after 100 fs Joule surface heating with material, diameter and laser energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first systematic experimental validation of return-current-driven implosion scaling in micrometer-sized wires irradiated by femtosecond laser pulses. Employing XFEL-based imaging with sub-micrometer spatial and femtosecond temporal resolution, supported by hydrodynamic and particle-in-cell simulations, we reveal how return current density depends precisely on wire diameter, material properties, and incident laser energy. We identify deviations from simple theoretical predictions due to geometrically influenced electron escape dynamics. These results refine and confirm the scaling laws essential for predictive modeling in high-energy-density physics and inertial fusion research.</description>

      <title>Gauss' Separation Algorithm for the Magnetic Field Decomposition of the SPARC PRD simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A magnetic separation algorithm originally introduced by Gauss has been revisited in recent years with application to magnetically-confined fusion experiments. The main result offered by Gauss' Separation Algorithm~(GSA) is a magnetic field computation that enables the decomposition of the contributions due to sources internal and external to a bounded volume through the generalized Virtual-Casing Principle. The present work applies GSA to simulations of the SPARC Primary Reference Discharge and demonstrates its separation capability on all phases of the shot, including the ramp-up during which significant currents on the passive structures often complicate the reconstruction of plasma equilibria. Such early results suggest a promising new way to study ramp-ups, disruptions, and vertical displacement events without any specific modeling assumption. Envisaged applications include reading magnetic data from experimental diagnostics and producing a new set of signals without external contributions to be used by downstream equilibrium codes for improved accuracy or speed.</description>

      <title>Ultra-strong Quantum Squeezing Mediated by Plasma Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum squeezed states enable precision measurements beyond the standard quantum limit, but conventional solid-state media fundamentally limit pump intensities to the ionization threshold. We demonstrate that plasma waves can mediate ultra-strong two-mode squeezing through stimulated Raman scattering, achieving up to ultrastrong squeezing using $10^{16}{Wcm^{-2}}$ pump lasers. Employing two copropagating pump beams with frequency difference matching twice the plasma frequency, we generate quantum-correlated photon pairs through phonon-mediated four-wave mixing. The process exhibits remarkable thermal noise tolerance, allowing strong squeezing even with large thermal phonon numbers. This plasma-based approach produces squeezed states with ultrahigh photon numbers, opening new possibilities for strong-field applications across optical to X-ray wavelengths.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Algorithm for Drift-Kinetic Particle Dynamics within General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamics Simulations of Black Holes Accretion Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrophysical plasmas in relativistic spacetimes, such as black hole accretion flows, are often weakly collisional and require kinetic modeling to capture non-local transport and particle acceleration. However, the extreme scale separation between microscopic and macroscopic processes limits the feasibility of fully kinetic simulations. A covariant guiding center formalism has recently been derived to address this challenge in curved spacetimes. We present a new hybrid numerical algorithm based on this formalism, which evolves the trajectories of charged particles over macroscopic timescales in GRMHD backgrounds. To address numerical instabilities in the equations of motion, we develop a semi-implicit integrator that ensures stable evolution in strong-field environments. We apply our method to GRMHD simulations of black hole accretion flows, demonstrating its accuracy and efficiency across a range of physical conditions.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous observations of multiple ELVES and SPRITES at the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since 2014, the Pierre Auger Observatory has exploited a dedicated trigger and its very high time resolution to study ELVES and harvest record samples of multiple ELVES using the Fluorescence Detector (FD). In 2017, after extending the readout of trace lengths to 0.9 ms, we started observing other types of light transients from the base of the ionosphere, such as HALOS, which deserved further investigation. In December 2023 and April 2024, we installed two additional cameras (TLECAMs), which allow us to perform simultaneous detection of these transients with higher space resolution and longer integration times. Here, we present our first simultaneous observations of SPRITES and ELVES by both TLECAMs and FD. Furthermore, we describe the Python algorithm based on DBSCAN to automatically detect SPRITES in the videos recorded by our TLECAMs and acquire data efficiently without needing the FD trigger.</description>

      <title>The Origin of Structure in the Auroral Ionosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The auroral ionosphere presents a paradox: turbulence often thrives in a conductive layer that should suppress the growth rates of plasma instabilities. Using a novel composite power spectrum from coherent radar and GPS data, we show that turbulence on a wide range of scales stem not from local instabilities. Instead, its spectrum is a structural imprint of field-aligned electrical currents, and its dissipative character is governed by the flux of precipitating particles. Our measurements provide a clear geophysical example of a driven, emergent system of self-organized dissipative structures.</description>

      <title>Subspace Approximation to the Focused Transport Equation. II. The Modified Form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transport of energetic particles in a spatially varying magnetic field is described by the focused transport equation. In the past two versions of this equation were investigated. The more commonly used standard form described a pitch-angle isotropization process but does not conserve the norm. In the current paper we consider the focused transport equation in conservative form also called modified focused transport equation. This equation conserves the norm but does not describe pitch-angle isotropization. We use the previously developed subspace method to solve the focused transport equation analytically and numerically. For a pure analytical treatment we employ the two-dimensional subspace approximation. Furthermore, we consider a higher dimensionality for which one needs to evaluate occurring matrix exponentials numerically. This type of semi-numerical approach is much faster than traditional solvers and, therefore, it is very useful.</description>

      <title>Can plasmoid-mediated reconnection occur in collisionless systems?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection is a process that converts magnetic energy into plasma energy by changing the magnetic field line topology. The outstanding question is why the reconnection rate is $\mathcal{O}(0.01 - 0.1)$ in many astrophysical phenomena, for example solar flares and terrestrial substorms. Previous studies have shown two ideas of Hall reconnection and plasmoid instability. However, there is no consensus on which process is the reason for the fast reconnection. In this paper, we discuss the formation of secondary plasmoids in \rewrite{2D antiparallel collisionless reconnection} using 2.5-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations and discuss whether plasmoid-mediated reconnection occur in collisionless systems by comparing with plasmoid instability in resistive MHD simulations. We find that in collisionless systems secondary plasmoids can indeed form. However, the mass ratio has a strong effect on the formation of secondary plasmoids, and it indicates that secondary plasmoids do not emerge using realistic ion-electron mass ratio ($m_i/m_e = 1836$). Furthermore, we find that there is no enhancement of the reconnection rate due to the secondary plasmoid in the collisionless system, as discussed in the plasmoid-mediated reconnection. Although our simulation $\mathcal{O}(100\lambda_i)$ box is not large enough to discuss astrophysical phenomena such as solar flares, it can reflect a relatively small plasma system such as the Earth's magnetotail.</description>

      <title>Multi-directional investigations on quiet time suprathermal ions measured by ASPEX-STEPS on-board Aditya L1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin, acceleration and anisotropy of suprathermal ions in the interplanetary medium during quiet periods have remained poorly understood issues in solar wind physics. To address these aspects, we derive the spectral indices for the quiet time suprathermal ions based on the measurements by the four directionally separated sensors that are part of the Supra-Thermal and Energetic Particle Spectrometer (STEPS) of Aditya Solar Wind Particle EXperiment (ASPEX) on-board Aditya L1 spacecraft. Three out of four STEPS sensors Parker Spiral (PS), Inter-Mediate (IM), Earth Pointing (EP) are in one plane (nearly aligned with the ecliptic plane) while the fourth sensor North Pointing (NP) is in a mutually orthogonal plane. The energy ranges covered by the PS, IM, EP and NP sensors are 0.36-1.32 MeV, 0.14-1.22 MeV, 0.39-1.33 MeV and 0.12-1.23 MeV respectively. The quiet intervals are identified during January November, 2024 and the derived spectral indices (differential directional flux versus energy) are found to be in the range of 2.0 for all directions in the time scale of a few days revealing isotropic nature of their distribution. Further analysis of elemental abundance ratios (3He/4He, Fe/O, and C/O) during the same quiet intervals obtained from the Ultra-Low Energy Isotope Spectrometer (ULEIS) on board the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) spacecraft suggests possible contributions from the leftover ions from the previous impulsive (Solar flares) and gradual events (CMEs) in the quiet time suprathermal ion pool.</description>

      <title>Constraining shear modulus of polycrystalline neutron star crust: Hashin-Shtrikman variational approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The elastic properties of the neutron star crust are thought to play a crucial role in various phenomena of neutron stars (glitches, oscillations, gravitational wave emission) and should be described quantitatively to model these phenomena. The fundamental problem of this description is associated with the polycrystalline nature of the crust: similar to terrestrial materials, the elastic moduli, strictly speaking, depend on the shape and orientation of crystallites, but for the crust, they are unknown. As a result, some assumptions are generally required to predict the elastic properties or constrain their possible range. In this paper, we follow the commonly believed assumption that the crust is (locally) isotropic, which allows us to describe elastic properties by two (effective) parameters: bulk and shear moduli. The bulk modulus is well determined by the Voigt-Reuss bounds, and we constrain the shear modulus by applying, for the first time in astrophysics of compact stars, the variational Hashin-Shtrikman approach, based on the additional assumption that there are no correlations in the orientation of crystallites. We analyse the Hashin-Shtrikman bounds for the one-component crust taking into account the electron screening and the motion of the nuclei, and for two-component static crystals. In particular, we demonstrate that within applied assumptions the effective shear modulus should be lower than the Voigt estimate, typically applied in the astrophysical literature.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic Cooling of Planar Motion in a Penning Trap Ion Crystal to Sub-Millikelvin Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional planar ion crystals in a Penning trap are a platform for quantum information science experiments. However, the low-frequency planar modes of these crystals are not efficiently cooled by laser cooling, which can limit the utility of the drumhead modes for quantum information processing. Recently, it has been shown that nonlinear mode coupling can enhance the cooling of the low-frequency planar modes. Here, we demonstrate in numerical simulations that this coupling can be dynamically tuned by adiabatically changing the rotation frequency of the ion crystal during experiments. Furthermore, we show that this technique can, in addition, produce lower temperatures for the low-frequency planar modes via an adiabatic cooling process. This result allows cooling of the planar modes to sub-millikelvin temperatures, resulting in improved spectral resolution of the drumhead modes at experimentally relevant rotation frequencies, which is crucial for quantum information processing applications.</description>

Abstract: Short Large Amplitude Magnetic Structures (SLAMS) are frequently detected during spacecraft crossings over the Earth bow shock. We investigate the existence of such structures at astrophysical shocks, where they could result from the steepening of cosmic-ray (CR) driven waves. Using kinetic particle-in-cell simulations, we study the growth of SLAMS and the appearance of associated transient shocks in the upstream region of quasi-parallel, non-relativistic, high-Mach number collisionless shocks. We find that high-energy CRs significantly enhance the transverse magnetic field within SLAMS, producing highly inclined field lines. As SLAMS are advected towards the shock, these fields lines form an intermittent superluminal configuration which traps magnetized electrons at fast shocks. Due to their oscillatory nature, SLAMS are periodically separated by subluminal gaps with lower transverse magnetic field strength. In these regions, electrons diffuse and accelerate by bouncing between the shock and the approaching SLAMS region through a mechanism that we call quasi-periodic shock acceleration (QSA). We analytically derive the distribution of electrons accelerated via QSA, $f(p)\sim p^{[-4.7,-5.7]}$, which agrees well with the simulation spectra. We find that the electron power law remains steep until the end of our longest runs, providing a possible explanation for the steep electron spectra observed at least up to GeV energies in young and fast supernova remnants.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Magnetic Reconnection in Astrophysical Plasmas: A Powerful Mechanism of Nonthermal Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02101v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection -- a fundamental plasma physics process, where magnetic field lines of opposite polarity annihilate -- is invoked in astrophysical plasmas as a powerful mechanism of nonthermal particle acceleration, able to explain fast-evolving, bright high-energy flares. Near black holes and neutron stars, reconnection occurs in the ``relativistic'' regime, in which the mean magnetic energy per particle exceeds the rest mass energy. This review reports recent advances in our understanding of the kinetic physics of relativistic reconnection: (1) Kinetic simulations have elucidated the physics of plasma heating and nonthermal particle acceleration in relativistic reconnection; (2) The physics of radiative relativistic reconnection, with its self-consistent interplay between photons and reconnection-accelerated particles -- a peculiarity of luminous, high-energy astrophysical sources -- is the new frontier of research; (3) Relativistic reconnection plays a key role in global models of high-energy sources, both in terms of global-scale layers, as well as of reconnection sites generated as a byproduct of local magnetohydrodynamic instabilities. We summarize themes of active investigation and future directions, emphasizing the role of upcoming observational capabilities, laboratory experiments, and new computational tools.</description>
