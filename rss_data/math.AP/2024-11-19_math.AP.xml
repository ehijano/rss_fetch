      <title>Multiple solutions to a semilinear elliptic equation with a sharp change of sign in the nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a nonautonomous semilinear elliptic problem where the power nonlinearity is multiplied by a discontinuous coefficient that equals one inside a bounded open set $\Omega$ and it equals minus one in its complement. In the slightly subcritical regime, we prove the existence of concentrating positive and nodal solutions. Moreover, depending on the geometry of $\Omega$, we establish multiplicity of positive solutions. Finally, in the critical case, we show the existence of a blow-up positive solution when $\Omega$ has nontrivial topology. Our proofs rely on a Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction strategy which in these problems turns out to be remarkably simple. We take this opportunity to highlight certain aspects of the method that are often overlooked and present it in a more accessible and detailed manner for nonexperts.</description>

      <title>Classification and Nondegeneracy of Cubic Nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger System in $\mathbb{R}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the following one-dimensional cubic nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger system: \[ u_i''+2\Big(\sum_{k=1}^Nu_k^2\Big)u_i=-\mu_iu_i \ \,\ \mbox{in}\, \ \mathbb{R} , \ \ i=1, 2, \cdots, N, \] where $\mu_1\leq\mu_2\leq\cdots\leq\mu_N&lt;0$ and $N\ge 2$. In this paper, we mainly focus on the case $N=3$ and prove the following results: (i). The solutions of the system can be completely classified; (ii). Depending on the explicit values of $\mu_1\leq\mu_2\leq\mu_3&lt;0$, there exist two different classes of normalized solutions $u=(u_1, u_2, u_3)$ satisfying $\int _{R}u_i^2dx=1$ for all $i=1, 2, 3$, which are completely different from the case $N=2$; (iii). The linearized operator at any nontrivial solution of the system is non-degenerate. The conjectures on the explicit classification and nondegeneracy of solutions for the system are also given for the case $N&gt;3$. These address the questions of [R. Frank, D. Gontier and M. Lewin, CMP, 2021], where the complete classification and uniqueness results for the system were already proved for the case $N=2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study one-dimensional boundary blow up problems with Kirchhoff type nonlocal terms on an interval. We perform a bifurcation analysis on the problems and obtain the precise number of solutions according to the value of the bifurcation parameter. We also obtain the precise asymptotic formula for solutions for special cases.</description>

      <title>A note on the development of singularities on solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations under super critical forcing terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently Qi S. Zhang provides examples of solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations which, under suitable hypothesis, blow up in finite time. He considers axially symmetric solutions in a cylinder $D\,$ under appropriate boundary conditions and under the effect of super critical external forces $f\,.$ The loss of boundedness for the velocity field, as $t\rightarrow T\,,$ is the basic case of blow up. However a more general situation is considered below, as explained in the preamble.\par In his main result Zhang exhibits, for each $q&lt;\infty\,,$ a blow up solution with an external force $f\in L^q(0,T;L^1(D))\,.$ Following Zhang, we construct blow up solutions with forcing terms in $L^q(0,T;L^p(D))\,,$ for suitable pairs $(q,p)\,.$ In particular our results contain Zhang's result. A significant particular case is the existence of external forces $f \in L^1(0,T;L^p(D))\,,$ for every $p&lt;2$, for which the velocity blows up in a finite time. The significant case $p=2$ remains open.</description>

      <title>Zero-extension convergence and Sobolev spaces on changing domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10827v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the definition of weak and strong convergence to sequences of Sobolev-functions whose underlying domains themselves are converging. In contrast to previous works, we do so without ever assuming any sort of reference configuration. We then develop the respective theory and counterparts to classical compactness theorems from the fixed domain case. Finally, we illustrate the usefulness of these definitions with some examples from applications and compare them to other approaches.</description>

      <title>Fully nonlinear parabolic equations of real forms on Hermitian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over many decades fully nonlinear PDEs, and the complex Monge-Amp\`ere equation in particular played a central role in the study of complex manifolds. Most previous works focused on problems that can be expressed through equations involving real $(1, 1)$ forms. As many important questions, especially those linked to higher cohomology classes in complex geometry involve real $(p, p)$ forms for $p &gt; 1$, there is a strong need to develop PDE techniques to study them. In this paper we consider a fully nonlinear equation for $(p, p)$ forms on compact Hermitian manifolds. We establish the existence of classical solutions for a large class of these equations by a parabolic approach, proving the long-time existence and convergence of solutions to the elliptic case.</description>

      <title>Local well-posedness for the Schr\"{o}dinger-KdV system in $H^{s_1}\times H^{s_2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study local well-posedness theory of the Cauchy problem for Schr\"{o}dinger-KdV system in Sobolev spaces $H^{s_1}\times H^{s_2}$. We obtain the local well-posedness when $s_1\geq 0$, $\max\{-3/4,s_1-3\}\leq s_2\leq \min\{4s_1,s_1+2\}$. The result is sharp in some sense and improves previous one by Corcho-Linares \cite{corcho2007well}. The endpoint case $(s_1,s_2) = (0,-3/4)$ has been solved in \cite{guo2010well,wang2011cauchy}. We show the necessary and sufficient conditions for related estimates in Bourgain spaces. To solve the borderline cases, we use the $U^p-V^p$ spaces introduced by Koch-Tataru \cite{kochtataru} and function spaces constructed by Guo-Wang \cite{guo2010well}. We also use normal form argument to control the nonresonant interaction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we continue the study of the local well-posedness theory for the Schr\"{o}dinger-KdV system in the Sobolev space $H^{s_1}\times H^{s_2}$. We show the local well-posedness in $H^{-3/16}\times H^{-3/4}$ for $\beta = 0$. Combining our work \cite{banchenzhang}, we also have the local well-posedness for $\max\{-3/4,s_1-3\}\leq s_2\leq \min\{4s_1,s_1+2\}$. The result is sharp by using the contraction mapping argument.</description>

      <title>Hypocoercivity for the non-linear semiconductor Boltzmann equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A kinetic model for semiconductor devices is considered on a flat torus. We prove exponential decay to equilibrium for this non-linear kinetic model by hypocoercivity estimates. This seems to be the first hypocoercivity result for this nonlinear kinetic equation for semiconductor devices without smallness assumptions. The analysis benefits from uniform bounds of the solution in terms of the equilibrium velocity distribution.</description>

      <title>Fractional Dirichlet problems with singular and non-locally convective reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11026v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the existence of positive weak solutions to a Dirichlet problem driven by the fractional $(p,q)$-Laplacian and with reaction both weakly singular and non-locally convective (i.e., depending on the distributional Riesz gradient of solutions) is established. Due to the nature of the right-hand side, we address the problem via sub-super solution methods, combined with variational techniques, truncation arguments, as well as fixed point results.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity and asymptotic behavior of normalized solutions to p-Kirchhoff equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a type of p-Kirchhoff equation $$
  -\left( a+b\int_{\mathbb{R} ^3}{\left| \nabla u \right|^pdx} \right) \varDelta _pu=\lambda \left| u \right|^{p-2}u+\left| u \right|^{q-2}u, x \in \mathbb{R}^3 $$ with the prescribed mass $$ (\int_{\mathbb{R} ^3}{\left| u \right|^{p}dx})^\frac{1}{p} = c &gt; 0 $$ where $a&gt;0, b &gt; 0,\frac{3}{2} &lt;p &lt;3, p &lt; q &lt; p^{\ast}:=\frac{3p}{3-p} $,$\varDelta _pu=div\left( \left| \nabla u \right|^{p-2}\nabla u \right)$ is the p-Laplacian of $u$, $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$ is Lagrange multiplier. We consider both $L^p$-subcritical , $L^p$-critical and $L^p$-supercritical cases. Precisely, in the $L^p$-subcritical and $L^p$-critical cases, we obtain the existence and nonexistence of the normalized solutions for the p-Kirchhoff equation. In the $L^p$-supercritical case, we obtain the existence of radial ground sates and multiplicity of radial normalized solutions for the p-Kirchhoff equation. Furthermore, we study the asymptotic behavior of normalized solutions when $b \rightarrow 0^+$. Besides, when $\frac{3}{2} &lt; p \leq 2$, benefit from the uniqueness(up to translations) of optimizer for Gargliardo-Nirenberg inequality, we show the existence and uniqueness of normalized solutions and provide the accurate descriptions.</description>

      <title>The Dirichlet Problem For the Logarithmic p-Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study the logarithmic $p$-Laplacian $L_{\Delta_p}$, which emerges from the formal derivative of the fractional $p$-Laplacian $(-\Delta_p)^s$ at $s=0$. This operator is nonlocal, has logarithmic order, and is the nonlinear version of the newly developed logarithmic Laplacian operator. We present a variational framework to study the Dirichlet problems involving the $L_{\Delta_p}$ in bounded domains. This allows us to investigate the connection between the first Dirichlet eigenvalue and eigenfunction of the fractional $p$-Laplacian and the logarithmic $p$-Laplacian. As a consequence, we deduce a Faber-Krahn inequality for the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of $L_{\Delta_p}$. We discuss maximum and comparison principles for $L_{\Delta_p}$ in bounded domains and demonstrate that the validity of these depends on the sign of the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of $L_{\Delta_p}$. In addition, we prove that the first Dirichlet eigenfunction of $L_{\Delta_p}$ is bounded. Furthermore, we establish a boundary Hardy-type inequality for the spaces associated with the weak formulation of the logarithmic $p$-Laplacian.</description>

      <title>Space-time structure and particle-fluid duality of solutions for Boltzmann equation with hard potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the quantitative pointwise behavior of solutions to the Boltzmann equation for hard potentials and Maxwellian molecules, which generalize the hard sphere case introduced by Liu-Yu in 2004 (Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 57:1543-1608, 2004). The large time behavior of the solution is dominated by fluid structures, similar to the hard sphere case. However, unlike hard sphere, the spatial decay here depends on the potential power $\gamma$ and the initial velocity weight. A key challenge in this problem is the loss of velocity weight in linear estimates, which makes standard nonlinear iteration infeasible. To address this, we develop an Enhanced Mixture Lemma, demonstrating that mixing the transport and gain parts of the linearized collision operator can generate arbitrary-order regularity and decay in both space and velocity variables. This allows us to decompose the linearized solution into fluid (arbitrary regularity and velocity decay) and particle (rapid space-time decay, but with loss of velocity decay) parts, making it possible to solve the nonlinear problem through this particle-fluid duality.</description>

      <title>The nonlocal Harnack inequality for antisymmetric functions: an approach via Bochner's relation and harmonic analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit a Harnack inequality for antisymmetric functions that has been recently established for the fractional Laplacian and we extend it to more general nonlocal elliptic operators.
  The new approach to deal with these problems that we propose in this paper leverages Bochner's relation, allowing one to relate a one-dimensional Fourier transform of an odd function with a three-dimensional Fourier transform of a radial function.
  In this way, Harnack inequalities for odd functions, which are essentially Harnack inequalities of boundary type, are reduced to interior Harnack inequalities.</description>

      <title>The blow-up dynamics for the divergence Schr\"odinger equations with inhomogeneous nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is dedicated to the blow-up solution for the divergence Schr\"{o}dinger equations with inhomogeneous nonlinearity (dINLS for short) \[i\partial_tu+\nabla\cdot(|x|^b\nabla u)=-|x|^c|u|^pu,\quad\quad u(x,0)=u_0(x),\] where $2-n&lt;b&lt;2$, $c&gt;b-2$, and $np-2c&lt;(2-b)(p+2)$. First, for radial blow-up solutions in $W_b^{1,2}$, we prove an upper bound on the blow-up rate for the intercritical dNLS. Moreover, an $L^2$-norm concentration in the mass-critical case is also obtained by giving a compact lemma. Next, we turn to the non-radial case. By establishing two types of Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequalities, we show the existence of finite time blow-up solutions in $\dot{H}^{s_c}\cap \dot{W}^{1,2}_b$, where $\dot{H}^{s_c}=(-\Delta)^{-\frac{s_c}{2}}L^2$, and $\dot{W}_b^{1,2}=|x|^{-\frac{b}{2}}(-\Delta)^{-\frac{1}{2}}L^2$. As an application, we obtain a lower bound for this blow-up rate, generalizing the work of Merle and Rapha\"{e}l [Amer. J. Math. 130(4) (2008), pp. 945-978] for the classical NLS equations to the dINLS setting.</description>

      <title>Global existence and blow-up for the variable coefficient Schr\"{o}dinger equations with a linear potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of variable coefficient Schr\"{o}dinger equations with a linear potential \[i\partial_tu+\nabla\cdot(|x|^b\nabla u)-V(x)u=-|x|^c|u|^pu,\] where $2-n&lt;b\leq0,\ c\geq b-2$ and $0&lt;\textbf{p}_c\leq(2-b)(p+2)$, where $\textbf{p}_c:=np-2c$. In the radial or finite variance case, we firstly prove the global existence and blow-up below the ground state threshold for the mass-critical and inter-critical nonlinearities. Next, adopting the variational method of Ibrahim-Masmoudi-Nakanishi \cite{IMN}, we obtain a sufficient condition on the nonradial initial data, under which the global behavior of the general solution is established.</description>

      <title>Regularization for point vortices on $\mathbb S^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a series of patch type solutions for incompressible Euler equation on $\mathbb S^2$, which constitutes the regularization for steady or traveling point vortex systems. We first prove the existence of $k$-fold symmetric patch solutions, whose limit is the well-known von K\'arm\'an point vortex street on $\mathbb S^2$; then we consider the general steady case, where besides a non-localized part induced by the sphere rotation, $j$ positive and $k$ negative patches are located near a nondegenerate critical point of the Kirchhoff--Routh function on $\mathbb S^2$. Our construction is accomplished by Lyapunov--Schmidt reduction argument, where the traveling speed or vortex patch location are used to eliminate the degenerate direction of a linearized operator. We also show that the boundary of each vortex patch is a $C^1$ close curve, which is a perturbation of a small ellipse in the spherical coordinates. As far as we know, this is the first attempt for a regularization of the point-vortex equilibria on $\mathbb S^2$.</description>

      <title>Quantitative regularity for the MHD equations via the localization technique in frequency space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we employ the localization technique in frequency space developed by Tao in \cite{MR4337421} to investigate the quantitative estimates for the MHD equations. With the help of quantitative Carleman inequalities given by Tao in \cite{MR4337421} and the pigeonhole principle, we establish the quantitative regularity for the critical $L^3$ norm bounded solutions which enables us explicitly quantify the blow-up behavior in terms of $L^3$ norm near a potential first-time singularity. Some technical innovations, such as introducing the corrector function, are required due to the fact that the scales are inconsistent between the magnetic field and the vorticity field.</description>

      <title>Global boundedness induced by asymptotically non-degenerate motility in a fully parabolic chemotaxis model with local sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fully parabolic chemotaxis model of Keller-Segel type with local sensing is considered. The system features a signal-dependent asymptotically non-degenerate motility function, which accounts for a repulsion-dominated chemotaxis. Global boundedness of classical solutions is proved for an initial Neumann boundary value problem of the system in any space dimension. In addition, stabilization towards the homogeneous steady state is shown, provided that the motility is monotone non-decreasing. The key steps of the proof consist of the introduction of several auxiliary functions and a refined comparison argument, along with uniform-in-time estimates for a functional involving nonlinear coupling between the unknowns and auxiliary functions.</description>

      <title>Stability and decay rate estimates for a nonlinear dispersed flow reactor model with boundary control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a nonlinear parabolic partial differential equation whose boundary conditions contain a single control input. This model describes a chemical reaction of the type ''$A \to $ product'', occurring in a dispersed flow tubular reactor. The existence and uniqueness of solutions to the nonlinear Cauchy problem under consideration are established by applying the theory of strongly continuous semigroups of operators. Using Lyapunov's direct method, a feedback control design that ensures the exponential stability of the steady state is proposed, and the exponential decay rate of solutions is evaluated.</description>

      <title>Observability inequality, log-type Hausdorff content and heat equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies observability inequalities for heat equations on both bounded domains and the whole space $\mathbb{R}^d$. The observation sets are measured by log-type Hausdorff contents, which are induced by certain log-type gauge functions closely related to the heat kernel. On a bounded domain, we derive the observability inequality for observation sets of positive log-type Hausdorff content. Notably, the aforementioned inequality holds not only for all sets with Hausdorff dimension $s$ for any $s\in (d-1,d]$, but also for certain sets of Hausdorff dimension $d-1$. On the whole space $\mathbb{R}^d$, we establish the observability inequality for observation sets that are thick at the scale of the log-type Hausdorff content. Furthermore, we prove that for the 1-dimensional heat equation on an interval, the Hausdorff content we have chosen is an optimal scale for the observability inequality.
  To obtain these observability inequalities, we use the adapted Lebeau-Robiano strategy from \cite{Duyckaerts2012resolvent}. For this purpose, we prove the following results at scale of the log-type Hausdorff content, the former being derived from the latter: We establish a spectral inequality/a Logvinenko-Sereda uncertainty principle; we set up a quantitative propagation of smallness of analytic functions; we build up a Remez' inequality; and more fundamentally, we provide an upper bound for the log-type Hausdorff content of a set where a monic polynomial is small, based on an estimate in Lubinsky \cite{Lubinsky1997small}, which is ultimately traced back to the classical Cartan Lemma. In addition, we set up a capacity-based slicing lemma (related to the log-type gauge functions) and establish a quantitative relationship between Hausdorff contents and capacities. These tools are crucial in the studies of the aforementioned propagation of smallness in high-dimensional situations.</description>

      <title>Mathematical modeling and analysis for the chemotactic diffusion in porous media with incompressible Navier-Stokes equations over bounded domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Myxobacteria aggregate and generate fruiting bodies in the soil to survive under starvation conditions. Considering soil as a porous medium, the biological mechanism and dynamic behavior of myxobacteria and slime (chemoattractants) affected by favorable environments in the soil can not be well characterized by the classical full parabolic Keller-Segel system combined with the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. In this work, we employ the continuous time random walk (CTRW) approach to characterize the diffusion behavior of myxobacteria and slime in porous media at the microscale, and develop a new macroscopic model named as the time-fractional Keller-Segel system. Then it is coupled with the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations through transport and buoyancy, resulting in the TF-KSNS system, which reveals the biological mechanism from micro to macro and then appropriately describes the dynamic behavior of the chemotactic diffusion of myxobacteria and slime in the soil. In addition, we demonstrate that the TF-KSNS system associated with initial and no-flux/no-flux/Dirichlet boundary conditions over smoothly bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ ($d\geq2$) admits a local well-posed mild solution, which continuously depends on the initial data with proper regularity under a small initial condition. Moreover, the blow-up of the mild solution is rigorously investigated.</description>

      <title>Wall laws for viscous flows in 3D randomly rough pipes: optimal convergence rates and stochastic integrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with effective approximations and wall laws of viscous laminar flows in 3D pipes with randomly rough boundaries. The random roughness is characterized by the boundary oscillation scale $\varepsilon \ll 1 $ and a probability space with ergodicity quantified by functional inequalities. The results in this paper generalize the previous work for 2D channel flows with random Lipschitz boundaries to 3D pipe flows with random boundaries of John type. Moreover, we establish the optimal convergence rates and substantially improve the stochastic integrability obtained in the previous studies. Additionally, we prove a refined version of the Poiseuille's law in 3D pipes with random boundaries, which seems unaddressed in the literature. Our systematic approach combines several classical and recent ideas (particularly from homogenization theory), including the Saint-Venant's principle for pipe flows, the large-scale regularity theory over rough boundaries, and applications of functional inequalities.</description>

      <title>Construction of multi solitary waves with symmetry for the damped nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are interested in the nonlinear damped Klein-Gordon equation \[ \partial_t^2 u+2\alpha \partial_t u-\Delta u+u-|u|^{p-1}u=0 \] on $\mathbb{R}^d$ for $2\le d\le 5$ and energy sub-critical exponents $2 &lt; p &lt; \frac{d+2}{d-2}$.
  We construct multi-solitons, that is, solutions which behave for large times as a sum of decoupled solitons, in various configurations with symmetry: this includes multi-solitons whose soliton centers lie at the vertices of an expanding regular polygon (with or without a center), of a regular polyhedron (with a center), or of a higher dimensional regular polytope. We give a precise description of these multi-solitons: in particular the interaction between nearest neighbour solitons is asymptotic to $\ln (t)$ as $t \to +\infty$.
  We also prove that in any multi-soliton, the solitons can not all share the same sign.
  Both statements generalize and precise results from \cite{F98}, \cite{Nak} and are based on the analysis developed in \cite{CMYZ,CMY}.</description>

      <title>A second microlocalization for the three-body calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is the first in a series studying the quantum mechanical three-body problem within a modern microlocal framework. The project aims to demonstrate how the Helmholtz operator is a Fredholm map between suitable anisotropic Hilbert spaces. Notably, we will consider decoupled indices that measure microlocal decay at spatial infinity. Despite the problem's rich history, new phenomena arise under this approach, particularly regarding diffraction. The treatment of this involves the second microlocalization framework introduced by Vasy for the two-body Helmholtz operator, which does not directly extend to the three-body case. This paper will clarify this structure. We will construct a pseudodifferential algebra, referred to as the three-cone algebra, which serves as a ``converse perspective'' to the second microlocalization. This algebra exhibits a scattering structure at one boundary face and a specific fibered structure (corresponding to the fibered structure for the three-body algebra) at another, which are connected by a fibered cone. We show that introducing suitable blow-ups at fiber infinities allows us to alter the three-cone algebra only at the symbolic level, thereby constructing the desired second microlocalized algebra. The presence of variable orders will also be considered. Finally, we prove basic properties for the second microlocalized algebra.</description>

      <title>Decay estimates for Schr\"{o}dinger's equation with magnetic potentials in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove that Schr\"{o}dinger's equation with a Hamiltonian of the form $H=-\Delta+i(A \nabla + \nabla A) + V$, which includes a magnetic potential $A$, has the same dispersive and solution decay properties as the free Schr\"{o}dinger equation. In particular, we prove $L^1 \to L^\infty$ decay and some related estimates for the wave equation.
  The potentials $A$ and $V$ are short-range and $A$ has four derivatives, but they can be arbitrarily large. All results hold in three space dimensions.</description>

Moreover, we prove that the Dirichlet $2l$-order poly-Laplace eigenvalues are at least as large as the squares of the Dirichlet $l$-order poly-Laplace eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>The Hausdorff distance and metrics on toric singularity types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a compact K\"ahler manifold $(X,\omega)$, due to the work of Darvas-Di Nezza-Lu, the space of singularity types of $\omega$-psh functions admits a natural pseudo-metric $d_\mathcal S$ that is complete in the presence of positive mass. When restricted to model singularity types, this pseudo-metric is a bona fide metric. In case of the projective space, there is a known one-to-one correspondence between toric model singularity types and convex bodies inside the unit simplex. Hence in this case it is natural to compare the $d_\mathcal S$ metric to the classical Hausdorff metric. We provide precise H\"older bounds, showing that their induced topologies are the same. More generally, we introduce a quasi-metric $d_G$ on the space of compact convex sets inside an arbitrary convex body $G$, with $d_\mathcal S = d_G$ in case $G$ is the unit simplex. We prove optimal H\"older bounds comparing $d_G$ with the Hausdorff metric. Our analysis shows that the H\"older exponents differ depending on the geometry of $G$, with the worst exponents in case $G$ is a polytope, and the best in case $G$ has $C^2$ boundary.</description>

Abstract: We introduce new function spaces $\mathcal{L}_{W,s}^{q,p}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$ that yield a natural reformulation of the $\ell^{q}L^{p}$ decoupling inequalities for the sphere and the light cone. These spaces are invariant under the Euclidean half-wave propagators, but not under all Fourier integral operators unless $p=q$, in which case they coincide with the Hardy spaces for Fourier integral operators. We use these spaces to obtain improvements of the classical fractional integration theorem and local smoothing estimates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a non-local interaction energy over bounded densities of fixed mass $m$. We prove that under certain regularity assumptions on the interaction kernel these energies admit minimizers given by characteristic functions of sets when $m$ is sufficiently small (or even for every $m$, in particular cases). We show that these assumptions are satisfied by particular interaction kernels in power-law form, and give a certain characterization of minimizing sets. Finally, following a recent result of Davies, Lim and McCann, we give sufficient conditions on the interaction kernel so that the minimizer of the energy over probability measures is given by Dirac masses concentrated on the vertices of a regular $(N+1)$-gon of side length 1 in $\mathbb{R}^N$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, a class of anisotropic weights having the form of $|x'|^{\theta_{1}}|x|^{\theta_{2}}|x_{n}|^{\theta_{3}}$ in dimensions $n\geq2$ is considered, where $x=(x',x_{n})$ and $x'=(x_{1},...,x_{n-1})$. We first find the optimal range of $(\theta_{1},\theta_{2},\theta_{3})$ such that this type of weights belongs to the Muckenhoupt class $A_{p}$. Then we further study its doubling property, which shows that it provides an example of a doubling measure but is not in $A_{p}$. As a consequence, we obtain anisotropic weighted Poincar\'{e} and Sobolev inequalities, which are used to study the local behavior for solutions to non-homogeneous weighted $p$-Laplace equations.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness and regularity of the Darcy-Boussinesq system in layered porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the existence of global weak solution in 2D and 3D, as well as the uniqueness of weak solution in 2D, for the Darcy-Boussinesq model for convection in layered porous media with square integrable initial data. We also derived tangential regularity in the 2D case. In addition, we obtain the existence and uniqueness of regular solution in a novel piecewise $H^2$ space in both 2D and 3D under uniform porosity assumption and $H^1$ initial data. This is the first rigorous result for this model in the physically important layered setting.</description>

      <title>Vanishing center-of-mass limit of the 2D-1D corotational Oldroyd-B polymeric fluid-structure interaction problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Oldroyd-B model for a two-dimensional dilute corotational polymer fluid with center-of-mass diffusion that is interacting with a one-dimensional viscoelastic shell. We show that any family of strong solutions of the system described above that is parametrized by the center-of-mass diffusion coefficient converges, as the coefficient goes to zero, to a weak solution of a corotational polymer fluid-structure interaction system without center-of-mass diffusion but with essentially bounded polymer number density and extra stress tensor. As a consequence, we also obtain a weak-strong uniqueness result that says that the weak solution of the latter is unique in the class of the strong solution of the former as the center-of-mass diffusion vanishes.</description>

Abstract: A fundamental issue in the theory of time-dependent differential equations is to characterize precompact sets in Bochner spaces.
  We here survey the theory, starting with the classical Aubin-Lions inequality and its important extension by Dubinskii. In particular, we give a simple and self-contained proof of the compactness result due to Chen, Jungel, and Liu.</description>

      <title>Two dimensional graph model for epitaxial crystal growth with adatoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a model to describe stable configurations in epitaxial growth of crystals in the two dimensional case, and in the regime of linearized elasticity. The novelty is that the model also takes into consideration the adatom density on the surface of the film. These are behind the main mechanisms of crystal growth and formation of islands (or quantum dots). The main result of the paper is the integral representation of the relaxed energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a granular model for congested crowd motion and pedestrian flow. Our approach is based on an approximation through a Hele-Shaw type equation involving a degenerate operator of $p$-Laplacian type and a linear drift, for which we prove existence and uniqueness using nonlinear semigroup methods and the doubling variables technique. Our main result shows that, as $p \to \infty$, the weak solutions of the $p-$problem converge to a variational solution of the congested crowd motion problem.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we continue some investigations on the periodic NLSE started by Lebowitz, Rose and Speer and by Bourgain with the addition of a distributional multiplicative potential. We prove that the equation is globally wellposed for a set of data of full normalized Gibbs measure, after suitable truncation in the focusing case. The set and the measure are invariant under the flow. The main ingredients used are Strichartz estimates on periodic NLS with distributional potential to obtain local well-posedness for low regularity initial data.</description>

      <title>Bilinear Strichartz estimates on rescaled waveguides with applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We focus on the bilinear Strichartz estimates for free solutions to the Schr\"odinger equation on rescaled waveguides $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{T}_\lambda^n$, $\mathbb{T}_\lambda^n=(\lambda\mathbb{T})^n$ with $n\geq 1$ and their applications. First, we utilize a decoupling-type estimate originally from Fan-Staffilani-Wang-Wilson [Anal. PDE 11 (2018)] to establish a global-in-time bilinear Strichartz estimate with a `$N_2^\epsilon$' loss on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{T}^n_\lambda$ when $n\geq1$, which generalize the local-in time estimate in Zhao-Zheng [SIAM J. Math. Anal. (2021)] and fills a gap left by the unresolved case in Deng et al. [J. Func. Anal. 287 (2024)]. Second, we prove the local-in-time angularly refined bilinear Strichartz estimates on the 2d rescaled waveguide $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{T}_\lambda$, which generalize the estimate obtained by Takaoka [J. Differ. Equa. 394 (2024)] with $\lambda=1$. As applications, we show the local well-posedness and small data scattering for nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with algebraic nonlinearities in the critical space on $\mathbb R^m\times\mathbb{T}^n$ and the global well-posedness for cubic NLS on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{T}$ in the lower regularity space $H^s$ with $s&gt;\frac{1}{2}$.</description>

      <title>An ergodic theorem with weights and applications to random measures, RW homogenization and IPS hydrodynamics on point processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12348v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a multidimensional ergodic theorem with weighted averages for the action of the group $\mathbb{Z}^d$ on a probability space. At level $n$ weights are of the form $n^{-d} \psi(j/n)$, $ j\in \mathbb{Z}^d$, for real functions $\psi$ decaying suitably fast. We discuss applications to random measures and to quenched stochastic homogenization of random walks on simple point processes with long-range random jump rates, allowing to remove the technical Assumption (A9) from \cite[Theorem~4.4]{Fhom1}. This last result concerns also some semigroup and resolvent convergence particularly relevant for the derivation of the quenched hydrodynamic limit of interacting particle systems via homogenization and duality. As a consequence we show that also the quenched hydrodynamic limit of the symmetric simple exclusion process on point processes stated in \cite[Theorem~4.1]{F_SEP} remains valid when removing the above mentioned Assumption (A9).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04948v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We combine methods from microlocal analysis and dimension theory to study resonances with largest real part for an Anosov flow with smooth real valued potential. We show that the resonant states are closely related to special systems of measures supported on the stable manifolds introduced by Climenhaga. As a result, we relate the presence of the resonances on the critical axis to mixing properties of the flow with respect to certain equilibrium measures and show that these equilibrium measures can be reconstructed from the spectral theory of the Anosov flow.</description>

      <title>A Coupled Diffusion Approximation for Spatiotemporal Hemodynamic Response and Deoxygenated Blood Volume Fraction in Microcirculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background and Objective: This proof of concept study investigates mathematical modelling of blood flow and oxygen transport in cerebral microcirculation, focusing on understanding hemodynamic responses. By coupling oxygen transport models and blood flow dynamics, the research aims to predict spatiotemporal hemodynamic responses and their impact on blood oxygenation levels, particularly in the context of deoxygenated and total blood volume (DBV and TBV) fractions. Methods: A coupled spatiotemporal model is developed using Fick's law for diffusion, combined with the hemodynamic response function derived from a damped wave equation. The diffusion coefficient in Fick's law is based on Hagen-Poiseuille flow, and arterial blood flow is approximated numerically through pressure-Poisson equation (PPE). The equations are then numerically solved with the finite element method (FEM). Numerical experiments are performed on a high-resolution 7-Tesla Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) dataset for head segmentation, which facilitates the differentiation of arterial blood vessels and various brain tissue compartments. Results: The applicability of the model is further demonstrated through numerical experiments utilizing a 7 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dataset for head segmentation, which facilitates the differentiation of arterial blood vessels and various brain tissue compartments. By simulating hemodynamical responses and analyzing their impact on volumetric DBV and TBV, this study offers valuable insights into spatiotemporal modelling of brain tissue and blood flow. Conclusions: This study utilizes spatiotemporal modelling with high-resolution 7 Tesla-MRI head data to explore cerebral blood flow, oxygen transport, and brain dynamics. It enhances understanding of cardiovascular conditions, improves simulation accuracy, and offers potential clinical applications for targeted interventions.</description>

      <title>Polynomial mixing for white-forced Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation on the whole line</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our goal in this paper is to investigate ergodicity of white-forced Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation (KSE) on the whole line. Under the assumption that sufficiently many directions of the phase space are stochastically forced, we can prove that the dynamics is attractive toward a unique invariant probability measure with polynomial rate of any power. In order to prove this, we further develop coupling method and establish a sufficiently general criterion for polynomial mixing. The proof of polynomial mixing for KSE is obtained by the combination of the coupling criterion and the Foia\c{s}-Prodi estimate of KSE on the whole line.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a class of area-preserving curvature flows of closed planar curves, we prove that every immortal solution becomes asymptotically circular without any additional assumptions on initial data. As a particular corollary, every solution of zero enclosed area blows up in finite time. This settles an open problem posed by Escher--Ito in 2005 for Gage's area-preserving curve shortening flow, and moreover extends it to the surface diffusion flow of arbitrary order. We also establish a general existence theorem for nontrivial immortal solutions under almost circularity and rotational symmetry.</description>

En route to this we establish a Luckhaus type lemma for Yang$-$Mills connections to exclude curvature concentration along blow-up sequences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a new strategy to study Lagrangain mean curvature equation on open sets of $\mathbb{R}^{n}(n\geq2)$. By establishing an Allard-type regularity theorem, we obtain an interior Hessian estimate of solutions to this equation with prescribed Lipschitz critical and supercritical phases. Here, our condition on the phases is sharp. The proof heavily relies on geometric measure theory, geometry of Lagrangian graphs, and De Giorgi-Nash-Moser iteration. We expect that the techniques and ideas developed here can be used in some other equations.</description>
