      <title>Transmission Efficiency of the Recoil Mass Spectrometer EMMA at TRIUMF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mean transmission efficiency of the EMMA recoil mass spectrometer at TRIUMF has been measured with 6 different angular apertures at 17 kinetic energy/charge deviations with respect to the central, reference trajectory. Measurements performed using a 148Gd alpha source installed at the target position of the spectrometer are compared to ion-optical calculations and Monte Carlo simulations. The transmission efficiency as a function of angle and kinetic energy/charge is described empirically using piecewise Gaussian functions whose parameters are fit to the data.</description>

      <title>Compressive multi-beam scanning transmission electron microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a multi-beam scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) imaging that integrates down-sampling with super-resolution image reconstruction via a compressive sensing framework. A custom condenser aperture with six randomly positioned circular holes is employed to produce a multi-beam STEM probe, with beam distribution tuned through defocus. While the raw multi-beam images exhibit overlapping patterns, reconstruction using Adam optimization and total variation normalization yields high-fidelity images that closely reproduce the original sample structures, even from substantially down-sampled data. The proposed approach offers a pathway toward significant acceleration of such techniques through multibeam sparse sampling and computational reconstruction potentially useful for the analytical scanning methods in general.</description>

      <title>The Use of O2 in Gas Mixtures for Drift Chambers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of Oxygen in gas mixtures for drift chambers is highly discouraged because Oxygen, being strongly electronegative, is generally believed to lead, even in very small quantities, to extremely reduced drift electron attachment values, thus preventing the detector's operation.The drift chamber of the MEG II experiment at PSI has been operating for several years with a gas mixture that mainly contains He:Isobutane in relative proportions of 90:10% by molar concentration, in addition to 1.5% Isopropanol and 0.5% Oxygen. Oxygen and Isopropanol are essential for the proper functioning of the chamber. The electron attachment in the mixture used has proven negligible for the proper operation of the chamber and agrees well with the Garfield++ simulation after correctly accounting for the three-body attachment simulation.</description>

      <title>MPGD with a 3D-printed Thick-GEM as sole gain element</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first micropattern gaseous detector that employs a small 3D-printed Thick-GEM as its sole gain element. The detector can achieve sufficient gas gain for regular operation without the need for pre-amplification by additional gain elements. We describe the design, quality control, assembly, and test of this detector. The 10 cm $\times$ 10 cm active area of the Thick-GEM features three separate sectors with different sizes of the clearance rim annuli (0.1 mm, 0.15 mm, 0.2 mm) around the 0.7 mm diameter holes. The gas gain is found to depend strongly on the rim size. When operated in Ar/CO$_2$ 70:30 gas, the sector with 0.15 mm annulus rims reaches a gain above 10$^4$ while operating in a stable manner with an acceptably low discharge rate. The gain reach under stable operation is found to be considerably lower in the other two sectors. The gas gain shows a characteristic time-dependence as it rises quickly in the first hour of operation and then drops slowly over the next 24 hours and subsequently stabilizes.</description>

      <title>Real time synchronisation of a free-running atomic clock time base with UTC using GNSS signals for application in experimental physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the results obtained by applying, in real-time, a correction method to precisely synchronize a time base generated from a free-running atomic clock with the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The method uses the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals to have regular time comparisons between the atomic clock generated time base and the GPS Time, perform linear fits of the measurements and extrapolate a correction to apply to the free-running signal. In this work, we apply for the first time this method in real-time. Two atomic clocks were tested, a low-cost Rubidium clock and a more expensive magnetic Caesium clock. We demonstrate that we can obtain a residual difference between the clock time base and the French official realization of UTC (UTC(OP)) in the range of $\pm 15$ ns with no apparent residual drift.</description>

      <title>Delay Time Characterization on FPGA: A Low Nonlinearity, Picosecond Resolution Time-to-Digital Converter on 16-nm FPGA using Bin Sequence Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a Time-to-Digital Converter (TDC) implemented on a 16 nm Xilinx UltraScale Plus FPGA that achieves a resolution of 1.15 ps, RMS precision of 3.38 ps, a differential nonlinearity (DNL) of [-0.43, 0.24] LSB, and an integral nonlinearity (INL) of [-2.67, 0.15] LSB. This work introduces two novel hardware-independent post-processing techniques - Partial Order Reconstruction (POR) and Iterative Time-bin Interleaving (ITI) - that significantly enhance the performance of FPGA-based TDCs. POR addresses the missing code problem by inferring the partial order of each time bin through code density test data and directed acyclic graph (DAG) analysis, enabling near-complete recovery of usable bins. ITI further improves fine time resolution by merging multiple calibrated tapped delay lines (TDLs) into a single unified delay chain, achieving scalable resolution without resorting to averaging. Compared to state-of-the-art FPGA-based TDC architectures, the proposed methods deliver competitive or superior performance with reduced hardware overhead. These techniques are broadly applicable to high-resolution time measurement and precise delay calibration in programmable logic platforms.</description>

      <title>wa-hls4ml: A Benchmark and Surrogate Models for hls4ml Resource and Latency Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As machine learning (ML) is increasingly implemented in hardware to address real-time challenges in scientific applications, the development of advanced toolchains has significantly reduced the time required to iterate on various designs. These advancements have solved major obstacles, but also exposed new challenges. For example, processes that were not previously considered bottlenecks, such as hardware synthesis, are becoming limiting factors in the rapid iteration of designs. To mitigate these emerging constraints, multiple efforts have been undertaken to develop an ML-based surrogate model that estimates resource usage of ML accelerator architectures. We introduce wa-hls4ml, a benchmark for ML accelerator resource and latency estimation, and its corresponding initial dataset of over 680,000 fully connected and convolutional neural networks, all synthesized using hls4ml and targeting Xilinx FPGAs. The benchmark evaluates the performance of resource and latency predictors against several common ML model architectures, primarily originating from scientific domains, as exemplar models, and the average performance across a subset of the dataset. Additionally, we introduce GNN- and transformer-based surrogate models that predict latency and resources for ML accelerators. We present the architecture and performance of the models and find that the models generally predict latency and resources for the 75% percentile within several percent of the synthesized resources on the synthetic test dataset.</description>

      <title>Performance of the AstroPix Prototype Module for the Barrel Imaging Calorimeter at the ePIC Detector and in Space-Based Payloads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AstroPix is a high-voltage CMOS (HV-CMOS) monolithic active pixel sensor originally developed to enable precision gamma-ray imaging and spectroscopy in the medium-energy regime (approximately 100 keV-100 MeV) based on the groundwork laid by ATLASpix and MuPix. It features a 500 um pixel pitch, in-pixel amplification and digitization, and low power consumption (around 3-4 mW/cm^2), making it scalable for large-area, multilayer telescope detector planes. The detectors have a designed dynamic range of 25 keV to 700 keV.
  With these features, AstroPix meets the requirements of future space-based high-energy telescopes and the imaging layers of the Barrel Imaging Calorimeter (BIC) in the Electron-Proton/Ion Collider (ePIC) detector at the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). For the space-based payload, AstroPix is being integrated into sounding rocket and balloon payloads to demonstrate the technical readiness of the devices. For BIC, AstroPix-based imaging layers interleaved within the lead/scintillating-fiber (Pb/SciFi) sampling calorimeter provide granular shower imaging, enabling key performance features such as electron/pion or gamma/neutral-pion separation.
  As part of the ongoing detector R&amp;D efforts, we have been testing various AstroPix v3 configurations: the single chip, a quad-chip assembly, a three-layer stack of quad chips, and a nine-chip module that represents the smallest prototype unit of the BIC imaging layer. This presentation will highlight recent performance test results from these AstroPix detector configurations.</description>

      <title>Photodiode quantum efficiency for 2-{\mu}m light in the signal band of gravitational wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum technologies with quantum correlated light require photodiodes with near-perfect `true' quantum efficiency, the definition of which adequately accounts for the photodiode dark noise. Future squeezed-light-enhanced gravitational wave detectors could in principle achieve higher sensitivities with a longer laser wavelength around 2 {\mu}m. Photodiodes made of extended InGaAs are available for this range, but the true quantum efficiency at room temperature and the low frequency band of gravitational waves is strongly reduced by dark noise. Here we characterize the change in performance of a commercial extended-InGaAs photodiode versus temperature. While the dark noise decreases as expected with decreasing temperature, the detection efficiency unfortunately also decreases monotonically. Our results indicate the need for a dedicated new design of photodiodes for gravitational wave detectors using 2-{\mu}m laser light.</description>

Abstract: Electron spectroscopy implemented in electron microscopes provides high spatial resolution, down to the atomic scale, of the chemical, electronic, vibrational and optical properties of materials. In this review, we will describe how temporal coincidence experiments in the nanosecond to femtosecond range between different electron spectroscopies involving photons, inelastic electrons and secondary electrons can provide information bits not accessible to independent spectroscopies. In particular, we will focus on nano-optics applications. The instrumental modifications necessary for these experiments are discussed, as well as the perspectives for these coincidence techniques.</description>

      <title>Automated split Hopkinson pressure bar for high throughput dynamic experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designing novel materials for impact applications and predicting material behavior using data-driven techniques require extensive datasets, which can be challenging to obtain through conventional experimental methods. While high throughput characterization is feasible at the sample micro and nanoscale, there remains a critical need for an experimental tool capable of facilitating high-throughput measurements at the macroscale. This paper presents the design and development of a fully automated split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) with full-field diagnostics for performing dynamic compression experiments on different materials. The automated SHPB experiments consist of four main components: 1) striker launch and retrieval system, 2) bar repositioning mechanism, 3) automated sample placement system, and 4) diagnostics. Each of these systems employs various electromechanical devices and actuators programmed to work collaboratively to automate the SHPB experimental setup. A data analysis tool has been developed to automate the post-processing of the data obtained from the setup. The setup also incorporates automated high-speed imaging, enabling full-field strain measurement capabilities. To benchmark the setup, fully automated dynamic compression experiments were conducted on 45 Copper 101 samples and 20 3D-printed resin samples. The stress-strain curve was extracted from the raw data using the automated data analysis tool. The efficiency of the data analysis tool is validated by comparing the data with existing data analysis tools for SHPB. The stress-strain response obtained from the copper experiments aligned well with existing data on copper. Furthermore, the full-field strain measurements in experiments show strain values comparable to those of the strain gauge measurements. This advancement has enabled dynamic compression experiments on materials at a rate of 60 samples per hour.</description>

      <title>Silicon pinhole strip defects and their impact on ATLAS Inner Tracker HV current measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In preparation for the High-Luminsoity LHC (HL-LHC), the ATLAS detector will undergo major detector upgrades, including the replacement of the current Inner Detector with the new all-silicon Inner Tracker (ITk). The ITk consists of a pixel detector close to the beamline surrounded by a large-area strip detector. During detector production, the electrical properties of silicon sensors and readout electronics must be characterized through a series of quality control (QC) and quality assurance tests. These tests ensure any defect is captured at the earliest possible stage. One such defect, called a pinhole, occurs when the strip implant and the metal readout electrode are shorted through the intermediary dielectric layer. Notably, the introduction of pinholes during module assembly and pinhole effects on completed modules, especially on leakage current measurement circuitry, have never been studied. In this paper, we investigate the effect of such connections on the sensor leakage current measurements of completed modules and introduce new ways to locate pinholed strips. With minor modifications to testing procedures, such defects are shown not to impede module testing or performance.</description>
