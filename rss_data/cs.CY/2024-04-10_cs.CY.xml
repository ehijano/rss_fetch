      <title>Responsible Generative AI: What to Generate and What Not</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, generative AI (GenAI), like large language models and text-to-image models, has received significant attention across various domains. However, ensuring the responsible generation of content by these models is crucial for their real-world applicability. This raises an interesting question: \textit{What should responsible GenAI generate, and what should it not?} To answer the question, this paper investigates the practical responsible requirements of both textual and visual generative models, outlining five key considerations: generating truthful content, avoiding toxic content, refusing harmful instruction, leaking no training data-related content, and ensuring generated content identifiable. Specifically, we review recent advancements and challenges in addressing these requirements. Besides, we discuss and emphasize the importance of responsible GenAI across healthcare, education, finance, and artificial general intelligence domains. Through a unified perspective on both textual and visual generative models, this paper aims to provide insights into practical safety-related issues and further benefit the community in building responsible GenAI.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Latent Topics in Robotic Process Automation -- an Approach based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation Smart Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robotic process automation (RPA) is a software technology that in recent years has gained a lot of attention and popularity. By now, research on RPA has spread into multiple research streams. This study aims to create a science map of RPA and its aspects by revealing latent topics related to RPA, their research interest, impact, and time development. We provide a systematic framework that is helpful to develop further research into this technology. By using an unsupervised machine learning method based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation, we were able to analyse over 2000 paper abstracts. Among these, we found 100 distinct study topics, 15 of which have been included in the science map we provide.</description>

      <title>Approaching Emergent Risks: An Exploratory Study into Artificial Intelligence Risk Management within Financial Organisations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Globally, artificial intelligence (AI) implementation is growing, holding the capability to fundamentally alter organisational processes and decision making. Simultaneously, this brings a multitude of emergent risks to organisations, exposing vulnerabilities in their extant risk management frameworks. This necessitates a greater understanding of how organisations can position themselves in response. This issue is particularly pertinent within the financial sector with relatively mature AI applications matched with severe societal repercussions of potential risk events. Despite this, academic risk management literature is trailing behind the speed of AI implementation. Adopting a management perspective, this study aims to contribute to the understanding of AI risk management in organisations through an exploratory empirical investigation into these practices. In-depth insights are gained through interviews with nine practitioners from different organisations within the UK financial sector. Through examining areas of organisational convergence and divergence, the findings of this study unearth levels of risk management framework readiness and prevailing approaches to risk management at both a processual and organisational level. Whilst enhancing the developing literature concerning AI risk management within organisations, the study simultaneously offers a practical contribution, providing key areas of guidance for practitioners in the operational development of AI risk management frameworks.</description>

      <title>Automatic Authorities: Power and AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As rapid advances in Artificial Intelligence and the rise of some of history's most potent corporations meet the diminished neoliberal state, people are increasingly subject to power exercised by means of automated systems. Machine learning and related computational technologies now underpin vital government services. They connect consumers and producers in new algorithmic markets. They determine how we find out about everything from how to vote to where to get vaccinated, and whose speech is amplified, reduced, or restricted. And a new wave of products based on Large Language Models (LLMs) will further transform our economic and political lives. Automatic Authorities are automated computational systems used to exercise power over us by determining what we may know, what we may have, and what our options will be. In response to their rise, scholars working on the societal impacts of AI and related technologies have advocated shifting attention from how to make AI systems beneficial or fair towards a critical analysis of these new power relations. But power is everywhere, and is not necessarily bad. On what basis should we object to new or intensified power relations, and what can be done to justify them? This paper introduces the philosophical materials with which to formulate these questions, and offers preliminary answers. It starts by pinning down the concept of power, focusing on the ability that some agents have to shape others' lives. It then explores how AI enables and intensifies the exercise of power so understood, and sketches three problems with power and three ways to solve those problems. It emphasises, in particular, that justifying power requires more than satisfying substantive justificatory criteria; standards of proper authority and procedural legitimacy must also be met. We need to know not only what power may be used for, but how it may be used, and by whom.</description>

      <title>Youth as Peer Auditors: Engaging Teenagers with Algorithm Auditing of Machine Learning Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) applications become more pervasive in youth lives, supporting them to interact, design, and evaluate applications is crucial. This paper positions youth as auditors of their peers' ML-powered applications to better understand algorithmic systems' opaque inner workings and external impacts. In a two-week workshop, 13 youth (ages 14-15) designed and audited ML-powered applications. We analyzed pre/post clinical interviews in which youth were presented with auditing tasks. The analyses show that after the workshop all youth identified algorithmic biases and inferred dataset and model design issues. Youth also discussed algorithmic justice issues and ML model improvements. Furthermore, youth reflected that auditing provided them new perspectives on model functionality and ideas to improve their own models. This work contributes (1) a conceptualization of algorithm auditing for youth; and (2) empirical evidence of the potential benefits of auditing. We discuss potential uses of algorithm auditing in learning and child-computer interaction research.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Three Programming Error Measures for Explaining Variability in CS1 Grades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Programming courses can be challenging for first year university students, especially for those without prior coding experience. Students initially struggle with code syntax, but as more advanced topics are introduced across a semester, the difficulty in learning to program shifts to learning computational thinking (e.g., debugging strategies). This study examined the relationships between students' rate of programming errors and their grades on two exams. Using an online integrated development environment, data were collected from 280 students in a Java programming course. The course had two parts. The first focused on introductory procedural programming and culminated with exam 1, while the second part covered more complex topics and object-oriented programming and ended with exam 2. To measure students' programming abilities, 51095 code snapshots were collected from students while they completed assignments that were autograded based on unit tests. Compiler and runtime errors were extracted from the snapshots, and three measures -- Error Count, Error Quotient and Repeated Error Density -- were explored to identify the best measure explaining variability in exam grades. Models utilizing Error Quotient outperformed the models using the other two measures, in terms of the explained variability in grades and Bayesian Information Criterion. Compiler errors were significant predictors of exam 1 grades but not exam 2 grades; only runtime errors significantly predicted exam 2 grades. The findings indicate that leveraging Error Quotient with multiple error types (compiler and runtime) may be a better measure of students' introductory programming abilities, though still not explaining most of the observed variability.</description>

      <title>AEGIS: Online Adaptive AI Content Safety Moderation with Ensemble of LLM Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative AI become more widespread, the content safety risks associated with their use also increase. We find a notable deficiency in high-quality content safety datasets and benchmarks that comprehensively cover a wide range of critical safety areas. To address this, we define a broad content safety risk taxonomy, comprising 13 critical risk and 9 sparse risk categories. Additionally, we curate AEGISSAFETYDATASET, a new dataset of approximately 26, 000 human-LLM interaction instances, complete with human annotations adhering to the taxonomy. We plan to release this dataset to the community to further research and to help benchmark LLM models for safety. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the dataset, we instruction-tune multiple LLM-based safety models. We show that our models (named AEGISSAFETYEXPERTS), not only surpass or perform competitively with the state-of-the-art LLM-based safety models and general purpose LLMs, but also exhibit robustness across multiple jail-break attack categories. We also show how using AEGISSAFETYDATASET during the LLM alignment phase does not negatively impact the performance of the aligned models on MT Bench scores. Furthermore, we propose AEGIS, a novel application of a no-regret online adaptation framework with strong theoretical guarantees, to perform content moderation with an ensemble of LLM content safety experts in deployment</description>

      <title>Is Your AI Truly Yours? Leveraging Blockchain for Copyrights, Provenance, and Lineage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) integrates into diverse areas, particularly in content generation, ensuring rightful ownership and ethical use becomes paramount. AI service providers are expected to prioritize responsibly sourcing training data and obtaining licenses from data owners. However, existing studies primarily center on safeguarding static copyrights, which simply treats metadata/datasets as non-fungible items with transferable/trading capabilities, neglecting the dynamic nature of training procedures that can shape an ongoing trajectory.
  In this paper, we present \textsc{IBis}, a blockchain-based framework tailored for AI model training workflows. \textsc{IBis} integrates on-chain registries for datasets, licenses and models, alongside off-chain signing services to facilitate collaboration among multiple participants. Our framework addresses concerns regarding data and model provenance and copyright compliance. \textsc{IBis} enables iterative model retraining and fine-tuning, and offers flexible license checks and renewals. Further, \textsc{IBis} provides APIs designed for seamless integration with existing contract management software, minimizing disruptions to established model training processes. We implement \textsc{IBis} using Daml on the Canton blockchain. Evaluation results showcase the feasibility and scalability of \textsc{IBis} across varying numbers of users, datasets, models, and licenses.</description>

      <title>Echo Chambers in the Age of Algorithms: An Audit of Twitter's Friend Recommender System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The presence of political misinformation and ideological echo chambers on social media platforms is concerning given the important role that these sites play in the public's exposure to news and current events. Algorithmic systems employed on these platforms are presumed to play a role in these phenomena, but little is known about their mechanisms and effects. In this work, we conduct an algorithmic audit of Twitter's Who-To-Follow friend recommendation system, the first empirical audit that investigates the impact of this algorithm in-situ. We create automated Twitter accounts that initially follow left and right affiliated U.S. politicians during the 2022 U.S. midterm elections and then grow their information networks using the platform's recommender system. We pair the experiment with an observational study of Twitter users who already follow the same politicians. Broadly, we find that while following the recommendation algorithm leads accounts into dense and reciprocal neighborhoods that structurally resemble echo chambers, the recommender also results in less political homogeneity of a user's network compared to accounts growing their networks through social endorsement. Furthermore, accounts that exclusively followed users recommended by the algorithm had fewer opportunities to encounter content centered on false or misleading election narratives compared to choosing friends based on social endorsement.</description>

      <title>Public-private funding models in open source software development: A case study on scikit-learn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Governments are increasingly allocating funding for open source software (OSS) development in order to address concerns related to software security, digital sovereignty, and the competitiveness of domestic software markets, amongst others. While such funding is generally welcomed by OSS practitioners, how OSS developers perceive the relative benefits and drawbacks of governmental funding remains an open question. This paper explores this question through a case study on scikit-learn, a Python library for machine learning, whose funding model combines research grants, commercial sponsorship, community donations, and a 32 million EUR grant from the French government's artificial intelligence strategy. Through 25 interviews with scikit-learn maintainers and funders, this study makes two key contributions with implications for research and practice. First, it provides novel insights into the role of a public-private funding model in a successful, community-led OSS project and how maintainers evaluate their funding model. Furthermore, it highlights the governance mechanisms employed by maintainers to safeguard the community ethos of the project. Second, it offers practical implications for OSS developer communities, companies, and governments. For OSS communities, the study illustrates the benefits of a diversified funding model in balancing the merits and drawbacks of different funding sources. For companies, it serves as a reminder that sponsoring developers or directly funding OSS projects can significantly support OSS maintainers, who often struggle with limited resources and towering workloads. For governments, the findings emphasise the importance of funding the maintenance of existing OSS projects in addition to or exclusively funding new innovations. The paper concludes with suggestions for future research on OSS funding models.</description>

Abstract: With continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), data-driven models on blood glucose prediction have been shown to be effective in related work. However, such (CGM) systems are not always available, e.g., for a patient at home. In this work, we conduct a study on 9 patients and examine the online predictability of data-driven (aka. machine learning) based models on patient-level blood glucose prediction; with measurements are taken only periodically (i.e., after several hours). To this end, we propose several post-prediction methods to account for the noise nature of these data, that marginally improves the performance of the end system.</description>

      <title>The use of the open innovation paradigm in the public sector: a systematic review of published studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of the open innovation paradigm has been, over the past years, getting special attention in the public sector. Motivated by an urban environment that is increasingly more complex and challenging, several government agencies have been allocating financial resources and efforts to promote open and participative government initiatives. As a way to try and understand this scenario, a systematic review of the literature was conducted, to provide a comprehensive analysis of the scientific papers that were published, seeking to capture, classify, evaluate and synthesize how the use of this paradigm has been put into practice in the public sector. In total, 4,741 preliminary studies were analyzed. From this number, only 37 articles were classified as potentially relevant and moved forward, going through the process of data extraction and analysis. From the data obtained, it was possible to verify that the use of this paradigm started to be reported with a higher frequency in the literature since 2013 and, among the main findings, we highlight the reports of experiences, approach propositions, of understanding how the phenomenon occurs and theoretical reflections. It was also possible to verify that the use of open innovation through social media was one of the pioneer techniques of engagement between the public sector and citizens. In conclusion, the reports confirm that the main challenges of this paradigm applied to the public sector are associated with their respective bureaucratic aspects, therefore lacking a bigger reflection on the procedures and methods to be used in the public sphere.</description>

Abstract: Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) will transform many aspects of our lives and society, bringing immense opportunities but also posing significant risks and challenges. The next several decades may well be a turning point for humanity, comparable to the industrial revolution. We write to share a set of recommendations for moving forward from the perspective of the founder and leaders of the One Hundred Year Study on AI. Launched a decade ago, the project is committed to a perpetual series of studies by multidisciplinary experts to evaluate the immediate, longer-term, and far-reaching effects of AI on people and society, and to make recommendations about AI research, policy, and practice. As we witness new capabilities emerging from neural models, it is crucial that we engage in efforts to advance our scientific understanding of these models and their behaviors. We must address the impact of AI on people and society through technical, social, and sociotechnical lenses, incorporating insights from a diverse range of experts including voices from engineering, social, behavioral, and economic disciplines. By fostering dialogue, collaboration, and action among various stakeholders, we can strategically guide the development and deployment of AI in ways that maximize its potential for contributing to human flourishing. Despite the growing divide in the field between focusing on short-term versus long-term implications, we think both are of critical importance. As Alan Turing, one of the pioneers of AI, wrote in 1950, "We can only see a short distance ahead, but we can see plenty there that needs to be done." We offer ten recommendations for action that collectively address both the short- and long-term potential impacts of AI technologies.</description>

      <title>Bias Amplification Enhances Minority Group Performance</title>

Abstract: Neural networks produced by standard training are known to suffer from poor accuracy on rare subgroups despite achieving high accuracy on average, due to the correlations between certain spurious features and labels. Previous approaches based on worst-group loss minimization (e.g. Group-DRO) are effective in improving worse-group accuracy but require expensive group annotations for all the training samples. In this paper, we focus on the more challenging and realistic setting where group annotations are only available on a small validation set or are not available at all. We propose BAM, a novel two-stage training algorithm: in the first stage, the model is trained using a bias amplification scheme via introducing a learnable auxiliary variable for each training sample; in the second stage, we upweight the samples that the bias-amplified model misclassifies, and then continue training the same model on the reweighted dataset. Empirically, BAM achieves competitive performance compared with existing methods evaluated on spurious correlation benchmarks in computer vision and natural language processing. Moreover, we find a simple stopping criterion based on minimum class accuracy difference that can remove the need for group annotations, with little or no loss in worst-group accuracy. We perform extensive analyses and ablations to verify the effectiveness and robustness of our algorithm in varying class and group imbalance ratios.</description>

      <title>Global Geolocated Realtime Data of Interfleet Urban Transit Bus Idling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Urban transit bus idling is a contributor to ecological stress, economic inefficiency, and medically hazardous health outcomes due to emissions. The global accumulation of this frequent pattern of undesirable driving behavior is enormous. In order to measure its scale, we propose GRD-TRT- BUF-4I (Ground Truth Buffer for Idling) an extensible, realtime detection system that records the geolocation and idling duration of urban transit bus fleets internationally. Using live vehicle locations from General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) Realtime, the system detects approximately 200,000 idling events per day from over 50 cities across North America, Europe, Oceania, and Asia. This realtime data was created to dynamically serve operational decision-making and fleet management to reduce the frequency and duration of idling events as they occur, as well as to capture its accumulative effects. Civil and Transportation Engineers, Urban Planners, Epidemiologists, Policymakers, and other stakeholders might find this useful for emissions modeling, traffic management, route planning, and other urban sustainability efforts at a variety of geographic and temporal scales.</description>

      <title>Flexible Fairness Learning via Inverse Conditional Permutation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Equalized odds, as a popular notion of algorithmic fairness, aims to ensure that sensitive variables, such as race and gender, do not unfairly influence the algorithm prediction when conditioning on the true outcome. Despite rapid advancements, most of the current research focuses on the violation of equalized odds caused by one sensitive attribute, leaving the challenge of simultaneously accounting for multiple attributes under-addressed. We address this gap by introducing a fairness learning approach that integrates adversarial learning with a novel inverse conditional permutation. This approach effectively and flexibly handles multiple sensitive attributes, potentially of mixed data types. The efficacy and flexibility of our method are demonstrated through both simulation studies and empirical analysis of real-world datasets.</description>
