      <title>Evidence for an Instability-Induced Binary Merger in the Double-Peaked, Helium-Rich Type IIn Supernova 2023zkd</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present ultraviolet to infrared observations of the extraordinary Type IIn supernova 2023zkd (SN 2023zkd). Photometrically, it exhibits persistent and luminous precursor emission spanning $\sim$4 years preceding discovery ($M_r\approx-15$ mag, 1,500~days in the observer frame), followed by a secondary stage of gradual brightening in its final year. Post-discovery, it exhibits two photometric peaks of comparable brightness ($M_r\lesssim-18.7$ mag and $M_r\approx-18.4$ mag, respectively) separated by 240 days. Spectroscopically, SN 2023zkd exhibits highly asymmetric and multi-component Balmer and He I profiles that we attribute to ejecta interaction with fast-moving ($1,\!000-2,\!000\;\mathrm{km}\;\mathrm{s}^{-1}$) He-rich polar material and slow-moving ($\sim$$400\;\mathrm{km}\;\mathrm{s}^{-1}$) equatorially-distributed H-rich material. He II features also appear during the second light curve peak and evolve rapidly. Shock-driven models fit to the multi-band photometry suggest that the event is powered by interaction with $\sim$$5-6\;M_{\odot}$ of CSM, with $2-3\;M_{\odot}$ associated with each light curve peak, expelled during mass-loss episodes $\sim$$3-4$ and $\sim$$1-2$ years prior to explosion. The observed precursor emission, combined with the extreme mass-loss rates required to power each light curve peak, favors either super-Eddington accretion onto a black hole or multiple long-lived eruptions from a massive star to luminosities that have not been previously observed. We consider multiple progenitor scenarios for SN 2023zkd, and find that the brightening optical precursor and inferred explosion properties are most consistent with a massive ($M_{\mathrm{ZAMS}}\geq30\;M_{\odot}$) and partially-stripped He star undergoing an instability-induced merger with a black hole companion.</description>

      <title>Low-Luminosity Type IIP Supernovae from the Zwicky Transient Facility Census of the Local Universe. I: Luminosity Function, Volumetric Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the luminosity function and volumetric rate of a sample of Type IIP supernovae (SNe) from the Zwicky Transient Facility Census of the Local Universe survey (CLU). This is the largest sample of Type IIP SNe from a systematic volume-limited survey to-date. The final sample includes 330 Type IIP SNe and 36 low-luminosity Type II (LLIIP) SNe with $M_{\textrm{r,peak}}&gt;-16$ mag, which triples the literature sample of LLIIP SNe. The fraction of LLIIP SNe is $19^{+3}_{-4}\%$ of the total CLU Type IIP SNe population ($8^{+1}_{-2}\%$ of all core-collapse SNe). This implies that while LLIIP SNe likely represent the fate of core-collapse SNe of $8-12$ \Msun\ progenitors, they alone cannot account for the fate of all massive stars in this mass range. To derive an absolute rate, we estimate the ZTF pipeline efficiency as a function of the apparent magnitude and the local surface brightness. We derive a volumetric rate of $(3.9_{-0.4}^{+0.4}) \times 10^{4}\ \textrm{Gpc}^{-3}\ \textrm{yr}^{-1}$ for Type IIP SNe and $(7.3_{-0.6}^{+0.6}) \times 10^{3}\ \textrm{Gpc}^{-3}\ \textrm{yr}^{-1}$ for LLIIP SNe. Now that the rate of LLIIP SNe is robustly derived, the unresolved discrepancy between core-collapse SN rates and star-formation rates cannot be explained by LLIIP SNe alone.</description>

      <title>Galaxy-cluster-stacked Fermi-LAT II: extended central hadronic signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Faint $\gamma$-ray signatures emerge in Fermi-LAT data stacked scaled to the characteristic $\theta_{500}$ angles of MCXC galaxy clusters. After Paper I of this series thus discovered virial shocks, later supported in other bands, this second paper focuses on cluster cores. Stacking $1$-$100$ GeV source-masked data around clusters shows a significant ($4.7\sigma$ for 75 clusters) and extended central excess, inconsistent with central point sources. The resolved signal is best fit ($3.7\sigma$ TS-test) as hadronic emission from a cosmic-ray ion (CRI) distribution that is flat both spectrally ($p\equiv1-d\ln u/d\ln E=2.0\pm0.3$) and spatially (CRI-to-gas index $\sigma=0.1\pm0.4$), carrying an energy density $du(0.1\theta_{500})/d\ln E=10^{-13.6\pm0.5}$ erg cm$^{-3}$ at $E=100$ GeV energy; insufficient resolution would raise $p$ and $\sigma$. Such CRI match the long-predicted distribution needed to power diffuse intracluster radio emission in its various forms (mini-halos, giant halos, standard relics, their transitional forms, and mega-halos), disfavoring models that invoke electron (re)acceleration in weak shocks or turbulence. Stringent upper limits on residual $\gamma$-ray emission, e.g. from dark-matter annihilation, are imposed.</description>

      <title>Rates of Strongly Lensed Tidal Disruption Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the coming years, surveys such as the Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) are expected to increase the number of observed Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) substantially. We employ Monte Carlo integration to calculate the unlensed and lensed TDE rate as a function of limiting magnitude in $u$, $g$, $r$, and $i$-bands. We investigate the impact of multiple luminosity models, black hole mass functions (BHMFs), and flare temperatures on the TDE rate. Notably, this includes a semi-analytical model, which enables the determination of the TDE temperature in terms of black hole (BH) mass. We predict the highest unlensed TDE rate to be in $g$-band. It ranges from $16$ to $5,440\;\mathrm{yr}^{-1}\;(20,000\;\mathrm{deg}^2)^{-1}$ for the Zwicky Transient Facility, being more consistent with the observed rate at the low end. For LSST, we expect a rate in $g$-band between $3,580$ and $82,060\;\mathrm{yr}^{-1}\;(20,000\;\mathrm{deg}^2)^{-1}$. A higher theoretical prediction is understandable, as we do not consider observational effects such as completeness. The unlensed and lensed TDE rates are insensitive to the redshift evolution of the BHMF, even for LSST limiting magnitudes. The best band for detecting lensed TDEs is also $g$-band. Its predicted rates range from $0.43$ to $15\;\mathrm{yr}^{-1}\;(20,000\;\mathrm{deg}^2)^{-1}$ for LSST. The scatter of predicted rates reduces when we consider the fraction of lensed TDEs; that is, a few in ten thousand TDEs will be lensed. Despite the large scatter in the rates of lensed TDEs, our comprehensive considerations of multiple models suggest that lensed TDEs will occur in the $10$-year LSST lifetime, providing an exciting prospect for detecting such events. We expect the median redshift of a lensed TDE to be between $1.5$ and $2$. In this paper, we additionally report on lensed TDE properties, such as the BH mass and time delays.</description>

      <title>The Non-Uniform Expansion of the Crab Nebula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present extensive proper motion measurements of the Crab Nebula made from Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope MegaPrime/MegaCam images taken in 2007, 2016, and 2019. A total of 19974 proper motion vectors with uncertainty $&lt;10$\,mas\,yr$^{-1}$ located over the majority of the Crab Nebula are used to map the supernova remnant's two-dimensional expansion properties that reflect the dynamics of the original explosion, acceleration of ejecta imparted by spin-down energy from the pulsar, and interaction between the ejecta and surrounding cicumstellar material (CSM). The average convergence date we derive is 1105.5 $\pm$ 0.5 CE, which is 15-35 yr earlier compared to most previous estimates. We find that it varies as a function of position angle around the nebula, with the earliest date and smallest proper motions measured along the equator defined by the east and west bays. The lower acceleration of material along the equatorial plane may be indicative of the supernova's interaction with a disk-like CSM geometry. Comparing our measurements to previous analytical solutions of the Crab's expansion and our own numerical simulation using the moving mesh hydrodynamics code \texttt{Sprout}, we conclude that the ejecta have relaxed closer to homologous expansion than expected for the commonly adopted pulsar spindown age of $\tau \sim 700$ yr and a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) still evolving inside the flat part of the ejecta density profile. These findings provide further evidence that the PWN has broken out of the inner flat part of the supernova ejecta density profile and has experienced ``blowout''.</description>

      <title>Insight-HXMT observations on thermonuclear X-ray bursts from 4U~1608--52 in the low/hard state: the energy-dependant hard X-ray deficit and cooling saturation of the corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During thermonuclear bursts, it is suspected that {\bf the cooling of the corona by the burst emission}
  may be the cause of hard X-ray {\bf deficits}. Although this {\bf deficit} has been observed in nine sources, it has not been observed {\bf from} 4U~1608--52, a nearby prolific burster. Therefore, the authenticity and universality of the hard X-ray {\bf deficit} may be in question. To investigate this suspicion, Insight-HXMT performed cadence observations during the low/hard state of 4U~1608--52 in September 2022 and detected 10 thermonuclear X-ray bursts. Two of these bursts show a double-peaked structure in the soft X-ray band, which could be caused by the high temperature of the burst emission and a marginal photospheric radius expansion (PRE) around the burst peak time. This is indicated by their peak fluxes being up to the Eddington limit and having a large color factor at the peak of the bursts. The hard X-ray deficit is significantly observed during bursts at $&gt;$ 30 keV. Furthermore, the fraction of this deficit shows saturation at 50\% for the first 8 bursts. This saturation may indicate that the corona is layered and only a part of the corona is cooled by the bursts. For example, the part close to the NS surface is cooled while the rest remains intact during bursts. This result provides a clue to the geometry of the corona, e.g., a possible scenario is that the corona has two forms: a quasi-spheric corona between the NS and the disk, and a disk-corona on both surfaces of the disk.</description>

      <title>Probing the PeV Region in the Astrophysical Neutrino Spectrum using $\nu_\mu$ from the Southern Sky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: IceCube has observed a diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux over the energy region from a few TeV to a few PeV. At PeV energies, the spectral shape is not yet well measured due to the low statistics of the data. This analysis probes the gap between 1 PeV and 10 PeV by using high-energy downgoing muon neutrinos. To reject the large atmospheric muon background, two complementary techniques are combined. The first technique selects events with high stochasticity to reject atmospheric muon bundles whose stochastic energy losses are smoothed due to high muon multiplicity. The second technique vetoes atmospheric muons with the IceTop surface array. Using 9 years of data, we found two neutrino candidate events in the signal region, consistent with expectation from background, each with relatively high signal probabilities. A joint maximum likelihood estimation is performed using this sample and an independent 9.5-year sample of tracks to measure the neutrino spectrum. A likelihood ratio test is done to compare the single power-law (SPL) vs. SPL+cutoff hypothesis; the SPL+cutoff model is not significantly better than the SPL. High-energy astrophysical objects from four source catalogs are also checked around the direction of the two events. No significant coincidence was found.</description>

      <title>Insight-HXMT observations on thermonuclear X-ray bursts from 4U~1608--52 in 2022: the accretion rate dependent anisotropy of burst emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermonuclear X-ray bursts occur on the surface of an accreting neutron star (NS), and their characteristics and interplay with the surrounding circumstance could be a clue to understand the nature of the NS and accretion process. For this purpose, Insight-HXMT has performed high cadence observations on the bright thermonuclear X-ray burster--4U~1608--52 during its outburst in July and August 2022; nine bursts were detected, including seven bursts with the photospheric radius expansion (PRE).
  Time-resolved spectroscopy of the bright PRE bursts reveals that an enhancement of accretion rate or the Comptonization of the burst emission by the corona could reduce the residuals when fitting their spectra with the conventional model--blackbody. The inferred energy increment rate of the burst photon gained from the corona is up to $\sim$40\%, even though the bursts have different peak fluxes and locate at different accretion rates. Moreover, the flux shortage of the rising PRE is observed in the bursts at a high mass accretion rate, but not for the burst with a faint persistent emission, which has been predicted theoretically but first observed in this work. If the flux shortage is due to the disk obscuration, i.e., the burst emission is anisotropic, the phenomenon above could indicate that the anisotropy of the burst emission is accretion rate dependent, which could also be evidence of the truncated disk in the low/hard state.</description>

      <title>Solid Identification of Extragalactic Gamma-Ray Source Using High-Resolution Radio Interferometric Observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dominant fraction of the extragalactic $\gamma$-ray sources are blazars, active galactic nuclei with jets inclined at a small angle to the line of sight. Apart from blazars, a few dozen narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1) and a number of radio galaxies are associated with $\gamma$-ray sources. The identification of $\gamma$-ray sources requires multiwavelength follow-up observations since several candidates could reside within the relatively large $\gamma$-ray localisation area. The $\gamma$-ray source 4FGL 0959.6+4606 was originally associated with a radio galaxy. However, follow-up multiwavelength work suggested a nearby NLS1 as the more probable origin of the $\gamma$-ray emission. We performed high-resolution very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observation at 5 GHz of both proposed counterparts of 4FGL 0959.6+4606. We clearly detected the NLS1 source SDSS J095909.51+460014.3 with relativistically boosted jet emission. On the other hand, we did not detect milliarcsecond-scale compact emission in the radio galaxy 2MASX J09591976+4603515. Our VLBI imaging results suggest that the NLS1 object is the origin of the $\gamma$-ray emission in 4FGL 0959.6+4606.</description>

      <title>The diffuse extragalactic gamma-ray background radiation: star-forming galaxies are not the dominant component</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Star-forming galaxies (SFGs) are considered to be an important component of the diffuse extragalactic gamma-ray background (EGB) radiation observed in 0.1 -- 820 GeV, but their quantitative contribution has not yet been precisely determined. In this study, we aim to provide the currently most reliable estimate of the contribution of SFGs based on careful calibration with gamma-ray luminosities of nearby galaxies and physical quantities (star formation rate, stellar mass, and size) of galaxies observed by high-redshift galaxy surveys. Our calculations are based on the latest database of particle collision cross-sections and energy spectra of secondary particles, and take into account not only hadronic but also leptonic processes with various radiation fields in a galaxy. We find that SFGs are not the dominant component of the unresolved EGB measured by Fermi; the largest contribution is around 50% -- 60% in the 1 -- 10 GeV region, and the contribution falls rapidly in lower and higher energy ranges. This result appears to contradict a previous study, which claimed that SFGs are the dominant component of the unresolved EGB, and the origin of the discrepancy is examined. In calculations of cosmic-ray production, propagation, and interaction in a galaxy, we try models developed by two independent groups and find that they have little impact on EGB.</description>

      <title>H I absorption line and anomalous dispersion in the radio pulses of PSR B1937+21</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) to observe the bright millisecond pulsar (MSP) PSR B1937+21 (J1939+2134) and record the data in the band from 1.0 GHz to 1.5 GHz. We measure the neutral hydrogen (HI) emission and absorption lines near 1420 MHz ($\lambda \simeq 21$ cm). We derive the kinematic distance of the pulsar with the HI observation, and update the upper bound of kinematic distance from the previous $14.8\pm 0.9$ npc in the Outer Arm to the nearer $9.4\pm 0.5$ kpc in the Perseus Arm. By comparing with the archival absorption spectra observed decades ago, we notice possible variations in the absorption spectra towards this pulsar, which corresponds to a possible tiny-scale atomic structure (TSAS) of a few AU in size. We also verify the apparent faster-than-light anomalous dispersion at the HI absorption line of this pulsar previously reported.</description>

      <title>Science Potential and Technical Design of the IceCube-Gen2 Surface Array (UHECR 2024)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: IceCube-Gen2, the next generation extension of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory at the South Pole, offers a unique scientific potential for cosmic-ray physics at PeV to EeV energies complementing the main science case of neutrino astronomy. The cosmic-ray science case will be enabled by a surface array on top of an extended optical array deep in the polar ice. The optical array measures TeV muons of air showers, and the surface array primarily measures the electromagnetic shower component and low-energy muons. The design of the surface array foresees scintillation panels providing a full-efficiency threshold for near-vertical proton showers of 0.5 PeV and radio antennas increasing the measurement accuracy for the electromagnetic shower component in the energy range of the Galactic-to-extragalactic transition. Compared to IceCube, the aperture for air showers measured in coincidence with the surface and optical arrays will increase by a factor of 30, due to the larger area and angular acceptance in zenith angle. The science potential includes both, the particle physics of air showers, such as prompt muons, and the astrophysics of the highest energy Galactic cosmic-rays, enabled by the higher sensitivity for the mass composition and anisotropy of cosmic rays, and by the search for PeV photons. This proceeding summarizes the science case and design of the surface array as presented in the recently released IceCube-Gen2 Technical Design Report: https://icecube-gen2.wisc.edu/science/publications/tdr/</description>

      <title>Radio Detection of ultra-high-energy Cosmic-Ray Air Showers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio antennas have become a standard tool for the detection of cosmic-ray air showers in the energy range above $10^{16}\,$eV. The radio signal of these air showers is generated mostly due to the deflection of electrons and positrons in the geomagnetic field, and contains information about the energy and the depth of the maximum of the air showers. Unlike the traditional air-Cherenkov and air-fluorescence techniques for the electromagnetic shower component, radio detection is not restricted to clear nights, and recent experiments have demonstrated that the measurement accuracy can compete with these traditional techniques. Numerous particle detector arrays for air showers have thus been or will be complemented by radio antennas. In particular when combined with muon detectors, the complementary information provided by the radio antennas can enhance the total accuracy for the arrival direction, energy and mass of the primary cosmic rays. Digitization and computational techniques have been crucial for this recent progress, and radio detection will play an important role in next-generation experiments for ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. Moreover, stand-alone radio experiments are under development and will search for ultra-high-energy photons and neutrinos in addition to cosmic rays. This article provides a brief introduction to the physics of the radio emission of air showers, an overview of air-shower observatories using radio antennas, and highlights some of their recent results.</description>

      <title>On Bactrian glitch-size distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A glitch is a rare and sudden increase in the otherwise steadily decreasing rotation rate of a pulsar. Its cause is widely attributed to the transfer of angular momentum to the crust of the star from the array of superfluid vortices enclosed within. The magnitude of such an increase defines the size of the glitch. The distribution of glitch sizes in individual pulsars, the power-law being the most argued for, is shrouded in uncertainty due to the small sample size. From a Bayesian perspective, we revisit the data for PSR J0537-6910, the pulsar with the most glitches, and find a bimodality in the distribution, reminiscent of the Bactrian camel. To understand this bimodality, we use a superfluid vortex simulator and study three independent neutron star paradigms: (i) Annular variation in pinning strength to account for the predicted differences between the crust and the core; (ii) Sectorial triggers to mimic local disturbances; and (iii) Stress-waves to model global disturbances. We find that annular variation in pinning introduces a bimodality in the glitch-size distribution and that sectorial triggers do so weakly. Stress-waves do not lead to any such features for the range of parameters tested. This provides us with new insights into the effects of various perturbations on the vortex dynamics and the glitch statistics of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Timing and Spectral Evolution of the Magnetar 1E 1841-045 in Outburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the timing and spectral analyses of the NICER, NuSTAR, and IXPE observations of the magnetar 1E 1841-045 covering 82 days following its August 2024 bursting activity as well as radio observations utilizing MeerKAT and Effelsberg. We supplement our study with a historical NuSTAR and all 2024 pre-outburst NICER observations. The outburst is marked by an X-ray flux enhancement of a factor 1.6 compared to the historical level, predominantly driven by a newly-formed non-thermal emitting component with a photon index $\Gamma=1.5$. This flux showed a 20% decay at the end of our monitoring campaign. The radio monitoring did not reveal any pulsed radio emission with an upper-limit of 20 mJy and 50 mJy ms on the mean flux density and single pulse fluence, respectively. We detect a spin-up glitch at outburst onset with a $\Delta\nu=6.1\times10^{-8}$ Hz and a $\Delta\dot{\nu}=-1.4\times10^{-14}$ Hz s$^{-1}$, consistent with the near-universality of this behavior among the continuously-monitored magnetars. Most intriguingly, the 1E 1841-045 2-10 keV pulse profile is markedly different compared to pre-outburst; it shows a new, narrow (0.1 cycles) peak that appears to shift towards merging with the main, persistently-present, pulse. This is the second case of pulse-peak migration observed in magnetars after SGR 1830$-$0645, and the two sources exhibit a similar rate of phase shift. This implies that this phenomenon is not unique and might present itself in the broader population. The newly-formed peak for 1E 1841-045 is non-thermal, with emission extending to $\gtrsim20$ keV, in contrast to the case of SGR 1830$-$0645. Our results are consistent with an untwisting magnetic field bundle with migration towards the magnetic pole, perhaps accompanied by plastic motion of the crust.</description>

      <title>Inferring Black Hole Spin from Interferometric Measurements of the First Photon Ring: A Geometric Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately inferring black hole spin is crucial for understanding black hole dynamics and their astrophysical environments. In this work, we outline a geometric method for spin estimation by using the interferometric shape of the first photon ring ($n=1$) as an approximation to the critical curve, which, given an assumed value of the black hole inclination, is then mapped to a spin value. While future space-based missions will capture a wealth of data on the first photon ring--including the full angle-dependent diameter, angular brightness profile, and astrometric offset from the $n=0$ ring--our analysis is restricted to using only two angle-dependent diameters to compute its shape asymmetry and infer spin. Focusing on low inclinations and moderate-to-high spins, we test the method across various emission models, baselines, and noise sources, including a mock space-based observation. Although the size of the $n=1$ ring depends on the emission model, its interferometric shape remains a robust spin probe at low inclinations. We find that the inferred asymmetry of the $n=1$ image may be biased by the critical curve morphology, and it can be heavily skewed by the presence of noise, whether astrophysical or instrumental. In low-noise limits at low viewing inclination, significant contributions from the n=0 image at short baselines may lead to a downward bias in asymmetry estimates. While our method can estimate high spins in noise-free time-averaged images, increasing the noise and astrophysical variability degrades the resulting constraints, providing only lower bounds on the spin when applied to synthetic observed data. Remarkably, even using only the ring's asymmetry, we can establish lower bounds on the spin, underscoring the promise of photon ring-based spin inference in future space-based very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) missions, such as the proposed Black Hole Explorer (BHEX).</description>

      <title>VLTI/GRAVITY upper limit on near-infrared emission from the nearby 33 Msun black hole Gaia BH3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent astrometric discovery of the nearby (590 pc) massive ($33 M_\odot$) dormant black hole candidate Gaia BH3 offers the possibility to angularly resolve the black hole from its companion star by using optical interferometry. Our aim is to detect emission in the near-infrared K band from the close-in environment of Gaia BH3 caused by accretion. Gaia BH3 was observed with the GRAVITY instrument using the four 8-meter Unit Telescopes of the VLT Interferometer. We searched for the signature of emission from the black hole in the interferometric data using the CANDID, PMOIRED, and exoGravity tools. With a present separation of 18 mas, the Gaia BH3 system can be well resolved angularly by GRAVITY. We did not detect emission from the black hole at a contrast level of $\Delta m = 6.8$ mag with respect to the companion star, that is, $f_\mathrm{BH}/f_* &lt; 0.2\%$. This corresponds to an upper limit on the continuum flux density of $f_\mathrm{BH} &lt; 1.9 \times 10^{-16}$ W m$^{-2}$ ${\mu}$m$^{-1}$ in the K band. In addition, we did not detect emission from the black hole in the hydrogen Br{\gamma} line. The non-detection of near-infrared emission from the black hole in Gaia BH3 indicates that its accretion of the giant star wind is presently occurring at most at a very low rate. This is consistent with the limit of $f_\mathrm{Edd} &lt; 4.9 \times 10^{-7}$ derived previously on the Eddington ratio for an advection-dominated accretion flow. Deeper observations with GRAVITY may be able to detect the black hole as the companion star approaches periastron around 2030.</description>

      <title>Detecting Supernova Axions with IAXO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the potential of IAXO and its intermediate version, BabyIAXO, to detect axions produced in core-collapse supernovae (SNe). Our study demonstrates that these experiments have realistic chances of identifying SN axions, offering crucial insights into both axion physics and SN dynamics. IAXO's sensitivity to SN axions allows for the exploration of regions of the axion parameter space inaccessible through solar observations. In addition, in the event of a nearby SN, $d \sim O(100)$ pc, and sufficiently large axion couplings, $g_{a \gamma} \gtrsim 10^{-11} GeV^{-1}$, IAXO could have a chance to significantly advance our understanding of axion production in nuclear matter and provide valuable information about the physics of SNe, such as pion abundance, the equation of state, and other nuclear processes occurring in extreme environments.</description>

      <title>The Massive and Distant Clusters of $WISE$ Survey. XII. Exploring X-ray AGN in Dynamically Active Massive Galaxy Clusters at z~1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the cluster X-ray morphology and active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity in nine $z\sim1$ galaxy clusters from the Massive and Distant Clusters of $WISE$ Survey (MaDCoWS) observed with $Chandra$. Using photon asymmetry ($A_{\text{phot}}$) to quantify X-ray morphologies, we find evidence that the four most dynamically disturbed clusters are likely to be mergers. Employing a luminosity cut of $7.6\times10^{42}$ erg/s to identify AGN in the 0.7-7.0 keV, we show that the majority of these clusters host excess AGN compared to the local field. We use the cumulative number-count ($\log N-\log S$) model to predict AGN incidence in cluster isophotes under this luminosity cut. Our analysis finds evidence (at $&gt; 2\sigma$) of a positive correlation between AGN surface densities and photon asymmetry, suggesting that a disturbed cluster environment plays a pivotal role in regulating AGN triggering. Studying AGN incidence in cluster X-ray isophotes equivalent in area to $1.0r_{500}$, we find that the AGN space density inversely scales with cluster mass as $\sim M^{-0.5^{+0.18}_{-0.18}}$ at the 3.18$\sigma$ level. Finally, when we separately explore the cluster mass dependence of excess AGN surface density in disturbed and relaxed clusters, we see tentative evidence that the two morphologically distinct sub-populations exhibit diverging trends, especially near the outskirts, likely due to cluster merger-driven AGN triggering/suppression.</description>

      <title>Measurement of Neutral Atmosphere Density During the Years of Increasing Solar Activity Using \textit{Insight}-HXMT Data with the Earth Occultation Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The density of the Earth's middle and upper atmosphere is an important question in Earth science and is a critical factor in the design, operation, and orbital determination of low Earth orbit spacecraft. In this study, we employ the Earth Occultation Technique (EOT) combined with Maximum Likelihood Estimation to estimate the neutral atmospheric density by modeling the attenuation of X-ray photons during the occultation process of \textit{Insight}-HXMT observations of Crab Nebula. Based on 83 occultation datasets of the Crab Nebula observed by all three sets of telescopes of \textit{Insight}-HXMT between 2022 and 2024, we derived the atmospheric densities at altitudes ranging from 55\,--130\,km. We find a general agreement between our results and the prediction by the NRLMSIS model within the altitude ranges of 65\,-- 90\,km, 95\,--100\,km and 120\,--130\,km, particularly during periods of enhanced solar activity. However, we also find that the NRLMSIS model overestimates atmospheric density at altitudes 90\,--95\,km and 100\,--120\,km by approximately 20\%. Furthermore, since the atmospheric density measurements at altitudes of 55\,--\,65\,km may be subject to selection bias, we do not report the prediction accuracy of the NRLMSIS model at this altitude.</description>

      <title>Application of Machine Learning to Identify Radio Pulses of Air Showers at the South Pole (ARENA 2024)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning is a useful tool for identifying radio pulses from cosmic-ray air showers and for cleaning such pulses from radio background. This can lower the detection threshold and increase the accuracy for the pulse time and amplitude. We have trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using CoREAS simulations and background recorded by a prototype station at the IceTop surface array at the South Pole and have applied them to air-shower measurements by this station. The station consists of 3 SKALA antennas and 8 scintillators, which are used to trigger the readout of the antennas upon a sixfold coincidence. Afterwards, the radio signal is filtered to the band of 70-350 MHz. By applying neural networks to search for radio signals in about four months of data, we find about five times more events than by a traditional method based on a signal-to-noise ratio cut after filtering for radio frequency interferences. Despite the lower threshold, the purity of the selected events seems to improve, and the angular resolution of the radio measurements does not deteriorate, which we have confirmed by a comparison of the reconstructed shower direction with IceTop. This analysis thus provides experimental confirmation that neural networks can indeed be used to clean air-shower radio signals from background and to lower the radio detection threshold of hybrid arrays combining particle and radio detectors.</description>

      <title>Bayesian inferences on covariant density functionals from multimessenger astrophysical data. I. Nucleonic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: [Background] Bayesian inference frameworks incorporating multi-messenger astrophysical constraints have recently been applied to covariant density functional (CDF) models to constrain their parameters. Among these, frameworks utilizing CDFs with density-dependent meson-nucleon couplings furnishing the equation of state (EoS) of compact star (CS) matter have been explored. [Purpose] The aforementioned inference framework has not yet incorporated astrophysical objects with potentially extreme high masses or ultra-small radii among its constraints, leaving its flexibility and predictive power under such extreme parameters still unknown. [Method] We apply the Bayesian inference framework based on CDFs with density dependent couplings. The astrophysical data is expanded to include not only the latest multi-messenger constraints from NICER and gravitational wave events but also the highest measured mass to date for the ``black widow" pulsar PSR J0952-0607 and the mass-radius estimates for the ultra-compact, low-mass object HESS J1731-347. [Results] Our systematic Bayesian analysis indicates that our CDF models can support higher maximum masses for CSs, reaching up to $2.4$-$2.5\,M_{\odot}$. However, achieving sufficient softening of the EoS in the low-density regime to accommodate the HESS J1731-347 data remains challenging. Nonetheless, we are able to impose tighter constraints on the parameter space of CDF models, ensuring consistency with current nuclear experimental and astrophysical data. [Conclusions] CDF models with density-dependent meson-nucleon couplings encompass a wide range of nuclear and astrophysical phenomena, providing a robust theoretical framework for interpreting compact objects. However, the predicted lower limit for the radii of low-mass stars is approximately 12 km, which stems from the restricted degrees of freedom in the isovector sector.</description>

      <title>Nyquist-resolving gravitational waves via orbital frequency-based refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adaptive mesh refinement efficiently facilitates the computation of gravitational waveforms in numerical relativity. However, determining precisely when, where, and to what extent to refine when solving the Einstein equations poses challenges; several ad hoc refinement criteria have been explored in the literature. This work introduces an optimized resolution baseline derived in situ from the inspiral trajectory (ORBIT). This method uses the binary's orbital frequency as a proxy for anticipated gravitational waves to dynamically refine the grid, satisfying the Nyquist frequency requirements on grid resolution up to a specified spin weighted spherical harmonic order. ORBIT sustains propagation of gravitational waves while avoiding the more costly alternative of maintaining high resolution across an entire simulation, both spatially and temporally. We find that enabling ORBIT decreases waveform noise by an order of magnitude and better resolves high-order wave amplitudes through merger. Combined with WAMR and other improvements, updates to Dendro-GR decrease waveform noise, decrease constraint violations, and boost refinement efficiency each by factors of $\mathcal{O}(100)$, while reducing computational cost by a factor of four. ORBIT and other recent improvements to Dendro-GR begin to prepare us for gravitational wave science with next-generation detectors.</description>

      <title>Origin of high-velocity ejecta and early red excess emission in the infant Type Ia supernova 2021aefx</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.00625v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: SN~2021aefx is a normal Type Ia Supernova (SN) with red excess emission over the first $\sim$ 2 days. We present detailed analysis of this SN using our high-cadence KMTNet multi-band photometry, spectroscopy, and publicly available data. We provide the first measurements of its epochs of explosion (MJD 59529.32 $\pm$ 0.16) as well as ``first light'' (MJD 59529.85 $\pm$ 0.55) associated with the main ejecta ${\rm{^{56}Ni}}$ distribution. This places our first detection of SN 2021aefx at $\sim -$0.5 hours since ``first light'', indicating the presence of additional power sources. Our peak-spectrum confirms its Type Ia sub-classification as intermediate between Core-Normal and Broad-Line, and we estimate the ejecta mass to be $\sim$ 1.34 $M_{\odot}$. The pre-peak spectral evolution identifies fast-expanding material reaching $&gt;$ 40,000 km s$^{-1}$ (the fastest ever observed in Type Ia SNe) and at least two distinct homologously-expanding ejecta components: (1) a normal-velocity (12,400 km s$^{-1}$) component consistent with the typical photospheric evolution of Chandrasekhar-mass ejecta; and (2) a high-velocity (23,500 km s$^{-1}$) component visible during the first $\sim$ 3.6 days post-explosion, which locates the component within the outer $&lt;$ 16\% of the ejecta mass. Asymmetric, subsonic explosion processes producing a non-spherical photosphere provide an explanation for the simultaneous presence of the two components, as well as the red excess emission via a slight ${\rm{^{56}Ni}}$ enrichment in the outer $\sim$ 0.5\% of the ejecta mass. Our spectrum from 300 days post-peak advances the constraint against non-degenerate companions and further supports a near-Chandrasekhar-mass explosion origin. Off-center ignited delayed-detonations of Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarfs may be responsible for the observed features of SN 2021aefx in some normal Type Ia SNe.</description>

      <title>Energy Extraction from a Black Hole by a Strongly Magnetized Thin Accretion Disk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The presence of a strong, large-scale magnetic field in an accretion flow leads to extraction of the rotational energy of the black hole (BH) through the Blandford-Znajek (BZ) process, believed to power relativistic jets in various astrophysical sources. We study rotational energy extraction from a BH surrounded by a highly magnetized thin disk by performing a set of 3D global GRMHD simulations. We find that the saturated flux threading the BH has a weaker dependence on BH spin, compared to highly magnetized hot (geometrically thick) accretion flows. Also, we find that only a fraction ($10-70$ per cent) of the extracted BZ power is channeled into the jet, depending on the spin parameter. The remaining energy is potentially used to launch winds or contribute to the radiative output of the disk or corona. Our simulations reveal that the presence of a strong magnetic field enhances the radiative efficiency of the disk, making it more luminous than its weakly magnetized counterpart or the standard disk model. We attribute this excess luminosity primarily to the enhanced magnetic dissipation in the intra-ISCO region. Our findings have implications for understanding X-ray corona formation and black hole spin measurements, and interpreting black hole transient phenomena.</description>

      <title>On the possible contributions of two nearby blazars to the NGC 4151 neutrino hotspot</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of the high-energy astrophysical neutrinos discovered by IceCube remains unclear, with both blazars and Seyfert galaxies emerging as potential sources. Recently, the IceCube Collaboration reported a ${\sim}{3}\sigma$ neutrino signal from the direction of a nearby Seyfert galaxy NGC 4151. However, two gamma-ray loud BL Lac objects, 4FGL 1210.3+3928 and 4FGL J1211.6+3901, lie close to NGC 4151, at angular distances of 0.08$^\circ$ and 0.43$^\circ$, respectively. We investigate the potential contribution of these two blazars to the observed neutrino signal from the direction of NGC 4151 and assess their detectability with future neutrino observatories. We model the multi-wavelength spectral energy distributions of both blazars using a self-consistent numerical radiation code, AM$^3$. We calculate their neutrino spectra and compare them to the measured NGC 4151 neutrino spectrum and future neutrino detector sensitivities. Our models predict neutrino emission peaking at $\sim$10$^{17}$ eV for both blazars, with fluxes of ${\sim}10^{-12}~\mathrm{erg~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}}$. This indicates their contribution to the $\sim$10 TeV neutrino signal observed from the direction of NGC 4151 is minor. While detection with current facilities is challenging, both sources should be detectable by future radio-based neutrino telescopes such as IceCube-Gen2's radio array and GRAND, with 4FGL~J1210.3+3928 being the more promising candidate.</description>

      <title>AT2021aeuk: A Repeating Partial Tidal Disruption Event Candidate in a Narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A black hole (BH) can tear apart a star that ventures within its tidal radius, producing a luminous flare as the stellar debris falls back, known as a tidal disruption event (TDE). While TDEs in quiescent galaxies are relatively well understood, identifying TDEs in active galactic nuclei (AGN) still remains a significant challenge. We present the discovery of AT2021aeuk, a transient exhibiting dual flares within around three years in a narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy. Multi-wavelength observations triggered during the second flare in 2023 revealed an extraordinary X-ray V-shaped light curve, strongly anti-correlated with the optical light curve and accompanied by a lag of $\sim$40 days. This behavior is inconsistent with both supernova and pure AGN origins. In addition, a new broad component emerges in the Balmer lines during the second flare, showing a clear reverberation signal to the continuum variation. We propose that the dual-flare may be linked to a repeating partial TDE (rpTDE), where the second flare results from a collision between the TDE stream and the inner accretion disk, triggering an optical flare while simultaneously partially destroying the X-ray corona. However, other mechanisms, such as a stellar-mass BH (sBH) merger within an accretion disk, could produce similar phenomena, which we cannot entirely rule out. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory will be a powerful tool for further investigating the nature of such events in the future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12507v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tidally induced spin-up of stripped helium stars in short-period (&lt;\,1\,d) binaries with black holes has been presented as one of the possible mechanisms to reproduce the high-spin tail of the black hole spin distribution derived from gravitational wave (GW) merger observations. At such short periods, a fraction of the strong stellar wind from the stripped helium stars may be accreted by the black holes, and its gravitational potential energy may be released as observable radiation in the X-ray regime. We estimate the X-ray luminosity and its observability from black holes in orbit with stripped helium stars, which evolve into binary black hole or black hole+neutron star binaries that merge within Hubble time. We post-process recent advancements for estimating X-ray luminosities (via wind accretion onto stellar mass black holes) into two rapid population synthesis codes, BSE and StarTrack. We derive lower limits on the X-ray luminosity distribution from populations of stripped helium+black hole binaries at four metallicities (0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 1 $Z_{\odot}$) and two mass transfer stability criteria. We find that a large fraction (0.1-0.5) of stripped-helium stars that get spun up by tides also transfer enough wind matter onto the black hole to produce X-ray luminosities above $10^{35}$\,erg\,s$^{-1}$, up to $\sim10^{39}$\,erg\,s$^{-1}$. Such binaries should be observable as X-ray bright systems at 0.1\,$Z_{\odot}$, 0.5\,$Z_{\odot}$ and $Z_{\odot}$, representative of Sextans A, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the Solar neighbourhood, respectively. The formation efficiency of these systems increases with decreasing metallicity. However, accounting for the local star formation rates, our population synthesis predicts $\sim$2 and $\sim$1 such observable binaries in the Milky Way and LMC, respectively, that will produce a binary compact object merger within a Hubble time.

      <title>Clash of the Titans: ultra-high energy KM3NeT event versus IceCube data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: KM3NeT has reported the detection of a remarkably high-energy through-going muon. Lighting up about a third of the detector, this muon likely originated from a neutrino exceeding 10 PeV in energy. The crucial question we need to answer is where this event comes from and what its source is. Intriguingly, IceCube has been operating with a much larger effective area for a considerably longer time, yet it has not reported neutrinos above 10~PeV. We quantify the tension between the KM3NeT event and the absence of similar high-energy events in IceCube. Through a detailed analysis, we determine the most likely neutrino energy to be in the range of 23 - 2400 PeV. We find a $3.5\sigma$ tension between the two experiments, assuming the neutrino is from the diffuse isotropic neutrino flux. Alternatively, assuming the event is of cosmogenic origin and considering three representative models, this tension still falls within 3.1 - 3.6$\sigma$. The least disfavored scenario is a steady or transient point source, though still leading to $2.9\sigma$ and $2.0\sigma$ tensions, respectively. The lack of observation of high-energy events in IceCube seriously challenges the explanation of this event coming from any known diffuse fluxes. Our results indicate the KM3NeT event is likely the first observation of a new astrophysical source.</description>

Abstract: We performed variability analysis of the multiwavelength light curves for the flat-spectrum radio quasar PKS 0727-11. Using the generalized Lomb-Scargle periodogram, we identified a possible quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) of $\sim$ 168.6 days (persisted for 6 cycles, with a significance of $3.8\sigma$) in the gamma-ray light curve during the flare period (MJD 54687-55738). It is the first time that periodic variations have been detected in this source, and further supported by other methods: weighted wavelet $z$-transform, phase dispersion minimization, REDFIT, autoregressive integrated moving average model, and structure function analysis. Cross-correlation analysis shows that there is a strong correlation between multi-band light variations, indicating that gamma-ray and radio flares may originate from the same disturbance, and the distance between the emission regions of gamma-ray and radio flares is calculated based on the time lag. We demonstrate that QPO arising from the non-ballistic helical jet motion driven by the orbital motion in a supermassive binary black hole is a plausible physical explanation. In this scenario, the estimated mass of the primary black hole is $M\sim3.66\times10^8-5.79\times10^{9}M_\odot$.</description>

      <title>The origin and evolution of the normal Type Ia SN 2018aoz with infant-phase reddening and excess emission</title>

Abstract: SN~2018aoz is a Type Ia SN with a $B$-band plateau and excess emission in the infant-phase light curves $\lesssim$ 1 day after first light, evidencing an over-density of surface iron-peak elements as shown in our previous study. Here, we advance the constraints on the nature and origin of SN~2018aoz based on its evolution until the nebular phase. Near-peak spectroscopic features show the SN is intermediate between two subtypes of normal Type Ia: Core-Normal and Broad-Line. The excess emission could have contributions from the radioactive decay of surface iron-peak elements as well as ejecta interaction with either the binary companion or a small torus of circumstellar material. Nebular-phase limits on H$\alpha$ and He~I favour a white dwarf companion, consistent with the small companion size constrained by the low early SN luminosity, while the absence of [O~I] and He~I disfavours a violent merger of the progenitor. Of the two main explosion mechanisms proposed to explain the distribution of surface iron-peak elements in SN~2018aoz, the asymmetric Chandrasekhar-mass explosion is less consistent with the progenitor constraints and the observed blueshifts of nebular-phase [Fe~II] and [Ni~II]. The helium-shell double-detonation explosion is compatible with the observed lack of C spectral features, but current 1-D models are incompatible with the infant-phase excess emission, $B_{\rm max}-V_{\rm max}$ color, and absence of nebular-phase [Ca~II]. Although the explosion processes of SN~2018aoz still need to be more precisely understood, the same processes could produce a significant fraction of Type Ia SNe that appear normal after $\sim$ 1 day.</description>

      <title>Can the solar atmosphere generate very high energy cosmic rays?</title>

Abstract: The origin and acceleration of high-energy particles in space (cosmic rays), constitute important topics in modern astrophysics. Among the The origin and acceleration of high-energy particles, constituting cosmic rays, is likely to remain an important topic in modern astrophysics. Among the two categories - galactic and solar cosmic rays - the latter are much less investigated. Primary source of solar cosmic ray particles are impulsive explosions of the magnetized plasma known as solar flares and coronal mass ejections. These particles, however, are characterized by relatively low energies compared to their galactic counterparts. In this work, we explore resonance wave-wave (RWW) interaction between the polarized electromagnetic radiation emitted by the solar active regions, and the quantum waves associated with high-energy, relativistic electrons generated during solar flares. Mathematically, the RWW interaction problem boils down to analyzing a Klein-Gordon equation (spin less electrons) embedded in the electromagnetic field. We find that RWW could accelerate the relativistic electrons to enormous energies even comparable to energies in the galactic cosmic rays.</description>

      <title>Postmerger multimessenger analysis of binary neutron stars: Effect of the magnetic field strength and topology</title>

Abstract: The oscillation modes of neutron star (NS) merger remnants, as encoded by the kHz postmerger gravitational wave (GW) signal, hold great potential for constraining the as-yet undetermined equation of state (EOS) of dense nuclear matter. Previous works have used numerical relativity simulations to derive quasi-universal relations for the key oscillation frequencies, but most of them omit the effects of a magnetic field. We conduct full general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations of NSNS mergers with two different masses and two different EOSs (SLy and ALF2) with three different initial magnetic field topologies (poloidal and toroidal only, confined to the interior, and "pulsar-like": dipolar poloidal extending from the interior to the exterior), with four different magnetic field strengths with maximum values ranging from from $5.5\times 10^{15}G$ to $2.2\times 10^{17}G$ at the time of insertion. We find that magnetic braking and magnetic effective turbulent viscosity drives the merger remnants towards uniform rotation and increases their overall angular momentum loss. As a result, the $f_2$ frequency of the dominant postmerger GW mode shifts upwards over time. The overall shift is up to $\sim 200$Hz for the strongest magnetic field we consider and $\sim 50$Hz for the median case and is therefore detectable in principle by future GW observatories, which should include the magnetic field in their analyses. We also explore the impact of the magnetic field on the postmerger electromagnetic emission, and demonstrate that an extremely large magnetic field, or alternatively a significant shear viscosity mechanism, can cause a supramassive NS remnant to collapse to a BH in less than 100ms and lead to jet formation, although we do not expect the conditions for such an outcome to be realistic.</description>
