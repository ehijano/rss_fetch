      <title>Sino-US S and T Frictions and Transnational Knowledge Flows: Evidence from machine learning and cross-national patent data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper identifies the impact of China-U.S. science and technology (S&amp;T) friction on knowledge flows in different fields, using data on invention patent applications from China, the U.S., Europe, and the World Patent Office (WPO) along with machine-learning-based econometric methods. The empirical results find that the negative impacts of China-U.S. S&amp;T frictions on cross-border knowledge flows are confined to a limited number of technology areas during the period of our observation. This paper further explores the characteristics of the negatively impacted technology areas, and the empirical results show that technology areas that rely more on basic scientific research, where the distribution of U.S. scientific and technological strength is more concentrated, and where the gap between U.S. and Chinese science and technology is narrower, are more likely to be the victims of the Sino-U.S. S&amp;T friction.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Reserve Token: A Decentralized Digital Currency Backed by Quantum Computational Capacity as a Candidate for Global Reserve Status</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The U.S. dollar's status as the global reserve currency faces growing challenges from a 36 trillion dollar national debt, geopolitical shifts, and the emergence of digital currencies. This paper introduces the Quantum Reserve Token (QRT), a decentralized digital currency backed by quantum computational capacity - a scarce, productive resource projected to add over 1 trillion dollars to global GDP by 2035. Unlike Bitcoin's fixed-supply volatility, stablecoins' dependence on fiat trust, or central bank digital currencies' jurisdictional limits, QRT uses quantum computing power as a novel value anchor. This study develops a monetary theory-based framework for QRT, compares it to existing digital currency models, and evaluates its feasibility across technological, economic, geopolitical, and adoption dimensions. QRT offers a stable, neutral, and scalable reserve currency alternative, potentially reshaping the global monetary system.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on assessing the potentials for the efficient low carbon development in green hydrogen and ammonia economy using an example of Ukraine as a case study. It describes the country prerequisites for the transition to renewable energy sources and outlines the ongoing green hydrogen projects. Moreover, it offers a comprehensive SWOT analysis of Ukraine engagement in the green hydrogen and ammonia economy. Furthermore, the paper employs a comprehensive bibliometric network analysis using a sample of 204 selected publications indexed in the Web of Science database. It is doing so by carrying out the network cluster analysis using the text data as well as the bibliometric data with the help of VOSViewer software. The results and outcomes might be helpful for researchers, stakeholders, and policymakers alike in devising effective strategies and policies aimed at rebuilding and recreating Ukrainian efficient low-carbon energy sector based on the renewable energy sources.</description>

      <title>Two Level Nested and Sequential Logit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This technical note provides comprehensive derivations of fundamental equations in two-level nested and sequential logit models for analyzing hierarchical choice structures. We present derivations of the Berry (1994) inversion formula, nested inclusive values computation, and multi-level market share equations, complementing existing literature. While conceptually distinct, nested and sequential logit models share mathematical similarities and, under specific distributional assumptions, yield identical inversion formulas-offering valuable analytical insights. These notes serve as a practical reference for researchers implementing multi-level discrete choice models in empirical applications, particularly in industrial organization and demand estimation contexts.</description>

      <title>Gene-environment interplay and public policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We posit that gene-environment interplay (GxE) studies should be developed both theoretically and empirically to be of relevance to policy makers. On the theoretical front, this development is essential because the current literature lacks the integration of a clear framework capturing the various goals of public policies. Empirically, GxE models need to be further developed because the common way of modelling GxE effects fails to adequately capture the heterogeneous effects public policies may have along the distribution of genetic propensities (as captured by polygenic indices). We fill these gaps by proposing a policy classification for GxE research and by offering guidance on advancing the empirical modelling of policy-informative GxE interplay. While doing so, we provide a systematic review of existing GxE studies on educational outcomes exploiting policy reforms or environments that could be targeted by public policy.</description>

      <title>A Theory of Investors' Disclosure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07630v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the voluntary disclosure decision of investors under uncertainty about information endowment (Dye 1985). In our model, an investor first uncovers initial evidence about the target firm and then seeks additional information to help interpret the initial evidence. The investor takes a position in the firm's stock, then voluntarily discloses some or all of their findings, and finally closes their position after the disclosure. We present two main findings. First, the investor will always disclose the initial evidence, even though the market is uncertain about whether the investor possesses such evidence. Second, the investor's disclosure strategy of the additional information increases stock price volatility: they disclose extreme news and withhold moderate news.</description>

      <title>Behavioral Expectations in New Keynesian DSGE Models: Evidence from India's COVID-19 Recovery and Vaccination Program</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17165v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper extends the New Keynesian Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) framework by incorporating behavioral expectations to analyze the moments of India's output gap and inflation rate, with a particular focus on the impacts of COVID-19 and vaccination programs. While DSGE models traditionally rely on rational expectations, we demonstrate that behavioral expectations more accurately capture the distributional characteristics of India's output gap and inflation rates data. Utilizing both Hodrick-Prescott and Kalman filters, we estimate the output gap and establish congruence with the moments of the simulated output gap. Concurrently, employing the initial negative demand shock values of the output gap, we calibrate the persistence parameters of negative aggregate demand (AD) and positive aggregate supply (AS) shocks, alongside the initial magnitude of the positive supply shock to achieve correspondence with post-COVID actual average values of the output gap and inflation rate. To ensure model precision, we implement Mahalanobis distance minimization for model calibration. Our findings elucidate that vaccination programs generated significant positive supply shocks, counterbalancing the prolonged negative demand shock precipitated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, the analysis reveals that the positive supply shocks' persistence parameter exceeds that of the negative demand shocks, indicating the exceptional efficacy of India's vaccination strategy. Furthermore, this research advances the scholarly contributions of Dasgupta and Rajeev (2023) by furnishing a quantitative DSGE framework that complements their static simple Keynesian analysis.</description>

      <title>Critical misalignments in climate pledges reveal imbalanced sustainable development pathways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the integration of climate action and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in nationally determined contributions (NDCs), revealing persistent synergies and trade-offs across income groups. While high-income countries emphasize systemic challenges like health (SDG3) and inequality (SDG10), low-income nations prioritize the water-energy-food nexus (SDGs 6-7-12) and natural resource management (SDG15) due to vulnerabilities to climate impacts. Harnessing an innovative artificial intelligence routine, we discuss what these diverging development trajectories imply for the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development in terms of global inequality, the climate and sustainable finance flows and multilateral governance.</description>
