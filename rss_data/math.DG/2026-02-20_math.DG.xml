      <title>Complete closed-form solutions to the problem of inextensional bending for surfaces of translation and origami tessellations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plates generally admit six deformation modes: three of which are high in strain energy, stretch the plate's midsurface and are called membrane modes; and three are low-energy, bend the midsurface without stretching it and are called bending modes. For origami tessellations, and other corrugated compliant thin shells, the modes are mixed and it is no longer clear what modes, if any, are low in energy in the sense that they are inextensional. Here, it is shown, by direct construction of closed-form solutions, that when the midsurface is a surface of translation, there exists three infinitesimally inextensional deformation modes that correspond to (1) stretching, with an effective Poisson's effect; (2) bending, with an effective synclastic or anti-clastic effect; and to (3) twisting. The provided expressions are valid irrespective of surface regularity and, in particular, properly handle any creases be them straight or curved. The results provide a powerful benchmark for the validation of numerical methods and further insight into the elastic stiffness of thin corrugated compliant shells.</description>

      <title>A gauge theoretical generalization of Bryant's correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A classical theorem in the theory of minimal surfaces establishes a correspondence between minimal surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and null holomorphic curves in $\mathbb{C}^n$. A hyperbolic version of this correspondence is due to Bryant: null holomorphic curves in ${\rm SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ correspond to CMC-1 surfaces in the hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^3$. We also have a relativistic Bryant type correspondence: CMC-1 immersions in the hyperbolic space are replaced by space-like CMC-1 immersion in the de Sitter space. We prove a mutual generalisation of all these results: let $H$ be a real Lie group, $\pi:P \to M$ a principal $H$-bundle, $A$ a connection on $P$ and $\alpha\in A^1_{\rm Ad}(P,\mathfrak{h})$ a tensorial 1-form of type ${\rm Ad}$ which induces isomorphisms $A_\xi \to \mathfrak{h}$. Such a pair $(\alpha,A)$ defines an almost complex structure $J^\alpha_A$ on $P$, which is integrable if and only $(\alpha,A)$ solves a gauge-invariant first order differential system. A non-degenerate symmetric ${\rm Ad}_H$-invariant bilinear form $g$ on $\mathfrak{h}$ defines pseudo-Riemannian metrics $g^\alpha_M$, $\mathfrak{g}^\alpha_A$ on $M$, respectively $P$, and a non-degenerate bilinear form $\omega^{\alpha,g}_A:T_P\times_P T_P\to \mathbb{C}$ which is holomorphic when $J^\alpha_A$ is integrable. Assuming that this is the case, we have a Bryant type correspondence between space-like, $\omega^{\alpha,g}_A$-isotropic holomorphic immersions $Y\to P$ and space-like conformal immersions $Y\to (M,g^\alpha_M)$ whose mean curvature vector field is given by a simple explicit formula. In particular, one obtains such a correspondence for any principal bundle of the form $G\to G/H$, where $G$ is a complex Lie group, and $H$ is a real form of $G$ endowed with a non-degenerate, ${\rm Ad}_H$-invariant, symmetric bilinear form $g$ on its Lie-algebra $\mathfrak{h}$.</description>

      <title>Geometric and topological rigidity of pinched submanifolds in Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the geometry and topology of compact submanifolds of Riemannian manifolds with arbitrary codimension that satisfy a pinching condition. The ambient space is not required to be a space form, and the pinching condition involves the length of the second fundamental form and the mean curvature.
  The results obtained, as well as the methods employed, differ substantially between higher-dimensional and four-dimensional submanifolds. Our approach in higher dimensions relies on results from the theory of Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative isotropic curvature and on the Bochner technique. In contrast, in the four-dimensional case, the analysis also relies critically on concepts from four-dimensional geometry.
  A key observation is that submanifolds satisfying the pinching condition necessarily have nonnegative isotropic curvature, a notion introduced by Micallef and Moore. The results are sharp and extend previous work by several authors, without imposing any additional assumptions on either the topology or the geometry of the submanifold.</description>

      <title>A Lower Bound for the First Non-zero Basic Eigenvalue on a Singular Riemannian Foliation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide the lower bounds of the first non-zero basic eigenvalue on a closed singular Riemannian manifold $(M,\mathcal{F})$ with basic mean curvature that depends on the given non-negative lower bound of the Ricci curvature of $M$ and the diameter of the leaf space $M/\mathcal{F}$. These can be regarded as generalized versions of the Zhong-Yang estimate and a generalized Shi-Yang's estimate for singular Riemannian foliations with basic mean curvature. We also provide a rigidity result corresponding to the generalized Zhong-Yang estimate, which is a generalized Hang-Wang rigidity for singular Riemannian foliations with basic mean curvature. More precisely, when the first basic eigenvalue $\lambda_1^B$ is equal to $\frac{\pi^2}{d_{M/\mathcal{F}^2}} $, where $d_{M/\mathcal{F}}$ is the diameter of the leaf space, $M$ is isometric to a mapping torus of an isometry $\varphi:N\to N$ where $N$ is an $(n-1)$-dimensional Riemannian manifold of nonnegative Ricci curvature and $\mathcal{F}$ has the form $\{[\{\text{point}\}\times N]\}$.</description>

      <title>Prefactorization algebras for the conformal Laplacian: Central charge and Hilbert Fock space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $d\geq 2$ and let $\mathrm{Mfld}_{d,\mathrm{emb}}^{\mathrm{CO}}$ be the symmetric monoidal category of oriented Riemannian $d$-manifolds and conformal open embeddings. The prefactorization algebra of the conformal Laplacian defines a symmetric monoidal functor $F_{\mathrm{CL}}:\mathrm{Mfld}_{d,\mathrm{emb}}^{\mathrm{CO}}\rightarrow \mathrm{Vect}_\mathbb{R}$.
  For Euclidean domains $U\subset\mathbb{R}^d$, $F_{\mathrm{CL}}(U)$ is identified with $\mathrm{Sym} H'(U)$ via the Green function, where $H'(U)$ is the continuous dual of harmonic functions on $U$. For $d\geq 3$ this identification is natural under all conformal transformations, while in $d=2$ the failure of naturality is governed by an explicit harmonic cocycle (the central charge). For the unit disk $\mathbb{D}$, $F_{\mathrm{CL}}(\mathbb D)$ carries an algebra structure over the operad of conformal disk embeddings and admits a canonical dense embedding into the Hilbert Fock space; in $d=2$ the latter holds after restricting to a codimension-one subspace, as suggested by logarithmic CFT.</description>

      <title>Rod Structures and Patching Matrices: a review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I review the twistor theory construction of stationary and axisymmetric, Lorentzian signature solutions of the Einstein vacuum equations and the related toric Ricci-flat metrics of Riemannian signature, \cite{W,MW,F,FW}. The construction arises from the Ward construction \cite{W2} of anti-self-dual Yang-Mills fields as holomorphic vector bundles on twistor space, with the observation of Witten \cite{LW} that the Einstein equations for these metrics include the anti-self-dual Yang-Mills equations. The principal datum for a solution is the holomorphic patching matrix $P$ for a holomorphic vector bundle on a reduced twistor space, and $P$ is typically simpler than the corresponding metric to write down.
  I give a catalogue of examples, building on earlier collections \cite{F,AG}, and consider the inverse problem: how far does the rod structure of such a metric, together with its asymptotics, determine $P$?</description>

Abstract: We study the maximum ratio of the Euclidean norm to the comass norm of p-covectors in Euclidean n-space and improve the known upper bound found in the standard references by Whitney and Federer.

      <description>arXiv:2505.11971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that small perturbations of the metric of a ball in Euclidean n-space to metrics with nonpositive curvature do not reduce the isoperimetric ratio. Furthermore, the isoperimetric ratio is preserved only if the perturbation corresponds to a homothety of the ball. These results establish a sharp local version of the Cartan-Hadamard conjecture.</description>

      <title>Construction of Exponential Families from Statistical Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the construction of exponential families from statistical manifolds, a central problem in information geometry. We prove that every compact statistical manifold admits a singular foliation whose leaves are Hessian manifolds. In particular, any non-flat, compact, orientable 3-dimensional leaf arises as a quotient of an exponential family and has only odd Betti numbers. Our approach is constructive: we explicitly describe the foliation and analyze the geometric and topological properties of its leaves. We show that compact orientable leaves are either finite quotients of flat torus or mapping torus with periodic monodromy. In three dimensions, non-flat leaves admit a co-K\"ahler structure, which allows us to realize them as explicit exponential families parametrized by a Lorentz cone. These results establish a concrete bridge between abstract statistical manifolds and exponential families, highlighting deep connections between information geometry, differential geometry, and the topology of 3-manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a complete geometric solution to the problem of differentiating simplicial manifolds, extending classical Lie theory and complementing existing homotopical and formal approaches within a unifying framework. First, we establish a normal form theorem setting a system of compatible tubular neighborhoods. Building on this description, we identify a differentiating ideal in the algebra of cochains, prove that the quotient is semi-free, and interpret it as the Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra of the thus defined higher Lie algebroid. As an application, we introduce a higher version of the van Est map and prove a van Est isomorphism theorem in cohomology, under natural connectivity assumptions. Finally, we identify the algebraic mechanism underlying geometric differentiation as a monoidal refinement of the dual Dold-Kan correspondence, providing a conceptual explanation of the construction and relating it to earlier homotopical and functor-of-points approaches.</description>

      <title>On the Calabi-Yau Conjectures for Minimal Hypersurfaces in Higher Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Calabi-Yau conjectures for complete minimal hypersurfaces $\Sigma^{n}\subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ in dimensions $n\ge 3$. These conjectures ask whether a complete minimal hypersurface must be unbounded, and more strongly, whether it must be proper. For the unboundedness question, we prove a chord-arc estimate for an embedded minimal disk with bounded curvature, showing that intrinsic distance is controlled by a polynomial of the extrinsic distance. On the other hand, using gluing techniques, we construct a complete, improperly embedded minimal hypersurface in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ for every $n\ge 3$. This example shows that the properness conjecture suggested by the deep work of Colding Minicozzi [CM08] in the case $n=2$ fails in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Existence of constant mean curvature surfaces with controlled topology in 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the existence of a non-trivial, branched immersion of a closed Riemann surface $\Sigma$ with constant mean curvature (CMC) $H$ into any closed, orientable 3-manifold $\mathcal{M}$, for almost every prescribed value of $H$. The genus of the surface $\Sigma$ is bounded from above by the Heegaard genus $h$ of $\mathcal{M}$.
  Starting from a family of sweep-outs of $\mathcal{M}$ by surfaces of genus $h$, we apply a min-max construction for a family $\{E_{H,\sigma}\}_\sigma$ of perturbations of the energy involving the second fundamental form of the immersions to produce almost-critical points $u_k$ of $E_{H,\sigma}$. We then show, following ideas developed by Pigati and Rivi\`ere, that the maps $u_k$ converge to a "CMC-parametrized varifold". This limiting object is then shown to be a smooth, branched immersion with the prescribed mean curvature $H$.</description>

      <title>Invariant Reduction for Partial Differential Equations. II: The General Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09313v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a system of partial differential equations (PDEs) $F = 0$ admitting a local (point, contact, or higher) symmetry $X$ with the characteristic $\varphi$, invariant solutions satisfy the reduced system $F = \varphi = 0$. We propose a framework that allows, for every $X$-invariant conservation law, presymplectic structure, variational principle, or another geometric structure of the given PDE system $F = 0$, to systematically calculate its corresponding reduced form that describes the corresponding structure for the reduced system $F = \varphi = 0$. In particular, we show in what way Noether's theorem holding for the given PDE system is inherited by the reduced PDE system. We consider several detailed examples, including cases of point and higher symmetry invariance. The proposed framework is directly applicable to a wide range of PDE models, including complex PDE systems of contemporary interest arising across disciplines, where symmetry reduction is essential for analysis and simulation, as well as to integrable, Lagrangian, and gauge systems.</description>

Abstract: We prove an equivariant version of the CM minimization conjecture for extremal K\"ahler manifolds. This involves proving that, given an equivariant punctured family of polarized varieties, a relative version of the CM degree is strictly minimized by an extremal filling.
  This generalizes a result by Hattori for cscK manifolds with discrete automorphism group by allowing automorphisms and extremal metrics. As a main tool, we extend results by Sz\'ekelyhidi on asymptotic filtration Chow stability of cscK manifolds with discrete automorphism group to the extremal setting.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Model Order Reduction of Dynamical Systems in Process Engineering: Review and Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computationally cheap yet accurate dynamical models are a key requirement for real-time capable nonlinear optimization and model-based control. When given a computationally expensive high-order prediction model, a reduction to a lower-order simplified model can enable such real-time applications. Herein, we review nonlinear model order reduction methods and provide a comparison of method characteristics. Additionally, we discuss both general-purpose methods and tailored approaches for chemical process systems and we identify similarities and differences between these methods. As machine learning manifold-Galerkin approaches currently do not account for inputs in the construction of the reduced state subspace, we extend these methods to dynamical systems with inputs. In a comparative case study, we apply eight established model order reduction methods to an air separation process model: POD-Galerkin, nonlinear-POD-Galerkin, manifold-Galerkin, dynamic mode decomposition, Koopman theory, manifold learning with latent predictor, compartment modeling, and model aggregation. Herein, we do not investigate hyperreduction, i.e., reduction of floating point operations. Based on our findings, we discuss strengths and weaknesses of the model order reduction methods.</description>

      <title>On Einstein Structures for $\mathrm{SO}_0(p,p+1)$-Surface Group Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $S$ be a closed surface of genus $g \geq 2$. We study the cocompact domain of discontinuity $\Omega_{\rho}$ in the Einstein universe $\mathrm{Ein}^{p-1,p}$ defined by Guichard-Wienhard and Kapovich-Leeb-Porti for a class of $p$-Anosov representations $\rho:\pi_1S \rightarrow \mathrm{SO}_0(p,p+1)$ including Hitchin representations, for $p \geq 3$. The quotient $M_{\rho} = \rho(\pi_1S)\backslash \Omega_{\rho}$ is abstractly known to be realizable as a fiber bundle over $S$, with unknown fiber of unique homotopy type $F_{\rho}$. We explicitly exhibit $M_{\rho}$ as a smooth $\mathfrak{F}_{\rho}$-fiber bundle over $S$, determining the diffeomorphism type of $M_{\rho}$ and the unique homotopy type $F_{\rho}$. Surprisingly, in many situations the fiber bundle $\mathfrak{F}_{\rho} \rightarrow M_{\rho}\rightarrow S$ is trivial.</description>

      <title>Minimality of free-boundary axial hyperplanes in high dimensional circular cones via calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider an $(n+1)$-dimensional circular cone with opening angle $\alpha \in (0,\pi)$. Using a free-boundary adaptation of the classical calibration method, we prove that, for $n \geq 4$, there exists a threshold $\bar{\alpha}(n) \in (0,\pi)$ such that if $\alpha \geq \bar{\alpha}(n)$, that is, the cone is wide enough, the intersection of the cone with an axial hyperplane is area-minimizing with respect to free-boundary variations inside the cone. This provides a counterexample to a recent Vertex-skipping Theorem proved by the author in collaboration with G.P. Leonardi, at least for $n\geq4$.</description>
