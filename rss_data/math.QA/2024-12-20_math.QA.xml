      <title>Compact Semisimple Tensor 2-Categories are Morita Connected</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In arXiv:2211.04917, it was shown that, over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, every fusion 2-category is Morita equivalent to a connected fusion 2-category, that is, one arising from a braided fusion 1-category. We extend this result to compact semisimple tensor 2-categories over an arbitrary field of characteristic zero. In order to do so, we generalize to an arbitrary field of characteristic zero many well-known results about braided fusion 1-categories over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. Most notably, we prove that the Picard group of any braided fusion 1-category is indfinite, generalizing the classical fact that the Brauer group of a field is torsion. As an application of our main result, we derive the existence of braided fusion 1-categories indexed by the fourth Galois cohomology group of the absolute Galois group that represent interesting classes in the appropriate Witt groups.</description>

      <title>Frobenius monoidal functors induced by Frobenius extensions of Hopf algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that induction along a Frobenius extension of Hopf algebras is a Frobenius monoidal functor in great generality, in particular, for all finite-dimensional and all pointed Hopf algebras. As an application, we show that induction functors from unimodular Hopf subalgebras to small quantum groups at roots of unity are Frobenius monoidal functors and classify such unimodular Hopf subalgebras. Moreover, we present stronger conditions on Frobenius extensions under which the induction functor extends to a braided Frobenius monoidal functor on categories of Yetter--Drinfeld modules. We show that these stronger conditions hold for any extension of finite-dimensional semisimple and co-semisimple (or, more generally, unimodular and dual unimodular) Hopf algebras.</description>

      <title>Verlinde rings and cluster algebras arising from quantum affine algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate a positivity conjecture relating the Verlinde ring associated with an untwisted affine Lie algebra at a positive integer level and a subcategory of finite-dimensional representations over the corresponding quantum affine algebra with a cluster algebra structure. Specifically, we consider a ring homomorphism from the Grothendieck ring of this representation category to the Verlinde ring and conjecture that every object in the category has a positive image under this map.
  We prove this conjecture in certain cases where the underlying simple Lie algebra is simply-laced with level 2 or of type $A_1$ at an arbitrary level. The proof employs the close connection between this category and cluster algebras of finite cluster type. As further evidence for the conjecture, we show that for any level, all objects have positive quantum dimensions under the assumption that some Kirillov-Reshetikhin modules have positive quantum dimensions.</description>

      <title>Averaging antisymmetric infinitesimal bialgebra and perm bialgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a bialgebra theory for averaging algebras, called averaging antisymmetric infinitesimal bialgebras by generalizing the study of antisymmetric infinitesimal bialgebras to the context of averaging algebras. They are characterized by double constructions of averaging Frobenius algebras as well as matched pairs of averaging algebras. Antisymmetric solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation in averaging algebras provide averaging antisymmetric infinitesimal bialgebras. The notions of an $\mathcal{O}$-operator of an averaging algebra and an averaging dendriform algebra are introduced to construct antisymmetric solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation in an averaging algebra and hence averaging antisymmetric infinitesimal bialgebras. Moreover, we introduce the notion of factorizable averaging antisymmetric infinitesimal bialgebras and show that a factorizable averaging antisymmetric infinitesimal bialgebra leads to a factorization of the underlying averaging algebra. We establish a one-to-one correspondence between factorizable averaging antisymmetric infinitesimal bialgebras and symmetric averaging Frobenius algebras with a Rota-Baxter operator of nonzero weight. Finally, we apply the study of averaging antisymmetric infinitesimal bialgebras to perm bialgebras, extending the construction of perm algebras from commutative averaging algebras to the context of bialgebras, which is consistent with the well constructed theory of perm bialgebras.</description>

      <title>Defining extended TQFTs via handle attachments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a finite presentation of the cobordism symmetric monoidal bicategory of (smooth, oriented) closed manifolds, cobordisms and cobordisms with corners as an extension of the bicategory of closed manifolds, cobordisms and diffeomorphisms. The generators are the standard handle attachments, and the relations are handle cancellations and invariance under reversing the orientation of the attaching spheres.
  In other words, given a categorified TQFT and 2-morphisms associated to the standard handles satisfying our relations, we construct a once extended TQFT.</description>

      <title>Cyclic Representations of $U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}_2)$ and its Borel Subalgebras at Roots of Unity and Q-operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the cyclic representations $\Omega_{rs}$ of $ U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}_2)$ at $q^N=1$ that depend upon two points $r,s$ in the chiral Potts algebraic curve. We show how $\Omega_{rs}$ is related to the tensor product $\rho_r\otimes \bar{\rho}_s$ of two representations of the upper Borel subalgebra of $U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}_2)$. This result is analogous to the factorization property of the Verma module of $U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}_2)$ at generic-$q$ in terms of two q-oscillator representation of the Borel subalgebra - a key step in the construction of the Q-operator. We construct short exact sequences of the different representations and use the results to construct Q operators that satisfy TQ relations for $q^N=1$ for both the 6-vertex and $\tau_2$ models.</description>

      <title>Twisted vertex algebra modules for irregular connections: A case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A vertex algebra with an action of a group $G$ comes with a notion of $g$-twisted modules, forming a $G$-crossed braided tensor category. For a Lie group $G$, one might instead wish for a notion of $(\mathrm{d}+A)$-twisted modules for any $\mathfrak{g}$-connection on the formal punctured disc. For connections with a regular singularity, this reduces to $g$-twisted modules, where $g$ is the monodromy around the puncture. The case of an irregular singularity is much richer and involved, and we are not aware that it has appeared in vertex algebra language. The present article is intended to spark such a treatment, by providing a list of expectations and an explicit worked-through example with interesting applications.
  Concretely, we consider the vertex super algebra of symplectic fermions, or equivalently the triplet vertex algebra $\mathcal{W}_p(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ for $p=2$, and study its twisted module with respect to irregular $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-connections. We first determine the category of representations, depending on the formal type of the connection. Then we prove that a Sugawara type construction gives a Virasoro action and we prove that as Virasoro modules our representations are direct sums of Whittaker modules.
  Conformal field theory with irregular singularities resp. wild ramification appear in the context of geometric Langlands correspondence, and in particular in work by Witten, higher dimensional field theories and AGT correspondence. Our original motivation comes from semiclassical limits of the generalized quantum Langlands kernel, which fibres over the space of connections [FL24], similar to the affine Lie algebra at critical level. Our present article now describes, in the smallest case, the fibres of this category over irregular connections.</description>

      <title>Vertex algebras with big center and a Kazhdan-Lusztig Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.13337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Certain deformable families of vertex algebras acquire at a limit of the deformation parameter a large center, similar to affine Lie algebras at critical level. Then the vertex algebra and its representation category become a bundle over the variety defined by this large center. The zero-fibre becomes a vertex algebra, the other fibres become twisted modules over this vertex algebra.
  We explore these ideas and a conjectural correspondence in a class of vertex algebras $A^{(p)}[\mathfrak{g},\kappa]$ associated to a choice of a finite-dimensional semisimple Lie algebra and an integer $(\mathfrak{g},p)$ and a level $\kappa$, and some related algebras. These algebras were introduced under the name quantum geometric Langlands kernels and have an interpretation in 4-dimensional quantum field theory. In the limit $\kappa\to \infty$, they acquire a large central subalgebra identified with the ring of functions on the space of $\mathfrak{g}$-connections. The zero fibre is expected to be the Feigin-Tipunin algebra $W_p(\mathfrak{g})$, whose category of representations is expected to be equivalent to the small quantum group by the logarithmic Kazhdan Lusztig conjecture.
  Our rigorous results focus on the cases $(\mathfrak{g},1)$ and $(\mathfrak{sl}_2,2)$. In the first part of the paper, which might be of independent interest, we discuss the twisted modules (including twists by unipotent elements) of the affine Lie algebra and of the triplet algebra $W_2(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$, and introduce a method of twisted free field realization to obtain twisted modules for arbitrary $(\mathfrak{g},p)$. We also match our findings to the respective quantum group with big center. In the second part of the paper we match the results to the vertex algebra bundle we compute from the limit of $A^{(p)}[\mathfrak{g},\kappa]$, which in our cases have realizations as GKO coset resp. N=4 superconformal algebras.</description>

Abstract: We determine the dimension of the Kauffman bracket skein module at generic $q$ for mapping tori of the 2-torus, generalising the well-known computation of Carrega and Gilmer. In the process, we give a decomposition of the twisted Hochschild homology of the $G$-skein algebra for $G = \mathrm{SL}_N$ or $\mathrm{GL}_N$, which is a direct summand of the whole skein module, and from which the dimensions follow easily in the cases $G = \mathrm{SL}_2$ and $G = \mathrm{GL}_1$.</description>

      <title>Actions of tensor categories on Kirchberg algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18429v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize the simplicity of Pimsner algebras for non-proper C*-correspondences. With the aid of this criterion, we give a systematic strategy to produce outer actions of unitary tensor categories on Kirchberg algebras. In particular, every countable unitary tensor category admits an outer action on the Cuntz algebra $\mathcal{O}_2$. We also study the realizability of modules over fusion rings as K-groups of Kirchberg algebras acted on by unitary tensor categories, which turns out to be generically true for every unitary fusion category. Several new examples are provided, among which actions on Cuntz algebras of 3-cocycle twists of cyclic groups are constructed for all possible 3-cohomological classes by answering a question asked by Izumi.</description>

      <title>Monomial web basis for the SL(N) skein algebra of the twice punctured sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a new proof of a slightly modified version of a result of Queffelec--Rose, by constructing a linear basis for the $\mathrm{SL}(n)$ skein algebra of the twice punctured sphere for any non-zero complex number $q$, excluding finitely many roots of unity of small order. In particular, the skein algebra is a commutative polynomial algebra in $n-1$ generators, where each generator is represented by an explicit $\mathrm{SL}(n)$ web, without crossings, on the surface. This includes the case $q=1$, where the skein algebra is identified with the coordinate ring of the $\mathrm{SL}(n)$ character variety of the twice punctured sphere. The proof of both the spanning and linear independence properties of the basis depends on the so-called $\mathrm{SL}(n)$ quantum trace map, due originally to Bonahon--Wong in the case $n=2$. Two consequences of our method are that the quantum trace map and the so-called splitting map embed the polynomial algebra into the Fock--Goncharov quantum higher Teichm\"uller space and the L\^{e}--Sikora stated skein algebra, respectively, of the annulus. We end by discussing the relationship with Fock--Goncharov duality.</description>
