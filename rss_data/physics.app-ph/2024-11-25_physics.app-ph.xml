      <title>LoRePIE: $\ell_0$ Regularised Extended Ptychographical Iterative Engine for Low-dose and Fast Electron Ptychography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extended Ptychographical Iterative Engine (ePIE) is a widely used phase retrieval algorithm for Electron Ptychography from 4-dimensional (4-D) Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (4-D STEM) measurements acquired with a focused or defocused electron probe. However, ePIE relies on redundancy in the data and hence requires adjacent illuminated areas to overlap. In this paper, we propose a regularised variant of ePIE that is more robust to low overlap ratios. We examine the performance of the proposed algorithm on an experimental 4-D STEM data of double layered Rotavirus particles acquired in a full scan with 85% overlap. By artificial down-sampling of the probe positions, we have created synthetic 4-D STEM datasets with different overlap ratios and use these to show that a high quality reconstruction of Rotavirus particles can be obtained from data with an overlap as low as 56%.</description>

      <title>Parametric study of filament and gap models of resistive switching in TaO$_x$-based devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A finite element model consisting of a conducting filament with or without a gap was used to reproduce behavior of TaO$_x$-based resistive switching devices. The specific goal was to explore the range of possible filament parameters such a filament diameter, composition, gap width, and composition to reproduce the conductance and shape of I-V while keeping the maximum temperature within acceptable range allowing for ion motion and preventing melting. The model solving heat and charge transport produced a good agreement with experimental data for the oxygen content in the filament below TaO$_{1.3}$, the filament diameter range between 6 and 22 nm, and the gap oxygen content between TaO$_{1.7}$ and TaO$_{1.85}$. Gap width was not limited on either low or high sides by the criteria considered in this report. The obtained filament composition corresponds to oxygen deficiency an order of magnitude higher than one estimated by other modelling efforts. This was in a large part due to use of recent experimental values of conductivity as a function of composition and temperature. Our modelling results imply that a large fraction of atoms leaves and/or accumulates within the filament to produce large relative concentration change. This, in turn, necessitates inclusion of strain energy in the filament formation modelling. In addition, the results reproduce non-linear I-V without the necessity of assuming the Poole-Frenkel type of electrical conduction or presence of a barrier at the oxide/metal interface.</description>

      <title>Static and dynamic analysis of auxetic three-dimensional curved metamaterials in both axial and circumferential directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metamaterials can enable unique mechanical properties based on their geometry rather than their chemical composition. Such properties can go beyond what is possible using conventional materials. Most of the existing literature consider metamaterials in Cartesian coordinates with zero curvature. However, realistic utilization of meta-structures is highly likely to involve a degree of curvature. In this paper, we study both the effective static and dynamic properties of metamaterials in the presence of curvature. To capture the effect of curvature on the static behavior of our metamaterial, we calculate the effective Poisson's ratio of the metamaterial in the presence of curvature. We conduct our analysis on three-dimensional metamaterials with varying effective Poisson's ratio. We observe a significant change in the values of the effective Poisson's ratio of the metamaterial duo to curvature. To capture the effect of curvature on the dynamics of our metamaterials, we calculate dispersion curves of curved metamaterial at different circumferential directions. We show both numerically and experimentally the change of the dynamic behavior of auxetic metamaterial from attenuation to transmission and vice-versa due to curvature. Our findings underscore the importance of curvature in both static and dynamic analysis of metamaterial design and could provide the means to guide practical implementations of metamaterials for functional use.</description>

      <title>Dielectric waveguide setup tested with a superconducting millimeter-wave Fabry-P\'erot interferometer at milli-Kelvin temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We proposed and tested a cryogenic setup comprising dielectric waveguides for mm-wave frequencies in the range of 75-110 GHz and temperatures down to 10 mK. The targeted applications are quantum technologies at millimeter-wave frequencies, which require measurements at low photon numbers and noise. We show that the high density polyethylene waveguides combine a frequency independent low photon loss with a very low heat conductance. Black high density polyethylene shows a higher attenuation, which is useful to block thermal photons in a cryogenic environment. The dielectric waveguides are thermally anchored and attenuated at several stages of the cryostat. They are individually protected by additional metallic shields to suppress mutual cross-talk and external interference. We have measured a Fabry-P\'erot cavity with superconducting mirrors at 10 mK and found out that the quality of a signal transmitted through the dielectric waveguides is sufficient to measure resonator quality factors over one million at 110 GHz.</description>

      <title>Comment on 'Attosecond electron microscopy and diffraction'</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent paper by Hui et al. (Ref. [1], Sci. Adv. 10, eadp5805 (2024)) claims the demonstration of 'Attosecond electron microscopy and diffraction' with laser-gated electron pulses. In this comment, we point out a series of physical and technical inconsistencies of the experiment and results. Beyond failing to show any microscopy, the reported concept does not produce properly gated electrons. Furthermore, the noise and signal levels of the presented data are statistically and quantitatively incompatible with the work's interpretation and attosecond dynamics in graphite. These inconsistencies render the claims and conclusions of Ref. [1] unsubstantiated and suggest that the data primarily show an interferometric artifact.</description>

      <title>Time Interfaces in Nanoplasma-Switched Wire Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we consider instantaneous transitions of an infinitely extended uniaxial dielectric into a wire medium (WM) of continuous infinitely long conducting wires. Due to the strong spatial dispersion in the WM the known (Morgenthaler's) theory of temporal discontinuities is not applicable. We solve this problem analytically in time domain. We show that a transverse electromagnetic (TM) plane wave transforms into four waves: a pair of TM waves and a pair of transverse electromagnetic waves. This way, the power flow splits into two different directions, with one of them along the wires. Such a transition can possibly be achieved by nanoplasma discharges in the gaps of the split wires, initiated by an external voltage source applied to the wire and transforming the split wires forming the uniaxial dielectric into continuous ones.</description>

      <title>Crack-free Sc$_{x}$Al$_{1-x}$N(000$\bar{1}$) layers grown on Si(111) by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the synthesis of 340-nm-thick Sc$_x$Al$_{1-x}$N layers with $0 \leq x \leq 0.35$ on AlN-buffered Si(111) by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy. We employ an AlN nucleation layer under conditions giving rise to single-domain N-polar [(000$\bar{1}$)-oriented] layers, as demonstrated by the ($3 \times 3$) pattern observed in reflection high-energy electron diffraction and confirmed by KOH etching. The subsequent growth of pure wurtzite Sc$_x$Al$_{1-x}$N layers with $x \leq 0.1$ is feasible at temperatures $\leq$ 740{\deg}C. However, layers with $x \geq 0.2$ grown at 740{\deg}C develop cracks due the high thermal mismatch between Sc$_x$Al$_{1-x}$N and Si. Lowering the growth temperature to 500{\deg}C not only prevents cracking but also improves the crystallinity of the layers. For Sc$_{0.3}$Al$_{0.7}$N layers grown at 500{\deg}C, additional x-ray reflections due to intermetallic AlSc and Al$_3$Sc inclusions are observed. The formation of these compounds can be inhibited by lowering the temperature further to 300{\deg}C.</description>

      <title>Low-Loss and Low-Power Silicon Ring Based WDM 32$\times$100 GHz Filter Enabled by a Novel Bend Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ring resonators are crucial in silicon photonics for various applications, but conventional designs face performance trade-offs. Here a third-order polynomial interconnected circular (TOPIC) bend is proposed to revolutionize the ring designs fundamentally. The TOPIC bend has a unique feature of continuous curvature and curvature derivative, which is theoretically derived to be essential for waveguide loss optimization. With the TOPIC bend, the silicon ring resonators demonstrated here have achieved three records to the best of our knowledge: the smallest radius (0.7 $\mathrm{\mu m}$) for silicon rings resonating with single guided mode, the lowest thermal tuning power (5.85 mW/$\pi$) for silicon rings with FSR $\geq$3.2 THz, and the first silicon ring-based WDM 32$\times$100 GHz filter. The filter has doubled the channel amount compared to the state of the art, and meanwhile achieved low insertion loss (1.91 $\pm$ 0.28 dB) and low tuning power (283 GHz/mW). Moreover, the TOPIC bend is not limited to ring applications, it can also be used to create bends with an arbitrary angle, with the advantages of ultra-compact radius and heater integration, which are expected to replace all circular bends in integrated photonics, greatly reducing system size and power consumption.</description>

      <title>Significant loss suppression and large induced chirality via cooperative near- and far-field coupling in plasmonic dimer nanoantennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasmonic nanoantennas containing nano-gaps support "hotspots" for greatly enhanced light-matter interactions, but suffer from inherent high losses, a long-standing issue that hinders practical applications. Here we report a strategy to significantly suppress the losses of plasmonic dimer nanoantennas. Specifically, by introducing the concept of cooperative near- and far-field coupling, we observed an unprecedented transition from the weak coupling of localized resonances to strong coupling of collective (nonlocal) resonances, showing robustness to the gap distance between the dimer. We develop a generalized lattice sum approximation model to describe this transition and reveal its origins: the off-diagonal element of the anisotropic polarizability tensor due to near-field coupling, and the anisotropic lattice sums due to far-field coupling. This strong coupling leads to loss-suppressed plasmonic resonances with large modulation depths and meanwhile extremely high measured quality factors up to 3120 in the near-infrared regime, exceeding the record in the near infrared regime. Additionally, high-$Q$ and large chiroptical responses can also be induced for achiral planar dimers under the critical coupling condition. This work paves an avenue toward extremely low-loss plasmonic devices, either chiral or not, for diverse important applications.</description>

      <title>Ultra-High-Efficiency Dual-Band Thin-Film Lithium Niobate Modulator Incorporating Low-k Underfill with 220 GHz Extrapolated Bandwidth for 390 Gbit/s PAM8 Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-performance electro-optic modulators play a critical role in modern telecommunication networks and intra-datacenter interconnects. Low driving voltage, large electro-optic bandwidth, compact device size, and multi-band operation ability are essential for various application scenarios, especially energy-efficient high-speed data transmission. However, it is challenging to meet all these requirements simultaneously. Here, we demonstrate a high-performance dual-band thin-film lithium niobate electro-optic modulator with low-k underfill to achieve overall performance improvement. The low-k material helps reduce the RF loss of the modulator and achieve perfect velocity matching with narrow electrode gap to overcome the voltage-bandwidth limitation, extending electro-optic bandwidth and enhancing modulation efficiency simultaneously. The fabricated 7-mm-long modulator exhibits a low half-wave voltage of 1.9 V at C-band and 1.54 V at O-band, featuring a low half-wave voltage-length product of 1.33 V*cm and 1.08 V*cm, respectively. Meanwhile, the novel design yields an ultra-wide extrapolated 3 dB bandwidth of 220 GHz (218 GHz) in the C-band (O-band). High-speed data transmission in both C- and O-bands using the same device has been demonstrated for the first time by PAM8 with data rates up to 390 Gbit/s, corresponding to a record-low energy consumption of 0.69 fJ/bit for next-generation cost-effective ultra-high-speed optical communications.</description>

      <title>Noise-induced nonreciprocal topological dissipative solitons in directionally coupled chains and lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal coupling can alter the transport properties of material media, producing striking phenomena such as unidirectional amplification of waves, boundary modes, or self-assembled pattern formation. It is responsible for nonlinear convective instabilities in nonlinear systems that drive topological dissipative solitons in a single direction, producing a lossless information transmission. Considering fluctuations, which are intrinsic to every macroscopic dynamical system, noise-sustained structures emerge permanently in time. Here, we study arrays of nonreciprocally coupled bistable systems exhibiting noise-sustained topological phase wall (or soliton) dynamics. The bifurcations between different steady states are analytically addressed, and the properties of the noise-sustained states are unveiled as a function of the reciprocal and nonreciprocal coupling parameters. Furthermore, we study critical points where the structures' characteristic size diverges with different power law exponents. Our numerical results agree with the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Phased Gradient Ultra Open Metamaterials for Broadband Acoustic Silencing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Noise pollution is a persistent environmental concern with severe implications for human health and resources. Acoustic metamaterials offer the potential for ultrathin silencing devices; however, existing designs often lack practical openness and are thereby limited by their functional bandwidths. This paper introduces a novel approach utilizing a phase gradient ultra-open metamaterial (PGUOM) to address these challenges. The PGUOM, characterized by a phase gradient across three unit cells, efficiently transforms incident waves into spoof surface waves, effectively blocking sound while allowing for a high degree of ventilation. Our design provides adjustable openness, accommodates various boundary conditions, and ensures sustained broadband sound insulation. Theoretical, numerical, and experimental validations demonstrate the efficacy of our concept. This innovative approach represents a significant advancement in ventilated acoustic metamaterials, providing both ventilation and high-performance, broadband sound insulation simultaneously.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06483v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Partially synchronized solitary states occur frequently when a synchronized system of networked oscillators is perturbed locally. Several asymptotic states of different frequencies can coexist at the same node. Here, we reveal the mechanism behind this multistability: additional solitary frequencies arise from the coupling between network modes and the solitary oscillator's frequency, leading to significant energy transfer. This can cause the solitary node's frequency to resonate with a Laplacian eigenvalue. We analyze which network structures enable this resonance and explain longstanding numerical observations. Another solitary state is characterized by the effective decoupling of the synchronized network and the solitary node at the natural frequency. Our framework unifies the description of solitary states near and far from resonance, allowing to predict the behavior of complex networks.</description>

Abstract: Optically bistable materials respond to a single input with two possible optical outputs, contingent upon excitation history. Such materials would be ideal for optical switching and memory, yet limited understanding of intrinsic optical bistability (IOB) prevents development of nanoscale IOB materials suitable for devices. Here, we demonstrate IOB in Nd3+-doped KPb2Cl5 avalanching nanoparticles (ANPs), which switch with high contrast between luminescent and non-luminescent states, with hysteresis characteristic of bistability. We elucidate a nonthermal mechanism in which IOB originates from suppressed nonradiative relaxation in Nd3+ ions and from the positive feedback of photon avalanching, resulting in extreme, &gt;200th-order optical nonlinearities. Modulation of laser pulsing tunes hysteresis widths, and dual-laser excitation enables transistor-like optical switching. This control over nanoscale IOB establishes ANPs for photonic devices in which light is used to manipulate light.</description>
