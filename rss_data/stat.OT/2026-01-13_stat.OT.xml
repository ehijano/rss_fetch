      <title>Bayesian Handwriting Evidence Evaluation using MANOVA via Fourier-Based Extracted Features</title>

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel statistical approach that aims at the identification of valid and useful patterns in handwriting examination via Bayesian modeling. Starting from a sample of characters selected among 13 French native writers, an accurate loop reconstruction can be achieved through Fourier analysis. The contour shape of handwritten characters can be described by the first four pairs of Fourier coefficients and by the surface size. Six Bayesian models are considered for such handwritten features. These models arise from two likelihood structures: (a) a multivariate Normal model, and (b) a MANOVA model that accounts for character-level variability. For each likelihood, three different prior formulations are examined, resulting in distinct Bayesian models: (i) a conjugate Normal-Inverse-Wishart prior, (ii) a hierarchical Normal-Inverse-Wishart prior, and (iii) a Normal-LogNormal-LKJ prior specification. The hierarchical prior formulations are of primary interest because they can incorporate the between-writers variability, a distinguishing element that sets writers apart. These approaches do not allow calculation of the marginal likelihood in a closed-form expression. Therefore, bridge sampling is used to estimate it. The Bayes factor is estimated to compare the performance of the proposed models and to evaluate their efficiency for discriminating purposes. Bayesian MANOVA with Normal-LogNormal-LKJ prior showed an overall better performance, in terms of discriminatory capacity and model fitting. Finally, a sensitivity analysis for the elicitation of the prior distribution parameters is performed.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Strategies for Detecting and Sampling Misrepresented Subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01342v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Economic policy research frequently examines population well-being, with a particular focus on the relationships between unequal living conditions, low educational attainment, and social exclusion. Sample surveys, such as EU-SILC, are widely used for this purpose and inform public policy; yet, their sampling designs may fail to adequately represent rare, hard-to-sample, or under-covered subgroups. This limitation can hinder socio-demographic analyses and evidence-based policy design. We propose a generalisable approach based on univariate and multivariate unsupervised learning techniques to detect outliers in survey data that may signal under-represented subgroups. Identified groups can then be characterised to inform targeted resampling strategies that improve survey inclusiveness. An empirical application using the 2019 EU-SILC data for the Italian region of Liguria shows that citizenship, material deprivation, large household size, and economic vulnerability are key indicators of under-representation.</description>
