      <title>From the Shadows: The Impact of Nightside Thermal Emission on Ultra-hot Jupiter Transmission Spectra Retrievals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transmission spectroscopy is the most widely used technique for studying exoplanet atmospheres. Since the planetary nightside faces the observer during a transit, highly irradiated giant exoplanets with warm nightsides emit thermal radiation that can contaminate transmission spectra. Observations of ultra-hot Jupiters in the near- and mid-infrared with JWST are especially susceptible to nightside contamination. However, nightside thermal emission is generally not considered in atmospheric retrievals of exoplanet transmission spectra. Here, we quantify the potential biases from neglecting nightside thermal emission in multidimensional atmospheric retrievals of an ultra-hot Jupiter. Using simulated JWST transmission spectra of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-33b (0.8-12 $\mu$m), we find that transmission spectra retrievals without nightside emission can overestimate molecular abundances by almost an order-of-magnitude and underestimate the dayside temperature by $\gtrsim$ 400 K. We show that a modified retrieval prescription, including both transmitted light and nightside thermal emission, correctly recovers the atmospheric properties and is favored by Bayesian model comparisons. Nightside thermal contamination can be readily implemented in retrieval models via a first-order approximation, and we provide formulae to estimate whether this effect is likely to be significant for a given planet. We recommend that nightside emission should be included as standard practice when interpreting ultra-hot Jupiter transmission spectra with JWST.</description>

      <title>The effects of the carbon-to-oxygen ratio on the condensate compositions around Solar-like stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The initial stellar carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio can have a large impact on the resulting condensed species present in the protoplanetary disk and, hence, the composition of the bodies and planets that form. The observed C/O ratios of stars can vary from 0.1-2. We use a sequential dust condensation model to examine the impact of the C/O ratio on the composition of solids around a Solar-like star. We utilize this model in a focused examination of the impact of varying the initial stellar C/O ratio to isolate the effects of the C/O ratio in the context of Solar-like stars. We describe three different system types in our findings. The Solar system falls into the silicate-dominant, low C/O ratio systems which end at a stellar C/O ratio somewhere between 0.52 and 0.6. At C/O ratios between about 0.6 and 0.9, we have intermediate systems. Intermediate systems show a decrease in silicates while carbides begin to become significant. Carbide-dominant systems begin around a C/O ratio of 0.9. Carbide-dominant systems exhibit high carbide surface densities at inner radii with comparable levels of carbides and silicates at outer radii. Our models show that changes between C/O=0.8 and C/O=1 are more significant than previous studies, that carbon can exceed 80% of the condensed mass, and that carbon condensation can be significant at radii up to 6 AU.</description>

      <title>The $\sim$50-Myr-Old TOI-942c is Likely on an Aligned, Coplanar Orbit and Losing Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the observation of the transiting planet TOI-942c, a Neptunian planet orbiting a young K-type star approximately 50 Myr years old. Using Keck/HIRES, we observed a partial transit of the planet and detected an associated radial velocity anomaly. By modeling the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect, we derived a sky-projected obliquity of $\left|\lambda\right|=24^{+14}_{-14}$ degrees, indicating TOI-942c is in a prograde and likely aligned orbit. Upon incorporation of the star's inclination and the planet's orbital inclination, we determined a true obliquity for TOI-942c of $\psi&lt; 43$ degrees at 84\% confidence, while dynamic analysis strongly suggests TOI-942c is aligned with stellar spin and coplanar with the inner planet. Furthermore, TOI-942c is also a suitable target for studying atmospheric loss of young Neptunian planets that are likely still contracting from the heat of formation. We observed a blueshifted excess absorption in the H-alpha line at 6564.7 \AA, potentially indicating atmospheric loss due to photoevaporation. However, due to the lack of pre-ingress data, additional observations are needed to confirm this measurement.</description>

      <title>Lunar Swirls Unveil the Origin of the Moon Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origins of the lunar magnetic anomalies and swirls have long puzzled scientists.The prevailing theory posits that an ancient lunar dynamo core field magnetized extralunar meteoritic materials, leading to the current remnant magnetic anomalies that shield against solar wind ions, thereby contributing to the formation of lunar swirls. Our research reveals that these lunar swirls are the result of ancient electrical currents that traversed the Moon's surface, generating powerful magnetizing fields impacting both native lunar rocks and extralunar projectile materials. We have reconstructed 3-D distribution maps of these ancient subsurface currents and developed coupling models of magnetic and electric fields that take into account the subsurface density in the prominent lunar maria and basins. Our simulations suggest these ancient currents could have reached density up to 13 A/m2, with surface magnetizing field as strong as 469 {\mu}T. We propose that these intense electrical current discharges in the crust originate from ancient interior dynamo activity.</description>

      <title>Investing in the Unrivaled Potential of Wide-Separation Sub-Jupiter Exoplanet Detection and Characterisation with JWST -- Strategic Exoplanet Initiatives with HST and JWST White Paper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We advocate for a large scale imaging survey of nearby young moving groups and star-forming regions to directly detect exoplanets over an unexplored range of masses, ages and orbits. Discovered objects will be identified early enough in JWST's lifetime to leverage its unparalleled capabilities for long-term atmospheric characterisation, and will uniquely complement the known population of exoplanets and brown dwarfs. Furthermore, this survey will constrain the occurrence of the novel wide sub-Jovian exoplanet population, informing multiple theories of planetary formation and evolution. Observations with NIRCam F200W+F444W dual-band coronagraphy will readily provide sub-Jupiter mass sensitivities beyond ~0.4" (F444W) and can also be used to rule out some contaminating background sources (F200W). At this large scale, targets can be sequenced by spectral type to enable robust self-referencing for PSF subtraction. This eliminates the need for dedicated reference observations required by GO programs and dramatically increases the overall science observing efficiency. With an exposure of ~30 minutes per target, the sub-Jupiter regime can be explored across 250 targets for ~400 hours of exposure time including overheads. An additional, pre-allocated, ~100 hours of observing time would enable rapid multi-epoch vetting of the lowest mass detections (which are undetectable in F200W). The total time required for a survey such as this is not fixed, and could be scaled in conjunction with the minimum number of detected exoplanet companions.</description>

      <title>The Unrealised Interdisciplinary Advantage of Observing High Mass Transiting Exoplanets and Brown Dwarfs -- Strategic Exoplanet Initiatives with HST and JWST White Paper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We advocate for further prioritisation of atmospheric characterisation observations of high mass transiting exoplanets and brown dwarfs. This population acts as a unique comparative sample to the directly imaged exoplanet and brown dwarf populations, of which a range of JWST characterisation observations are planned. In contrast, only two observations of transiting exoplanets in this mass regime were performed in Cycle 1, and none are planned for Cycle 2. Such observations will: improve our understanding of how irradiation influences high gravity atmospheres, provide insights towards planetary formation and evolution across this mass regime, and exploit JWST's unique potential to characterise exoplanets across the known population.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the high early solar cosmic ray flux with cosmogenic neon isotopes in refractory minerals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An enhancement in the activity of the early young Sun resulting in a high charged particle flux has been invoked to explain excesses in spallation-induced nuclides in primitive planetary materials. Astronomical observations of energetic outbursts of young stellar objects (YSOs) also support the idea of an active young Sun. However, the early solar cosmic-ray (SCR) flux has not been well constrained. Here we use measured concentrations of SCR-produced nuclides that formed and are preserved in meteoritical hibonite and spinel, some of the oldest solids formed in the Solar System, and physical models for dust transport in the early protoplanetary disk to determine the magnitude of the early SCR flux. We focus our attention on cosmogenic neon which cannot have been inherited from precursors and can only be produced in situ in solids. Our modeled effective exposure time to SCRs for these solids is very short on the order of years. This indicates the early SCR flux recorded in refractory mineral hibonite was up to ~7 orders of magnitude higher than the contemporary level. Our flux estimate is consistent with the &gt;10^5 enhanced flux inferred from astronomical observations of greatly enhanced flare activities of YSOs.</description>

      <title>Cyclical period changes in cataclysmic variables: a statistical study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the results of a statistical study of cyclical period changes in cataclysmic variables (CVs). Assuming the third-body hypothesis as the cause of period changes, we estimate the third-body mass, $m_3$, and its separation from the binary, $a_3$, for 21 CVs showing cyclical period changes from well-sampled observed-minus-calculated diagrams covering more than a decade of observations. The inferred $a_3$ values are independent of the binary orbital period, $P_\mathrm{orb}$, whereas the $m_3$ values increase with $P_\mathrm{orb}$ by an order of magnitude from the shortest period (oldest) to the longest period (youngest) systems, implying significant mass loss from the third body with time. A model for the time evolution of the triple system is not able to simultaneously explain the observed behavior of the $m_3(P_\mathrm{orb})$ and $a_3(P_\mathrm{orb})$ distributions because the combined mass loss from the binary and the third body demands an increase in orbital separation by factors $\sim 140$ as the binary evolves toward shorter $P_\mathrm{orb}$'s, in clear disagreement with the observed distribution. We conclude that the third-body hypothesis is statistically inconsistent and cannot be used to explain cyclical period changes observed in CVs. On the other hand, the diagram of the amplitude of the period change versus the CV donor-star mass is consistent both with the alternative hypothesis that the observed cyclical period changes are a consequence of magnetic activity in the solar-type donor star, and with the standard evolutionary scenario for CVs.</description>

      <title>Scaling of the geomagnetic secular variation time scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ratio of the Lowes spectrum and the secular variation spectrum measured at the Earth's surface provides a time scale $\tau_{\rm sv}(l)$ as a function of spherical harmonic degree $l$. $\tau_{\rm sv}$ is often assumed to be representative of time scales related to the dynamo inside the outer core and its scaling with $l$ is debated. To assess the validity of this surmise and to study the time variation of the geomagnetic field $\boldsymbol{\dot B}$ inside the outer core, we introduce a magnetic time-scale spectrum $\tau(l,r)$ that is valid for all radius $r$ above the inner core and reduces to the usual $\tau_{\rm sv}$ at and above the core-mantle boundary (CMB). We study $\tau$ in a numerical geodynamo model. Focusing on the large scales, we find that $\tau \sim l^{-1}$ at the CMB. Just below the CMB, $\tau$ undergo a sharp transition such that the scaling becomes shallower than $l^{-1}$. This transition stems from the magnetic boundary condition at the CMB that ties all three components of $\boldsymbol{\dot B}$ together. In the interior of the outer core, the time variation of the horizontal magnetic field, which dominates $\boldsymbol{\dot B}$, has no such constraint. The upshot is $\tau_{\rm sv}$ becomes unreliable in estimating time scales inside the outer core. Another question concerning $\tau$ is whether a scaling argument based on the frozen-flux hypothesis can be used to explain its scaling. To investigate this, we analyse the induction equation in the spectral space. We find that away from both boundaries, the magnetic diffusion term is negligible in the power spectrum of $\boldsymbol{\dot B}$. However, $\boldsymbol{\dot B}$ is controlled by the radial derivative in the induction term, thus invalidating the frozen-flux argument. Near the CMB, magnetic diffusion starts to affect $\boldsymbol{\dot B}$ rendering the frozen-flux hypothesis inapplicable.</description>

      <title>Puffy Venuses: the Mass-Radius Impact of Carbon-Rich Atmospheres on Lava Worlds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent advancements in exoplanet observations enable the potential detection of exo-Venuses, rocky planets with carbon-rich atmospheres. How extended these atmospheres can be, given high carbon abundances, has not been studied. To answer this, we present a model for a theoretical class of exoplanets - puffy Venuses - characterized by thick, carbon-dominated atmospheres in equilibrium with global magma oceans. Our model accounts for carbon and hydrogen partition between the atmosphere and the magma ocean, as well as the C-H-O equilibrium chemistry throughout a semi-grey, radiative-convective atmosphere. We find that radius inflation by puffy Venus atmospheres is significant on small and irradiated planets: carbon content of 1200 ppm (or that of ordinary chondrites) can generate an atmosphere of ~0.16 - 0.3 $R_{\oplus}$ for an Earth-mass planet with equilibrium temperatures of 1500 to 2000 K. We identify TOI-561 b as an especially promising puffy Venus candidate, whose under-density could be attributed to a thick C-rich atmosphere. We also advocate for a puffy Venus interpretation of 55 Cancri e, where recent JWST observation indicates the presence of a CO/CO2 atmosphere. Puffy Venuses may thus constitute a testable alternative interpretation for the interior structure of underdense low-mass exoplanets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exoplanet discoveries have revealed a dramatic diversity of planet sizes across a vast array of orbital architectures. Sub-Neptunes are of particular interest; due to their absence in our own solar system, we rely on demographics of exoplanets to better understand their bulk composition and formation scenarios. Here, we present the discovery and characterization of TOI-1437 b, a sub-Neptune with a 18.84 day orbit around a near-Solar analog (Mstar = 1.10 +/- 0.10 Msun, Rstar = 1.17 +/- 0.12 Rsun). The planet was detected using photometric data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission and radial velocity follow-up observations were carried out as a part of the TESS-Keck Survey (TKS) using both the HIRES instrument at Keck Observatory and the Levy Spectrograph on the Automated Planet Finder (APF) telescope. A combined analysis of these data reveal a planet radius of Rp = 2.24 +/- 0.23 Rearth and a mass measurement of Mp = 9.6 +/- 3.9 Mearth). TOI-1437 b is one of few (~50) known transiting sub-Neptunes orbiting a solar-mass star that has a radial velocity mass measurement. As the formation pathway of these worlds remains an unanswered question, the precise mass characterization of TOI-1437 b may provide further insight into this class of planet.</description>

      <title>Deepest limits on scattered light emission from the Epsilon Eridani inner debris disk with HST/STIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Epsilon Eridani ($\epsilon$ Eri) is one of the first debris disk systems detected by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS). However, the system has thus far eluded detection in scattered light with no components having been directly imaged. Its similarity to a relatively young Solar System combined with its proximity makes it an excellent candidate to further our understanding of planetary system evolution. We present a set of coronagraphic images taken using the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) coronagraph on the Hubble space telescope at a small inner working angle to detect a predicted warm inner debris disk inside 1". We used three different post-processing approaches; Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), Karhunen-Lo`eve Image Processing (KLIP), and Classical reference differential imaging (RDI), to best optimize reference star subtraction, and find that NMF performed the best overall while KLIP produced the absolute best contrast inside 1". We present limits on scattered light from warm dust, with constraints on surface brightness at 6 mJy/as$^2$ at our inner working angle of 0.6". We also place a constraint of 0.5 mJy/as$^2$ outside 1", which gives us an upper limit on the brightness for outer disks and substellar companions. Finally, we calculated an upper limit on the dust albedo at $\omega &lt;$ 0.487.</description>
