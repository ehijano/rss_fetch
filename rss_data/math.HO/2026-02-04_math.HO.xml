      <title>Visualizing the Matrix Product as a Transformation: A Task Design Using GeoGebra in Secondary Mathematics Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The teaching of matrix multiplication in secondary education is often limited to the mechanical application of the row-by-column algorithm, leaving aside its interpretation as a geometric transformation. This study analyzes the impact of a GeoGebra-mediated instructional sequence, grounded in the Mathematical Working Space (MWS) framework, on students learning of the matrix product. Ten fifth-year secondary students from a school in Lima (Peru) participated in the study. The intervention was carried out over four sessions, combining manual activities with digital exploration using GeoGebra. The results show notable progress in students semiotic genesis, reflected in the coordination of algebraic, graphical, and numerical representations; in instrumental genesis, through the increasingly meaningful use of GeoGebra as a cognitive tool; and in discursive genesis, as students developed explanations of the geometric effects of matrices. A transition is observed from an algorithmic execution of matrix multiplication toward a conceptual understanding based on linear transformations. These findings suggest that task designs integrating manual work, dynamic visualization, and mathematical argumentation support deeper understanding of matrix multiplication and provide criteria for the reflective use of digital technologies in secondary linear algebra instruction.</description>

      <title>Footprints of the Walking of Numbers: A Dynamic Visualization Task for Understanding Decimal Numbers in Secondary Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of decimal numbers in secondary education is often approached from algorithmic perspectives, which limits students' understanding of their structure. This paper presents the task Footprints of the Walking of Numbers, a dynamic visualization proposal aimed at supporting the understanding of decimal numbers through the exploration of their infinite decimal expansions. The task is based on assigning vectors to the decimal digits from 0 to 9, so that the sequence of digits of a number generates a dynamic geometric path in the plane. Through the use of GeoGebra as a visualization environment, students can observe, compare, and interpret traces associated with different types of numbers, such as terminating decimals, repeating decimals, and irrational numbers, identifying visual regularities linked to their decimal behavior. The analysis is developed from a theoretical-didactical perspective, using the Mathematical Working Space as an interpretative lens to characterize the potential of the task design. In addition, the paper discusses the punctual use of generative AI tools exclusively as instrumental support for computation, without shifting the focus away from mathematical reasoning.</description>

      <title>The Lagrange-D'Alembert Principle from the Viewpoint of ODE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.01675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.01675v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate the Lagrange-D'Alembert principle as a pure mathematical theory that meets modern standards of rigor. While we note several new aspects of the principle, the article is primarily methodological.</description>
