      <title>Electric-Field-Controlled Chemical Reaction via Piezo-Chemistry Creates Programmable Material Stiffness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spatial and temporal control of material properties at a distance has yielded many unique innovations including photo-patterning, 3D-printing, and architected material design. To date, most of these innovations have relied on light, heat, sound, or electric current as stimuli for controlling the material properties. Here, we demonstrate that an electric field can induce chemical reactions and subsequent polymerization in composites via piezoelectrically-mediated transduction. The response to an electric field rather than through direct contact with an electrode is mediated by a nanoparticle transducer, i.e., piezoelectric ZnO, which mediates reactions between thiol and alkene monomers, resulting in tunable moduli as a function of voltage, time, and the frequency of the applied AC power. The reactivity of the mixture and the modulus of a na\"ive material containing these elements can be programmed based on the distribution of the electric field strength. This programmability results in multi-stiffness gels. Additionally, the system can be adjusted for the formation of an electro-adhesive. This simple and generalizable design opens new avenues for facile application in adaptive damping and variable-rigidity materials, adhesive, soft robotics, and potentially tissue engineering.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Training for Dynamics Matching in Coarse-Grained Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are essential for studying complex molecular systems, but their high computational cost limits scalability. Coarse-grained (CG) models reduce this cost by simplifying the system, yet traditional approaches often fail to maintain dynamic consistency, compromising their reliability in kinetics-driven processes. Here, we introduce an adversarial training framework that aligns CG trajectory ensembles with all-atom (AA) reference dynamics, ensuring both thermodynamic and kinetic fidelity. Our method adapts the adversarial learning paradigm, combining a physics-based generator with a neural network discriminator that differentiates between AA and CG trajectories. By adversarially optimizing CG parameters, our approach eliminates the need for predefined kinetic features. Applied to liquid water, it accurately reproduces radial and angular distribution functions as well as dynamical mean squared displacement, even extrapolating long-timescale dynamics from short training trajectories. This framework offers a new approach for bottom-up CG modeling, offering a systematic and principled way to preserve dynamic consistency in complex coarse-grained molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Timing the Escape of a Caged Electron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charge transfer is fundamentally dependent on the overlap of the orbitals comprising the transport pathway. This has key implications for molecular, nanoscale, and quantum technologies, for which delocalization (and decoherence) rates are essential figures of merit. Here, we apply the core hole clock technique - an energy-domain variant of ultrafast spectroscopy - to probe the delocalization of a photoexcited electron inside a closed molecular cage, namely the Ar 2p54s1 state of Ar@C60. Despite marginal frontier orbital mixing in the ground configuration, almost 80% of the excited state density is found outside the buckyball due to the formation of a markedly diffuse hybrid orbital. Far from isolating the intracage excitation, the surrounding fullerene is instead a remarkably efficient conduit for electron transfer: we measure characteristic delocalization times of 6.6 $\pm$ 0.3 fs and $\lesssim$ 500 attoseconds, respectively, for a 3D Ar@C60 film and a 2D monolayer on Ag(111).</description>

      <title>VQE calculations on a NISQ era trapped ion quantum computer using a multireference unitary coupled cluster ansatz: application to the BeH$_2$ insertion problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we employ the variational quantum eigensolver algorithm with a multireference unitary coupled cluster ansatz to report the ground state energy of the BeH$_2$ molecule in a geometry where strong correlation effects are significant. We consider the two most important determinants in the construction of the reference state for our ansatz. Furthermore, in order to carry out our intended 12-qubit computation on a noisy intermediate scale quantum era trapped ion hardware (the commercially available IonQ Forte-I), we perform a series of resource reduction techniques to a. decrease the number of two-qubit gates by 99.84% (from 12515 to 20 two-qubit gates) relative to the unoptimized circuit, and b. reduce the number of measurements via the idea of supercliques, while losing 2.69% in the obtained ground state energy (with error mitigation and post-selection) relative to that computed classically for the same resource-optimized problem setting.</description>

      <title>Quantum Magnetic J-Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We realize quantum oscillators operating at microhertz to tens of hertz frequencies based on nuclear scalar couplings in molecules in solution. The oscillators are implemented by coupling in situ hyperpolarized samples with programmable digital feedback that allows amplifying specific J-coupling transitions at zero field. Due to the fundamental insensitivity of J-couplings to magnetic field fluctuations, we achieve extremely stable coherent oscillations for longer than 3000 s, with a 337 uHz linewidth limited primarily by the measurement time. The ability to control the feedback delay and the external gain enabled us to resolve overlapping resonances, making possible on-demand spectral editing. Importantly, implementing active feedback allowed us to obviate the requirement of population inversion and relax the requirements on sample polarization. The quantum oscillator phenomenon demonstrated here for various chemical classes (nitriles, heterocycles, and organic acids) significantly improves resolution of zero-field NMR spectra, including for samples with natural isotopic abundance, and expands applications of J-spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Are Molecules Magical? Non-Stabilizerness in Molecular Bonding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Isolated atoms as well as molecules at equilibrium are presumed to be simple from the point of view of quantum computational complexity. Here we show that the process of chemical bond formation is accompanied by a marked increase in the quantum complexity of the electronic ground state. By studying the hydrogen dimer H$_{2}$ as a prototypical example, we demonstrate that when two hydrogen atoms form a bond, a specific measure of quantum complexity exhibits a pronounced peak that closely follows the behavior of the binding energy. This measure of quantum complexity, known as magic in the quantum information literature, reflects how difficult it is to simulate the state using classical methods. This observation suggests that regions of strong bonding formation or breaking are also regions of enhanced intrinsic quantum complexity. This insight suggests a connection of quantum information measures to chemical reactivity and advocates the use of stretched molecules as a quantum computational resource.</description>

      <title>Extended study of crystal structures, optical properties and vibrational spectra of polar 2-aminopyrimidinium hydrogen phosphite and bis(2-aminopyrimidinium) sulfate monohydrate and two 2-aminopyrimidinium hydrogen sulfate polymorphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study aimed primarily at completing and extending the characterization of the crystallographic, spectroscopic and optical properties of polar, biaxial, optically negative 2-aminopyrimidinium(1+) hydrogen phosphite. Besides the redetermination of the low-temperature crystal structure (space group P21), high-quality single crystals of this salt were grown from an aqueous solution, and their optical properties were studied. The determination of the refractive indices in the wavelength range of 435-1083 nm showed anomalous dispersion of the refractive indices, resulting in a point of uniaxiality. The crystal allows phase matching for collinear second harmonic generation (SHG) processes of both type I and type II in a broad wavelength range. SHG properties were studied for powdered size-fractioned samples and oriented single-crystal cuts. The optical damage threshold experiments confirmed excellent optical resistance - at least 220 TWm-2 and 70 TWm-2 for 800 and 1000 nm irradiation, respectively. The low-temperature crystallographic study was also extended for three monoclinic salts of 2-aminopyrimidine and sulfuric acid - i.e. bis(2-aminopyrimidinium(1+) sulfate monohydrate (space group P21/n) and two polymorphs of 2-aminopyrimidinium(1+) hydrogen sulfate (both with space group P21/c). The vibrational spectra of all title compounds were assigned using single-molecule quantum chemical computations (including Potential Energy Distribution analysis) in combination with the nuclear site group analysis. Spectroscopic results concerning sulfates of 2-aminopyrimidine provided valuable reference materials for the vibrational spectroscopic study and also addressed the question of their polymorphism. An optimal computational approach employing solid-state DFT calculations has also been sought to model the vibrational spectra of 2-aminopyrimidinium (1+) hydrogen phosphite crystals.</description>

      <title>Plasmon-driven substitution of 4 mercaptophenylboronic acid to 4-nitrothiophenol monitored by surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15418v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Plasmon-driven reactions on plasmonic nanoparticles (NPs) occur under significantly different conditions from those of classical organic synthesis and provide a promising pathway for enhancing the efficiency of various chemical processes. However, these reactions can also have undesirable effects, such as 4-mercaptophenylboronic acid (MPBA) deboronation. MPBA chemisorbs well to Ag NPs through its thiol group and can subsequently bind to diols, enabling the detection of various biological structures by surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), but not upon its deboronation. To avoid this reaction, we investigated the experimental conditions of MPBA deboronation on Ag NPs by SERS. Our results showed that the level of deboronation strongly depends on both the morphology of the system and the excitation laser wavelength and power. In addition, we detected not only the expected products, namely thiophenol and biphenyl-4,4-dithiol, but also 4-nitrothiophenol (NTP). The crucial reagent for NTP formation was an oxidation product of hydroxylamine hydrochloride, the reduction agent used in Ag NP synthesis. Ultimately, this reaction was replicated by adding NaNO2 to the system, and its progress was monitored as a function of the laser power, thereby identifying a new reaction of plasmon-driven -B(OH)2 substitution for -NO2.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unitary transformations play a fundamental role in many-body physics, and except for special cases, they are not expressible in closed form. We present closed-form expressions for unitary transformations generated by a single fermionic operator for Hermitian and anti-Hermitian generators. We demonstrate the usefulness of these expressions in formal analyses of unitary transformations and numerical applications involving block-diagonalization and Heisenberg dynamics. This work paves the way for new analytical treatments of unitary transformations and numerical many-body methods for fermions.</description>

      <title>The ground electronic state of CS: the potential curve and associated Born-Oppenheimer rovibrational spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14875v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Basics of the Born-Oppenheimer (B-O) approximation are reviewed. Assuming the domain of applicability of B-O approximation is limited to 4 significant digits (s.d.) in energy spectrum, where mass, relativistic and QED corrections do NOT contribute, it is shown that for carbon monosulfide ${\rm C}\,{\rm S}$ the potential curve $V(R)$ for the electronic ground state $X^1\Sigma^+$ can be constructed analytically in the form of two-point Pade approximant $\frac{1}{R}\ P(5,10)(R)$ in the whole range of internuclear distances $R \in [0,\infty)$. Pade approximant is fixed by taking into account the turning points with 4 s.d. accuracy, found by Coxon and Hajigeorgiou (2023), and asymptotics at small and large internuclear distances,
  By solving two-body radial nuclear Schr\"odinger equation with the potential $V(R)$ (with standard centrifugal potential included) in the Lagrange Mesh method, the whole B-O rovibrational spectrum for ${}^{12} {\rm C}\,{}^{32} {\rm S}$ diatomic molecule (taken as a particular example) is found: the $\sim 14562$ rovibrational energy states with angular momentum $L_{max}=289$ and vibrational quantum number $\nu_{max} \sim 82$ with accuracy $\sim 10^{-4}$ hartree in energy. It is shown that the experimentally observed transition energies are reproduced within 3-5 s.d. Critical analysis of existing theoretical (phenomenological) results on the rovibrational spectrum is carried out and its comparison with present ones is made.</description>

      <title>Learning Equivariant Non-Local Electron Density Functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accuracy of density functional theory hinges on the approximation of non-local contributions to the exchange-correlation (XC) functional. To date, machine-learned and human-designed approximations suffer from insufficient accuracy, limited scalability, or dependence on costly reference data. To address these issues, we introduce Equivariant Graph Exchange Correlation (EG-XC), a novel non-local XC functional based on equivariant graph neural networks (GNNs). Where previous works relied on semi-local functionals or fixed-size descriptors of the density, we compress the electron density into an SO(3)-equivariant nuclei-centered point cloud for efficient non-local atomic-range interactions. By applying an equivariant GNN on this point cloud, we capture molecular-range interactions in a scalable and accurate manner. To train EG-XC, we differentiate through a self-consistent field solver requiring only energy targets. In our empirical evaluation, we find EG-XC to accurately reconstruct `gold-standard' CCSD(T) energies on MD17. On out-of-distribution conformations of 3BPA, EG-XC reduces the relative MAE by 35% to 50%. Remarkably, EG-XC excels in data efficiency and molecular size extrapolation on QM9, matching force fields trained on 5 times more and larger molecules. On identical training sets, EG-XC yields on average 51% lower MAEs.</description>

      <title>Behavior of water and aqueous LiCl solutions confined in cylindrical silica pores: A wide temperature range molecular dynamics simulation study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report here a molecular dynamics simulation study on water and aqueous LiCl solutions confined in 1.6 nm cylindrical pores of silica to investigate a dynamical cross-over, observed earlier experimentally, wherein LiCl slows down confined water at high temperatures but makes it faster at lower temperatures. The cross-over observed in the experiments is reproduced in the simulations, albeit at lower temperature. Moreover, the cross-over encompasses all aspects of dynamics including translation as well as rotation. Both addition of LiCl and confinement result in a breaking of hydrogen bond network in confined water, eliminating the need for long jumps via exchange of hydrogen bonded partner molecules. This lowers the activation energy for diffusion in the electrolyte solution compared to pure confined water and leads to the dynamical cross-over seen at lower temperatures. Our results thus provide an explanation to the experimentally observed phenomena and provide important insights on the interplay of confinement, temperature and presence of electrolytes on the dynamical behavior of nano-confined water.</description>
