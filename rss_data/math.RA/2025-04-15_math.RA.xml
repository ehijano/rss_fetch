      <title>Witt invariants of quaternionic forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe all Witt invariants of anti-hermitian forms over a quaternion algebra with its canonical involution. They are combinations of appropriately defined $\lambda$-powers, similarly to the case of quadratic forms, but the module of invariants is no longer free over those operations.</description>

      <title>On quadratic Novikov algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quadratic Novikov algebra is a Novikov algebra $(A, \circ)$ with a symmetric and nondegenerate bilinear form $B(\cdot,\cdot)$ satisfying $B(a\circ b, c)=-B(b, a\circ c+c\circ a)$ for all $a$, $b$, $c\in A$. This notion appeared in the theory of Novikov bialgebras. In this paper, we first investigate some properties of quadratic Novikov algebras and give a decomposition theorem of quadratic Novikov algebras. Then we present a classification of quadratic Novikov algebras of dimensions $2$ and $3$ over $\mathbb{C}$ up to isomorphism. Finally, a construction of quadratic Novikov algebras called double extension is presented and we show that any quadratic Novikov algebra containing a nonzero isotropic ideal can be obtained by double extensions. Based on double extension, an example of quadratic Novikov algebras of dimension 4 is given.</description>

      <title>The varieties generated by 3-hypergraph semirings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper the 3-hypergraph semigroups and 3-hypergraph semirings from 3-hypergraphs $\mathbb{H}$ are introduced and the varieties generated by them are studied. It is shown that all 3-hypergraph semirings $S_{\scriptscriptstyle \mathbb{H}}$ are nonfinitely based and subdirectly irreducible. Also, it is proved that each variety generated by 3-hypergraph semirings is equal to a variety generated by 3-uniform hypergraph semirings. It is well known that both variety $\mathbf{V}(S_c(abc))$ (see, J. Algebra 611: 211--245, 2022 and J. Algebra 623: 64--85, 2023) and variety $\mathbf{V}(S_{\scriptscriptstyle \mathbb{H}})$ play key role in the theory of variety of ai-semirings, where 3-uniform hypergraph $\mathbb{H}$ is a 3-cycle. They are shown that each variety generated by 2-robustly strong 3-colorable 3-uniform hypergraph semirings is equal to variety $\mathbf{V}(S_c(abc))$, and each variety generated by so-called beam-type hypergraph semirings or fan-type hypergraph semirings is equal to the variety $\mathbf{V}(S_{\scriptscriptstyle \mathbb{H}})$ generated by a 3-uniform 3-cycle hypergraph semiring $S_{\scriptscriptstyle \mathbb{H}}$. Finally, an infinite ascending chain is provided in the lattice of subvarieties of the variety generated by all 3-uniform hypergraph semirings. This implies that the variety generated by all 3-uniform hypergraph semirings has infinitely many subvarieties.</description>

      <title>On the existence of parameterized noetherian rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A ring $R$ is called left strictly $(&lt;\aleph_{\alpha})$-noetherian if $\aleph_{\alpha}$ is the minimum cardinal such that every ideal of $R$ is $(&lt;\aleph_{\alpha})$-generated. In this note, we show that for every singular (resp., regular) cardinal $\aleph_{\alpha}$, there is a valuation domain $D$, which is strictly $(&lt;\aleph_{\alpha})$-noetherian (resp., strictly $(&lt;\aleph_{\alpha}^+)$-noetherian), positively answering a problem proposed in \cite{Marcos25} under some set theory assumption.</description>

      <title>The trace dual of nonlinear skew cyclic codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Codes which have a finite field $\mathbb{F}_{q^m}$ as their alphabet but which are only linear over a subfield $\mathbb{F}_q$ are a topic of much recent interest due to their utility in constructing quantum error correcting codes. In this article, we find generators for trace dual spaces of different families of $\mathbb{F}_q$-linear codes over $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$. In particular, given the field extension $\mathbb{F}_q\leq \mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ with $q$ an odd prime power, we determine the trace Euclidean and trace Hermitian dual codes for the general $\mathbb{F}_q$-linear cyclic $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$-code. In addition, we also determine the trace Euclidean and trace Hermitian duals for general $\mathbb{F}_q$-linear skew cyclic $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$-codes, which are defined to be left $\mathbb{F}_q[X]$-submodules of $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}[X;\sigma]/(X^n-1)$, where $\sigma$ denotes the Frobenius automorphism and $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}[X;\sigma]$ the induced skew polynomial ring.</description>

      <title>An approach to Martsinkovsky's invariant via Auslander's approximation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Auslander developed a theory of the $\delta$-invariant for finitely generated modules over commutative Gorenstein local rings, and Martsinkovsky extended this theory to the $\xi$-invariant for finitely generated modules over general commutative noetherian local rings. In this paper, we approach Martsinkovsky$'$s $\xi$-invariant by considering a non-decreasing sequence of integers that converges to it. We investigate Auslander$'$s approximation theory and provide methods for computing this non-decreasing sequence using the approximation.</description>

      <title>Universal deformation rings of a special class of modules over generalized Brauer tree algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Bbbk$ be an algebraically closed field and $\Lambda$ a generalized Brauer tree algebra over $\Bbbk$. We compute the universal deformation rings of the periodic string modules over $\Lambda$. Moreover, for a specific class of generalized Brauer tree algebras $\Lambda(n,\overline{m})$, we classify the universal deformation rings of the modules lying in $\Omega$-stable components $\mathfrak{C}$ of the stable Auslander-Reiten quiver provided that $\mathfrak{C}$ contains at least one simple module. Our approach uses several tools and techniques from the representation theory of Brauer graph algebras. Notably, we leverage Duffield's work on the Auslander-Reiten theory of these algebras and Opper-Zvonareva's results on derived equivalences between Brauer graph algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let F be a field. We investigate the greatest possible dimension t_n(F) for a vector space of n-by-n matrices with entries in F and in which every element is triangularizable over the ground field F. It is obvious that t_n(F) is greater than or equal to n(n+1)/2, and we prove that equality holds if and only if F is not quadratically closed or n=1, excluding finite fields with characteristic 2. If F is infinite and not quadratically closed, we give an explicit description of the solutions with the critical dimension t_n(F), reducing the problem to the one of deciding for which integers k between 2 and n all k-by-k symmetric matrices over F are triangularizable.</description>

      <title>Constructing strictly sign regular matrices of all sizes and sign patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The class of strictly sign regular (SSR) matrices has been extensively studied by many authors over the past century, notably by Schoenberg, Motzkin, Gantmacher, and Krein. A classical result of Gantmacher-Krein assures the existence of SSR matrices for any dimension and sign pattern. In this article, we provide an algorithm to explicitly construct an SSR matrix of any given size and sign pattern. (We also provide in an Appendix, a Python code implementing our algorithm.) To develop this algorithm, we show that one can extend an SSR matrix by adding an extra row (column) to its border, resulting in a higher order SSR matrix. Furthermore, we show how inserting a suitable new row/column between any two successive rows/columns of an SSR matrix results in a matrix that remains SSR. We also establish analogous results for strictly sign regular $m \times n$ matrices of order $p$ for any $p \in [1, \min\{m,n\}]$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05337v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We classify all two-dimensional simple algebras (which may be non-associative) over an algebraically closed field. For each two-dimensional algebra $\mathcal{A}$, we describe a minimal (with respect to inclusion) generating set for the algebra of invariants of the $m$-tuples of $\mathcal{A}$ in the case of characteristic zero. In particular, we establish that for any two-dimensional simple algebra $\mathcal{A}$ with a non-trivial automorphism group, the Artin--Procesi--Iltyakov Equality holds for $\mathcal{A}^m$; that is, the algebra of polynomial invariants of $m$-tuples of $\mathcal{A}$ is generated by operator traces. As a consequence, we describe two-dimensional algebras that admit a symmetric or skew-symmetric invariant nondegenerate bilinear form.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies irreducible characters of the $q$-rook monoid algebra $R_n(q)$ using the vertex algebraic method. Based on the Frobenius formula for $R_n(q)$, a new iterative character formula is derived with the help of the vertex operator realization of the Schur symmetric function. The same idea also leads to a simple proof of the Murnaghan-Nakayama rule for $R_n(q)$. We also introduce the bitrace for the $q$-rook monoid and derive its combinatorial formula as a generalization of the bitrace formula for the Iwahori-Hecke algebra. The character table of $R_n(q)$ with $|\mu|=5$ is listed in the appendix.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove prime avoidance for ringoids. We also generalize McCoy's and Davis' prime avoidance theorems in the context of semiring theory. Next, we proceed to define and characterize compactly packed semirings and show that a commutative semiring is compactly packed if and only if each prime ideal is the radical of a principal ideal. Finally, we calculate the set of zero-divisors of some monoid semimodules over compactly packed semirings in terms of their prime ideals.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Indigenous semirings and show that they are examples of information algebras. We also attribute a graph to them and discuss their diameters, girths, and clique numbers. On the other hand, we prove that the Zariski topology of any Indigenous semiring is the Sierpi\'{n}ski space. Next, we investigate their algebraic properties (including ideal theory). In the last section, we characterize units and idempotent elements of formal power series over Indigenous semirings.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we explore a taxonomy of connectivity for space-like structures. It is inspired by isolating posets of connected pieces of a space and examining its embedding in the ambient space. The taxonomy includes in its scope all standard notions of connectivity in point-set and point-free contexts, such as connectivity in graphs and hypergraphs (as well as k-connectivity in graphs), connectivity and path-connectivity in topology, and connectivity of elements in a frame.</description>

      <title>Generalizing the Invertible Matrix Theorem with Linear Relations using Graphical Linear Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linear algebra's main concerns are sets of vectors, linear functions, subspaces, linear systems, matrices and concepts about those, such as whether the solution of linear system exists or is unique; a set of vectors is linearly independent or spans the whole space; a linear function has a right or a left inverse; a linear function is surjective or injective; and the kernel of a matrix is trivial or the its image is full.
  The Invertible Matrix Theorem ties all these ideas and many others together. Many modern linear algebra books use this theorem as a guiding principle to explain many connections in linear algebra. The main idea is to separately characterize whether the linear function is surjective or injective. The proof usually uses a matrix decomposition as the key step. However, the invertible matrix theorem deals with a single linear function, a single set of vectors, a single subspace, and a single matrix.
  In this work, we generalize part of the invertible matrix theorem to results about a pair of linear functions, a pair of sets of vectors, a pair of subspaces, and a single linear relation. The main idea is to separately characterize the linear relation's fundamental properties -- whether it is surjective, injective, deterministic and total. Our proof uses a decomposition of a linear relation as the key step.
  Unfortunately, reasoning with linear relations in classical notation requires applying many rules besides shuffling quantifiers and variables around, which can obscure the symmetries in the results. Therefore, this work employs graphical linear algebra, a two-dimensional diagrammatic syntax with the fundamental rules of linear relations built-in.</description>
