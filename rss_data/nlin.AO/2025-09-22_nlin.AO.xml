      <title>A Social Force Model for Companion Groups Considering Relative-Weight Attraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an improved social force model for companion group that incorporates relative weight attraction. Based on the traditional social force model, the interaction forces among individuals within leader-follower groups are described by introducing relative weight attraction. Additionally, a velocity synchronization term is integrated into the pedestrians' self-driving force to address the problem of group dispersion commonly found in traditional models. Furthermore, the desired direction of followers within the companion group is refined to adapt to the evacuation movement led by the group leader. These enhancements collectively form a Social Force Model of companion groups considering relative weight attraction. Through comparative analysis of pedestrian evacuation processes in bidirectional channel simulation experiments between the relative weight attraction model and the traditional molecular potential (force) model, this study finds that the relative weight attraction model demonstrates stronger regulation and following capabilities when simulating collisions between companion groups and pedestrians or obstacles, more effectively ensuring group cohesion. Building upon this foundation, this study further investigates the impact of varying companion ratios on evacuation efficiency within the relative-weight attraction model. The results demonstrate that evacuation time steps exhibit a non-monotonic trend (initial increase, followed by a decrease, and a subsequent rise) as the companion ratio escalates. Additionally, across multiple simulation runs, the standard deviation of evacuation time steps expands with increasing companion ratios, indicating heightened fluctuation in individual evacuation timing.</description>

      <title>Manipulating phases in many-body interacting systems with subsystem resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stabilizing thermodynamically unstable phases in many-body systems, such as suppressing pathological neuronal synchronization in Parkinson's disease or maintaining magnetic order across broad temperature ranges, remains a persistent challenge. In traditional approaches, such phases are stabilized through intervening in the dynamics of all system constituents or introducing additional interactions. Here, we offer a hitherto-unexplored alternative, namely, subsystem resetting, whereby intervention in the dynamics of only a part of the system, and that too only occasionally in time, is implemented through resetting its state to a reset configuration. Just playing with a few parameters, e.g., the nature of the reset configuration and the size of the reset subsystem, one achieves a remarkable and robust control over the phase diagram of the bare dynamics. We demonstrate that these universal effects span a wide variety of scenarios, including equilibrium and non-equilibrium, mean-field and non-mean-field dynamics, with and without quenched disorder. Despite the challenges posed by memory effects, we obtain explicit analytical predictions, validated by simulations.</description>
