      <title>Mobile Edge Intelligence for Large Language Models: A Contemporary Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On-device large language models (LLMs), referring to running LLMs on edge devices, have raised considerable interest owing to their superior privacy, reduced latency, and bandwidth saving. Nonetheless, the capabilities of on-device LLMs are intrinsically constrained by the limited capacity of edge devices compared to the much more powerful cloud centers. To bridge the gap between cloud-based and on-device AI, mobile edge intelligence (MEI) presents a viable solution to this problem by provisioning AI capabilities within the edge of mobile networks with improved privacy and latency relative to cloud computing. MEI sits between on-device AI and cloud-based AI, featuring wireless communications and more powerful computing resources than end devices. This article provides a contemporary survey on harnessing MEI for LLMs. We first cover the preliminaries of LLMs, starting with LLMs and MEI, followed by resource-efficient LLM techniques. We then illustrate several killer applications to demonstrate the need for deploying LLMs at the network edge and present an architectural overview of MEI for LLMs (MEI4LLM). Subsequently, we delve into various aspects of MEI4LLM, extensively covering edge LLM caching and delivery, edge LLM training, and edge LLM inference. Finally, we identify future research opportunities. We aim to inspire researchers in the field to leverage mobile edge computing to facilitate LLM deployment in close proximity to users, thereby unleashing the potential of LLMs across various privacy- and delay-sensitive applications.</description>

      <title>Towards a Transformer-Based Pre-trained Model for IoT Traffic Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classification of IoT traffic is important to improve the efficiency and security of IoT-based networks. As the state-of-the-art classification methods are based on Deep Learning, most of the current results require a large amount of data to be trained. Thereby, in real-life situations, where there is a scarce amount of IoT traffic data, the models would not perform so well. Consequently, these models underperform outside their initial training conditions and fail to capture the complex characteristics of network traffic, rendering them inefficient and unreliable in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose IoT Traffic Classification Transformer (ITCT), a novel approach that utilizes the state-of-the-art transformer-based model named TabTransformer. ITCT, which is pre-trained on a large labeled MQTT-based IoT traffic dataset and may be fine-tuned with a small set of labeled data, showed promising results in various traffic classification tasks. Our experiments demonstrated that the ITCT model significantly outperforms existing models, achieving an overall accuracy of 82%. To support reproducibility and collaborative development, all associated code has been made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Rina: Enhancing Ring-AllReduce with In-network Aggregation in Distributed Model Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameter Server (PS) and Ring-AllReduce (RAR) are two widely utilized synchronization architectures in multi-worker Deep Learning (DL), also referred to as Distributed Deep Learning (DDL). However, PS encounters challenges with the ``incast'' issue, while RAR struggles with problems caused by the long dependency chain. The emerging In-network Aggregation (INA) has been proposed to integrate with PS to mitigate its incast issue. However, such PS-based INA has poor incremental deployment abilities as it requires replacing all the switches to show significant performance improvement, which is not cost-effective. In this study, we present the incorporation of INA capabilities into RAR, called RAR with In-Network Aggregation (Rina), to tackle both the problems above. Rina features its agent-worker mechanism. When an INA-capable ToR switch is deployed, all workers in this rack run as one abstracted worker with the help of the agent, resulting in both excellent incremental deployment capabilities and better throughput. We conducted extensive testbed and simulation evaluations to substantiate the throughput advantages of Rina over existing DDL training synchronization structures. Compared with the state-of-the-art PS-based INA methods ATP, Rina can achieve more than 50\% throughput with the same hardware cost.</description>

      <title>Nomadic Non-Public Networks for 6G: Use Cases and Key Performance Indicators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The landscape of wireless communication systems is evolving rapidly, with a pivotal role envisioned for dynamic network structures and self-organizing networks in upcoming technologies like the 6G mobile communications standard. This evolution is fueled by the growing demand from diverse sectors, including industry, manufacturing, agriculture, and the public sector, each with increasingly specific requirements. The establishment of non-public networks in the current 5G standard has laid a foundation, enabling independent operation within certain frequencies and local limitations, notably for Internet of Things applications. This paper explores the progression from non-public networks to nomadic non-public networks and their significance in the context of the forthcoming 6G era.
  Building on existing work in dynamic network structures, non-public networks regulations, and alternative technological solutions, this paper introduces specific use cases enhanced by nomadic networks. In addition, relevant Key Performance Indicators are discussed on the basis of the presented use cases. These serve as a starting point for the definition of requirement clusters and thus for a evaluation metric of nomadic non-public networks. This work lays the groundwork for understanding the potential of nomadic non-public networks in the dynamic landscape of 6G wireless communication systems.</description>

      <title>NegotiaToR: Towards A Simple Yet Effective On-demand Reconfigurable Datacenter Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in fast optical switching technology show promise in meeting the high goodput and low latency requirements of datacenter networks (DCN). We present NegotiaToR, a simple network architecture for optical reconfigurable DCNs that utilizes on-demand scheduling to handle dynamic traffic. In NegotiaToR, racks exchange scheduling messages through an in-band control plane and distributedly calculate non-conflicting paths from binary traffic demand information. Optimized for incasts, it also provides opportunities to bypass scheduling delays. NegotiaToR is compatible with prevalent flat topologies, and is tailored towards a minimalist design for on-demand reconfigurable DCNs, enhancing practicality. Through large-scale simulations, we show that NegotiaToR achieves both small mice flow completion time (FCT) and high goodput on two representative flat topologies, especially under heavy loads. Particularly, the FCT of mice flows is one to two orders of magnitude better than the state-of-the-art traffic-oblivious reconfigurable DCN design.</description>

      <title>Performance Study of Various Relay Nodes in 5G Wireless Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies performance of various types of relay nodes in a 5G wireless network: conventional amplify-forward repeaters, (semi-)smart/smart amplify-forward repeaters with different levels of side information, and half-duplex/full-duplex decode-forward relay nodes with and without spatial reuse. End-to-end effective signal to interference and noise ratios (SINRs) and achievable rates are derived for these different types of relay nodes. Performance and complexity tradeoffs are discussed with a simulation over a Manhattan topology setting. Over-the-air (OTA) test results corroborates the findings in this paper.</description>

      <title>An Alternative to Multi-Factor Authentication with a Triple-Identity Authentication Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Every user authentication scheme involves three login credentials, i.e. a username, a password and a hash value, but only one of them is associated with a user identity. However, this identity is actually not robust enough to protect the whole system, while the login entries (i.e., the username and password forms) have not been effectively protected. Furthermore, the extra factor in a system adding multi-factor authentication is transmitted in cyberspace and operated by users. If more identities can be employed for the two login forms to associate with all login credentials, and if the corresponding identifiers are not transmitted in cyberspace and operated by users, such a system can be more robust even without relying on a third-party service. To this end, a triple-identity authentication scheme is designed within a dual-password login-authentication system, which defines identities for the username and the login password, respectively. Therefore, in addition to the traditional server verification, the system can verify the identifiers at the username and password forms in succession. In the triple-identity authentication, the identifiers are entirely managed by the system without involvement of users or a third-party service, and they are concealed, incommunicable, inaccessible and independent of personal information. Thus, they are useless in online attacks.</description>

      <title>Diffie-Hellman Picture Show: Key Exchange Stories from Commercial VoWiFi Deployments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Voice over Wi-Fi (VoWiFi) uses a series of IPsec tunnels to deliver IP-based telephony from the subscriber's phone (User Equipment, UE) into the Mobile Network Operator's (MNO) core network via an Internet-facing endpoint, the Evolved Packet Data Gateway (ePDG). IPsec tunnels are set up in phases. The first phase negotiates the cryptographic algorithm and parameters and performs a key exchange via the Internet Key Exchange protocol, while the second phase (protected by the above-established encryption) performs the authentication. An insecure key exchange would jeopardize the later stages and the data's security and confidentiality.
  In this paper, we analyze the phase 1 settings and implementations as they are found in phones as well as in commercially deployed networks worldwide. On the UE side, we identified a recent 5G baseband chipset from a major manufacturer that allows for fallback to weak, unannounced modes and verified it experimentally. On the MNO side -- among others -- we identified 13 operators (totaling an estimated 140 million subscribers) on three continents that all use the same globally static set of ten private keys, serving them at random. Those not-so-private keys allow the decryption of the shared keys of every VoWiFi user of all those operators. All these operators deployed their core network from one common manufacturer.</description>

      <title>Fast Private Location-based Information Retrieval Over the Torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Location-based services offer immense utility, but also pose significant privacy risks. In response, we propose LocPIR, a novel framework using homomorphic encryption (HE), specifically the TFHE scheme, to preserve user location privacy when retrieving data from public clouds. Our system employs TFHE's expertise in non-polynomial evaluations, crucial for comparison operations. LocPIR showcases minimal client-server interaction, reduced memory overhead, and efficient throughput. Performance tests confirm its computational speed, making it a viable solution for practical scenarios, demonstrated via application to a COVID-19 alert model. Thus, LocPIR effectively addresses privacy concerns in location-based services, enabling secure data sharing from the public cloud.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an innovative federated learning (FL) approach that utilizes Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for classification tasks. By utilizing the adaptive activation capabilities of KANs in a federated framework, we aim to improve classification capabilities while preserving privacy. The study evaluates the performance of federated KANs (F- KANs) compared to traditional Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) on classification task. The results show that the F-KANs model significantly outperforms the federated MLP model in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score and stability, and achieves better performance, paving the way for more efficient and privacy-preserving predictive analytics.</description>

      <title>Rail-only: A Low-Cost High-Performance Network for Training LLMs with Trillion Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12169v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a low-cost network architecture for training large language models (LLMs) at hyperscale. We study the optimal parallelization strategy of LLMs and propose a novel datacenter network design tailored to LLM's unique communication pattern. We show that LLM training generates sparse communication patterns in the network and, therefore, does not require any-to-any full-bisection network to complete efficiently. As a result, our design eliminates the spine layer in traditional GPU clusters. We name this design a Rail-only network and demonstrate that it achieves the same training performance while reducing the network cost by 38% to 77% and network power consumption by 37% to 75% compared to a conventional GPU datacenter. Our architecture also supports Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) models with all-to-all communication through forwarding, with only 4.1% to 5.6% completion time overhead for all-to-all traffic. We study the failure robustness of Rail-only networks and provide insights into the performance impact of different network and training parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of cloud services and their unpredictable workload demands present significant challenges in resource management. Traditional resource management approaches, primarily based on static rules and thresholds, often fail to ensure cost-effectiveness and optimal resource utilization. This research introduces a predictive model designed to forecast traffic demand, aiming to shift from a reactive to a proactive resource management approach. By integrating advanced predictive analytics with the capabilities of P4 programmable switches, this study seeks to enhance the efficiency of resource utilization and improve system robustness. The goal is to equip organizations with the agility and economic efficiency required to navigate the complexities of dynamic cloud environments effectively. This approach not only promises to refine microservice resource allocation but also supports the broader objective of fostering more resilient and efficient cloud infrastructures.</description>

      <title>Gemini: Integrating Full-fledged Sensing upon Millimeter Wave Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrating millimeter wave (mmWave)technology in both communication and sensing is promising as it enables the reuse of existing spectrum and infrastructure without draining resources. Most existing systems piggyback sensing onto conventional communication modes without fully exploiting the potential of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in mmWave radios (not full-fledged). In this paper, we design and implement a full-fledged mmWave ISAC system Gemini; it delivers raw channel states to serve a broad category of sensing applications. We first propose the mmWave self-interference cancellation approach to extract the weak reflected signals for near-field sensing purposes. Then, we develop a joint optimization scheduling framework that can be utilized in accurate radar sensing while maximizing the communication throughput. Finally, we design a united fusion sensing algorithm to offer a better sensing performance via combining monostatic and bistatic modes. We evaluate our system in extensive experiments to demonstrate Gemini's capability of simultaneously operating sensing and communication, enabling mmWave ISAC to perform better than the commercial off-the-shelf mmWave radar for 5G cellular networks.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Optimization for Fast Radio Mapping and Localization with an Autonomous Aerial Drone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores how a flying drone can autonomously navigate while constructing a narrowband radio map for signal localization. As flying drones become more ubiquitous, their wireless signals will necessitate new wireless technologies and algorithms to provide robust radio infrastructure while preserving radio spectrum usage. A potential solution for this spectrum-sharing localization challenge is to limit the bandwidth of any transmitter beacon. However, location signaling with a narrow bandwidth necessitates improving a wireless aerial system's ability to filter a noisy signal, estimate the transmitter's location, and self-pilot to improve the location estimate. By showing results through simulation, emulation, and a final drone flight experiment, this work provides an algorithm using a Gaussian process for radio signal estimation and Bayesian optimization for drone automatic guidance. This research supports advanced radio and aerial robotics applications in critical areas such as search-and-rescue, last-mile delivery, and large-scale platform digital twin development.</description>
