      <title>A Zone-Based Algorithm for Timed Parity Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper revisits timed games by building upon the semantics introduced in "The Element of Surprise in Timed Games". We introduce some modifications to this semantics for two primary reasons: firstly, we recognize instances where the original semantics appears counterintuitive in the context of controller synthesis; secondly, we present methods to develop efficient zone-based algorithms. Our algorithm successfully addresses timed parity games, and we have implemented it using UppAal's zone library. This prototype effectively demonstrates the feasibility of a zone-based algorithm for parity objectives and a rich semantics for timed interactions between the players.</description>

      <title>Homomorphism Problems in Graph Databases and Automatic Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis investigates the central role of homomorphism problems (structure-preserving maps) in two complementary domains: database querying over finite, graph-shaped data, and constraint solving over (potentially infinite) structures. Building on the well-known equivalence between conjunctive query evaluation and homomorphism existence, the first part focuses on conjunctive regular path queries, a standard extension of conjunctive queries that incorporates regular-path predicates. We study the fundamental problem of query minimization under two measures: the number of atoms (constraints) and the tree-width of the query graph. In both cases, we prove the problem to be decidable, and provide efficient algorithms for a large fragment of queries used in practice. The second part of the thesis lifts homomorphism problems to automatic structures, which are infinite structures describable by finite automata. We highlight a dichotomy, between homomorphism problems over automatic structures that are decidable in non-deterministic logarithmic space, and those that are undecidable (proving to be the more common case). In contrast to this prevalence of undecidability, we then focus on the language-theoretic properties of these structures, and show, relying on a novel algebraic language theory, that for any well-behaved logic (a pseudovariety), whether an automatic structure can be described in this logic is decidable.</description>

      <title>Verifying Graph Neural Networks with Readout is Intractable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a logical language for reasoning about quantized aggregate-combine graph neural networks with global readout (ACR-GNNs). We provide a logical characterization and use it to prove that verification tasks for quantized GNNs with readout are (co)NEXPTIME-complete. This result implies that the verification of quantized GNNs is computationally intractable, prompting substantial research efforts toward ensuring the safety of GNN-based systems. We also experimentally demonstrate that quantized ACR-GNN models are lightweight while maintaining good accuracy and generalization capabilities with respect to non-quantized models.</description>

      <title>Implication Problems over Positive Semirings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study various notions of dependency in semiring team semantics. Semiring teams are essentially database relations, where each tuple is annotated with some element from a positive semiring. We consider semiring generalizations of several dependency notions from database theory and probability theory, including functional and inclusion dependencies, marginal identity, and (probabilistic) independence. We examine axiomatizations of implication problems, which are rule-based characterizations for the logical implication and inference of new dependencies from a given set of dependencies. Semiring team semantics provides a general framework, where different implication problems can be studied simultaneously for various semirings. The choice of the semiring leads to a specific semantic interpretation of the dependencies, and hence different semirings offer a way to study different semantics (e.g., relational, bag, and probabilistic semantics) in a unified framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate the study of the complexity-theoretic properties of convex logics in team semantics. We focus on the extension of classical propositional logic with the nonemptiness atom NE, a logic known to be both convex and union closed. We show that the satisfiability problem for this logic is NP-complete, that its validity problem is coNP-complete, and that its model-checking problem is in P.</description>

      <title>Compression for Coinductive Infinitary Rewriting: A Generic Approach, with Applications to Cut-Elimination for Non-Wellfounded Proofs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infinitary rewriting, i.e. rewriting featuring possibly infinite terms and sequences of reduction, is a convenient framework for describing the dynamics of non-terminating but productive rewriting systems. In its original definition based on metric convergence of ordinal-indexed sequences of rewriting steps, a highly desirable property of an infinitary rewriting system is Compression, i.e. the fact that rewriting sequences of arbitrary ordinal length can always be 'compressed' to equivalent sequences of length at most {\omega}.
  Since then, the standard examples of infinitary rewriting systems have been given another equivalent presentation based on coinduction. In this work, we extend this presentation to the rewriting of arbitrary non-wellfounded derivations and we investigate compression in this setting. We design a generic proof of compression, relying on a characterisation factorising most of the proof and identifying the key property a compressible infinitary rewriting system should enjoy.
  As running examples, we discuss first-order rewriting and infinitary {\lambda}-calculi. For the latter, compression can in particular be seen as a justification of its coinductive presentation in the literature. As a more advanced example, we also address compression of cut-elimination sequences in the non-wellfounded proof system {\mu}MALL{\infty} for multiplicative-additive linear logics with fixed points, which is a key lemma of several cut-elimination results for similar proof systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Automated Deduction by Contradiction Separation: The Standard Extension Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated deduction seeks to enable machines to reason with mathematical precision and logical completeness. Classical resolution-based systems, such as Prover9, E, and Vampire, rely on binary inference, which inherently limits multi-clause synergy during proof search. The Contradiction Separation Extension (CSE) framework, introduced by Xu et al. (2018), overcame this theoretical limitation by extending deduction beyond binary inference. However, the original work did not specify how contradictions are algorithmically constructed and extended in practice. This paper presents the Standard Extension algorithm, the first explicit procedural realization of contradiction separation reasoning. The proposed method dynamically constructs contradictions through complementary literal extension, thereby operationalizing the CSE theory within a unified algorithm for satisfiability and unsatisfiability checking. The algorithm's soundness and completeness are formally proven, and its effectiveness is supported indirectly through the performance of CSE-based systems, including CSE, CSE-E, CSI-E, and CSI-Enig in major automated reasoning competitions (CASC) in the last few years. These results confirm that the Standard Extension mechanism constitutes a robust and practically validated foundation for dynamic, multi-clause automated deduction.</description>

      <title>Truth-Aware Decoding: A Program-Logic Approach to Factual Language Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces Truth-Aware Decoding (TAD), a verification-oriented decoding scheme that aligns neural language generation with knowledge bases. Situated in the tradition of probabilistic program semantics for sequence models, TAD augments modern instruction-tuned systems with a lattice of semantic guards that operate at decode time. Our contributions are fourfold: (i) a constraint-based semantics that renders oracle filtering as a program-logic judgment, (ii) a proof that greedy selection enjoys local likelihood dominance under sound and complete guards (Theorem 2.7), (iii) an entropy-style invariant that quantifies factual risk via knowledge-aware safe mass, and (iv) a multi-agent operational calculus with verified Lean artefacts to certify implementation behaviour. Numerical and algorithmic case studies confirm that the resulting guardrails reduce hallucinations without sacrificing throughput, yielding a pragmatic bridge between large-scale empirical models and formal verification.</description>

      <title>The Functional Machine Calculus III: Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Functional Machine Calculus (Heijltjes 2022) is a new approach to unifying the imperative and functional programming paradigms. It extends the lambda-calculus, preserving the key features of confluent reduction and typed termination, to embed computational effects, evaluation strategies, and control flow operations. The first instalment modelled sequential higher-order computation with global store, input/output, probabilities, and non-determinism, and embedded both the call-by-name and call-by-value lambda-calculus, as well as Moggi's computational metalanguage and Levy's call-by-push-value. The present paper extends the calculus from sequential to branching and looping control flow. This allows the faithful embedding of a minimal but complete imperative language, including conditionals, exception handling, and iteration, as well as constants and algebraic data types.
  The calculus is defined through a simple operational semantics, extending the (simplified) Krivine machine for the lambda-calculus with multiple operand stacks to model effects and a continuation stack to model sequential, branching, and looping computation. It features a confluent reduction relation and a system of simple types that guarantees termination of the machine and strong normalization of reduction (in the absence of iteration). These properties carry over to the embedded imperative language, providing a unified functional-imperative model of computation that supports simple types, a direct and intuitive operational semantics, and a confluent reduction semantics.</description>

      <title>Order in Partial Markov Categories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19424v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Partial Markov categories are a recent framework for categorical probability theory that provide an abstract account of partial probabilistic computation with updating semantics. In this article, we discuss two order relations on the morphisms of a partial Markov category. In particular, we prove that every partial Markov category is canonically preorder-enriched, recovering several well-known order enrichments. We also demonstrate that the existence of codiagonal maps (comparators) is closely related to order properties of partial Markov categories. Finally, we introduce a synthetic version of the Cauchy--Schwarz inequality and, from it, we prove that updating increases validity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.02444v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that certain diagrams of $\infty$-logoses are reconstructed in homotopy type theory extended with some lex, accessible modalities, which enables us to use plain homotopy type theory to reason about not only a single $\infty$-logos but also a diagram of $\infty$-logoses. This also provides a higher dimensional version of Sterling's synthetic Tait computability -- a type theory for higher dimensional logical relations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09481v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The languages of mathematical physics and modelling are endowed with a rich "grammar of dimensions" that common abstractions of programming languages fail to represent. We propose a dependently typed domain-specific language (embedded in Idris) that captures this grammar. We apply it to explain basic notions of dimensional analysis and Buckingham's Pi theorem. We hope that the language makes mathematical physics more accessible to computer scientists and functional programming more palatable to modelers and physicists.</description>

      <title>Dissecting Logical Reasoning in LLMs: A Fine-Grained Evaluation and Supervision Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Logical reasoning is a core capability for large language models (LLMs), yet existing benchmarks that rely solely on final-answer accuracy fail to capture the quality of the reasoning process. To address this, we introduce FineLogic, a fine-grained evaluation framework that assesses logical reasoning across three dimensions: overall accuracy, stepwise soundness, and representation-level probing. Leveraging this framework, we conduct a comprehensive study on how different supervision formats in fine-tuning shape reasoning abilities. We fine-tune LLMs on four supervision styles: one in natural language and three symbolic variants. We find a key trade-off: natural language supervision excels at generalization to out-of-distribution and long-chain problems, whereas symbolic supervision is superior at instilling structurally sound, atomic reasoning steps. Furthermore, our probing analysis indicates that fine-tuning primarily refines the model's step-by-step generation process, rather than improving its ability to converge on an answer early. Together, our framework and analysis provide a more rigorous lens for evaluating and improving logical reasoning in LLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/YujunZhou/FineLogic.</description>

      <title>Neuro-Symbolic Agents with Modal Logic for Autonomous Diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of intelligent agents, particularly those powered by language models (LMs), has shown the critical role in various environments that require intelligent and autonomous decision. Environments are not passive testing grounds and they represent the data required for agents to learn and exhibit very challenging conditions that require adaptive, complex and autonomous capacity to make decisions. While the paradigm of scaling models and datasets has led to remarkable emergent capabilities, we argue that scaling the structure, fidelity, and logical consistency of agent reasoning within these environments is a crucial, yet underexplored, dimension of AI research. This paper introduces a neuro-symbolic multi-agent architecture where the belief states of individual agents are formally represented as Kripke models. This foundational choice enables them to reason about known concepts of \emph{possibility} and \emph{necessity} using the formal language of modal logic. In this work, we use of immutable, domain-specific knowledge to make infere information, which is encoded as logical constraints essential for proper diagnosis. In the proposed model, we show constraints that actively guide the hypothesis generation of LMs, effectively preventing them from reaching physically or logically untenable conclusions. In a high-fidelity simulated particle accelerator environment, our system successfully diagnoses complex, cascading failures by combining the powerful semantic intuition of LMs with the rigorous, verifiable validation of modal logic and a factual world model and showcasing a viable path toward more robust, reliable, and verifiable autonomous agents.</description>
