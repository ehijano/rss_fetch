      <title>A finitely presented group with transcendental spectral radius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short note, we prove the existence of a finitely presented group with transcendental spectral radius. The proof relies on links between decidability of the Word Problem and semi-computability of the spectral radius.</description>

      <title>Generating Sets of Mathieu Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Julius Whiston calculated the maximum size of an irredundant generating set for $S_n$ and $A_n$ by examination of maximal subgroups. Using analogous considerations, we will compute upper bounds to this value for the first two Mathieu groups, $M_{11}$ and $M_{12}$. Computational results gave explicit irredundant generating sets of $M_{11}$ and $M_{12}$ of size 5 and 6, respectively. Together these give the full results that the maximum size of an irredundant generating set for $M_{11}$ is 5 and for $M_{12}$ it is 6.</description>

      <title>A characterisation of semigroups with only countably many subdirect products with $\mathbb{Z}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{Z}$ be the additive (semi)group of integers. We prove that for a finite semigroup $S$ the direct product $\mathbb{Z}\times S$ contains only countably many subdirect products (up to isomorphism) if and only if $S$ is regular. As a corollary we show that $\mathbb{Z}\times S$ has only countably many subsemigroups (up to isomorphism) if and only if $S$ is completely regular.</description>

      <title>A Combinatorial Generalisation of Rank two Complex Reflection Groups via Generators and Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex reflection groups of rank two are precisely the finite groups in the family of groups that we call virtual complex reflection groups of rank two. These groups are particular cases of $J$-groups as defined by Achar \&amp; Aubert in ['On rank 2 complex reflection groups', \emph{Comm. Algebra} \textbf{36}(6) (2008), 2092-2132]. Virtual complex reflection groups generalise both complex reflection groups of rank two and toric reflection groups, a family of groups defined and studied by Gobet in ['Toric reflection groups', \emph{Journal of the Australian Mathematical Society} \textbf{116} (2) (2024), 171-199]. We give uniform presentations by generators and relations of virtual complex reflection groups of rank two, which coincide with the presentations given by Brou\'e, Malle and Rouquier in ['Complex reflection groups, braid groups, Hecke algebras', \emph{J. reine angew. Math.} \textbf{500} (1998), 127-190.] when the groups are finite. In particular, these presentations provide uniform presentations for complex reflection groups of rank two where the generators are reflections (however the proof uses the classification of irreducible complex reflection groups). Moreover, we show that the center of virtual complex reflection groups is cyclic, generalising what happens for irreducible complex reflection groups of rank two and toric reflection groups. Finally, we classify virtual complex reflection groups up to reflection isomorphisms.</description>

      <title>Archimedean l-groups with strong unit: cozero-sets and coincidence of types of ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\bf{W}^*$ is the category of the archimedean l-groups with distinguished strong order unit and unit-preserving l-group homomorphisms. For $G \in \bf{W}^*$, we have the canonical compact space $YG$, and Yosida representation $G \leq C(YG)$, thus, for $g \in G$, the cozero-set coz(g) in $YG$. The ideals at issue in $G$ include the principal ideals and polars, $G(g)$ and $g^{\perp \perp}$, respectively, and the $\bf{W}^*$-kernels of $\bf{W}^*$-morphisms from $G$. The ``coincidences of types" include these properties of $G$: (M) Each $G(g) = g^{\perp \perp}$; (Y) Each $G(g)$ is a $\bf{W}^*$-kernel; (CR) Each $g^{\perp \perp}$ is a $\bf{W}^*$-kernel (iff each coz(g) is regular open). For each of these, we give numerous ``rephrasings", and examples, and note that (M) = (Y) $\cap$ (CR). This paper is a companion to a paper in preparation by the present authors, which includes the present thrust in contexts less restrictive and more algebraic. Here, the focus on $\bf{W}^*$ brings topology to bear, and sharpens the view.</description>

      <title>Fixers and derangements of finite permutation groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G\leqslant\mathrm{Sym}(\Omega)$ be a finite transitive permutation group with point stabiliser $H$. We say that a subgroup $K$ of $G$ is a fixer if every element of $K$ has fixed points, and we say that $K$ is large if $|K| \geqslant |H|$. There is a special interest in studying large fixers due to connections with Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado type problems. In this paper, we classify up to conjugacy the large fixers of the almost simple primitive groups with socle $\mathrm{PSL}_2(q)$, and we use this result to verify a special case of a conjecture of Spiga on permutation characters. We also present some results on large fixers of almost simple primitive groups with socle an alternating or sporadic group.</description>

      <title>Constructive Recognition of Special Linear Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new constructive recognition algorithm for finite special linear groups in their natural representation. Given a group $G$ generated by a set of $d\times d$ matrices over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$, known to be isomorphic to the special linear group $\mathrm{SL}(d,q)$, the algorithm computes a special generating set $S$ for $G$. These generators enable efficient computations with the input group, including solving the word problem. Implemented in the computer algebra system GAP, our algorithm outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms by a significant margin. A detailed complexity analysis of the algorithm will be presented in an upcoming publication.</description>

      <title>The Unique stationary boundary property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a locally compact group and $\mu$ an admissible probability measure on $G$. Let $(B,\nu)$ be the universal topological Poisson $\mu$-boundary of $(G,\mu)$ and $\Pi_s(G)$ the universal minimal strongly proximal $G$-flow. In this note we present an alternative proof to a recent result of Hartman and Kalantar. We show that the following conditions are equivalent: (i) the measure $\nu$ is the unique $\mu$-stationary measure on $B$, (ii) $(B,G) \cong (\Pi_s(G),G)$.</description>

      <title>Difference graphs of finite abelian groups with two Sylow subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The power graph and the enhanced power graph of a group $\mathbf G$ are simple graphs with vertex set $G$; two elements of $G$ are adjacent in the power graph if one of them is a power of the other, and they are adjacent in the enhanced power graph if they generate a cyclic subgroup. The difference graph of a group $\mathbf G$, denoted by $\mathcal D(\mathbf G)$, is the difference of the enhanced power graph and the power graph of group $\mathbf G$ with all the isolated vertices removed. In this paper, we prove that, if a pair of finite abelian groups of order divisible by at most two primes have isomorphic difference graphs, then they are isomorphic.</description>

      <title>Rational cross-sections, bounded generation and orders on groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.04219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide new examples of groups without rational cross-sections (also called regular normal forms), using connections with bounded generation and rational orders on groups. Specifically, our examples are extensions of infinite torsion groups, groups of Grigorchuk type, wreath products similar to $C_2\wr(C_2\wr \mathbb Z)$ and $\mathbb Z\wr F_2$, a group of permutations of $\mathbb Z$, and a finitely presented HNN extension of the first Grigorchuk group. This last group is the first example of finitely presented group with solvable word problem and without rational cross-sections. It is also not autostackable, and has no left-regular complete rewriting system.</description>

      <title>Varieties of groups and the problem on conciseness of words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A group-word $w$ is concise in a class of groups $\mathcal X$ if and only if the verbal subgroup $w(G)$ is finite whenever $w$ takes only finitely many values in a group $G\in \mathcal X$. It is a long-standing open problem whether every word is concise in residually finite groups. In this paper we observe that the conciseness of a word $w$ in residually finite groups is equivalent to that in the class of virtually pro-$p$ groups.
  This is used to show that if $q,n$ are positive integers and $w$ is a multilinear commutator word, then the words $w^q$ and $[w^q,_{n} y]$ are concise in residually finite groups. Earlier this was known only in the case where $q$ is a prime power.
  In the course of the proof we establish that certain classes of groups satisfying the law $w^q\equiv1$, or $[\delta_k^q,{}_n\, y]\equiv1$, are varieties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.10114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of $\Theta$-positivity in real simple Lie groups. This notion at the same time generalizes Lusztig's total positivity in split real Lie groups and invariant orders in Lie groups of Hermitian type. We show that there are four families of Lie groups which admit $\Theta$-positive structures, and investigate basic properties of $\Theta$-positivity.</description>

Abstract: We follow on from the pioneering paper by the second author where he introduces the Knutson Index for the character ring of a finite group. We introduce the Knutson Index for general commutative rings. We study it for Burnside rings and global representation rings. We also introduce the global table of a finite group, that encompasses both the character table and the Burnside table of marks.</description>
