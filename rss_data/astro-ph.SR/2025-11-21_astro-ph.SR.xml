      <title>Post-Supernova Accretion of Light Elements onto a New-Born Neutron Star and NS 1987A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We model early accretion of light elements, He, C, and O, onto a new-born neutron star using the public stellar evolution code MESA, simulating what may happen during the first few years of its life. We find that, under the appropriate conditions, significant amounts of these elements can be accreted up to densities of 10^9 g/cc without triggering a nuclear explosion that would convert them into heavy elements. These results help to understand observations that favor light elements in the atmospheres of young cooling neutron stars, as the one found in the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A, and also add support to the recent indications for the presence of a neutron star, NS 1987A, in the remnant of SN 1987A.</description>

      <title>Solar Filament Physiognomy: Inferring Magnetic Quantities from Imaging Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic field is the key physical quantity in solar physics as it controls all kinds of solar activity, ranging from nanoflares to big flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). However, so far only the magnetic field on the solar surface can be more or less precisely measured, and the most important coronal magnetic field remains undetectable accurately. Without the knowledge of the coronal magnetic field, it is even more difficult to obtain secondary quantities related to magnetic field, such as the magnetic helicity and magnetic configuration, including the curvature of field lines. The prevailing approaches to obtain the coronal magnetic field include coronal magnetic extrapolation and coronal seismology. Actually there were scattered efforts to derive secondary magnetic quantities based on imaging observations of solar filaments, without the help of polarization measurements. We call this approach solar filament physiognomy. In this paper, we review these efforts made in the past decades, and point out that this approach will be promising as large telescopes are being built and more fine structures of filament channels will be revealed.</description>

      <title>Formation of Extremely Low-Mass White Dwarfs in Wide Orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Helium white dwarfs (WDs) with masses less than 0.3 $\rm M_{\sun}$ are known as extremely low-mass WDs (ELM WDs), which cannot be produced by single stellar evolution in theory. Generally, these stars are believed to form through binary interactions. Recently, two ELM WDs in unusually wide orbits were reported, i.e., KIC 8145411 and HE 0430-2457. Their orbital separations are too wide to be produced by the binary evolution scenario. In this work, we study the formation of wide-orbit ELM WD binaries from hierarchical triple systems. In this scenario, an ELM WD is formed from the inner binary and subsequently forms a wide binary system with the third object. We find that the merger of an evolved star with a brown dwarf in the inner binary fails to produce single ELM WDs, but Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) explosions can successfully do so. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of the supernova explosion on the orbital distribution of the surviving binary and find that this channel may have a probability of reproducing the orbital parameters of HE 0430-2457, but fails to reproduce the observed features of KIC 8145411. This supports recent observational recalibrations suggesting that KIC 8145411 resides in a triple system rather than a binary.</description>

      <title>Type II Cepheids: Period-Luminosity-Metallicity relations for the Population II distance scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type II Cepheids are a class of pulsating variable stars that play a critical role in our understanding of stellar evolution, distance measurement and tracing the structure and kinematics of old stars in nearby galaxies. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the current state of research on Type II Cepheids, including their observed properties, pulsation mechanisms and their distinction from other variable stars. These pulsating variable stars, found primarily in older stellar populations, exhibit well-defined period-luminosity relations but with an added advantage that they exhibit weak or negligible dependence on metallicity. We explore their relevance in the context of their role as distance indicators and potential calibrators of the first rung of the extragalactic distance ladder. Finally, the review highlights recent advancements in theoretical models, observations across different wavelengths and ongoing debates concerning their classification.</description>

      <title>Fundamental effective temperature measurements for eclipsing binary stars - VII. The solar twin in LL Aquarii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The eclipsing binary LL Aqr is a bright V = 9.32, detached system consisting of two solar-type stars in an eccentric orbit (P = 20.2 d). The secondary component, LL Aqr B, was previously found to have physical and atmospheric parameters very similar to the Sun. Using high-precision photometry from TESS along with previously published orbital solutions, we obtain updated model-independent stellar radii and masses: $R_A = 1.3180 \pm 0.0013~R_{\odot}$, $R_B = 0.9927 \pm 0.0008~R_{\odot}$, $M_A = 1.1947 \pm 0.0009~M_{\odot}$, and $M_B = 1.0334 \pm 0.0006~M_{\odot}$. We derive the bolometric flux and fundamental effective temperature for each component using observed magnitudes, flux ratios from light curves in multiple bands and angular diameters derived from the radii and parallax from long baseline interferometry, measuring the following values: $T_{\rm eff,A} = 6242 \pm 50$ K, $T_{\rm eff,B} = 5839 \pm 44$ K, with an additional 9 K systematic error from the flux scale zero-point. We confirm that LL Aqr displays low stellar activity by obtaining $2\sigma$ upper limits on the mean surface magnetic field strengths of 78 G and 96 G. Our results suggest an age of 2.67 - 3.01 Gyr, which is consistent with previous studies. LL Aqr now joins an ever-growing sample of well-characterised benchmark stars that can be used to test and calibrate a wide variety of methods and techniques in stellar astrophysics.</description>

      <title>FQ Circini: An Ordinary Nova with a High-mass B1 V(n)(e) Companion Whose Decretion Disk Transfers Mass to the White Dwarf via Roche-Lobe Overflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: FQ Cir was an ordinary fast He/N classical nova, peaking at $V$=10.9. The pre-eruption and post-eruption counterpart was at $V$=14.0, making the smallest known classical nova amplitude of 3.1 mag. The nova light and the counterpart coincide to 0.034 arc-seconds, and the counterpart is a rare hot/blue emission-line star with flickering, so the identification of the quiescent nova is certain. The counterpart is a weak Be main sequence star, B1 V(n)(e). A coherent photometric period appears in all four {\it TESS} Sectors and in the AAVSO post-eruption light curve, as ellipsoidal modulation with orbital period 2.041738 days. The companion must have been spun-up to a fast rotation, and like all Be stars, a decretion disk is exuded. With the constraints of the blackbody radius and the main sequence, the companion mass is 13.0$^{+0.2}_{-0.5}$ $M_{\odot}$, with radius 6.2$\pm$0.2 $R_{\odot}$. This is the discovery of a cataclysmic variable with a high-mass companion, a new class that we call `High Mass Cataclysmic Variables'. The white dwarf mass is 1.25$\pm$0.10 $M_{\odot}$ and must have an accretion disk that supplies fuel for the nova eruption. FQ Cir represents a new mode of accretion in interacting binaries, with Roche lobe overflow from the decretion disk feeding mass into the usual accretion disk around the white dwarf, for disk-to-disk accretion. From the mass budget of the binary, the primary star must have its initial mass $&gt;$7.6 $M_{\odot}$, forming an ONe white dwarf, so FQ Cir can never become a Type Ia supernova.</description>

      <title>Searching for close-in planets around TWA 7 with SPIRou</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We outline in this paper observations of the young pre-main-sequence low-mass star TWA 7, hosting a debris disk and a distant planet. Using data collected with the near-infrared SPIRou spectropolarimeter / precision velocimeter at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope from early 2019 to mid 2021, we detected the magnetic field of TWA 7 from the circularly polarized Zeeman signatures and Zeeman broadening of atomic spectral lines, and the rotational modulation of its longitudinal component at the known stellar rotation period (of 5.012+-0.007 d). We then modeled the large-scale and small-scale magnetic properties of TWA 7 using Zeeman-Doppler imaging. We found that TWA 7 hosted a mainly poloidal field that significantly evolved from 2019 to 2021, the dipole component getting stronger (increasing from 0.5 kG in 2019 to 0.7 kG in 2021) and less inclined to the stellar rotation axis (from 22{\deg} in 2019 to 15{\deg} in 2021). We also analyzed the radial velocities of TWA 7 derived from the SPIRou data, and found a tentative planet signature at a period of 15.2 d (with aliases at 20.8 and 30.4 d), very close to the detection limit of our data and that would correspond to a 0.17 Mjup planet at a distance of 0.09 au if confirmed. We finally report modulation of the 1083 nm He I and 1282 nm Pa-beta lines of TWA 7 with a period of 6.6 d, different from the rotation period and potentially hinting at the presence of a close-in planet triggering star-planet interactions.</description>

      <title>Excitation of Inertial Modes in 3D Simulations of Rotating Convection in Planets and Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal convection in rotating stars and planets drives anisotropic turbulence and strong differential rotation, both capable of feeding energy into global oscillations. Using 3D simulations of rotating convection in spherical shells, we show that inertial modes--oscillations restored by the Coriolis force--emerge naturally in rotationally constrained turbulence, without imposing any external forcing. By varying the rotation rate at fixed thermal forcing, we find that coherent modes appear only when the convective Rossby number, the ratio of the rotation period to the convective turnover time, falls below about one-half, where rotation dominates the dynamics. These modes are mostly retrograde in the rotating frame, equatorially symmetric, and confined to mid and high latitudes, with discrete frequencies well below twice the rotation rate. At lower viscosities, or smaller Prandtl number, mode excitation becomes more efficient and a broader spectrum of inertial modes emerges. While the precise excitation mechanism remains uncertain, our results suggest that the modes are driven by shear instabilities rather than stochastic forcing by convection. We conclude that similar inertial modes are likely to exist in the interiors of giant planets and stars, though their low frequencies will make them difficult to detect.</description>

      <title>Hidden Metallic Iron in Amorphous Silicate Dust? Insights from Condensation Experiments and Mid-Infrared Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Amorphous silicate dust is a major component in the interstellar and circumstellar dust formed in the outflow of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. Although iron depletion is observed in the interstellar medium (ISM), the exact form and fraction of iron in solid remains under debate. In particular, it is unclear whether amorphous silicate dust around AGB stars contains metallic iron. We aimed to provide optical constants of amorphous silicate nanoparticles and examine the effects of metallic iron on their spectral features to better constrain the dust properties by producing amorphous silicate nanoparticles with and without metallic cores. We performed condensation experiments using an induction thermal plasma system to produce dust analogues of the CI chondritic composition in the Mg-Ca-Na-Al-Si-Fe-Ni-O and Mg-Ca-Na-Al-Si-O systems. We measured the absorbance and reflectance of the samples, observed the structure of the products, and determined the optical constants. Two types of amorphous silicate nanoparticles (10-200 nm in diameter) with nearly CI chondritic composition were produced: one contained kamacite (Fe: Ni=0.9: 0.1) cores with a diameter ratio ranging 0-0.87 (average ~0.50), and the other was iron-free homogeneous amorphous silicate. The amorphous silicates of the CI chondritic composition with various sized metallic cores may be prevalent in circumstellar and interstellar dust.</description>

      <title>Herglotz-type $f(R,T)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-conservation of the energy-momentum tensor in $f(R,T)$ gravity can be interpreted as an effective manifestation of dissipation. Motivated by this, we propose a new formulation of $f(R,T)$ gravity based on the Herglotz variational principle, which extends the usual {Hamilton} variational principle to dissipative systems by allowing the Lagrangian to depend explicitly on the action. The resulting gravitational field equations extend those of $f(R,T)$ gravity by including Herglotz contributions. In the Newtonian limit, these contributions modify the gravitational potential, allowing us to constrain the Herglotz vector through Mercury's perihelion precession and the relativistic light deflection. Remarkably, the Herglotz corrections lead to a scaling law consistent with observations from the Cassini spacecraft. Examining two representative cosmological models, the Herglotz vector effectively reduces to a single function that, under suitable conditions, can play the role of a cosmological constant, providing an alternative mechanism for the Universe's accelerated expansion. Within the Herglotz variational approach, the linear $f(R,T)=R+\alpha T$ model, previously ruled out in the standard formulation due to its fixed deceleration parameter, becomes consistent with observations.</description>

      <title>Thermal equilibrium curves of accretion disks driven by magnetorotational instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analogous to the HR diagram for stars, the thermal equilibrium curve encodes the thermodynamics of accretion disks by expressing the local balance between heating -- primarily via viscous dissipation -- and cooling -- typically through radiative transfer. These curves are commonly plotted as surface density versus effective temperature. When an S-shaped locus appears, local annuli become bistable, and limit-cycle oscillations arise when the external mass-transfer rate falls within an unstable band. This behavior underpins the disk instability model for recurring outbursts in cataclysmic variables. This paper reviews first-principles thermal equilibrium curves for accretion disks driven by magnetorotational instability (MRI), with emphasis on dwarf novae. Unlike the parameterized $\alpha$-viscosity approach, the curves are obtained by solving the governing equations with radiation magnetohydrodynamics simulations, thereby reproducing S-shaped loci without prescribing $\alpha$. The disk instability in dwarf-nova systems and the physical origin of angular-momentum transport (shear stresses) are also briefly reviewed. Notes on the stability of radiation-dominated accretion flows are included in the Appendix.</description>

      <title>Can Wolf-Rayet stars be the missing ingredient to explain high-z He II ionizing radiation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars are hot, massive stars with depleted hydrogen. At low metallicities (Z), WN3-type WR stars have relatively thin winds and are major sources of ionizing flux. The detection of high-ionization emission lines in high-redshift ($z$) galaxies as well as nearby low-Z dwarf galaxies raises questions about the origin of He II ionizing radiation and its role in galaxy evolution, as stellar population models fail to reproduce the required fluxes. Low-Z WN3 stars may provide the missing contribution but are easily hidden in integrated light. Using the Local Volume Mapper, we compare resolved optical spectra of SMC WN3 stars with integrated regions, focusing on the broad He II $\lambda4686\,\AA$ line. We find stellar emission diluted within nebular regions, becoming undetectable when integrating over areas larger than 24 pc. Nonetheless, these stars emit enough ionizing photons to explain observed He II nebular emission, being strong candidates for the He II ionizing sources in low-Z and high-$z$ galaxies.</description>

      <title>An observationally based wind model contemporaneous with the radio detections in $\tau$ Bo\"otis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent low-frequency array (LOFAR) radio signal detections bearing from the $\tau$ Bo\"otis system have been cautiously attributed to auroral emissions from the hot Jupiter $\tau$ Bo\"otis Ab. The auroral emissions are believed to be excited by interaction between the exoplanet and the winds of its host star. Since stellar winds respond to stellar surface magnetism, three-dimensional stellar wind modelling, able to account for the star's contemporaneous magnetic field geometry, can aid the interpretation of radio detections. For the first time, we present spectropolarimetric observations of $\tau$ Bo\"otis A from the same epoch as the LOFAR detections. We derive a contemporaneous large-scale magnetic map of $\tau$ Bo\"otis A, which shows a poloidally dominated field with mean strength 1.6 G. From our magnetic map, we create a three-dimensional numerical wind model and characterise the wind properties around $\tau$ Bo\"otis Ab. To compute the wind power dissipated in $\tau$ Bo\"otis Ab's magnetosphere, we apply two approaches: A) the solar system-based empirical relation called Bode's law; and B) a resolved numerical model of the planetary magnetosphere. When consistently applying best-case assumptions, we redict radio flux densities around 50 mJy and 0.68 mJy respectively. Our values are much too small to be consistent with the reported observation of $890_{-500}^{+690}$ mJy; a stellar surface magnetic field scaling $\gtrsim 10$ is required to reproduce the observed signal strength. As $\tau$ Bo\"otis A has a rapid magnetic cycle, we speculate that wind variations cased by variation in stellar magnetism may explain the lack of detections from follow-up observations. Our work emphasises the importance of contemporaneous observations of stellar magnetism and observational signatures of star-planet interaction.</description>

      <title>A Butterfly's Eye Camera for Intensity Interferometry with Cherenkov Telescopes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) have emerged as promising platforms for optical interferometry through the use of intensity interferometry. IACTs combine large segmented mirrors, photodetectors with nanosecond-scale time response capable of detecting signals from just a few photo-electrons, and array configurations with baselines of hundreds of meters. As a result, all major IACT facilities have now been upgraded to function also as optical intensity interferometers, achieving sensitivities an order of magnitude better than their predecessor, the Narrabri Stellar Intensity Interferometer. However, further improvements in sensitivity are currently limited by key IACT design constraints, namely the combination of poor optical quality and small focal ratios. Here we present three practical implementations of the "I3T concept", in which segments of the IACT primary mirror are focused onto different pixels of its camera. This approach yields several unexpected but significant advantages. Optics with larger focal ratios allow to integrate narrow-band optical filters, while lower photon fluxes enable to deploy next-generation photodetectors operating in photon-counting mode. We demonstrate that this so-called "Butterfly's Eye" configuration enhances the sensitivity of IACT-based intensity interferometers by a factor between 4 and 6. Moreover, as originally envisioned, the I3T design introduces imaging capabilities on angular scales from 2 to 40 milliarcseconds, unlocking new scientific opportunities such as direct surface imaging of nearby red giants. Besides, realistic simulations show that it can have a transformative impact on at least two key science cases: imaging the earliest stages of nova ejecta, and measuring the oblateness and circumstellar disks of fast-rotating stars.</description>

      <title>Neutron star heating vs. HST observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Passively cooling neutron stars (NSs) should reach undetectably low surface temperatures $T_s&lt;10^4$ K in less than $10^7$ yr. However, HST observations have revealed likely thermal UV emission from the Gyr-old millisecond pulsars PSR~J0437$-$4715 and PSR~J2124$-$3358, and from the $\sim10^{7-8}$ yr-old classical pulsars PSR~B0950$+$08 and PSR~J0108$-$1431, implying $T_s\sim10^5$ K and the need for heating mechanisms. We compute the thermal evolution of these NSs including rotochemical heating (RH) in the core with normal or Cooper-paired matter, vortex creep (VC) in the inner crust, and crustal heating through nuclear reactions, and compare the results with observations and with the upper limit for PSR~2144$-$3933. No single mechanism explains all sources. The high temperature of PSR~J0437$-$4715 can be reproduced by RH with a large Cooper pairing gap $\Delta_i\sim1.5$ MeV for either neutrons or protons, but this requires an unrealistically short initial period $P_0\lesssim1.8$ ms to activate the same mechanism in PSR~B0950$+$08. Conversely, the latter can be explained by RH with modified Urca reactions in normal matter or by VC with an excess angular momentum $J\sim3\times10^{43}$ erg,s, but these models underpredict PSR~J0437$-$4715. A model combining RH with a large pairing gap and VC matches both pulsars and is consistent with the upper limits for the remaining three. It further predicts that their temperatures should lie close to these limits, suggesting that deeper or broader-wavelength observations would provide a strong test of this scenario.</description>

      <title>Disc fragmentation. I. Ejection of Jupiter-mass Free Floating Planets from growing binary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past 25 years, observations have uncovered a large population of free-floating planets (FFPs), whose origins remain debated. Massive FFPs (several Jupiter masses or more) may form via gravitational collapse of molecular clouds, similar to stars. Lower-mass FFPs likely originate in planetary systems and are later ejected through dynamical interactions. We show that disc fragmentation in very young stellar binaries may be an abundant source of Jupiter-like FFPs (JFFPs), with masses above 0.3 Jupiter masses. In our model, disc fragmentation at tens to 100 au from the primary star produces gas giants, while fragmentation further out forms a more massive object that will eventually evolve into the secondary star. We present 3D simulations of massive, self-gravitating discs with embedded Jupiter-mass planets and a secondary seed ($5-50 M_J$). Chaotic migration leads to frequent planet-secondary interactions, imparting velocity kicks via gravitational slingshot that usually end in planet ejection. The ejection fraction increases steeply with the secondary-to-primary mass ratio, $q_s$, reaching 0.6 for $q_s &gt; 0.05$. Compared to Core Accretion JFFPs, disc fragmentation JFFPs: (i) form earlier, and may be more abundant in young clusters; (ii) are ejected at much lower velocities; (iii) may retain compact circum-planetary discs. To reproduce the observed abundance of JFFPs, disc fragmentation planets must be in the post-collapse configuration. They must also either form more frequently in binary systems than around single stars, or be frequently disrupted in inner disc regions, as previously suggested in certain versions of the theory.</description>

      <title>Differential rotation of solar {\alpha} sunspots and implications for stellar light curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Differential rotation is a key driver of magnetic activity and dynamo processes in the Sun and other stars, especially as the rate differs across the solar layers, but also in active regions. We aim to accurately quantify the velocity at which round {\alpha}-spots traverse the solar disk as a function of their latitude, and compare these rates to those of the quiet-Sun and other sunspot types. We then extend this work to other stars and investigate how differential rotation affects the modulation of stellar light curves by introducing a generalized stellar differential rotation law. We manually identify and track 105 {\alpha}-sunspots in the 6173 {\AA} continuum using the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). We measure the angular velocities of each spot through center-of-mass and geometric ellipse-fitting methods to derive a differential rotation law for round {\alpha}-sunspots. Results. Using over a decade of HMI data we derive a differential rotation law for {\alpha}-sunspots. When compared to previous measurements we find that {\alpha}-sunspots rotate 1.56% faster than the surrounding quiet-Sun, but 1.35% slower than the average sunspot population. This supports the hypothesis that the depth at which flux tubes are anchored influences sunspot motions across the solar disk. We extend this analysis to other stars by introducing a scaling law based on the rotation rates of these stars. This scaling law is implemented into the Stellar Activity Grid for Exoplanets (SAGE) code to illustrate how differential rotation alters the photometric modulation of active stars. Our findings emphasize the necessity of considering differential rotation effects when modeling stellar activity and exoplanet transit signatures</description>

      <title>Characterizing Vortex-Driven Dynamics in the Solar Atmosphere Using Information Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solar vortex regions show enhanced Poynting flux and favourable heating conditions, but how the vortices reorganize and influence their surroundings remains unclear. Here we apply information-theoretic diagnostics to a Bifrost simulation to quantify the dynamics of a long-lived vortex. By combining Shannon Entropy and Normalized Mutual Information, we track how the vortex reshapes plasma-magnetic couplings and modifies local thermodynamics. The vortex originates in the upper photosphere and extends into the chromosphere, where it suppresses the background p-mode-like organisation seen in the neighbouring magnetic flux tube. Shannon Entropy analysis shows that magnetic complexity rises sharply as the vortex develops, which is consistent with the build-up of currents and stored energy. At the same time, temperature becomes more strongly linked to magnetic shear, pointing to heating associated with current dissipation. The way temperature responds to different heating processes also changes with height: in the photosphere and lower chromosphere, it follows local compressional and expansion motions, while in the upper atmosphere, it is influenced mainly by viscous and current-driven effects. During this phase, the usual temperature-density relationship weakens, indicating that the plasma departs from purely adiabatic behaviour. Applying the same diagnostics to a nearby non-vortical flux tube yields only weak, uniform couplings, which confirms that the enhanced links are vortex-driven. Together, these results demonstrate that a coherent solar vortex not only drives heating but also reconfigures the local atmosphere, replacing periodic pressure-driven behaviour with magnetically dominated dynamics.</description>

      <title>Assessing the star formation history of all-sky and part-sky 100pc white dwarf samples</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thanks to Gaia and large-scale spectroscopic follow-up surveys (4MOST, DESI, WEAVE, SDSS-V), it is now possible to build representative and minimally biased samples of the local white dwarf population. Here we analyse several volume-limited 100pc samples of white dwarfs, constructed from different surveys and studies, to evaluate their completeness and residual biases. We model the underlying star formation history and Galactic disc age via comparison with simulated populations of white dwarfs to quantitatively characterise completeness. We assess whether the benefit of Gaia XP spectra in datasets outweighs the reduction in sample size, and to what extent targeted, part-sky, and magnitude limited surveys can be used in comparison to all-sky volume limited surveys. Additionally, we simulate the 4MOST 100PC sub-survey and discuss its use to better understand the local star formation history.</description>

      <title>Type Iax supernovae as a source of iron-rich silicate dust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We model the formation of dust in the ejecta of Type Iax supernovae (SNe), which is a low-luminosity subclass of Type Ia SNe. A non-equilibrium chemical kinetic approach is adopted to trace the synthesis of molecules, molecular clusters, and dust grains in the ejecta of thermonuclear SNe. We find that Type Iax SNe provide conditions conducive to the formation of several O-rich dust species in the ejecta. Particularly, iron-rich silicates of chemical type FeSiO3, Fe2SiO4, and MgFeSiO4 are found to form in abundance, suggesting that the ejecta of low-luminosity thermonuclear SNe can be a site where a large fraction of iron is locked up in dust, unlike other stellar sources. The final mass of dust formed in the ejecta ranges between 10^{-5} and 10^{-4} Msun, where most of the dust forms between 1000 and 2000 days post-explosion. Apart from Fe-rich silicates, Mg-silicates, and silicon carbide are also formed in the ejecta of Type Iax SNe. When compared to the dust budget of typical Type Ia SNe, we find that the expected dust-to-ejecta mass ratio is one or two orders of magnitude larger in Type Iax SNe. We conclude that the ejecta of typical Type Ia SNe form a negligible amount of dust, in agreement with observation, while the low-luminosity subclass Type Iax SNe are potential producers of iron-rich silicates.</description>

      <title>Partial tidal disruption of White Dwarfs in off-equatorial orbits around Kerr black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12727v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the results of a suite of numerical simulations using smoothed particle hydrodynamics to study partial tidal disruption events (TDEs) of white dwarfs (WDs) in off-equatorial orbits in intermediate mass spinning (Kerr) black hole backgrounds. We carry out this analysis for both parabolic and eccentric WD orbits and also take into account possible initial WD spins. Our objective here is to quantify the differences in variables like the mass of the self-bound core, the peak fallback rate of debris and gravitational wave signature in off-equatorial orbits compared to equatorial ones. The analysis is carried out using a hybrid numerical scheme, one which involves integrating the exact Kerr geodesics while adopting a Newtonian formalism for the stellar fluid dynamics, justified by our choice of simulation parameters. We find that the physics of TDEs in off-equatorial orbits present several interesting and novel features due to black hole spin, which in some cases enhances when coupled with the rotation of the WD. However, numerical values of observable quantities in TDEs involving off-equatorial orbits cannot possibly distinguish between such orbits from equatorial ones. We further comment on the genericness of our results and argue that these should extend to a general TDE scenario involving a spinning BH.</description>

      <title>Converging on the Cepheid Metallicity Dependence: Implications of Non-Standard Gaia Parallax Recalibration on Distance Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By comparing Cepheid brightnesses with geometric distance measures including Gaia EDR3 parallaxes, most recent analyses conclude metal-rich Cepheids are brighter, quantified as $\gamma \sim -0.2$ mag/dex. While the value of $\gamma$ has little impact on the determination of the Hubble constant in contemporary distance ladders (due to the similarity of metallicity across these ladders), $\gamma$ plays a role in gauging the distances to metal-poor dwarf galaxies like the Magellanic Clouds and is of considerable interest in testing stellar models. Recently, Madore &amp; Freedman (2025, hereafter MF25) recalibrated Gaia EDR3 parallaxes by adding to them a magnitude offset to match certain historic Cepheid parallaxes which otherwise differ by $\sim1.6\sigma$. A calibration which adjusts Gaia parallaxes by applying a magnitude offset (i.e., a multiplicative correction in parallax) differs significantly from the Gaia Team's calibration (Lindegren et al. 2021), which is additive in parallax space - especially at distances much closer than 1 kpc or beyond 10 kpc, outside the $\sim$2-3 kpc range on which the MF25 calibration was based. The MF25 approach reduces $\gamma$ to zero. If extrapolated, it places nearby cluster distances like the Pleiades too close compared to independent measurements, while leaving distant quasars with negative parallaxes. We conclude that the MF25 proposal for Gaia calibration and $\gamma \sim 0$ produces farther-reaching consequences, many of which are strongly disfavored by the data.</description>
