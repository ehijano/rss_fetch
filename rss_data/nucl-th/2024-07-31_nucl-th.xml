      <title>From Complexity to Clarity: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks in Nuclear Binding Energy Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the application of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) in predicting nuclear binding energies, leveraging their ability to decompose complex multi-parameter systems into simpler univariate functions. By utilizing data from the Atomic Mass Evaluation (AME2020) and incorporating features such as atomic number, neutron number, and shell effects, KANs demonstrated significant predictive accuracy, surpassing traditional models. The symbolic regression analysis yielded simplified analytical expressions for binding energies, aligning with classical models like the liquid drop model and the Bethe-Weizs\"acker formula. These results highlight KANs' potential in enhancing the interpretability and understanding of nuclear phenomena, paving the way for future applications in nuclear physics and beyond.</description>

      <title>Spin response of neutron matter in ab initio approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a general method embedded in the ab initio nuclear framework to reconstruct linear response functions and calculate sum rules. Within our approach, based on the Gaussian integral transform, we consistently treat the groundstate and the excited spectrum. Crucially, the method allows for a robust uncertainty estimation of the spectral reconstruction. We showcase it for the spin response in neutron matter. Our calculations are performed using state-of-the-art many-body coupled-cluster method and Hamiltonians derived in the chiral effective field theory, emphasizing the analysis of finite-size effects. This work serves as a stepping stone towards further studies of neutrino interactions in astrophysical environments from first principles.</description>

      <title>The Proton Charge Radius from Dimuon Photoproduction off the Proton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the feasibility of measuring the proton charge radius through dimuon photoproduction off a proton target. Our findings indicate that the Bethe-Heitler mechanism, which dominates at small momentum transfers, allows for an extraction of the proton electromagnetic form factors in the extremely low $Q^2$ region below $10^{-3}$ GeV$^2$ in the spacelike region, when the incident photon beam energy exceeds several hundred MeV. The optimal kinematical region and a sensitivity study of the proton charge radius from dimuon photoproduction are presented. Such a measurement is expected to provide an alternative to the elastic muon-proton scattering measurements such as MUSE at PSI and AMBER at CERN.</description>

      <title>System size dependence of energy loss and correlations of heavy mesons at LHC energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the system size dependence of heavy quark (HQ) observables at a center of mass energy of $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV to explore whether it can provide further constraints on the physical processes which are involved: energy loss of HQs in the quark gluon plasma (QGP), hadronization and hadronic rescattering. We use the EPOS4HQ approach to study p-p and 0-10\% central O-O, Ar-Ar, Kr-Kr and Pb-Pb reactions and investigate in detail the momentum change of heavy quarks from creation until their detection as part of a hadron as well as the enhancement of heavy baryon production at low $p_T$. We investigate furthermore the origin and the system size dependence of the azimuthal correlations between the heavy quark $Q$ and the heavy antiquark $\bar Q$ and how one can bypass the problem that correlations are washed out due to the combinatorial background. We conclude that a systematic study of the system size dependence of the momentum loss allows to separate the momentum loss due to the passage through the QGP from the momentum change due to hadronization and the $Q\bar Q$ correlations allow to gain inside into the different pQCD processes in which the heavy quarks are created.</description>

      <title>Neutrinoless double-beta decay in a finite volume from relativistic effective field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The neutrinoless double-beta decay process $nn\rightarrow ppee$ within the light Majorana-exchange scenario is studied using the relativistic pionless effective field theory (EFT) in finite-volume cubic boxes with the periodic boundary conditions. Using the low-energy two-nucleon scattering observables from lattice QCD available at $m_\pi=300$, 450, 510, and 806 MeV, the leading-order $nn\rightarrow ppee$ transition matrix elements are predicted with a precision of 10\%-20\% and their volume dependence is investigated. This is possible thanks to the fact that the leading-order $nn\rightarrow ppee$ transition matrix elements can be properly renormalized in the relativistic pionless EFT without the uncertain $nn\rightarrow pp ee$ contact term, in contrast to the nonrelativistic case. The predictions for the $nn\rightarrow ppee$ transition matrix elements can be directly matched to the LQCD calculations of the $nn\rightarrow ppee$ process at the same pion masses. Therefore, the present results are expected to play a crucial role in the benchmark between the nuclear EFTs and the upcoming LQCD calculations of the $nn\rightarrow pp ee$ process, which would provide a nontrivial test on the predictive power of nuclear EFTs on neutrinoless double-beta decay.</description>

      <title>Most general neutron decay correlations: Standard Model recoil and radiative corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To continue from our previous work Phys.Rev.D 109(2024),073007, we derive the full Standard Model prediction of the most general free neutron differential decay rate with all massive particles (neutron, proton and electron) polarized, including the $\mathcal{O}(1/m_N)$ recoil corrections and $\mathcal{O}(\alpha/\pi)$ radiative corrections. For the latter we adopt the newly-developed pseudo-neutrino formalism which is compatible to realistic experimental setups, in which neutrinos and photons are not detected. We also provide readily-executable Mathematica notebooks to evaluate these corrections.</description>

      <title>BBN catalysis by doubly charged particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06019v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider primordial nucleosynthesis in the presence of hypothetical quasi-stable doubly charged particles. Existence of $X^{--}$ with macroscopic lifetimes will lead to the formation of its bound states with $^4$He and other light elements, significantly facilitating the subsequent formation of lithium nuclei. From observational constraints on maximum allowable amount of lithium, that we update in this work, we derive strong constraints on the abundance and lifetime of $X^{--}$. In a likely cosmological freeze-out scenario with temperatures initially exceeding the mass of $X^{--}$, the BBN constrains the lifetime of these particles to be less than about 100 seconds. For parametrically long lifetimes, lithium abundance data constrain $X^{--}$ abundance to be less than $10^{-9}$ relative to protons, regardless of whether these particles decay or remain stable. Stable particles could saturate the dark matter density only if their mass is comparable to or in excess of $10^{10}$ GeV, and most of $X^{--}$ will be found in bound states with beryllium nuclei, so that chemically they would appear as abnormally heavy helium isotopes.</description>
