      <title>Dichotomy for the Hausdorff dimension of nonergodic directions on translation surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the ergodic properties of the translation surface $X_{\lambda,\mu}$ formed by gluing two flat tori along a slit with holonomy $(\lambda,\mu) \in \mathbb{R}^2$. Extending the dichotomy result of Cheung, Hubert, and Masur for the case $\mu = 0$, we prove the following: for slits not parallel to any absolute homology class, the Hausdorff dimension of the set of nonergodic directions is either $0$ or $\frac{1}{2}$. This dichotomy is completely characterized by the P\'erez-Marco condition expressed in terms of best approximation denominators. As a corollary, we obtain that the P\'erez-Marco condition for best approximation denominators is norm-independent.</description>

      <title>Integrability of Kepler Billiards at Zero-Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that if a Kepler billiard in the plane defined inside a smooth closed connected simple curve intersecting all focused parabola at at most two points is integrable at its zero-energy, then the system is defined actually inside an ellipse with the Kepler center occupying one of the foci. This statement is obtained as a simple ``translation'' of the theorem of Bialy-Mironov 2022 with Levi-Civita transformation.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic consensus with transmission and reaction delay: an overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to provide a systematic overview of results on asymptotic consensus for the Hegselmann-Krause-type model with delay and discuss the corresponding analytical tools. We explain that two types (sources) of delay - transmission and reaction - are justifiable from the modeling point of view. We consider both classical and normalized communication weights. Studying a toy model with two agents only, we develop an intuitive insight into what type of dynamics we can expect from the systems. In particular, we stress that with transmission-type delay, asymptotic consensus can be reached with any length of the delay (i.e., without smallness assumptions). In contrast, the systems with reaction-type delay can only reach asymptotic consensus if the delay is sufficiently small.
  We formulate four theorems that establish asymptotic consensus in the following scenarios: (1) transmission-type delay with classical communication weights, (2) transmission-type delay with normalized communication weights, (3) reaction-type delay with symmetric communication weights, (4) reaction-type delay with non-symmetric communication weights.
  We explain how the methods of proof depend on the particular scenario: direct estimates for (1), convexity arguments for (2), Lyapunov functional for (3) and generalized Gronwall-Halanay inequality for (4).</description>

      <title>Moment stability and large deviations for random dynamical systems on non-compact manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rate function for large deviations of the finite time Lyapunov exponent for the derived process in TM corresponding to a stochastic differential equation in M is related, via the Gartner-Ellis theorem, to the p-th moment Lyapunov exponent. When M is compact there is a characterization of the p-th moment Lyapunov exponent in terms of an eigenvalue problem for an associated differential operator acting on functions on the unit sphere bundle SM. For the non-compact case, we formulate growth conditions which, together with standard assumptions of hypoellipticity and positivity, ensure that the eigenvalue characterization remains valid so long as the corresponding eigenfunction is restricted to be in a suitable function space. There is a central limit theorem for finite time Lyapunov exponent, and there are moderate deviation estimates for the finite time Lyapunov exponent, both involving the second derivative of the moment exponent function at 0.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Enveloping Semigroup of Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we relate the dynamics of a flow $(X, T)$ with the dynamics of the induced flow $(E(X), T)$ where $E(X)$ is the enveloping semigroup of flow $(X, T)$. We establish that a flow $(X, T)$ is distal if and only if the induced flow is also distal. We prove that while the induced flow on the enveloping semigroup of an equicontinuous flow is equicontinuous, the converse holds when $(X, T)$ is point transitive. We prove that for any flow $(X,T)$, $(E(X),T)$ is isomorphic to $(E(E(X)),T)$. We show that if a distal flow contains a minimal sensitive subsystem, the induced flow on the enveloping semigroup is also sensitive. We relate various forms of rigidity for a flow with rigidity for the induced flow. We also establish that for any proximal flow $(X, T)$, if T is abelian then the induced flow $(E(X),T)$ is also proximal.</description>

      <title>A note on the boundary dynamics of holomorphic iterated function systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the boundary dynamics of iterated function systems of holomorphic self-maps of the unit disc. Our main result provides a sufficient condition which guarantees that the dynamical behaviour of a left iterated function system in the interior of the unit disc can be extended to the boundary. This generalises an extension of the classical Denjoy--Wolff Theorem, due to Bourdon, Matache and Shapiro, to the setting of iterated function systems. To do so we modify estimates for the Hardy norm of composition operators and combine them with a new technique of perturbing a left iterated function system by elliptic M\"obius transformations.</description>

      <title>Collapsing in polygonal dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polygonal dynamics is a family of dynamical systems containing many studied systems, like the famous pentagram map. Similar collapsing phenomena seem to occur in most of these systems. We give a unifying, general definition of polygonal dynamics, and conjecture that a generic orbit collapses towards a predictable point. For the special case of ``closed polygons'', we show that the collapse point depends algebraicly on the vertices of the starting polygon, using tools called scaling symmetry and infinitesimal monodromy. This holds regardless of the validity of the conjecture. As a corollary, this generalises previous results about the pentagram map. Then, we investigate the case of polygonal dynamics in $\mathbb{P}^1$ for which we give an explicit polynomial equation satisfied by the collapse point. Based on previous works, we define a new dynamical system, the ``staircase'' cross-ratio dynamics, for which we study particular configurations.</description>

      <title>Exactness, Cohomology, and Uniqueness in First-Order Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between the solvability of first-order differential equations and the topology of the underlying domain through the lens of de\,Rham cohomology. We analyze the conditions under which a closed 1-form associated with a first-order ODE admits a global potential, thereby reducing the problem to the exactness of differential forms. While it is well known that exactness is guaranteed on simply connected domains, we show that triviality of the first de\,Rham cohomology group is the more fundamental requirement for global integrability and uniqueness of solutions. In particular, we demonstrate that certain non-simply connected manifolds, such as the real projective plane $\mathbb{RP}^2$, still support global solutions due to the vanishing of $H^1_{\text{dR}}$. By explicitly constructing examples on $\mathbb{RP}^2$ and comparing them with domains like $\mathbb{R}^2 \setminus \{0\}$, we illustrate how topological obstructions manifest analytically as non-uniqueness or multi-valued behavior. We further discuss the correspondence between integrating factors and the trivialization of cohomology classes, drawing connections to classical symmetry methods and potential theory. This synthesis of geometric, topological, and analytic perspectives provides a unifying framework for understanding the global behavior of first-order ODEs beyond local existence theorems.</description>

      <title>Extremal Lyapunov exponents in random dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we consider finitely many maps, all of which are defined on a smooth compact measure space, with at least one map in the collection having degree strictly bigger than 1. Working with random dynamics generated by this setting, we obtain an expression for the extremal Lyapunov exponents, that characterise the instability of typical orbits, as the limit of the averages of the logarithm of the operator norm of linear cocycles of generic orbits. We obtain this as a consequence to the Kingman's ergodic theorem for a subadditive sequence of measurable functions, which naturally generalises the Birkhoff's ergodic theorem.</description>

      <title>From heteroclinic loops to homoclinic snaking in reversible systems: rigorous forcing through computer-assisted proofs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Homoclinic snaking is a widespread phenomenon observed in many pattern-forming systems. Demonstrating its occurrence in non-perturbative regimes has proven difficult, although a forcing theory has been developed based on the identification of patterned front solutions. These heteroclinic solutions are themselves challenging to analyze due to the nonlinear nature of the problem. In this paper, we use computer-assisted proofs to find parameterized loops of heteroclinic connections between equilibria and periodic orbits in time reversible systems. This leads to a proof of homoclinic snaking in both the Swift-Hohenberg and Gray-Scott problems. Our results demonstrate that computer-assisted proofs of continuous families of connecting orbits in nonlinear dynamical systems are a powerful tool for understanding global dynamics and their dependence on parameters.</description>

Abstract: This article addresses control problems for semilinear impulsive neutral integro-differential equations with memory in a Banach space. It investigates the approximate controllability of linear and semilinear systems and proves the establishment of mild solutions in the semilinear setting. The approach involves constructing a resolvent family for the corresponding integro-differential equation of linear type without memory. The results for the linear system are established first, then extended to the semilinear scenario, followed by a detailed example to illustrate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Homoclinic snaking of contact defects in reaction-diffusion equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply spatial dynamical-systems techniques to prove that certain spatiotemporal patterns in reversible reaction-diffusion equations undergo snaking bifurcations. That is, in a narrow region of parameter space, countably many branches of patterned states coexist that connect at towers of saddle-node bifurcations. Our patterns of interest are contact defects, which are 1-dimensional time-periodic patterns with a spatially oscillating core region that at large distances from the origin in space resemble pure temporally oscillatory states and arise as natural analogues of spiral and target waves in one spatial dimension. We show that these solutions lie on snaking branches that have a more complex structure than has been seen in other contexts. In particular, we predict the existence of families of asymmetric travelling defect solutions with arbitrary background phase offsets, in addition to symmetric standing target and spiral patterns. We prove the presence of these additional patterns by reconciling results in classic ODE studies with results from the spatial-dynamics study of patterns in PDEs and using geometrical information contained in the stable and unstable manifolds of the background wavetrains and their natural equivariance structure.</description>

      <title>Subharmonic entrainment and limit cycle modulation by high frequency excitation: A Renormalization group approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.08091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.08091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we explore the possibility of a sub-harmonic $(1{:}2)$ entrainment and supercritical Hopf bifurcation in a van der Pol-Duffing oscillator that has been excited by two frequencies, comprising a slow parametric drive and a fast external forcing, through the variation of the amplitude of the external fast signal. We also deduce the condition for the threshold parametric strength required to generate sub-harmonic oscillation. The Blekhman perturbation (direct partition of motion) and the Renormalization group technique have been employed to study how the signal amplitude plays a pivotal role in modulating the limit cycle dynamics as well as the subharmonic generation. Studies of nonlinear responses and bifurcations of such driven nonlinear systems are usually done by treating the strength of the fast drive as the control parameter. Here we show that, beyond its role in allowing one to study the dynamics with the slow and fast components nicely separated, the amplitude of the high-frequency signal can also be treated as an independent control parameter for controlling both the limit cycle behavior and the onset of subharmonic oscillation in the oscillator. Our analytical estimations are well supported by numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a measure equivalence coupling between two finitely generated groups, Delabie, Koivisto, Le Ma\^itre and Tessera have found explicit upper bounds on how integrable the associated cocycles can be. These bounds are optimal in many cases but the integrability of the cocycles with respect to these critical thresholds remained unclear. For instance, a cocycle from $\mathbb{Z}^{k+\ell}$ to $\mathbb{Z}^{k}$ can be $\mathrm{L}^p$ for all $p&lt;\frac{k}{k+\ell}$ but not for $p&gt;\frac{k}{k+\ell}$, and the case $p=\frac{k}{k+\ell}$ was an open question which we answer by the negative. Our main result actually yields much more examples where the integrability threshold given by Delabie-Koivisto-Le Ma\^itre-Tessera Theorems cannot be reached.</description>

      <title>Making rare events typical in $d$-dimensional chaotic maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the deterministic nature of chaotic systems, fluctuations in their trajectories arise solely from the choice of initial conditions. Some of these dynamical fluctuations may lead to extremely unlikely scenarios. Understanding the impact of such rare events and the trajectories that give rise to them is of significant interest across disciplines. Yet, identifying the initial conditions responsible for those events is a challenging task due to the inherent sensitivity to small perturbations of chaotic dynamics. In a recent paper [Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 227201 (2023)], this challenge was addressed by finding the effective dynamics that make rare events typical for one-dimensional chaotic maps. Here we extend such large-deviation framework to $d$-dimensional chaotic maps. Specifically, for any such map, we propose a method to find an effective topologically-conjugate map which reproduces the rare-event statistics in the long-time limit. We demonstrate the applicability of this result using several observables of paradigmatic examples of two-dimensional chaos, namely the two-dimensional tent map and Arnold's cat map.</description>
