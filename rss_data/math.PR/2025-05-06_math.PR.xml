      <title>A non-asymptotic approach to stochastic differential games with many players under semi-monotonicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider stochastic differential games with a large number of players, with the aim of quantifying the gap between closed-loop, open-loop and distributed equilibria. We show that, under two different semi-monotonicity conditions, the equilibrium trajectories are close when the interactions between the players are weak. Our approach is non-asymptotic in nature, in the sense that it does not make use of any a priori identification of a limiting model, like in mean field game (MFG) theory. The main technical step is to derive bounds on solutions to systems of PDE/FBSDE characterizing the equilibria that are independent of the number of players. When specialized to the mean field setting, our estimates yield quantitative convergence results for both open-loop and closed-loop equilibria without any use of the master equation. In fact, our main bounds hold for games in which interactions are much sparser than those of MFGs, and so we can also obtain some "universality" results for MFGs, in which we show that games governed by dense enough networks converge to the usual MFG limit. Finally, we use our estimates to study a joint vanishing viscosity and large population limit in the setting of displacement monotone games without idiosyncratic noise.</description>

      <title>Some developments of exchangeable measure-valued P\'{o}lya sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measure-valued P\'{o}lya sequences (MVPS) are stochastic processes whose dynamics are governed by generalized P\'{o}lya urn schemes with infinitely many colors. Assuming a general reinforcement rule, exchangeable MVPSs can be viewed as extensions of Blackwell and MacQueen's P\'{o}lya sequence, which characterizes an exchangeable sequence whose directing random measure has a Dirichlet process prior distribution. Here, we show that the prior distribution of any exchangeable MVPS is a Dirichlet process mixture with respect to a latent parameter that is associated with the atoms of an emergent conditioning $\sigma$-algebra. As the mixing components have disjoint supports, the directing random measure can be interpreted as a random histogram whose bins are located on these same atoms. Furthermore, we extend the basic exchangeable MVPS to include a null component in the reinforcement, which corresponds to having a fixed part in the directing random measure. Finally, we provide set-wise rates of convergence of the empirical and predictive distributions of any exchangeable MVPS to its directing random measure in the form of a central limit theorem.</description>

      <title>A note on the asymptotic uniformity of Markov chains with random rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stationary distribution of a continuous-time Markov chain is generally a complicated function of its transition rates. However, we show that if the transition rates are i.i.d. random variables with a common distribution satisfying certain tail conditions, then the resulting stationary distribution is close in total variation distance to the distribution that is proportional to the inverse of the exit rates of the states. This result, which generalizes and makes a precise prediction of Chvykov et al. (2021), constitutes the first rigorous validation of an emerging physical theory of order in non-equilibrium systems. The proof entails showing that the stationary distribution of the corresponding "jump chain," i.e., the discrete-time Markov chain with transition probabilities given by the normalized transition rates, is asymptotically uniform as the number of states grows, which settles a question raised by Bordenave, Caputo, and Chafa\"i (2012) under certain assumptions.</description>

      <title>Stochastic motions of the two-dimensional many-body delta-Bose gas, I: One-$\delta$ motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is the first in a series devoted to constructing stochastic motions for the two-dimensional $N$-body delta-Bose gas for all integers $N\geq 3$ and establishing the associated Feynman-Kac-type formulas; see [11,12,13] for the remaining of the series. The main results of this paper establish the foundation by studying the stochastic one-$\delta$ motions, which relate to the two-dimensional many-body delta-Bose gas by turning off all but one delta function, and we prove the central distributional properties and the SDEs. The proofs extend the method in [10] for the stochastic relative motions and develop and use analytical formulas of the probability distributions of the stochastic one-$\delta$ motions.</description>

      <title>Stochastic motions of the two-dimensional many-body delta-Bose gas, II: Many-$\delta$ motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is the second in a series devoted to constructing stochastic motions for the two-dimensional $N$-body delta-Bose gas for all integers $N\geq 3$ and establishing the associated Feynman-Kac-type formulas. The main results here construct and study the more general stochastic many-$\delta$ motions for $N$ particles. They have the interpretation of independent two-dimensional Brownian motions conditioned to attain the contact interactions that realize multiple two-body $\delta$-function potentials. For the construction, we transform the stochastic one-$\delta$ motions studied in [7] by Girsanov's theorem locally before a pair of particles with different initial conditions begins to contact each other. The strong Markov processes with lifetime thus obtained are concatenated by using the "no-triple-contacts" (NTC). This NTC phenomenon appears in the functional integral solutions of the two-dimensional many-body delta-Bose gas obtained earlier and is now proven at the pathwise level to a generalized degree.</description>

      <title>Finite Free Convolution: Infinitesimal Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Additive and multiplicative finite free convolutions are operations on the set of polynomials with real roots, whose empirical distributions are known to approximate free additive and multiplicative convolutions, as the degree $d$ converges to infinity. In this paper, we study these approximations in finer detail, focusing on corrections (or fluctuations) up to order $1/d$, namely their infinitesimal distribution. By studying how the infinitesimal behavior of the moments relates to the infinitesimal behavior of the cumulants we are able to determine how the infinitesimal distributions changes under the additive and multiplicative finite free convolutions. It is worth mentioning that these operations do not correspond to the infinitesimal free additive and multiplicative convolutions that has been studied before, but in the additive case we provide an explicit connection using subordination functions. We give several examples and applications, including an explicit formula to compute the effect of repeated differentiation on the infinitesimal distribution.</description>

      <title>Martingale Solutions of Stochastic Constrained Modified Swift-Hohenberg Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to prove the existence of global Martingale solution to Stochastic Constrained Modified Swift-Hohenberg Equation driven by stratonovich multiplicative noise. This equation belongs to class of amplitude equations which describe the appearance of pattern formation in nature. This structure allows us to work in a Hilbert space framework and to apply a stochastic Galerkin method. The existence proof is based on energy-type estimates, the tightness criterion of Brzezniak and collaborators, and Jakubowski's generalization of the Skorokhod theorem.</description>

      <title>Stochastic dominance for linear combinations of infinite-mean risks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a sufficient condition to compare linear combinations of independent and identically distributed (iid) infinite-mean random variables under usual stochastic order. We introduce a new class of distributions that includes many commonly used heavy-tailed distributions and show that within this class, a linear combination of random variables is stochastically larger when its weight vector is smaller in the sense of majorization order. We proceed to study the case where each random variable is a compound Poisson sum and demonstrate that if the stochastic dominance relation holds, the summand of the compound Poisson sum belongs to our new class of distributions. Additional discussions are presented for stable distributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a one-parameter family of infinite line ensembles on $[0, \infty)$ that are natural half-space analogues of the Airy line ensemble. Away from the origin these ensembles are locally described by avoiding Brownian bridges, and near the origin they are described by a sequence of avoiding reverse Brownian motions with alternating drifts, that depend on the parameter of the model. In addition, the restrictions of our ensembles to finitely many vertical lines form Pfaffian point processes with the crossover kernels obtained by Baik-Barraquand-Corwin-Suidan (Ann. Probab., 46(6), 3015-3089, 2018)</description>

      <title>Negative Dependence in Knockout Tournaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Negative dependence in tournaments has received attention in the literature. The property of negative orthant dependence (NOD) was proved for different tournament models with a special proof for each model. For general round-robin tournaments and knockout tournaments with random draws, Malinovsky and Rinott (2023) unified and simplified many existing results in the literature by proving a stronger property, negative association (NA). For a knockout tournament with a non-random draw, Malinovsky and Rinott (2023) presented an example to illustrate that S is NOD but not NA. However, their proof is not correct. In this paper, we establish the properties of negative regression dependence (NRD), negative left-tail dependence (NLTD) and negative right-tail dependence (NRTD) for a knockout tournament with a random draw and with players being of equal strength. For a knockout tournament with a non-random draw and with equal strength, we prove that S is NA and NRTD, while S is, in general, not NRD or NLTD.</description>

      <title>The inversion statistic in derangements and in other permutations with a prescribed number of fixed points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how the inversion statistic is influenced by fixed points in a permutation. %The expected number of inversions in a uniformly random permutation in $S_n$ is $\frac{n(n-1)}4$. For each $n\in\mathbb{N}$, and each $k\in\{0,1,\cdots, n\}$, let $P_n^{(k)}$ denote the uniform probability measure on the set of permutations in $S_n$ with exactly $k$ fixed points. We obtain an exact formula for the expected number of inversions under the measure $P_n^{(k)}$ as well as for $P_n^{(k)}(\sigma^{-1}_i&lt;\sigma^{-1}_j)$, for $1\le i&lt;j\le n$, the $P_n^{(k)}$-probability that the number $i$ precedes the number $j$. In particular,
  up to a super-exponentially small correction as $n\to\infty$, the expected number of inversions in a random derangement $(k=0)$ is $\frac16n+\frac1{12}$ more than
  the value $\frac{n(n-1)}4$ that one obtains for a uniformly random
  general permutation in $S_n$. On the other hand, up to a super-exponentially small correction, for $k\ge2$, the expected number of inversions in a random permutation with $k$ fixed points is $\frac{k-1}6n+\frac{k^2-k-1}{12}$ less than $\frac{n(n-1)}4$. In the borderline case, $k=1$, up to a super-exponentially small correction, the expected number of inversions in a random permutation with one fixed point is $\frac1{12}$ more than $\frac{n(n-1)}4$. The proofs make strategic and perhaps novel use of the Chinese restaurant construction for a uniformly random permutation.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Cumulative Prospect Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel parametrization of Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT), as developed by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, that yields an explicit gamble valuation formula for Gaussian reward distributions. Specifically, we define parametric functions $ v_{\theta} $, $ w^{-}_{\theta} $, and $ w^{+}_{\theta} $ satisfying three key properties. The first, \emph{validity}, ensures that for any parameter $\theta$, the functions conform to the qualitative principles of CPT: $ v_{\theta} $ is concave over gains and convex over losses with a steeper slope for losses; $ w^{-}_{\theta} $ and $ w^{+}_{\theta} $ are increasing, exhibit inverse S-shaped curves, and map 0 to 0 and 1 to 1. The second, \emph{richness}, guarantees that the parametrization is expressive enough to capture a wide range of behaviors: $ v_{\theta} $ can exhibit arbitrary asymptotic behavior and convergence rates, while $ w^{-}_{\theta} $ and $ w^{+}_{\theta} $ can achieve any specified crossover points and slopes. The third, \emph{explicit valuation}, ensures that for any $\theta$, the CPT valuation of a Gaussian-distributed gamble (with arbitrary mean and variance) can be computed in closed form -- enabling efficient approximations for bell-shaped reward distributions. This framework is designed for scalable and rapid computation, making it particularly suited for applications involving large populations. We demonstrate its practicality through two illustrative examples in population-level CPT modeling.</description>

      <title>Spectral gap of the KMP and other stochastic exchange models on arbitrary graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a simple strategy to derive universal bounds on the spectral gap of reversible stochastic exchange models on arbitrary graphs. The Kipnis-Marchioro-Presutti (KMP) model, the harmonic process (HP), and the immediate exchange model (IEM) are all examples that fall into this class. Our upper and lower bounds depend only on two features: worst-case linear statistics and a kinetic factor, which is, in essence, graph-independent. For the three aforementioned examples, these bounds are sharp, and even saturate to an identity for HP and IEM in some log-concave regimes. The proof -- which yields bounds for eigenvalues even in the non-reversible context -- crucially exploits the rigidity of the eigenstructure of these models and quantitative contraction rates of the corresponding hidden parameter models recently introduced in [DMFG24, GRT25].</description>

      <title>Reach-avoid semi-Markov decision processes with time-varying obstacles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the maximal reach-avoid probability to a target in finite horizon for semi-Markov decision processes with time-varying obstacles. Since the variance of the obstacle set, the model \eqref{Model} is non-homogeneous. To overcome such difficulty, we construct a related two-dimensional model \eqref{newModel}, and then prove the equivalence between such reach-avoid probability of the original model and that of the related two-dimensional one. For the related two-dimensional model, we analyze some special characteristics of the equivalent reach-avoid probability. On this basis, we provide a special improved value-type algorithm to obtain the equivalent maximal reach-avoid probability and its $\epsilon$-optimal policy. Then, at the last step of the algorithm, by the equivalence between these two models, we obtain the original maximal reach-avoid probability and its $\epsilon$-optimal policy for the original model.</description>

For a monotone subset $A\subseteq\{0,1\}^{n}$ of density $\mu(A)$, the previous best lower bound on the spectral gap, due to Cohen, was $\gamma\gtrsim \mu(A)/n^{2}$, improving upon the earlier bound $\gamma\gtrsim \mu(A)^{2}/n^{2}$ established by Ding and Mossel. In this paper, we prove the optimal lower bound $\gamma\gtrsim \mu(A)/n$. As a corollary, we improve the mixing time upper bound of the random walk on constant-density monotone sets from $O(n^{3})$, as shown by Ding and Mossel, to $O(n^{2})$. Along the way, we develop two new inequalities that may be of independent interest: (1)~a directed $L^{2}$-Poincar\'{e} inequality on the hypercube, and (2)~an ``approximate'' FKG inequality for monotone sets.</description>

      <title>Limit law for root separation in random polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f_n$ be a random polynomial of degree $n\ge 2$ whose coefficients are independent and identically distributed random variables. We study the separation distances between roots of $f_n$ and prove that the set of these distances, normalized by $n^{-5/4}$, converges in distribution as $n\to \infty$ to a non-homogeneous Poisson point process. As a corollary, we deduce that the minimal separation distance between roots of $f_n$, normalized by $n^{-5/4}$ has a non-trivial limit law. In the course of the proof, we establish a related result which may be of independent interest: a Taylor series with random i.i.d. coefficients almost-surely does not have a double zero anywhere other than the origin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the spectral dimension, the dimension of a symmetric random walk, and the Gelfand-Kirillov dimension for compact Vilenkin groups. As a result, we show that these dimensions are zero for any compact, totally disconnected, metrizable topological group. We provide an explicit description of the $K$-groups for compact Vilenkin groups. We express the generators of the $K_0$-groups in terms of the corresponding matrix coefficients for two specific examples: the group of $p$-adic integers and the $p$-adic Heisenberg group. Finally, we prove the nonexistence of a natural class of spectral triples on the group of $p$-adic integers.</description>

      <title>Automated ARAT Scoring Using Multimodal Video Analysis, Multi-View Fusion, and Hierarchical Bayesian Models: A Clinician Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Manual scoring of the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) for upper extremity assessment in stroke rehabilitation is time-intensive and variable. We propose an automated ARAT scoring system integrating multimodal video analysis with SlowFast, I3D, and Transformer-based models using OpenPose keypoints and object locations. Our approach employs multi-view data (ipsilateral, contralateral, and top perspectives), applying early and late fusion to combine features across views and models. Hierarchical Bayesian Models (HBMs) infer movement quality components, enhancing interpretability. A clinician dashboard displays task scores, execution times, and quality assessments. We conducted a study with five clinicians who reviewed 500 video ratings generated by our system, providing feedback on its accuracy and usability. Evaluated on a stroke rehabilitation dataset, our framework achieves 89.0% validation accuracy with late fusion, with HBMs aligning closely with manual assessments. This work advances automated rehabilitation by offering a scalable, interpretable solution with clinical validation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper addresses a singular control problem, where controls are processes of finite variation, with a focus on portfolio investment under transaction costs. We establish the existence of an optimal strategy in the class of randomized strategies for a range of goal functionals, including cumulative prospect theory preferences, subject to the nonnegativity constraint on the portfolio wealth. Unlike the existing approaches, we employ a metrizable Meyer-Zheng topology. Additionally, we investigate the applicability of the Skorokhod convergence for processes, adapted to a specific filtration. The presented framework provides a clear distinction between constraints imposed on the market model and on the goal functional.</description>

      <title>A copula-based rank histogram ensemble filter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Serial ensemble filters implement triangular probability transport maps to reduce high-dimensional inference problems to sequences of state-by-state univariate inference problems. The univariate inference problems are solved by sampling posterior probability densities obtained by combining constructed prior densities with observational likelihoods according to Bayes' rule. Many serial filters in the literature focus on representing the marginal posterior densities of each state. However, rigorously capturing the conditional dependencies between the different univariate inferences is crucial to correctly sampling multidimensional posteriors. This work proposes a new serial ensemble filter, called the copula rank histogram filter (CoRHF), that seeks to capture the conditional dependency structure between variables via empirical copula estimates; these estimates are used to rigorously implement the triangular (state-by-state univariate) Bayesian inference. The success of the CoRHF is demonstrated on two-dimensional examples and the Lorenz '63 problem. A practical extension to the high-dimensional setting is developed by localizing the empirical copula estimation, and is demonstrated on the Lorenz '96 problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the free energy of a class of spin glass models with $ p$-spin interactions in a transverse magnetic field. As $ p \to \infty $, the infinite system-size free energy is proven to converge to that of the quantum random energy model. This is accomplished by combining existing analytical techniques addressing the non-commutative properties of such quantum glasses, with the description of the typical geometry of extreme negative deviations of the classical $ p $-spin glass. We also review properties of the corresponding classical free energy and conjectures addressing $ 1/p $-corrections in the quantum case.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical random measures without tables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hierarchical Dirichlet process is the cornerstone of Bayesian nonparametric multilevel models. Its generative model can be described through a set of latent variables, commonly referred to as tables within the popular restaurant franchise metaphor. The latent tables simplify the expression of the posterior and allow for the implementation of a Gibbs sampling algorithm to approximately draw samples from it. However, managing their assignments can become computationally expensive, especially as the size of the dataset and of the number of levels increase. In this work, we identify a prior for the concentration parameter of the hierarchical Dirichlet process that (i) induces a quasi-conjugate posterior distribution, and (ii) removes the need of tables, bringing to more interpretable expressions for the posterior, with both a faster and an exact algorithm to sample from it. Remarkably, this construction extends beyond the Dirichlet process, leading to a new framework for defining normalized hierarchical random measures and a new class of algorithms to sample from their posteriors. The key analytical tool is the independence of multivariate increments, that is, their representation as completely random vectors.</description>

Abstract: The starting point of this work is a theorem due to Maxwell characterizing the distribution of a Gaussian vector with at least two coordinates. We define the Gaussian Orthogonal, Unitary and Symplectic Tensor Ensembles for notions of real symmetric, hermitian and self-dual hermitian tensors which recover the classical vector and matrix Gaussian Ensembles when the order is one and two. We give a basis of invariant polynomials for orthogonal, unitary and symplectic transformations and we prove a Maxwell-type theorem for these Gaussian tensor distributions unifying and extending the ones known for vectors and matrices.</description>

Abstract: We study the convergence of probability measures in terms of moments by applying operators to their Bessel generating functions. We consider a general setting of applying operators such as the Dunkl operator to formal power series that are symmetric or symmetric in all but one variable. Afterwards, we apply the results from this setting by considering Bessel generating functions as the formal power series to obtain a Law of Large Numbers as $N$, the number of variables, increases to infinity and $N^c\beta$ converges to a constant, where $c\in (-\infty, 1)$. In contrast with previous results, we consider when the scaled partial derivatives of the logarithms of the Bessel generating functions evaluated at the origin can have nonzero $N\rightarrow\infty$ limit when any number of variables is involved. Then, the free cumulant of order $k$ is a linear combination of the limits of the order $k$ partial derivatives.</description>

      <title>Heat kernel estimates for Dirichlet forms degenerate at the boundary</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.08606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to establish sharp two-sided estimates on the heat kernels of two types of purely discontinuous symmetric Markov processes in the upper half-space of $\mathbb R^d$ with jump kernels degenerate at the boundary. The jump kernels are of the form $J(x,y)=\mathcal B(x,y)|x-y|^{-\alpha-d}$, $\alpha\in (0,2)$, where the function $\mathcal B$ depends on four parameters and may vanish at the boundary. Our results are the first sharp two-sided estimates for the heat kernels of non-local operators with jump kernels degenerate at the boundary. The first type of processes are conservative Markov processes on $\overline{\mathbb R}^d_+$ with jump kernel $J(x,y)$. Depending on the regions where the parameters belong, the heat kernels estimates have three different forms, two of them are qualitatively different from all previously known heat kernel estimates. The second type of processes are the processes above killed either by a critical potential or upon hitting the boundary of the half-space. We establish that their heat kernel estimates have the approximate factorization property with survival probabilities decaying as a power of the distance to the boundary, where the power depends on the constant in the critical potential.</description>

      <title>Which exceptional low-dimensional projections of a Gaussian point cloud can be found in polynomial time?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given $d$-dimensional standard Gaussian vectors $\boldsymbol{x}_1,\dots, \boldsymbol{x}_n$, we consider the set of all empirical distributions of its $m$-dimensional projections, for $m$ a fixed constant. Diaconis and Freedman (1984) proved that, if $n/d\to \infty$, all such distributions converge to the standard Gaussian distribution. In contrast, we study the proportional asymptotics, whereby $n,d\to \infty$ with $n/d\to \alpha \in (0, \infty)$. In this case, the projection of the data points along a typical random subspace is again Gaussian, but the set $\mathscr{F}_{m,\alpha}$ of all probability distributions that are asymptotically feasible as $m$-dimensional projections contains non-Gaussian distributions corresponding to exceptional subspaces.
  Non-rigorous methods from statistical physics yield an indirect characterization of $\mathscr{F}_{m,\alpha}$ in terms of a generalized Parisi formula. Motivated by the goal of putting this formula on a rigorous basis, and to understand whether these projections can be found efficiently, we study the subset $\mathscr{F}^{\rm alg}_{m,\alpha}\subseteq \mathscr{F}_{m,\alpha}$ of distributions that can be realized by a class of iterative algorithms. We prove that this set is characterized by a certain stochastic optimal control problem, and obtain a dual characterization of this problem in terms of a variational principle that extends Parisi's formula.
  As a byproduct, we obtain computationally achievable values for a class of random optimization problems including `generalized spherical perceptron' models.</description>

Abstract: This paper aims to investigate the stochastic generalization of the projected deterministic constrained modified Swift-Hohenberg equation. In particular, we prove the global well-posedness and its invariance of Hilbert submanifold i.e. if the initial condition are chosen from submanifold then trajectories of solutions are going to stay on manifold. The proof of global well-posedness is based on Khashminskii test for non-explosions test for no-explosions. Swift-Hohenberg equations belong to class of Amplitude equations that usually describe the pattern formation in nature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by information geometry, a distance function on the space of stochastic matrices is advocated. Starting with sequences of Markov chains the Bhattacharyya angle is advocated as the natural tool for comparing both short and long term Markov chain runs. Bounds on the convergence of the distance and mixing times are derived. Guided by the desire to compare different Markov chain models, especially in the setting of healthcare processes, a new distance function on the space of stochastic matrices is presented. It is a true distance measure which has a closed form and is efficient to implement for numerical evaluation. In the case of ergodic Markov chains, it is shown that considering either the Bhattacharyya angle on Markov sequences or the new stochastic matrix distance leads to the same distance between models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The definition of generalized random processes in Gel'fand sense allows to extend well-known stochastic models, such as the fractional Brownian motion, and study the related fractional pde's, as well as stochastic differential equations in distributional sense. By analogy with the construction (in the infinite-dimensional white-noise space) of the latter, we introduce two processes defined by means of Hadamard-type fractional operators. When used to replace the time derivative in the governing p.d.e.'s, the Hadamard-type derivatives are usually associated with ultra-slow diffusions. On the other hand, in our construction, they directly determine the memory properties of the so-called Hadamard fractional Brownian motion (H-fBm) and its long-time behaviour. Still, for any finite time horizon, the H-fBm displays a standard diffusing feature. We then extend the definition of the H-fBm from the white noise space to an infinite dimensional grey-noise space built on the Le Roy measure, so that our model represents an alternative to the generalized grey Brownian motion. In this case, we prove that the one-dimensional distribution of the process satisfies a heat equation with non-constant coefficients and fractional Hadamard time-derivative. Finally, once proved the existence of the distributional derivative of the above defined processes and derived an integral formula for it, we construct an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type process and evaluate its distribution.</description>

      <title>Lifting couplings in Wasserstein spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.06591v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper makes mathematically precise the idea that conditional probabilities are analogous to path liftings in geometry.
  The idea of lifting is modelled in terms of the category-theoretic concept of a lens, which can be interpreted as a consistent choice of arrow liftings. The category we study is the one of probability measures over a given standard Borel space, with morphisms given by the couplings, or transport plans.
  The geometrical picture is even more apparent once we equip the arrows of the category with weights, which one can interpret as "lengths" or "costs", forming a so-called weighted category, which unifies several concepts of category theory and metric geometry.
  Indeed, we show that the weighted version of a lens is tightly connected to the notion of submetry in geometry.
  Every weighted category gives rise to a pseudo-quasimetric space via optimization over the arrows. In particular, Wasserstein spaces can be obtained from the weighted categories of probability measures and their couplings, with the weight of a coupling given by its cost.
  In this case, conditionals allow one to form weighted lenses, which one can interpret as "lifting transport plans, while preserving their cost".</description>

      <title>Asymptotic mixed normality of maximum likelihood estimator for Ewens--Pitman partition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.01949v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the asymptotic properties of parameter estimation for the Ewens--Pitman partition with parameters $0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$ and $\theta&gt;-\alpha$. Especially, we show that the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of $\alpha$ is $n^{\alpha/2}$-consistent and converges to a variance mixture of normal distributions, where the variance is governed by the Mittag-Leffler distribution. Moreover, we show that a proper normalization involving a random statistic eliminates the randomness in the variance. Building on this result, we construct an approximate confidence interval for $\alpha$. Our proof relies on a stable martingale central limit theorem, which is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>$\Phi^4_3$ measures on compact Riemannian $3$-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10185v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct the $\Phi^4_3$ measure on an arbitrary 3-dimensional compact Riemannian manifold without boundary as an invariant probability measure of a singular stochastic partial differential equation. Proving the nontriviality and the covariance under Riemannian isometries of that measure gives for the first time a non-perturbative, non-topological interacting Euclidean quantum field theory on curved spaces in dimension 3. This answers a longstanding open problem of constructive quantum field theory on curved 3 dimensional backgrounds. To control analytically several Feynman diagrams appearing in the construction of a number of random fields, we introduce a novel approach of renormalization using microlocal and harmonic analysis. This allows to obtain a renormalized equation which involves some universal constants independent of the manifold. We also define a new vectorial Cole-Hopf transform which allows to deal with the vectorial $\Phi^4_3$ model where $\Phi$ is now a bundle valued random field. In a companion paper, we develop in a self-contained way all the tools from paradifferential and microlocal analysis that we use to build in our manifold setting a number of analytic and probabilistic objects.</description>

      <title>On reachability of Markov decision processes: a novel state-classification-based PI approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.06298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper concentrates on the reliability of a discrete-time controlled Markov system with finite states and actions, and aims to give an efficient algorithm for obtaining an optimal (control) policy that makes the system have the maximal reliability for every initial state. After establishing the existence of an optimal policy, for the computation of optimal policies, we introduce the concept of an absorbing set of a stationary policy, and find some characterization and a computational method of the absorbing sets. Using the largest absorbing set, we build a novel optimality equation (OE), and prove the uniqueness of a solution of the OE. Furthermore, we provide a policy iteration algorithm of optimal policies, and prove that an optimal policy and the maximal reliability can be obtained in a finite number of iterations. Finally, an example in reliability and maintenance problems is given to illustrate our results.</description>

      <title>Inter-city infections and the role of size heterogeneity in containment strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03100v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study examines the effectiveness of regional lockdown strategies in mitigating pathogen spread across regional units, termed cities hereinafter. We develop simplified models to analyze infection spread across cities within a country during an epidemic wave. Isolation of a city is initiated when infection numbers within the city surpass defined thresholds. We compare two strategies: strategy (P) consists in prescribing thresholds proportionally to city sizes, while the same threshold is used for all cities under strategy (U). Given the heavy-tailed distribution of city sizes, strategy (P) may result in more secondary infections from larger cities than strategy (U).
  Random graph models are constructed to represent infection spread as a percolation process. In particular, we consider a model in which mobility between cities only depends on city sizes. We assess the relative efficiency of the two strategies by comparing the ratios of the number of individuals under isolation to the total number of infections by the end of the epidemic wave under strategy (P) and (U). Additionally, we derive analytical formulas for disease prevalence and basic reproduction numbers.
  Our models are calibrated using mobility data from France, Poland and Japan, validated through simulation. The findings indicate that mobility between cities in France and Poland is mainly determined by city sizes. However, a poor fit was observed with Japanese data, highlighting the importance to include other factors like e.g. geography for some countries in modeling. Our analysis suggest similar effectiveness for both strategies in France and Japan, while strategy (U) demonstrates distinct merits in Poland.</description>

      <title>Multivariate Gaussian Approximation for Random Forest via Region-based Stabilization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09960v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive Gaussian approximation bounds for $k$-Potential Nearest Neighbor ($k$-PNN) based random forest predictions based on a set of training points given by a Poisson process under fairly mild regularity assumptions on the data generating process. Our approach is based on the key observation that $k$-PNN based random forest predictions satisfy a certain geometric property called region-based stabilization. We also compare the rates with those of $k$-nearest neighbor-based random forests, highlighting a form of universality in our result. In the process of developing our results, we also establish a probabilistic result on multivariate Gaussian approximation bounds for general functionals of Poisson process that are region-based stabilizing. This general result makes use of the Malliavin-Stein method, and is potentially applicable to various related statistical problems.</description>

      <title>Non-concave stochastic optimal control in finite discrete time under model uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we present a general framework for non-concave robust stochastic control problems under model uncertainty in a discrete time finite horizon setting. Our framework allows to consider a variety of different path-dependent ambiguity sets of probability measures comprising, as a natural example, the ambiguity set defined via Wasserstein-balls around path-dependent reference measures with path-dependent radii, as well as parametric classes of probability distributions. We establish a dynamic programming principle which allows to derive both optimal control and worst-case measure by solving recursively a sequence of one-step optimization problems. Moreover, we derive upper bounds for the difference of the values of the robust and non-robust stochastic control problem in the Wasserstein uncertainty and parameter uncertainty case. As a concrete application, we study the robust hedging problem of financial derivatives under an asymmetric (and non-convex) loss function accounting for different preferences of sell- and buy side when it comes to the hedging of financial derivatives. As our entirely data-driven ambiguity set of probability measures, we consider Wasserstein-balls around the empirical measure derived from real financial data. We demonstrate that during adverse scenarios such as a financial crisis, our robust approach outperforms typical model-based hedging strategies such as the classical Delta-hedging strategy as well as the hedging strategy obtained in the non-robust setting with respect to the empirical measure and therefore overcomes the problem of model misspecification in such critical periods.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15824v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study non-expanding random walks on the space of affine lattices and establish a new classification theorem for stationary measures. Further, we prove a theorem that relates the genericity with respect to these random walks to Birkhoff genericity. Finally, we apply these theorems to obtain several results in inhomogeneous Diophantine approximation, especially on fractals.</description>
