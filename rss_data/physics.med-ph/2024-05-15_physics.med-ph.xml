      <title>A review on machine learning for arterial extraction and quantitative assessment on invasive coronary angiograms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose of Review Recently, machine learning has developed rapidly in the field of medicine, playing an important role in disease diagnosis. Our aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the advancements in machine learning techniques applied to invasive coronary angiography (ICA) for segmentation of coronary arteries and quantitative evaluation like fractional flow reserve (FFR) and stenosis assessment.
  Recent Findings ICA are used extensively along with machine learning techniques for the segmentation of arteries and quantitative evaluation of stenosis, coronary artery disease and measurement of fractional flow reserve, representing a trend towards using computational methods for enhanced diagnostic precision in cardiovascular medicine.
  Summary Various research studies have been conducted in this field, each using different algorithms and datasets. The performance of these studies largely depends on the algorithms employed and the datasets used for training and evaluation. However, despite the progress made, there remains a need for machine learning (ML) algorithms that can be easily integrated into clinical practice.</description>

      <title>Effects of skull properties on transcranial focused ultrasound transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transcranial focused ultrasound can deliver energy to the brain in a minimally invasive manner for a variety of clinical applications. However, acoustic inhomogeneities within the skull cause significant wave interactions, leading to difficulties in predicting the energy delivered to the target. We present a comprehensive examination of intracranial acoustic fields generated by focused ultrasound transducers and assess the characteristics of cranial bone that affect acoustic transmission. Acoustic field maps were generated at 88 regions of interest across 10 historical and 2 Thiel-embalmed human skull specimens with sonication at frequencies of 220 kHz, 650 kHz, and 1000 kHz. The average peak pressure attenuation was $3.1 \pm 1.4$ dB, $9.0 \pm 1.7$ dB, and $14.6 \pm 4.1$ dB, respectively. The average power attenuation was $5.0 \pm 2.4$ dB, $14.9 \pm 3.2$ dB, and $24.1 \pm 6.3$ dB, respectively. The effect of skull thickness, skull density ratio, and skull curvature on intracranial peak pressure and power was investigated and linear fits produced. Our results demonstrate that Thiel-embalmed samples fall within the confidence intervals of fits for historical samples. The effects of angulation and spacing between the transducer and the skull were also investigated. Results indicate that wave superposition resulting from skull and transducer spacing could lead to a 30-40% uncertainty in peak recorded intracranial pressure.</description>

      <title>Approaches to iterative algorithms for solving nonlinear equations with an application in tomographic absorption spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we propose an approach for solving systems of nonlinear equations without computing function derivatives. Motivated by the application area of tomographic absorption spectroscopy, which is a highly-nonlinear problem with variables coupling, we consider a situation where straightforward translation to a fixed point problem is not possible because the operators that represent the relevant systems of nonlinear equations are not self-mappings, i.e., they operate between spaces of different dimensions. To overcome this difficulty we suggest an "alternating common fixed points algorithm" that acts alternatingly on the different vector variables. This approach translates the original problem to a common fixed point problem for which iterative algorithms are abound and exhibits a viable alternative to translation to an optimization problem, which usually requires derivatives information. However, to apply any of these iterative algorithms requires to ascertain the conditions that appear in their convergence theorems. To circumvent the need to verify conditions for convergence, we propose and motivate a derivative-free algorithm that better suits the tomographic absorption spectroscopy problem at hand and is even further improved by applying to it the superiorization approach. This is presented along with experimental results that demonstrate our approach.</description>

      <title>CheXmask: a large-scale dataset of anatomical segmentation masks for multi-center chest x-ray images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03293v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of successful artificial intelligence models for chest X-ray analysis relies on large, diverse datasets with high-quality annotations. While several databases of chest X-ray images have been released, most include disease diagnosis labels but lack detailed pixel-level anatomical segmentation labels. To address this gap, we introduce an extensive chest X-ray multi-center segmentation dataset with uniform and fine-grain anatomical annotations for images coming from five well-known publicly available databases: ChestX-ray8, Chexpert, MIMIC-CXR-JPG, Padchest, and VinDr-CXR, resulting in 657,566 segmentation masks. Our methodology utilizes the HybridGNet model to ensure consistent and high-quality segmentations across all datasets. Rigorous validation, including expert physician evaluation and automatic quality control, was conducted to validate the resulting masks. Additionally, we provide individualized quality indices per mask and an overall quality estimation per dataset. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for the broader scientific community, streamlining the development and assessment of innovative methodologies in chest X-ray analysis. The CheXmask dataset is publicly available at: https://physionet.org/content/chexmask-cxr-segmentation-data/</description>

      <title>Inverse Problem Approach to Aberration Correction for in vivo Transcranial Imaging Based on a Sparse Representation of Contrast-enhanced Ultrasound Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transcranial ultrasound imaging is currently limited by attenuation and aberration induced by the skull. First used in contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), highly echoic microbubbles allowed for the development of novel imaging modalities such as ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM). Herein, we develop an inverse problem approach to aberration correction (IPAC) that leverages the sparsity of microbubble signals. We propose to use the \textit{a priori} knowledge of the medium based upon microbubble localization and wave propagation to build a forward model to link the measured signals directly to the aberration function. A standard least-squares inversion is then used to retrieve the aberration function. We first validated IPAC on simulated data of a vascular network using plane wave as well as divergent wave emissions. We then evaluated the reproducibility of IPAC \textit{in vivo} in 5 mouse brains. We showed that aberration correction improved the contrast of CEUS images by 4.6 dB. For ULM images, IPAC yielded sharper vessels, reduced vessel duplications, and improved the resolution from 21.1 $\mu$m to 18.3 $\mu$m. Aberration correction also improved hemodynamic quantification for velocity magnitude and flow direction.</description>
