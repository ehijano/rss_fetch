      <title>Automated Discovery of Continuous Dynamics from Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical systems form the foundation of scientific discovery, traditionally modeled with predefined state variables such as the angle and angular velocity, and differential equations such as the equation of motion for a single pendulum. We propose an approach to discover a set of state variables that preserve the smoothness of the system dynamics and to construct a vector field representing the system's dynamics equation, automatically from video streams without prior physical knowledge. The prominence and effectiveness of the proposed approach are demonstrated through both quantitative and qualitative analyses of various dynamical systems, including the prediction of characteristic frequencies and the identification of chaotic and limit cycle behaviors. This shows the potential of our approach to assist human scientists in scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>Physical Informed-Inspired Deep Reinforcement Learning Based Bi-Level Programming for Microgrid Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To coordinate the interests of operator and users in a microgrid under complex and changeable operating conditions, this paper proposes a microgrid scheduling model considering the thermal flexibility of thermostatically controlled loads and demand response by leveraging physical informed-inspired deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based bi-level programming. To overcome the non-convex limitations of karush-kuhn-tucker (KKT)-based methods, a novel optimization solution method based on DRL theory is proposed to handle the bi-level programming through alternate iterations between levels. Specifically, by combining a DRL algorithm named asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C) and automated machine learning-prioritized experience replay (AutoML-PER) strategy to improve the generalization performance of A3C to address the above problems, an improved A3C algorithm, called AutoML-PER-A3C, is designed to solve the upper-level problem; while the DOCPLEX optimizer is adopted to address the lower-level problem. In this solution process, AutoML is used to automatically optimize hyperparameters and PER improves learning efficiency and quality by extracting the most valuable samples. The test results demonstrate that the presented approach manages to reconcile the interests between multiple stakeholders in MG by fully exploiting various flexibility resources. Furthermore, in terms of economic viability and computational efficiency, the proposal vastly exceeds other advanced reinforcement learning methods.</description>

      <title>Parallel Batch Scheduling With Incompatible Job Families Via Constraint Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the incompatible case of parallel batch scheduling, where compatible jobs belong to the same family, and jobs from different families cannot be processed together in the same batch. Existing constraint programming (CP) models for this problem fail to synchronize the processing of the jobs within their batch, resulting in batch interruptions. In the context of the diffusion area in the semiconductor manufacturing process, these interrupted solutions would disrupt the thermal stability required for a uniform dopant distribution on the wafers. This paper proposes three new CP models that directly tackle these interruptions in the formulation, including two adaptions of existing models and a novel Redundant Synchronized (RS) model. These existing and novel models are compared on standard test cases, demonstrating the superiority of the RS model in finding optimal or near-optimal solutions quickly.</description>

      <title>System-Level Analysis of Module Uncertainty Quantification in the Autonomy Pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel perspective on the design, use, and role of uncertainty measures for learned modules in an autonomous system. While in the current literature uncertainty measures are produced for standalone modules without considering the broader system context, in our work we explicitly consider the role of decision-making under uncertainty in illuminating how "good'" an uncertainty measure is. Our insights are centered around quantifying the ways in which being uncertainty-aware makes a system more robust. Firstly, we use level set generation tools to produce a measure for system robustness and use this measure to compare system designs, thus placing uncertainty quantification in the context of system performance and evaluation metrics. Secondly, we use the concept of specification generation from systems theory to produce a formulation under which a designer can simultaneously constrain the properties of an uncertainty measure and analyze the efficacy of the decision-making-under-uncertainty algorithm used by the system. We apply our analyses to two real-world and complex autonomous systems, one for autonomous driving and another for aircraft runway incursion detection, helping to form a toolbox for an uncertainty-aware system designer to produce more effective and robust systems.</description>

      <title>Augmented Intelligence in Smart Intersections: Local Digital Twins-Assisted Hybrid Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vehicle-road collaboration is a promising approach for enhancing the safety and efficiency of autonomous driving by extending the intelligence of onboard systems to smart roadside infrastructures. The introduction of digital twins (DTs), particularly local DTs (LDTs) at the edge, in smart mobility presents a new embodiment of augmented intelligence, which could enhance information exchange and extract human driving expertise to improve onboard intelligence. This paper presents a novel LDT-assisted hybrid autonomous driving system for improving safety and efficiency in traffic intersections. By leveraging roadside units (RSUs) equipped with sensory and computing capabilities, the proposed system continuously monitors traffic, extracts human driving knowledge, and generates intersection-specific local driving agents through an offline reinforcement learning (RL) framework. When connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) pass through RSU-equipped intersections, RSUs can provide local agents to support safe and efficient driving in local areas. Meanwhile, they provide real-time cooperative perception (CP) to broaden onboard sensory horizons. The proposed LDT-assisted hybrid system is implemented with state-of-the-art products, e.g., CAVs and RSUs, and technologies, e.g., millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications. Hardware-in-the-loop (HiL) simulations and proof-of-concept (PoC) tests validate system performance from two standpoints: (i) The peak latency for CP and local agent downloading are 8.51 ms and 146 ms, respectively, aligning with 3GPP requirements for vehicle-to-everything (V2X) and model transfer use cases. Moreover, (ii) local driving agents can improve safety measures by 10% and reduce travel time by 15% compared with conventional onboard systems. The implemented prototype also demonstrates reliable real-time performance, fulfilling the targets of the proposed system design.</description>

      <title>RTI-NMPC for Control of Autonomous Vehicles Using Implicit Discretization Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent efforts in the development of autonomous driving technology have induced great advancements in perception, planning and control systems. Model predictive control is one of the most popular advanced control methods, but its application to nonlinear systems still depends on the development of computationally efficient methods. This work presents a nonlinear model predictive control formulation based on real-time iteration using an implicit discretization of the system's dynamics, with the objective of achieving greater prediction accuracy and lower computational cost when dealing with stiff dynamical systems, as is the case for vehicle dynamics. The proposed method is described and later evaluated on a simulation scenario considering modeling errors and external disturbances. The presented results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method when it comes to tracking a given trajectory and its low computational burden, measured in terms of execution time.</description>

      <title>A Hierarchical DRL Approach for Resource Optimization in Multi-RIS Multi-Operator Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) emerge as a pivotal technology in the upcoming sixth-generation (6G) networks, their deployment within practical multiple operator (OP) networks presents significant challenges, including the coordination of RIS configurations among OPs, interference management, and privacy maintenance. A promising strategy is to treat RIS as a public resource managed by an RIS provider (RP), which can enhance resource allocation efficiency by allowing dynamic access for multiple OPs. However, the intricate nature of coordinating management and optimizing RIS configurations significantly complicates the implementation process. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (HDRL) approach that decomposes the complicated RIS resource optimization problem into several subtasks. Specifically, a top-level RP-agent is responsible for RIS allocation, while low-level OP-agents control their assigned RISs and handle beamforming, RIS phase-shifts, and user association. By utilizing the semi-Markov decision process (SMDP) theory, we establish a sophisticated interaction mechanism between the RP and OPs, and introduce an advanced hierarchical proximal policy optimization (HPPO) algorithm. Furthermore, we propose an improved sequential-HPPO (S-HPPO) algorithm to address the curse of dimensionality encountered with a single RP-agent. Experimental results validate the stability of the HPPO algorithm across various environmental parameters, demonstrating its superiority over other benchmarks for joint resource optimization. Finally, we conduct a detailed comparative analysis between the proposed S-HPPO and HPPO algorithms, showcasing that the S-HPPO algorithm achieves faster convergence and improved performance in large-scale RIS allocation scenarios.</description>

      <title>AoI-Aware Resource Allocation for Smart Multi-QoS Provisioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Age of Information (AoI) has recently gained recognition as a critical quality-of-service (QoS) metric for quantifying the freshness of status updates, playing a crucial role in supporting massive ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (mURLLC) services. In mURLLC scenarios, due to the inherent system dynamics and varying environmental conditions, optimizing AoI under such multi-QoS constraints considering both delay and reliability often results in non-convex and computationally intractable problems. Motivated by the demonstrated efficacy of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in addressing large-scale networking challenges, this work aims to apply DRL techniques to derive optimal resource allocation solutions in real time. Despite its potential, the effective integration of FBC in DRL-based AoI optimization remains underexplored, especially in addressing the challenge of simultaneously upper-bounding both delay and error-rate. To address these challenges, we propose a DRL-based framework for AoI-aware optimal resource allocation in mURLLC-driven multi-QoS schemes, leveraging AoI as a core metric within the finite blocklength regime. First, we design a wireless communication architecture and AoI-based modeling framework that incorporates FBC. Second, we proceed by deriving upper-bounded peak AoI and delay violation probabilities using stochastic network calculus (SNC). Subsequently, we formulate an optimization problem aimed at minimizing the peak AoI violation probability through FBC. Third, we develop DRL algorithms to determine optimal resource allocation policies that meet statistical delay and error-rate requirements for mURLLC. Finally, to validate the effectiveness of the developed schemes, we have executed a series of simulations.</description>

      <title>Design and Analysis of a Metamaterial-Inspired Absorber for data rate in 52% RF-to-DC conversion Efficiency Dual-band SWIPT system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel metamaterial-inspired absorber designed to enhance the data rate in 52% RF to DC conversion simultaneous wireless information and power transfer system (SWIPT) through biological tissue. The proposed absorber includes split-ring resonators(SRRs) and demonstrates significant permeability characteristics, with both the real and imaginary parts being negative and close to -1. It also improves isolation by around 5dB in a WPT distance of 9mm. A 5mm thick phantom is used for biological tissue in this study. Experimental results exhibits that the SWIPT systems including a rectifier that converts 52% RF to DC efficiency in a WPT distance of 9mm embedding this absorber between power and signal ports at Tx side results in a 5dB improvement in isolation performance. By using proposed absorber, it enables a 7MB/s improvement of data rate and allows signals to be transmitted with 5dBm weaker power than without absorber SWIPT system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new multirotor aerial vehicle class of designs composed of a multi-body structure in which a main body is connected by passive joints to links equipped with propellers. We have investigated some instances of such class, some of which are shown to achieve omnidirectionality while having a minimum number of inputs equal to the main body Degrees of Freedom DoF's, only uni-directional positive thrust propellers, and no internal forces generated at steady state. After dynamics are derived following the Euler-Lagrange approach, an I/O dynamic feedback linearization strategy is then used to show the controllability of any desired pose with stable zero dynamics. We finally verify the developed controller with closed-loop simulations.</description>

      <title>Modeling, Prediction and Risk Management of Distribution System Voltages with Non-Gaussian Probability Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High renewable energy penetration into power distribution systems causes a substantial risk of exceeding voltage security limits, which needs to be accurately assessed and properly managed. However, the existing methods usually rely on the joint probability models of power generation and loads provided by probabilistic prediction to quantify the voltage risks, where inaccurate prediction results could lead to over or under estimated risks. This paper proposes an uncertain voltage component (UVC) prediction method for assessing and managing voltage risks. First, we define the UVC to evaluate voltage variations caused by the uncertainties associated with power generation and loads. Second, we propose a Gaussian mixture model-based probabilistic UVC prediction method to depict the non-Gaussian distribution of voltage variations. Then, we derive the voltage risk indices, including value-at-risk (VaR) and conditional value-at-risk (CVaR), based on the probabilistic UVC prediction model. Third, we investigate the mechanism of UVC-based voltage risk management and establish the voltage risk management problems, which are reformulated into linear programming or mixed-integer linear programming for convenient solutions. The proposed method is tested on power distribution systems with actual photovoltaic power and load data and compared with those considering probabilistic prediction of nodal power injections. Numerical results show that the proposed method is computationally efficient in assessing voltage risks and outperforms existing methods in managing voltage risks. The deviation of voltage risks obtained by the proposed method is only 15% of that by the methods based on probabilistic prediction of nodal power injections.</description>

      <title>Mean Field-based Dynamic Backoff Optimization for MIMO-enabled Grant-Free NOMA in Massive IoT Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the 6G Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm, unprecedented challenges will be raised to provide massive connectivity, ultra-low latency, and energy efficiency for ultra-dense IoT devices. To address these challenges, we explore the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) based grant-free random access (GFRA) schemes in the cellular uplink to support massive IoT devices with high spectrum efficiency and low access latency. In particular, we focus on optimizing the backoff strategy of each device when transmitting time-sensitive data samples to a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-enabled base station subject to energy constraints. To cope with the dynamic varied channel and the severe uplink interference due to the uncoordinated grant-free access, we formulate the optimization problem as a multi-user non-cooperative dynamic stochastic game (MUN-DSG). To avoid dimensional disaster as the device number grows large, the optimization problem is transformed into a mean field game (MFG), and its Nash equilibrium can be achieved by solving the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) and Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov (FPK) equations. Thus, a Mean Field-based Dynamic Backoff (MFDB) scheme is proposed as the optimal GFRA solution for each device. Extensive simulation has been fulfilled to compare the proposed MFDB with contemporary random access approaches like access class barring (ACB), slotted-Additive Links On-line Hawaii Area (ALOHA), and minimum backoff (MB) under both static and dynamic channels, and the results proved that MFDB can achieve the least access delay and cumulated cost during multiple transmission frames.

      <title>Optimal Network Expansion Planning Considering Uncertain Dynamic Thermal Line Rating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the integrated generation and transmission expansion planning problem to address the growing challenges associated with increasing power network loads. The proposed approach optimizes the operation and investment costs for new generation units and transmission lines, while also considering the environmental benefits of integrating renewable energy sources (RES) and the impact of electric vehicle (EV) charging on the grid. The inherent uncertainties in demand, EV charging loads, and RES generation are managed using a hybrid stochastic-robust optimization approach. Additionally, the model integrates Dynamic Thermal Line Rating (DTLR) to improve the efficiency and resilience of transmission lines. The framework also tackles the uncertainty related to DTLR, incorporating a heuristic linearization technique to reduce model complexity. The effectiveness of the proposed model and techniques is evaluated through simulations conducted on two case studies: the modified IEEE 6-bus system and the IEEE 24-bus Reliability Test System.</description>

      <title>A Communication Consistent Approach to Signal Temporal Logic Task Decomposition in Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of decomposing a global task assigned to a multi-agent system, expressed as a formula within a fragment of Signal Temporal Logic (STL), under range-limited communication. Given a global task expressed as a conjunction of local tasks defined over the individual and relative states of agents in the system, we propose representing task dependencies among agents as edges of a suitably defined task graph. At the same time, range-limited communication naturally induces the definition of a communication graph that defines which agents have access to each other's states. Within these settings, inconsistencies arise when a task dependency between a pair of agents is not supported by a corresponding communication link due to the limited communication range. As a result, state feedback control laws previously derived to achieve the tasks' satisfaction can not be leveraged. We propose a task decomposition mechanism to distribute tasks assigned to pairs of non-communicating agents in the system as conjunctions of tasks defined over the relative states of communicating agents, thus enforcing consistency between task and communication graphs. Assuming the super-level sets of the predicate functions composing the STL tasks are bounded polytopes, our task decomposition mechanism can be cast as a parameter optimization problem and solved via state-of-the-art decentralized convex optimization algorithms. To guarantee the soundness of our approach, we present various conditions under which the tasks defined in the applied STL fragment are unsatisfiable, and we show sufficient conditions such that our decomposition approach yields satisfiable global tasks after decomposition.</description>

      <title>Circulating Currents in Windings: Fundamental Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circulating currents in windings refer to unwanted electrical currents flowing between the parallel conductors of a winding. These currents arise due to several phenomena such as asymmetries, imperfections in the winding layout, and differences in electric potential between the parallel conductors. This effect is visible typically in windings of transformers, motors, or generators. At on-load condition, this is equivalent to having a current unevenly distributed between parallel conductors. Circulating currents have two main drawbacks: increased losses in windings and potential degradation of insulation over time. The former is an intuitive property that is widely acknowledged in the literature. This paper presents a formal proof of this fundamental property, building upon the authors' previous work and embedding it within a rigorous mathematical framework. The mathematical definition of circulating currents is provided, along with a case application in an electric machine.</description>

      <title>Marine spatial planning techniques with a case study on wave-powered offshore aquaculture farms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As emerging marine technologies lead to the development of new infrastructure across the ocean, they enter an environment that existing ecosystems and industries already rely on. Although necessary to provide sustainable sources of energy and food, careful planning will be important to make informed decisions and avoid conflicts. This paper examines several techniques used for marine spatial planning, an approach for analyzing and planning the use of marine resources. Using open source software including QGIS and Python, the potential for developing wave-powered offshore aquaculture farms using the RM3 wave energy converter along the Northeast coast of the United States is assessed and several feasible sites are identified. The optimal site, located at 43.7{\deg}N, 68.9{\deg}W along the coast of Maine, has a total cost for a 5-pen farm of $56.8M, annual fish yield of 676 tonnes, and a levelized cost of fish of $9.23 per kilogram. Overall trends indicate that the cost greatly decreases with distance to shore due to the greater availability of wave energy and that conflicts and environmental constraints significantly limit the number of feasible sites in this region.</description>

      <title>A Lyapunov-Based Switching Scheme for Selecting the Stable Closed-Loop Fixed Attitude-Error Quaternion During Flight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a switching scheme, which uses both the attitude-error quaternion (AEQ) and the angular-velocity error, for controlling the rotational degrees of freedom of an uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) during flight. In this approach, the proposed controller continually selects the stable closed-loop (CL) equilibrium AEQ corresponding to the smallest cost between those computed with two energy-based Lyapunov functions. To analyze and enforce the stability of the CL switching dynamics, we use basic nonlinear theory. This research problem is relevant because the selection of the stable CL equilibrium AEQ directly determines the power and energy requirements of the controlled UAV during flight. To test and demonstrate the implementation, suitability, functionality, and performance of the proposed approach, we present experimental results obtained using a 31-gram quadrotor, which was controlled to execute high-speed yaw maneuvers in flight. These flight tests show that the proposed switching controller can respectively reduce the control effort and rotational power by as much as 49.75 % and 28.14 %, on average, compared to those corresponding to an often-used benchmark controller.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Empowering resource-limited robots to execute computationally intensive tasks like model/learning-based algorithms is challenging. Due to the complexity of the workload characteristic, the bottlenecks in different systems can depend on application requirements, preventing a single hardware architecture from being adequate across all robotics applications. This project provides a comprehensive design space exploration to determine optimal hardware computation platforms and architectures suitable for robotic algorithms. We profile and optimize representative architectural designs across general-purpose cores and specialized accelerators. Specifically, we compare CPUs, vector machines, and domain-specialized accelerators with kernel-level benchmarks and end-to-end representative robotic workloads. Our exploration provides a quantitative performance, area, and utilization comparison and analyzes the trade-offs between these representative distinct architectural designs. We demonstrate that the variation of hardware architecture choices depends on workload characteristics and application requirements. Finally, we explore how architectural modifications and software ecosystem optimization can alleviate bottlenecks and enhance utilization.</description>

      <title>When to Trust Your Data: Enhancing Dyna-Style Model-Based Reinforcement Learning With Data Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms can be divided into two classes: model-free algorithms, which are sample-inefficient, and model-based algorithms, which suffer from model bias. Dyna-style algorithms combine these two approaches by using simulated data from an estimated environmental model to accelerate model-free training. However, their efficiency is compromised when the estimated model is inaccurate. Previous works address this issue by using model ensembles or pretraining the estimated model with data collected from the real environment, increasing computational and sample complexity. To tackle this issue, we introduce an out-of-distribution (OOD) data filter that removes simulated data from the estimated model that significantly diverges from data collected in the real environment. We show theoretically that this technique enhances the quality of simulated data. With the help of the OOD data filter, the data simulated from the estimated model better mimics the data collected by interacting with the real model. This improvement is evident in the critic updates compared to using the simulated data without the OOD data filter. Our experiment integrates the data filter into the model-based policy optimization (MBPO) algorithm. The results demonstrate that our method requires fewer interactions with the real environment to achieve a higher level of optimality than MBPO, even without a model ensemble.</description>

      <title>Towards Large Scale Atomic Manufacturing: Heterodyne Grating Interferometer with Zero Dead-Zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel heterodyne grating interferometer designed to meet the precise measurement requirements of next-generation lithography systems and large-scale atomic-level manufacturing. Utilizing a dual-frequency light source, the interferometer enables simultaneous measurement of three degrees of freedom. Key advancements include a compact zero Dead-Zone optical path configuration, significantly enhancing measurement reliability by mitigating the impact of light source fluctuations and air refractive index variations. A comprehensive crosstalk error analysis was conducted, resulting in a robust correction algorithm that reduces errors to below 5%. Performance testing of the prototype, size of 90mm*90mm*40mm, demonstrated exceptional resolution (0.25 nm in the XY-axis and 0.3 nm in the Z-axis), superior linearity (6.9e-5, 8.1e-5 and 16.2e-5 for the X, Y, and Z axes, respectively), high repeatability (0.8 nm/1000 nm for the three axes) and stability (20 nm for the XY-axis and 60 nm for the Z-axis over 1000 seconds). Comparative analysis with existing measurement sensors highlights the proposed method's significant advantages in integration, multidimensional capabilities, and is expected to be widely used in fields such as integrated circuits, atomic-level manufacturing and aerospace technology.</description>

      <title>Vehicle Localization in GPS-Denied Scenarios Using Arc-Length-Based Map Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated driving systems face challenges in GPS-denied situations. To address this issue, kinematic dead reckoning is implemented using measurements from the steering angle, steering rate, yaw rate, and wheel speed sensors onboard the vehicle. However, dead reckoning methods suffer from drift. This paper provides an arc-length-based map matching method that uses a digital 2D map of the scenario in order to correct drift in the dead reckoning estimate. The kinematic model's prediction is used to introduce a temporal notion to the spatial information available in the map data. Results show reliable improvement in drift for all GPS-denied scenarios tested in this study. This innovative approach ensures that automated vehicles can maintain continuous and reliable navigation, significantly enhancing their safety and operational reliability in environments where GPS signals are compromised or unavailable.</description>

      <title>Using Intermittent Chaotic Clocks to Secure Cryptographic Chips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This letter proposes using intermittent chaotic clocks, generated from chaotic maps, to drive cryptographic chips running the Advanced Encryption Standard as a countermeasure against Correlation Power Analysis attacks. Five different chaotic maps -- namely: the Logistic map, the Bernoulli shift map, the Henon map, the Tent map, and the Ikeda map -- are used in this work to generate chaotic clocks. The performance of these chaotic clocks is evaluated in terms of timing overhead and the resilience of the driven chip against Correlation Power Analysis attacks. All proposed chaotic clocking schemes successfully protect the driven chip against attacks, with the clocks produced by the optimized Ikeda, Henon, and Logistic maps achieving the lowest timing overhead. These optimized maps, due to their intermittent chaotic behavior, exhibit lower timing overhead compared to previous work. Notably, the chaotic clock generated by the optimized Ikeda map approaches the theoretical limit of timing overhead, i.e., half the execution time of a reference periodic clock.</description>

      <title>AI-Aided Kalman Filters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kalman filter (KF) and its variants are among the most celebrated algorithms in signal processing. These methods are used for state estimation of dynamic systems by relying on mathematical representations in the form of simple state-space (SS) models, which may be crude and inaccurate descriptions of the underlying dynamics. Emerging data-centric artificial intelligence (AI) techniques tackle these tasks using deep neural networks (DNNs), which are model-agnostic. Recent developments illustrate the possibility of fusing DNNs with classic Kalman-type filtering, obtaining systems that learn to track in partially known dynamics. This article provides a tutorial-style overview of design approaches for incorporating AI in aiding KF-type algorithms. We review both generic and dedicated DNN architectures suitable for state estimation, and provide a systematic presentation of techniques for fusing AI tools with KFs and for leveraging partial SS modeling and data, categorizing design approaches into task-oriented and SS model-oriented. The usefulness of each approach in preserving the individual strengths of model-based KFs and data-driven DNNs is investigated in a qualitative and quantitative study, whose code is publicly available, illustrating the gains of hybrid model-based/data-driven designs. We also discuss existing challenges and future research directions that arise from fusing AI and Kalman-type algorithms.</description>

      <title>GAN Based Top-Down View Synthesis in Reinforcement Learning Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human actions are based on the mental perception of the environment. Even when all the aspects of an environment are not visible, humans have an internal mental model that can generalize the partially visible scenes to fully constructed and connected views. This internal mental model uses learned abstract representations of spatial and temporal aspects of the environments encountered in the past.
  Artificial agents in reinforcement learning environments also benefit by learning a representation of the environment from experience. It provides the agent with viewpoints that are not directly visible to it, helping it make better policy decisions. It can also be used to predict the future state of the environment.
  This project explores learning the top-down view of an RL environment based on the artificial agent's first-person view observations with a generative adversarial network(GAN). The top-down view is useful as it provides a complete overview of the environment by building a map of the entire environment. It provides information about the objects' dimensions and shapes along with their relative positions with one another. Initially, when only a partial observation of the environment is visible to the agent, only a partial top-down view is generated. As the agent explores the environment through a set of actions, the generated top-down view becomes complete. This generated top-down view can assist the agent in deducing better policy decisions. The focus of the project is to learn the top-down view of an RL environment. It doesn't deal with any Reinforcement Learning task.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates distributed zeroth-order feedback optimization in multi-agent systems with coupled constraints, where each agent operates its local action vector and observes only zeroth-order information to minimize a global cost function subject to constraints in which the local actions are coupled. Specifically, we employ two-point zeroth-order gradient estimation with delayed information to construct stochastic gradients, and leverage the constraint extrapolation technique and the averaging consensus framework to effectively handle the coupled constraints. We also provide convergence rate and oracle complexity results for our algorithm, characterizing its computational efficiency and scalability by rigorous theoretical analysis. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the algorithm's effectiveness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.06608v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continuous higher order sliding mode (CHOSM) controllers represent an efficient tool for disturbance rejection. For the systems with relative degree r, CHOSM approaches provide theoretically exact compensation of the matched Lipschitz perturbation, ensuring the finite-time convergence to the (r+1)-th sliding-mode set, by using only information on the sliding output and its derivatives up to the order (r-1). In this paper, we investigate the disturbance rejection properties of a PID-like CHOSM controller, as the simplest and intuitively clear example which incorporates nonlinear actions on the output error, its derivative, and integration of its sign. We use the harmonic balance approach and develop an analysis of propagation of the matched Lipschitz perturbation through the control loop in frequency domain. The resulted solution appears in form of the Bode-like loci which depend also on the amplitude of harmonic disturbances. Such amplitude-frequency characteristics allow certain comparability with standard disturbance sensitivity functions of a linear PID-controlled system in frequency domain. Also a simple and straightforward design procedure for the robust linear PID controller targeting the second-order system plants under investigation is provided for benchmarking. Additional (parasitic) actuator dynamics, which can lead to self-induced steady oscillations, i.e. chattering, is ditto respected. A detailed experimental case study, accomplished on an electro-mechanical actuator in the laboratory setting, highlight and make the pros and cons of both PID and CHOSM controllers well comparable for a broadband disturbance rejection.</description>

      <title>A game-theoretic, market-based approach to extract flexibility from distributed energy resources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a market designed using game theory to optimally utilize the flexibility of distributed energy resources (DERs) like solar, batteries, electric vehicles, and flexible loads. Market agents perform multiperiod optimization to determine their feasible flexibility limits for power injections while satisfying all constraints of their DERs. This is followed by a Stackelberg game between the market operator and agents. The market operator as the leader aims to regulate the aggregate power injection around a desired value by leveraging the flexibility of their agents, and computes optimal prices for both electricity and flexibility services. The agents follow by optimally bidding their desired flexible power injections in response to these prices. We show the existence and uniqueness of a Nash equilibrium among all the agents and a Stackelberg equilibrium between all agents and the operator. In addition to deriving analytical closed-form solutions, we provide simulation results for a small example system to illustrate our approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cost-effective decarbonisation of the built environment is a stepping stone to achieving net-zero carbon emissions since buildings are globally responsible for more than a quarter of global energy-related CO$_2$ emissions. Improving energy utilization and decreasing costs naturally requires considering multiple domain-specific performance criteria. The resulting problem is often computationally infeasible. The paper proposes an approach based on decomposition and selection of significant operating conditions to achieve a formulation with reduced computational complexity. We present a robust framework to optimise the physical design, the controller, and the operation of residential buildings in an integrated fashion, considering external weather conditions and time-varying electricity prices. The framework explicitly includes operational constraints and increases the utilization of the energy generated by intermittent resources. A case study illustrates the potential of co-design in enhancing the reliability, flexibility and self-sufficiency of a system operating under different conditions. Specifically, numerical results demonstrate reductions in costs up to $30$% compared to a deterministic formulation. Furthermore, the proposed approach achieves a computational time reduction of at least $10$ times lower compared to the original problem with a deterioration in the performance of only 0.6%.</description>

      <title>Attitude Estimation via Matrix Fisher Distributions on SO(3) Using Non-Unit Vector Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This note presents a novel Bayesian attitude estimator with the matrix Fisher distribution on the special orthogonal group, which can smoothly accommodate both unit and non-unit vector measurements. The posterior attitude distribution is proven to be a matrix Fisher distribution with the assumption that non-unit vector measurement errors follow the isotropic Gaussian distributions and unit vector measurements follow the von-Mises Fisher distributions. Next, a global unscented transformation is proposed to approximate the full likelihood distribution with a matrix Fisher distribution for more generic cases of vector measurement errors following the non-isotropic Gaussian distributions. Following these, a Bayesian attitude estimator with the matrix Fisher distribution is constructed. Numerical examples are then presented. The proposed estimator exhibits advantageous performance compared with the previous attitude estimator with matrix Fisher distributions and the classic multiplicative extended Kalman filter in the case of non-unit vector measurements.</description>

      <title>Battlefield Transfers in Coalitional Blotto Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.02068v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In competitive resource allocation environments, agents often choose to form alliances; however, for some agents, doing so may not always be beneficial. Is there a method of forming alliances that always reward each of their members? We study this question using the framework of the coalitional Blotto game, in which two players compete against a common adversary by allocating their budgeted resources across disjoint sets of valued battlefields. On any given battlefield, the agent that allocates a greater amount of resources wins the corresponding battlefield value. Existing work has shown the surprising result that in certain game instances, if one player donates a portion of their budget to the other player, then both players win larger amounts in their separate competitions against the adversary. However, this transfer-based method of alliance formation is not always mutually beneficial, which motivates the search for alternate strategies. In this vein, we study a new method of alliance formation referred to as a joint transfer, whereby players publicly transfer battlefields and budgets between one another before they engage in their separate competitions against the adversary. We show that in almost all game instances, there exists a mutually beneficial joint transfer that strictly increases the payoff of each player.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear integral extension of PID control with improved convergence of perturbed second-order dynamic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear extension of the integral part of a standard proportional-integral-derivative (PID) feedback control is proposed for the perturbed second-order systems. For the matched constant perturbations, the global asymptotic stability is shown, while for Lipschitz perturbations an ultimately bounded output error is guaranteed. It is shown that the proposed control is also applicable to second-order systems extended by additional (parasitic) actuator dynamics with low-pass characteristics, thus representing a frequently encountered application case. The proposed nonlinear control is proven to outperform its linear PID counterpart during the settling phase, i.e. at convergence of the residual output error. An experimental case study of the second-order system with an additional actuator dynamics and considerable perturbations is demonstrated to confirm and benchmark the control performance.</description>

      <title>CoViS-Net: A Cooperative Visual Spatial Foundation Model for Multi-Robot Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01107v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous robot operation in unstructured environments is often underpinned by spatial understanding through vision. Systems composed of multiple concurrently operating robots additionally require access to frequent, accurate and reliable pose estimates. In this work, we propose CoViS-Net, a decentralized visual spatial foundation model that learns spatial priors from data, enabling pose estimation as well as spatial comprehension. Our model is fully decentralized, platform-agnostic, executable in real-time using onboard compute, and does not require existing networking infrastructure. CoViS-Net provides relative pose estimates and a local bird's-eye-view (BEV) representation, even without camera overlap between robots (in contrast to classical methods). We demonstrate its use in a multi-robot formation control task across various real-world settings. We provide code, models and supplementary material online. https://proroklab.github.io/CoViS-Net/</description>

      <title>Vision-Based Adaptive Robotics for Autonomous Surface Crack Repair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Surface cracks in infrastructure can lead to significant deterioration and costly maintenance if not efficiently repaired. Manual repair methods are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and imprecise and thus difficult to scale to large areas. While advancements in robotic perception and manipulation have progressed autonomous crack repair, existing methods still face three key challenges: accurate localization of cracks within the robot's coordinate frame, (ii) adaptability to varying crack depths and widths, and (iii) validation of the repair process under realistic conditions. This paper presents an adaptive, autonomous system for surface crack detection and repair using robotics with advanced sensing technologies to enhance precision and safety for humans. The system uses an RGB-D camera for crack detection, a laser scanner for precise measurement, and an extruder and pump for material deposition. To address one of the key challenges, the laser scanner is used to enhance the crack coordinates for accurate localization. Furthermore, our approach demonstrates that an adaptive crack-filling method is more efficient and effective than a fixed-speed approach, with experimental results confirming both precision and consistency. In addition, to ensure real-world applicability and testing repeatability, we introduce a novel validation procedure using 3D-printed crack specimens that accurately simulate real-world conditions. This research contributes to the evolving field of human-robot interaction in construction by demonstrating how adaptive robotic systems can reduce the need for manual labor, improve safety, and enhance the efficiency of maintenance operations, ultimately paving the way for more sophisticated and integrated construction robotics.</description>

      <title>Learning Optimal Stable Matches in Decentralized Markets with Unknown Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04669v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Matching algorithms have demonstrated great success in several practical applications, but they often require centralized coordination and plentiful information. In many modern online marketplaces, agents must independently seek out and match with another using little to no information. For these kinds of settings, can we design decentralized, limited-information matching algorithms that preserve the desirable properties of standard centralized techniques? In this work, we constructively answer this question in the affirmative. We model a two-sided matching market as a game consisting of two disjoint sets of agents, referred to as proposers and acceptors, each of whom seeks to match with their most preferable partner on the opposite side of the market. However, each proposer has no knowledge of their own preferences, so they must learn their preferences while forming matches in the market. We present a simple online learning rule that guarantees a strong notion of probabilistic convergence to the welfare-maximizing equilibrium of the game, referred to as the proposer-optimal stable match. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first completely decoupled, communication-free algorithm that guarantees probabilistic convergence to an optimal stable match, irrespective of the structure of the matching market.</description>
