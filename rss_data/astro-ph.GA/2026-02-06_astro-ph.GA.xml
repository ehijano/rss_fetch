      <title>How Do Disk Galaxies Form?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In both observed and simulated galaxies, disk morphologies become more prevalent at higher masses and lower redshifts. To elucidate the physical origin of this trend, we develop a simple analytical model in which galaxy morphology is governed by the competition between rotational support and turbulence in a gravitational potential of a dark matter halo and the galaxy itself, and a disk forms when the potential steepens due to the accumulation of baryons in the halo center. The minimum galaxy mass required for this transition decreases with an increasing dark matter contribution within the galaxy, making more concentrated halos more prone to forming disks. Our model predicts that galaxy sizes behave qualitatively differently before and after disk formation: after disks form, sizes are governed by the halo spin, in agreement with classical models, whereas before disk formation, sizes are larger and set by the scale on which turbulent motions, which dominate over rotation, can be contained. We validate our model against the results of the TNG50 cosmological simulation and, despite the simplicity of the model, find remarkable agreement. In particular, our model explains the increase with redshift in the critical halo mass for disk formation, reported in both simulations and observations, as a consequence of the evolution of the halo mass-concentration and baryonic mass-halo mass relations. This redshift trend therefore supports the recent proposal that it is the steepening of the gravitational potential that causes disk formation, while other effects discussed in the literature, such as potential deepening and hot gaseous halo formation, can still play important roles in the transition from early turbulent to dynamically cold disks.</description>

      <title>The GMRT archive atomic gas survey -- III. Comparative Study of Dark Matter Halos in Nearby Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distribution of dark matter in the inner regions of galaxies poses a key challenge for small-scale {\Lambda}CDM cosmology. While cold dark matter simulations predict cuspy inner density profiles, observations of low surface brightness (LSB) and dwarf galaxies often favour cored profiles, an issue known as the cusp-core problem. We investigate this problem by comparing four dark matter halo profiles: NFW (cuspy), Einasto (intermediate), Burkert (cored), and pseudo-isothermal (pISO) (cored) in a pilot sample of $11$ galaxies from the GMRT archive atomic gas survey (GARCIA). We have performed mass modelling using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques, utilising rotation curves derived from robust 3D Kinematic modelling. Baryonic contributions from stars derived using stellar kinematics based on $3.6\mu\mathrm{m}$ or $r$-band photometry via Multi-Gaussian Expansion (MGE) combined with Jeans Anisotropic Model (JAM) and from gas, calculated directly from the gas surface density (HI + He) without assuming any predefined functional form, are included. Our mass modelling shows that all halo profiles provide statistically good fits, yielding consistent estimates of halo mass and stellar mass-to-light ratio. To validate our analysis, we examine the stellar-to-halo mass relation and find broad agreement with empirical models. Non-parametric density profiles derived from baryon-subtracted rotation curves show that NFW fits the inner regions best, while all profiles converge in the outskirts. Future studies with a larger sample from GARCIA will be helpful in refining this trend and addressing the cusp-core issue in greater depth.</description>

      <title>Wiggling Through the ICM: Multi-Resolution Radio Imaging of a Tailed Radio Galaxy in MACS J1354.6+7715</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tailed radio galaxies are powerful tracers of interactions between active galactic nuclei (AGN) and the intracluster medium (ICM), providing unique insights into cluster dynamics. We present LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) 144 MHz and uGMRT 400 MHz observations of the cluster MACS J1354.6+7715 (z = 0.3967) to investigate the radio emission associated with its member galaxies and the cluster environment. The dominant tailed radio galaxy in the cluster exhibits a sharply bent tail extending over approximately 300 kpc, with the spectral index steepening from approximately -0.46 +/- 0.21 near the AGN core to approximately -2.43 +/- 0.30 in the outermost regions. Synchrotron modelling of the tail yields a radiative age of 150 +/- 10 Myr, implying a galaxy velocity of 1956 +/- 130 km s^-1, which is of order ~ 0.9 times the escape velocity. We find no evidence of relics or halos in our radio images, and the X-ray morphology from Chandra appears relatively undisturbed, suggesting that the system is a pre-merging candidate. Our results indicate that the radio galaxy is undergoing its first infall into the cluster, providing an excellent laboratory for studying the impact of the ICM on AGN activity and galaxy evolution, and demonstrating how multi-frequency radio observations of tailed galaxies can uniquely probe both AGN lifecycles and the early stages of cluster assembly.</description>

      <title>Abundant hydrocarbons in a buried galactic nucleus with signs of carbonaceous grain and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrocarbons play a key role in shaping the chemistry of the interstellar medium (ISM), but their enrichment and relationship with carbonaceous grains and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) still lack clear observational constraints. We report JWST NIRSpec+MIRI/MRS infrared (IR; 3-28 micron) observations of the local ultra-luminous IR galaxy (ULIRG) IRAS 07251-0248, revealing the extragalactic detection of small gas-phase hydrocarbons such as benzene (C$_6$H$_6$), triacetylene (C$_6$H$_2$), diacetylene (C$_4$H$_2$), acetylene (C$_2$H$_2$), methane (CH$_4$), and methyl radical (CH$_3$) as well as deep amorphous C-H absorptions in the solid phase. The unexpectedly high abundance of these molecules indicates an extremely rich hydrocarbon chemistry, not explained by high-temperature gas-phase chemistry, ice desorption or oxygen depletion. Instead, the most plausible explanation is the erosion and fragmentation of carbonaceous grains and PAHs. This scenario is supported by the correlation between the abundance of one of their main fragmentation products, C$_2$H$_2$, and cosmic ray (CR) ionization rate for a sample of local ULIRGs. These hydrocarbons are outflowing at $\sim$160 km/s, which may represent a potential formation pathway for hydrogenated amorphous grains. Our results suggest that IRAS 07251-0248 might not be unique but represents an extreme example of the commonly rich hydrocarbon chemistry prevalent in deeply obscured galactic nuclei.</description>

      <title>Multi-spin stellar velocity maps of the most massive galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (Abridged) We present stellar kinematics of the MUSE Most Massive Galaxies (M3G) Survey, comprising 25 galaxies brighter than -25.7 mag in the Ks-band and stellar mass above ~6x10^11 Msun. Galaxies are divided between the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) and lower-ranked (in brightness) galaxies (non-BCGs) in three rich galaxy clusters within the core of the Shapley super cluster. We find several velocity maps with rich kinematic structure, including multiple spin reversals within the region encompassing central two effective radii, typically associated with BCGs. The majority of BCGs show rotation around the major-axis, at least in one of the visible velocity components. These kinematic structures are possible only if galaxies have non-axisymmetric shapes and contain several orbital families with both prograde and retrograde rotations. There are six fast rotators in the M3G sample, all among non-BCGs, and typically ranked below the 3rd brightest galaxy. Based on the properties of the h3 Gauss-Hermite moment, fast rotation can be linked to the dominance of prograde rotating short-axis tubes in the orbital distribution. Slow rotators are BCGs or the second and sometimes third brightest galaxies, indicating that the galaxy mass (brightness) is not the only driver of low spin, but that the location within the local environment also plays a role. Slow rotators, as evidenced from their multi-spin velocity maps, require more complex orbital structures. Furthermore, some BCGs show kinematic evidence for a secondary component at larger radii, likely not in equilibrium with the main galaxy and possibly made of stars accreted from other cluster galaxies. Multi-spin velocity maps, low angular momentum and additional kinematic components highlight the difference in the evolutionary histories of BCGs (including 2nd ranked galaxies) and non-BCGs.</description>

      <title>Clustering of z~6.6 Quasars and [O III] Emitters Constrains Host Halo Masses and Duty Cycles in 25 ASPIRE Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use data from the JWST ASPIRE Wide Field Slitless Spectroscopy (WFSS) program to measure the auto-correlation function of [O,{\sc iii}] emitters at 5.3$&lt;z&lt;$7.0 and the quasar--[O,{\sc iii}] emitter cross-correlation around 25 ASPIRE quasars (6.51$&lt;z&lt;$6.82; $\langle z\rangle=6.6$). We use synthetic source injection to calibrate the selection function, which we combine with the large-volume FLAMINGO-10k simulation (2.8,cGpc box) to construct realistic mock observations. Our simulation-based approach captures nonlinear structure growth and scale-dependent bias on small scales and derives covariance matrices that include cosmic variance. The clustering yields correlation lengths of $r_0^{\rm GG}=4.7^{+0.4}{-0.5},h^{-1}$,cMpc for the [O,{\sc iii}] auto-correlation with fixed slope $\gamma{\rm GG}=1.8$, and $r_0^{\rm QG}=8.7^{+0.8}{-0.9},h^{-1}$,cMpc for the quasar--[O,{\sc iii}] cross-correlation with $\gamma{\rm QG}=2.0$. We infer $\log(M_{h,{\rm min}}^{[{\rm O,III}]}/M_\odot)=10.5^{+0.1}{-0.1}$ for [O,{\sc iii}] emitters and $\log(M{h,{\rm min}}^{\rm QSO}/M_\odot)=12.1^{+0.3}{-0.4}$ for quasars. These imply duty cycles of $2.5^{+1.0}{-0.8}$,per,cent for [O,{\sc iii}] emitters and $0.3^{+4.0}{-0.3}$,per,cent for quasars, corresponding to UV-bright lifetimes of $t{\rm Q}=2.6^{+30}_{-2.5}$,Myr (less than 10,per,cent of a Salpeter $e$-folding time). The results indicate that the observed UV-luminous phase contributes little to total SMBH growth, placing tight constraints on early black-hole formation.</description>

      <title>ASPIRE: The Environments and Dark Matter Halos of Luminous Quasars in the Epoch of Reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of the environments of 25 luminous quasars at $z &gt; 6.5$ from the ASPIRE program. Using JWST/NIRCam WFSS data, we identified 487 galaxies at $5.3 \lesssim z \lesssim 7.0$ exhibiting [OIII] emission. Among these, 122 [OIII] emitters lie within $|\Delta v_{\rm los}| &lt; 1000~{\rm km~s^{-1}}$ of the quasars, corresponding to a $\sim9.4$-fold enhancement relative to the average galaxy density at other redshifts. Furthermore, we identified 16 [CII]-emitting galaxies at the quasar redshifts from ALMA mosaic observations. A cross-correlation function (CCF) analysis between quasars and [OIII]+[CII] emitters yields a cross-correlation length of $r_0^{\rm QG} = 8.68^{+0.51}_{-0.55}~h^{-1}~\mathrm{cMpc}$ and a auto-correlation of $r_0^{\rm{QQ}}=15.76^{+2.48}_{-2.70}~h^{-1}~{\rm cMpc}$, indicating that $z \sim 7$ quasars reside in dark matter halos with $M_{\rm halo} = 10^{12.27^{+0.21}_{-0.26}}~M_\odot$. Notably, the number of [OIII]-emitting galaxies at quasar redshifts varies significantly from field to field, ranging from zero to twenty, highlighting a diverse quasar environment. Remarkably, seven quasars trace significant galaxy overdensities (i.e., protoclusters), with $\delta_{\rm gal} &gt; 5$ within a volume of $V \sim 500~{\rm cMpc^3}$. We also find that $|\Delta v_{\rm los}|$ increases rapidly toward smaller galaxy-quasar separations in protocluster fields, consistent with galaxy kinematics around extremely massive halos in cosmological simulations. By combining JWST and ALMA data, we reveal the complex and diverse environments of these early quasars, providing robust evidence that the earliest luminous quasars are effective tracers of galaxy overdensities, albeit with substantial field-to-field variation.</description>

      <title>The CON-quasar stage of IRAS 07251-0248 E</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ALMA continuum measurements of the local ULIRG IRAS 07251-0248 E at 667$\mu$m reveal an extremely compact (R &lt; 27 pc) and bright ($T_B$ &gt;200 K) nucleus with an absorbing foreground envelope and a surrounding (R ~ 75 pc) disk or torus seen nearly face-on. The bright and unresolved nuclear emission implies large optical depths ($\tau_{667\mu m}$ &gt;0.5, corresponding to $N_H &gt; 10^{25}$ cm^-2) of hot dust at &gt;500 K. In addition, JWST observations of the source show strong mid-infrared (mid-IR) absorption in the ro-vibrational bands of H2O nu_2=1-0 (5-7 $\mu$m) and of other species including CO, HCN, C2H2, CH4, and CO2, and Herschel/PACS observations exhibit strong and saturated absorption due to OH, H2O, CH^+, and CH. We propose a model in which the unresolved ALMA submillimeter and JWST mid-IR continua trace the same nuclear source, the former penetrating deep into the nucleus and the latter probing the nuclear photosphere. The continuum model, which includes trapping of photons (the "greenhouse" effect), indicates that the nuclear ($R_h$ ~ 13 pc) luminosity and luminosity surface density are ~10$^{12}$ Lsun and $\Sigma_{bol}$~ 5e8 Lsun pc^-2, arising from an active galactic nucleus (AGN) so buried that high-ionization lines are completely obscured. The observed mid-IR gas-phase molecular bands probe outflowing gas with velocities of ~160 km s^-1 and are reproduced with the predicted $T_{dust}$ profile, while the far-IR molecular absorption lines are generated in the surrounding thick disk or torus with $\tau_{100 \mu m}$~10. We conclude that IRAS 07251-0248 harbors a compact obscured nucleus (CON) that hides an AGN currently emitting at quasar luminosity. While the observed outflow could be driven by radiation pressure, we favor the scenario of a (partially) energy-conserving hot bubble caught in a very early phase of the expulsion of the highly concentrated gas at the galactic nucleus.</description>

      <title>Modeling the recent interactions between the Magellanic Clouds and Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC, respectively) are the largest satellite galaxies of the Milky Way (MW) and their interactions with each other have given rise to multiple stellar substructures in their periphery as well as the gaseous Magellanic Stream. To better understand the origin of the stellar substructures and constrain their past orbit, we model the past 2.5 Gyr of the interactions between the MW and the LMC and SMC using N-body simulations. Due to the strong interactions, analytical orbit integrations are insufficient to analyze the past galaxy orbits accurately. Therefore, we use a genetic algorithm in combination with N-body simulations to determine the LMC and SMC initial positions and velocities 2.5 Gyr ago that result in the Magellanic Clouds (MCs) arriving near their observed locations and velocities at the current time. After running ~8,000 simulations, our best matching model includes two close interactions between the MCs (940 Myr and 140 Myr ago) and reproduces some observed features of the MCs, including the LMC disc warp, a ring-shaped overdensity in the LMC, the tidal expansion of the SMC, and a greater distance dispersion on the eastern side of the SMC. The LMC disc warp is caused by the most recent interaction with the SMC, which occurred ~140 Myr before the present. The interaction causes global ripples in the LMC disc with a mean amplitude of 1.3 kpc.</description>

      <title>Shocks, Winds, and a Torus: The Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer (LBTI) Resolves the Active Nucleus of NGC 4151</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present mid-infrared (MIR) observations of the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 4151 using the Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer (LBTI). We took open-loop Fizeau images with 66-104 mas (5.8-9.1 pc) resolution in the N-band (at $8.7$ and $10.5~\mu m$), using the full resolution of the LBTI -- equivalent to that of a 28.8 m telescope. These images were complemented by AO imaging in the LM-bands ($3.7$ and $4.8~\mu m$), with 50-62 mas (4.4-5.4 pc) resolution. These images bridge the scales between previous Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI)/MIDI and VLT/VISIR data, delivering ELT-like imaging resolution in the N-band. We resolve a dusty torus, (diameter 32 pc, PA$=125^{\circ}$), and detect dusty clouds within the narrow line region. Matching the resolution across four bands, we measured spatially-resolved SEDs of the central $\sim 100$ pc. Modified blackbody fitting revealed dust temperature and extinction profiles, indicating both heating from the accretion disk and additional shock heating due to the radio jet. The spatial coincidence of ionized emission (e.g., [Fe II] and [O III]), extended MIR structures, and radio features further supports the interpretation of shock heating. Comparison with NGC 1068 tests the Unified Model of Active Galactic Nuclei (Unified Model of AGN): Structures are similar, despite differences in orientation and Eddington ratio. NGC 4151's torus is smaller than NGC 1068's following a $r\propto L^{0.5}$ scaling. These thirty-meter-telescope class observations of NGC 4151 and NGC 1068 highlight the need to revise MIR radiative transfer models of AGN to account for jet-related heating.</description>

      <title>Growth of High-Redshift Quasars from Fermion Dark Matter Seeds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasars hosting $\gtrsim 10^{9}\,M_\odot$ black holes at $z&gt;6$ challenge growth scenarios that start from light seeds and assume accretion within already formed galaxies. Motivated by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) discovery of Little Red Dots (LRDs), which suggests that $\sim 10^{6}\,M_\odot$ black holes can be active in compact, pre-galactic environments, we revisit early black hole growth with a minimal cosmology-based framework. We model the accretion history as the smaller of the Bondi inflow rate and the Eddington-limited rate, where the Bondi rate is set by the supply of overdense primordial gas whose density declines with cosmic expansion, and the Eddington rate captures regulation by radiative feedback. By fitting the observed masses and luminosities of J0313--1806 ($z=7.64$) and J0100+2802 ($z=6.30$) with Bayesian inference, we infer initial conditions that favor massive seed black holes with initial mass $M_0 \sim 10^{6}\,M_\odot$, formed at $z\sim20{-}30$ in environments with baryonic overdensity factors $f_\rho \gtrsim 50$ relative to the cosmic mean. The resulting growth histories include a prolonged supply-limited stage, and they reproduce the observed quasar masses without requiring sustained Eddington accretion or any super-Eddington episodes. The inferred seed mass scale is consistent with black holes produced by the collapse of quantum-degenerate fermion dark matter cores, providing a physically defined pathway to massive seeds at the redshifts implied by LRD phenomenology.</description>

      <title>IFU Spectroscopic Study of the Planetary Nebula Abell 30: Mapping the Ionisation and Kinematic Structure of the Inner Complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents integrated flux and velocity channel maps of the planetary nebula Abell 30 (A30) inner knot system. The observations were taken with the INTEGRAL spectrograph at the William Herschel Telescope (WHT). Our IFU data cube partially covers knots J1, J2, and completely covers knots J3, J4 in the system. Optical Recombination Lines of C II, He I, He II, N III, O II and Collisionally Excited Lines of [Ar IV], [Ar V], [N II], [Ne III], [Ne IV], and [O III] were detected. Our integrated flux maps visualise the ionisation structure and the chemical inhomogeneity in the system previously reported by other groups. We find that ORLs are concentrated in the polar region (J1, J3), whereas the equatorial knots (J2, J4) are dominated by CELs. The flux ratio map of the diagnostic [O III] lambda 5007/4363 Angstrom lines reveals the electron temperature distribution, which shows cold cores of 15,000 K in knots J3 and J4 surrounded by a hot outer layer of above 20,000 K. Our channel maps show positive and negative velocity excursions from the systemic value among the ions. Several ions show variation in their velocity structures from their lower-energy-level counterparts, including [Ar IV] and [Ar V], [Ne III] and [Ne IV], and He I and He II. New recurrent velocity structures are identified in the low-density regions where the ions move much faster compared to their surrounding environments. The velocity dispersion measurements highlight extreme turbulence in some of the ions (sigma_vrad approx 140 km/s), consistent with supersonic/hypersonic motion driven by shocks. The forbidden line species [N II] exhibits lower turbulence (sigma_vrad approx 50-60 km/s), tracing denser, less-turbulent gases. Based on our data, we conclude both the ionisation and kinematic studies hint at shock heating and multiple ejection history in the evolutionary pathway of A30.</description>

      <title>Galactic seismology: can a disc-crossing impulse explain the large-scale perturbations in the Milky Way's disc?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prior to its infall, the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf galaxy was a major satellite with a mass of $M_{\rm sgr}\sim 10^{11}$ M$_\odot$. For the past $5-6~\mathrm{Gyr}$ , it has been heavily stripped by the Milky Way (MW), losing most of its mass while crossing the MW disc multiple times. Recent models of Milky Way disc perturbations $-$ including the spiral arms, the stellar bar, the Gaia phase spiral, and stellar and gaseous disc corrugations $-$ have identified these crossings as possible formation triggers, but have generally treated each perturbation in isolation. Here, we adopt a holistic perspective and ask whether a single disc-crossing impulse can simultaneously account for these features as observed today. We focus on simulations of single disc-crossing events by a Sgr-like perturber, and present a forensic analysis of the role of the powerful impulse in forming spiral arms, disc corrugations, the phase spiral and the `$L_{z}-\bar{V}_{R}$ wave', determined from a star's angular momentum and radial velocity, respectively. We find that a single disc crossing can reproduce reasonably well (e.g. structure, amplitude, phase) the observed local disc corrugation, and the Outer, Local and Sagittarius-Carina arm segments, implying that the last significant impulse due to a transit took place $700-1200~\mathrm{Myr}$ ago. Moreover, the $L_{z}-\bar{V}_{R}$ wave and phase spiral appear within the simulations over the same epoch and their general structure is reasonably well replicated, but not in detail. We conclude that Sgr's last significant crossing roughly a Gyr ago could be the primary cause of large-scale MW disc perturbations, but it cannot fully account for the $L_{z}-\bar{V}_{R}$ wave. Consequently, other triggers, possibly the Galactic bar or interactions with other satellites, must be considered in order to fully explain the current dynamical state of the MW's disc.</description>

      <title>B-field Orion Protostellar Survey (BOPS). IV: The Relative Orientation Between Magnetic Fields and Density Structures in Young Protostellar Envelopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the relative alignment between density structures and magnetic fields in eight young protostars from the ALMA B-field Orion Protostellar Survey. Column density maps are derived from 870 $\mu$m dust continuum emission, and the Histogram of Relative Orientations (HRO) method is applied to quantify the correlation between magnetic field orientations and density structures on envelope scales ($\sim$10$^{3}$~au). We find that the relative alignment shows overall weak evidence of systematic evolution with column density, suggesting that column density alone does not fully determine the alignment. The magnetization level also plays a crucial role, with weakly magnetized envelopes exhibiting predominantly parallel or random alignment, whereas strongly magnetized ones show perpendicular configurations even at moderate densities. These results reveal that density and magnetization jointly shape the morphology of protostellar envelopes and the coupling between gravity and magnetic fields during early stages of star formation.</description>

      <title>The sub-arcsecond ILT view of the Bo\"{o}tes Deep Field: A link between low-frequency kiloparsec radio morphology and AGN driven ionised outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) outflows can regulate host galaxy evolution via AGN feedback. Ionised gas outflows have been linked to enhanced radio emission. In the first paper of this series, AGN detected with the International LOFAR Telescope (ILT) at 6" were more likely to host an [O III] 5007 outflow than AGN not detected, although only high-powered jets were ruled out as the origin of radio emission. New wide-field, sub-arcsecond resolution imaging at 144 MHz with the ILT now enables a resolved morphological study of this sample. We present the first wide-field, sub-arcsecond images of the Bo\"otes Deep Field at 144 MHz, detecting 4074 sources in the $\sim$0.3" image with a central sensitivity of 33.8 uJy $\mathrm{beam^{-1}}$. For 47 AGN matched in AGN luminosity, we probe radio emission on kiloparsec-scales to investigate correlations with [O III] outflows. This sample spans $z&lt;0.83$, $10^{40}&lt;L_{\mathrm{[O III]}}&lt;10^{43}~\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}}$, and $10^{21}&lt;L_{\mathrm{144MHz}}&lt;10^{24.5}~\mathrm{W~Hz^{-1}}$. We find that if we detect an AGN on both large-scales (6") and small-scales (0.3"), 90$\pm$7 per cent have an [O III] outflow, compared to 63$\pm$9 per cent of sources detected on large-scales, but undetected on small-scales. Furthermore, 17$\pm$6 per cent of sources without an [O III] outflow are detected on kiloparsec-scales, compared to 51$\pm$12 per cent of sources with an [O III] outflow. This implies a connection between [O III] outflows and kiloparsec-scale radio emission, which is likely AGN-driven. In contrast, AGN without an [O III] outflow are dominated by diffuse radio emission, likely to be associated with star formation.</description>

      <title>A Chemistry-First Centered Icy Chemical Inventory of Protostellar Sources with JWST</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chemical evolution in star forming regions is driven by the interplay between gas and ice mantles. Identifying the ice compositions at the early stage of star formation thus provides constraints on the chemical processes inaccessible from gas-phase characterizations. As part of the CORINOS program, spectra from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) MIRI MRS were taken toward four Class 0 protostars: IRAS 15398-3359, Ser-emb7, L483, and B335. The spectra were processed with simultaneous fitting of a continuum and silicate absorption to produce optical depth mid-infrared spectra of the ices at 5-28 $\mu$m (360-2000 cm$^{-1}$) toward these four sources. Simple molecules such as water (H$_2$O), carbon dioxide (CO$_2$), methanol (CH$_3$OH), formic acid/formate (HCOOH/HCOO$^-$), ammonia/ammonium (NH$_3$/NH$_4$$^+$), and formaldehyde (H$_2$CO) are the most abundant features in these ices, while complex organic molecules (COMs) represent a smaller contribution. Likely COMs include hydroxylamine (NH$_2$OH), methylamine (CH$_3$NH$_2$), and ethanol (CH$_3$CH$_2$OH). Absorption features belonging to functional groups such as -CH$_3$ and -OH suggest that additional COMs are present, but these cannot be unambiguously assigned due to overlapping bands. Formation pathways toward these COMs utilizing radical-radical combination reactions based on laboratory simulation experiments is presented. By extension, COMs predicted by these reactions, but absent from the spectra, are discussed. The results provide insight into the chemical environment of these ices and also highlight the critical need for caution and sufficient evidence in order to confidently identify COMs in ice.</description>

      <title>ELFO: A Python package for emission line fitting optimization in integral field spectroscopy data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integral field spectroscopy (IFS) provides spatially resolved spectra, enabling detailed studies that address the physical and kinematic properties of the interstellar medium. A critical step in analyzing IFS data is the decomposition of emission lines, where different velocity components are often modeled with Gaussian profiles. However, conventional fitting methods that treat each spectrum independently often yield spatial discontinuities in the fitting results. Here, we present Emission Line Fitting Optimization (ELFO), a Python package for IFS spectral fitting. ELFO uses the results of neighboring spectra to determine multiple initial guesses and selects the result that exhibits spatial smoothness. We tested ELFO on IFS data of two quasars obtained from the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer, where it successfully corrected anomalous fits, revealed previously unresolved substructures, and made large-scale kinematic structures more evident. With minor modifications, this method can also be easily adapted to other IFS data and different emission lines.</description>

      <title>Mergers Drive Structural Complexity but Not Starbursts in Lyman-$\alpha$ Emitters at $3 &lt; z &lt; 4$: A JWST Spatially Resolved View</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) reveal that the merger fraction among Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) at redshifts $z &gt; 3$ is significantly higher than previously estimated. In this study, we focus on three high signal-to-noise merging LAE systems at $3 &lt; z &lt; 4$, selected from the VLT/MUSE-Deep survey in the GOODS-S field. We combine new \textit{JWST}/NIRCam broadband and medium-band imaging with archival \textit{HST}/ACS data to perform spatially resolved spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting using the \textsc{Bagpipes} software package. Our analysis reveals that two of the systems are minor mergers, while the third is a major merger. The close agreement between spatially resolved and integrated stellar mass estimates indicates that recent star formation does not significantly outshine the light from older stellar populations in these systems. Moreover, both the individual components and the systems as a whole lie on the star-forming main sequence, further supporting the conclusion that these mergers have not yet triggered substantial starburst activity. Furthermore, we detect prominent color gradients and disturbed dust distributions in these merging systems, indicating that the mergers have already induced significant internal structural perturbations. These morphological and dust-related changes may facilitate the escape of Ly$\alpha$ photons -- potentially through mechanisms such as gas redistribution or a reduced covering fraction of neutral hydrogen -- thereby playing a key role in shaping the observed properties of LAEs.</description>

      <title>XGAP with uGMRT I: Old AGN plasma in merging galaxy groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy groups are affected by outflows from central Active Galactic Nuclei due to the shallower gravitational potential compared to galaxy clusters. The group binding energy is comparable to the energy output from AGN, making it an important factor in mutual evolution. We present a multi-wavelength analysis of three dynamically active groups: SDSSTG8102, SDSSTG16393, and SDSSTG28674, which are part of the XMM-Newton Group AGN Project X-GAP sample, a statistically complete sample of 49 galaxy groups. We combine uGMRT 400 MHz observations with 144 MHz LOFAR and XMM-Newton observations to study the radio sources associated with the Brightest Group Galaxies (BGGs). The BGGs in SDSSTG8102 and SDSSTG16393 have extended radio emission with asymmetric distortions in their morphologies. SDSSTG28674 has a compact flat-spectrum radio source associated with the BGG and an extended lobe on one side, connected by a faint bridge detected with LOFAR. Integrated spectral indices of the three BGGs are $-0.96\pm0.09$ (SDSSTG8102), $-1.35\pm0.09$ (SDSSTG16393), and $-1.6\pm0.02$ (SDSSTG28674). X-ray images reveal elongated morphologies in all three groups, with SDSSTG28674 showing evidence of a binary merger, while thermodynamical maps highlight temperature variations. In SDSSTG8102, lobes are bent and displaced by IGrM flows, while SDSSTG16393 hosts steep-spectrum relic-like plasma coinciding with X-ray emission. SDSSTG28674, with its ultra-steep spectrum lobe and disturbed morphology, likely traces merger-driven activity, consistent with a remnant or revived radio phoenix. The spectral diversity across the systems reflects different stages of AGN fading governed by duty cycle, source age, and confinement by the hot IGrM.</description>

      <title>MIGHTEE/COSMOS-3D: The discovery of three spectroscopically confirmed radio-selected star-forming galaxies at z=4.9-5.6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio observations offer a dust-independent probe of star formation and active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity, but sufficiently deep data are required to access the crossover luminosity between these processes at high redshift ($z&gt;4.5$). We present three spectroscopically confirmed high-redshift radio sources (HzRSs) detected at 1.3 GHz at $z=4.9$-$5.6$, with radio luminosities spanning $L_{\rm 1.3 \, GHz}\approx2$-$5\times10^{24} \, \rm W \, Hz^{-1}$. These sources were first identified as high-redshift candidates through spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting of archival Hubble, JWST NIRCam+MIRI, and ground-based photometry, and then spectroscopically confirmed via the $\rm H\,\alpha$ emission line using wide-field slitless spectroscopy from JWST COSMOS-3D. The star formation rates (SFRs) measured from SED fitting, the $\rm H\,\alpha$ flux, and the 1.3 GHz luminosity, span $\sim100$-$1800\, M_{\odot} \, \rm yr^{-1}$, demonstrating broad agreement between these SFR tracers. We find that these three sources lie either on or $0.5$-1.0 dex above the star-forming main sequence at $z=4$-6 and have undergone a recent burst of star formation. The sources have extended rest-UV/optical morphologies with no evidence for a dominant point source component, indicating that an AGN is unlikely to dominate their rest-UV and optical emission. Two of the sources have complex, multi-component rest-frame UV/optical morphologies, suggesting that their starbursts may be triggered by merging activity. These HzRSs open up a new window towards probing radio emission powered by star formation alone at $z&gt; 4.5$, representing a remarkable opportunity to begin tracing star formation, independent of dust, in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>The JWST EXCELS survey: The ages and abundances of $3&lt;z&lt;5$ massive quiescent galaxies show that downsizing was already in place by $z\simeq4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present deep, medium-resolution $\lambda=1-5\,\mu$m JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy for 14 quiescent galaxies at $3&lt;z&lt;5$ with $\log_{10}(M_*/\mathrm{M_\odot}){\,&gt;\,}10$, obtained as part of the EXCELS survey. We perform a complete re-reduction of these data, including a custom optimal-extraction approach to combat the spectral "wiggles" that result from undersampling of the NIRSpec spatial PSF. We constrain the star-formation histories and stellar metallicities of these objects via full-spectral fitting, finding a clear stellar age vs stellar mass correlation, in which more massive galaxies assembled their stellar mass at earlier times. This confirms spectroscopically that the archaeological "downsizing" trend was already in place by $z\simeq4$. The slope of our measured relation ($\simeq1.5$ Gyr per dex in stellar mass) is consistent with literature results at $0 &lt; z &lt; 3$. We do not observe objects with $\log_{10}(M_*/\mathrm{M_\odot})\lesssim10.5$ and ages of more than a few hundred Myr at this epoch, suggesting that recently reported examples of higher-redshift quiescent galaxies at these masses are likely to soon rejuvenate. We measure relatively high stellar metallicities for the majority of our sample, consistent with similar objects at $0 &lt; z &lt; 3$. Finally, we explore evidence for $\alpha$-enhancement in six older and more luminous galaxies within our sample, finding considerable disagreements in the chemical abundances measured using different stellar population models, different fitted rest-frame wavelength ranges, star-formation history models and fitting codes. We therefore conclude that inferring detailed stellar chemical abundances for the earliest quiescent galaxies remains challenging, and higher signal-to-noise spectra are required (SNR per resolution element $&gt;100$ for $R\simeq1000$).</description>

      <title>Tracing AGN Feedback Power with Cool/Warm Outflow Densities: Predictions and Observational Implications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Winds launched at the scale of the accretion disc or dusty torus in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are thought to drive energy-conserving outflows that shape galaxy evolution. The key signature of such outflows, the presence of a hot ($T \gtrsim 10^9 \, \rm K$), shocked wind component, is hard to detect directly. Observations of AGN outflows typically probe a separate outflow phase: cool/warm gas with $T \lesssim 10^5 \, \rm K$. Here, we show that the density of cool outflowing gas scales with AGN luminosity, serving as an indirect diagnostic of the elusive hot, shocked wind. We use hydrodynamic simulations with the moving-mesh code AREPO to target the interaction between a small-scale AGN wind of speed $\approx 10^4 \, \rm km \, s^{-1}$ and galactic discs containing an idealised, clumpy interstellar medium (ISM). Through a new refinement scheme targeting rapidly-cooling, fast-moving gas, our simulations reach a resolution of $\lesssim 0.1 \, \rm pc$ in the cool, outflowing phase. We extract an ensemble of cool clouds from the AGN-driven outflows produced in our simulations, finding that their densities increase systematically with AGN wind power and AGN luminosity. Moreover, the mass distribution and internal properties of these cloudlets appear to be insensitive to the initial properties of the ISM, and shaped mainly by the dynamics of radiative, turbulent mixing layers. The increase in cool outflow density with kinetic wind power and AGN luminosity has profound implications for observational estimates of outflow rates and their scaling with AGN luminosity. Depending on the available outflow and density tracers, observationally-derived outflow rates may be overestimated by orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Water absorption confirms cool atmospheres in two little red dots</title>

Abstract: Little red dots (LRDs) are an abundant population of compact high-redshift sources with red rest-frame optical continua, discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Their red colors and power sources have been attributed either to dust reddening of standard hot accretion disks or to intrinsically cool thermal emission from dense hydrogen envelopes, in both cases surrounding accreting supermassive black holes. These scenarios predict order-of-magnitude differences in emission temperature but have lacked decisive temperature diagnostics. Here we report a prominent absorption feature at rest-frame $\sim 1.4 \, \mu\mathrm{m}$ in two out of four LRDs at $z \sim 2$ with high signal-to-noise JWST spectra, among the coolest from a large LRD sample. The feature matches the shape and wavelength of the water absorption band seen in cool stars. Atmosphere models require $T \lesssim 3000\, \mathrm{K}$ to reproduce it, confirming unambiguously the presence of a cool, dense gas component contributing $20-30\%$ to the emergent continuum. A composite model reproduces both the absorption and the rest-frame optical-to-infrared continuum shape and suggests a temperature range ($\sim2000\, \mathrm{K} - 4000 \, \mathrm{K}$) rather than a single blackbody predicted by some gas envelope models. Molecular absorption demonstrates that the red continua of some LRDs are intrinsic rather than dust-reddened, implying order-of-magnitude lower bolometric luminosities and black-hole masses, and providing a new diagnostic of the emitting gas.</description>

      <title>Tidal disruption event rates across cosmic time: forecasts for LSST, Roman, and JWST and their constraints on the supermassive black hole mass function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measuring the mass distribution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) over cosmic time remains particularly challenging for the low mass ($M_{\bullet}\lesssim10^8~M_\odot$) population at $z&gt;1$. This population is also the most sensitive to SMBH seeding and early growth models. In this work we construct a semi-empirical model for the redshift evolution of the TDE rate under multiple SMBH mass function prescriptions, and show that the observed redshift-dependent rate of TDEs is very sensitive to the SMBH mass function and its evolution with redshift. We further incorporate galaxy-scale processes that evolve with redshift -- namely, increasing galaxy nuclear stellar densities, enhanced galaxy-galaxy merger rates, dust obscuration, and a possible top-heavy IMF at early cosmic times -- and quantify their combined impact on the TDE rate. We find that including these effects generally results in a volumetric TDE rate that increases with redshift until a maximum near cosmic noon, before declining at higher redshift where SMBHs that can disrupt stars become increasingly scarce. We forecast TDE rates in the Rubin LSST and the Roman High Latitude Time Domain Survey, alongside expectations for serendipitous TDE rates in the JWST COSMOS-Web survey. Finally, we provide a methodology for using a flux-limited survey of TDEs in LSST to directly constrain the redshift evolution of the SMBH mass function.</description>

      <title>Classifying white dwarfs from multi-object spectroscopy surveys with machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With tens to hundreds of spectra of white dwarfs being taken each night from multi-object spectroscopic surveys, automated spectral classification is essential as part of efficient data processing. In this study, we design a neural network to classify the spectral type of white dwarfs using a combination of spectra from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) data release~1 and imaging from Pan-STARRS photometry. The trained network has a near 100% accuracy at identifying DA and DB white dwarf spectral types, while having an 85-95% accuracy for identifying all other primary types, including metal pollution. Distinct spectral or photometric features map into separate structures when performing a Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) dimensionality reduction. Investigating further and looking at multiple epoch spectra, we performed a separate search for objects that have strongly changing spectral signatures using UMAP, discovering 3 new inhomogeneous surface composition ('double-faced') white dwarfs in the process. We lastly show how machine learning has the potential to separate single white dwarfs from double white dwarf binary star systems in a large dataset, ideal for isolating a single star population. The results from all of these techniques show a compelling use of machine learning to boost efficiency in analysing white dwarfs observed in multi-object spectroscopy surveys, at times replacing the need for human-driven spectral classifications. This demonstrates our techniques as powerful tools for batch population analyses, finding outliers as a form of rare subclass detection, and in conducting multi-epoch spectral analyses.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Stochastic Halo Occupation Distribution with Galaxy Intrinsic Alignments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present diffHOD-IA, a fully differentiable implementation of a halo occupation distribution (HOD) model that incorporates galaxy intrinsic alignments (IA). Motivated by the diffHOD framework, we create a new implementation that extends differentiable galaxy population modeling to include orientation-dependent statistics crucial for weak gravitational lensing analyses. Our implementation combines this HOD formulation with an IA model, enabling end-to-end automatic differentiation from HOD and IA parameters through to the galaxy field. We additionally extend this framework to differentiably model two-point correlation functions, including galaxy clustering and IA statistics. We validate diffHOD-IA against the reference halotools-IA implementation using the Bolshoi-Planck simulation, demonstrating excellent agreement across both one-point and two-point statistics. We verify the accuracy of gradients computed via automatic differentiation by comparison with finite-difference estimates for both HOD and IA parameters. We present science use cases leveraging gradients in the simulations to recover the IA parameters of a galaxy field representative of the TNG300 simulation. Finally, we apply diffHOD-IA in a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo analysis and compare its performance with halotools-IA and a neural-network-based emulator, IAEmu. Unlike emulator-based approaches, diffHOD-IA provides differentiability at the catalog level, enabling integration into field-level inference pipelines and extension to arbitrary summary statistics for next-generation weak-lensing analyses. Our code is publicly available.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Galaxy Formation on Galaxy Biasing, and Implications for Primordial non-Gaussianity Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The parameter $f_{\textrm{NL}}$ measures the local non-Gaussianity in the primordial energy fluctuations of the Universe, with any deviation from $f_{\textrm{NL}}=0$ providing key constraints on inflationary models. Galaxy clustering is sensitive to $f_{\textrm{NL}}$ at large scale modes and the next generation of galaxy surveys will approach a statistical error of $\sigma_{f_{\textrm{NL}}}\sim1$. However, the systematic errors on these constraints are dominated by the degeneracy of $f_{\textrm{NL}}$ with the galaxy bias parameters $b_1$ (galaxy overdensities caused by mass perturbations) and $b_{\phi}$ (galaxy overdensities caused by primordial potential perturbations). It has been shown that the assumed scaling of $b_{\phi}(z)=2\delta_c (b_1(z)-1)$ is not accurate for realistically simulated galaxies, and depends both on the galaxy selection and the way that galaxies are modeled. To address this, we leverage the CAMELS-SAM pipeline to explore how varying parameters of galaxy formation affects $b_{\phi}$ and $b_1$ for various galaxy selections. We run separate-universe N-body simulations of $L=205 h^{-1}$ cMpc and $N=1280^3$ to measure $b_{\phi}$, and run 55 unique instances of the Santa Cruz semi-analytic model with varying parameters of stellar and AGN feedback. We find the behavior and evolution of a SC-SAM model's stellar-, SFR- and sSFR- to halo mass relationships track well with how $b_1$ and $b_{\phi}(b_1)$ change across redshift and selection for the SC-SAM. We find our variations of the SC-SAM encapsulate the $b_{\phi}$ behavior previously measured in IllustrisTNG, the Munich SAM, and Galacticus.Finally, we identify sSFR selections as particularly robust to varied galaxy modeling.</description>

      <title>Complex hydrogen chemical equilibrium and Gaia low mass problem in cool white dwarfs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.04995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Gaia data set shows substantial misfit between models and observation for cool white dwarfs with $T_{\rm eff}&lt;6000\,\rm K$, resulting in severe underestimation of masses of these stars.
  We aim to understand the underlying modelling issues.
  State of the art atmosphere models have been applied to analyse the Gaia DR3 sample of white dwarfs as well as quantum mechanical calculations to quantify formation and stability of different hydrogen species in the atmospheres of these stars.
  We reconcile the models and observations when we artificially suppress formation of $\rm H_3^+$ species, a process which substantially alters the chemical equilibrium at $T_{\rm eff}&lt;6000\,\rm K$, resulting in an overabundance of free electrons and $\rm H^-$, and strengthening of $\rm H^-$ bound-free absorption. Removing the $\rm H_3^+$ species from chemical equilibrium consideration makes ionization of hydrogen atoms the main source of free electrons, with the resulting models reproducing well the Gaia white dwarfs cooling branch. Because $\rm H_3^+$ must form under the considered conditions, likely it is the overestimation of its partition function and resulting abundance or the formation of $\rm H_3^-$ or another anionic species that suppresses the formation of $\rm H^-$ as a countercharge for $\rm H_3^+$ in current models.
  Chemical equilibrium in cool, hydrogen atmospheres white dwarfs must be reconsidered in respect to the abundance of $\rm H_3^+$ species and presence of unaccounted charge species.</description>

      <title>A gamma-ray-emitting blazar B3 1239+376 at z = 3.82 identified in a multi-wavelength context</title>

Abstract: Among thousands of extragalactic $\gamma$-ray emitters, only a handful of distant ($z &gt;$ 3) sources are detected, yet they are cruial probes shedding light on the cosmic evolution of jets of active galactic nuclei and the initial phase of mass growth of supermassive black holes. Here, we report on a multi-band study of a radio quasar B3 1239+376 with $z$ = 3.82. By analyzing the Fermi-LAT data, a significant (globally 7.7$\sigma$) $\gamma$-ray source in its direction, with an estimated association probability of 0.91, is observed in a half-year period of 2025. The analyses also reveal the emergence of co-spatial $\gamma$-ray residues in prior epochs. Moreover, the $\gamma$-ray and infrared light curves are likely correlated, particularly, the two emissions climb to the peaking values at the same time. The temporal coincidence establishes a firm association relationship between the $\gamma$-ray source and the quasar. Therefore, B3 1239+376 is proposed as the {\it third} most distant $\gamma$-ray-emitting blazar to date. Benefiting from the multi-wavelength observations, broadband spectral energy distributions in different flux states are drawn and reproduced by the classic one-zone leptonic radiation model to investigate the jet properties. Considering the recent brightening in $\gamma$ rays, prompt follow-up observations are encouraged, especially radio interferometry observations which may catch the potential ejection of a new jet blob.</description>

      <title>Predicting galaxy bias using machine learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how galaxies trace the underlying matter density field is essential for characterizing the influence of the large-scale structure on galaxy formation, being therefore a key ingredient in observational cosmology. This connection, commonly described through the galaxy bias, $b$, can be studied effectively using machine learning (ML) techniques, which offer strong predictive capabilities and can capture non-linear relationships. We aim to incorporate the linear bias parameter assigned to individual galaxies into a ML framework, quantify its dependence on various halo and environmental properties, and evaluate whether different algorithms can accurately predict this parameter and reproduce the scatter in several bias relations. We use data from the IllustrisTNG300 simulation, including the distance to different cosmic-web structures computed with DisPerSE. These data are complemented with an object-by-object estimator of the large-scale linear bias ($b_i$), providing the individual contribution of each galaxy to the bias of the entire population. Our ML framework uses three models to predict $b_i$: a Random Forest Regressor, a Neural Network and a probabilistic method (Normalizing Flows). We recover the full hierarchy of galaxy bias dependencies, showing that the most informative features are the overdensities, particularly $\delta_8$, followed by the distances to cosmic-web structures and selected internal halo properties, most notably $z_{1/2}$. We also demonstrate that Normalizing Flows clearly outperform deterministic methods in predicting galaxy bias, including its joint distributions with galaxy properties, owing to their ability to capture the intrinsic variance associated with the stochastic nature of the matter-halo-galaxy connection. Our ML framework provides a foundation for future efforts to measure individual bias with upcoming spectroscopic surveys.</description>

      <title>Early growth of massive black holes in dynamical dark energy models with negative cosmological constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent results from combined cosmological probes indicate that the Dark Energy component of the Universe could be dynamical. The simplest explanation envisages the presence of a quintessence field rolling into a potential, where the Dark Energy energy density parameter $\Omega_{DE}=\Omega_{\Lambda}+\Omega_{x}$ results from the contribution of the ground state energy $\Omega_{\Lambda}$ and the scalar field energy $\Omega_{x}$. Provided that $\Omega_{DE}\approx 0.7$, negative values of $\Omega_{\Lambda}$ can be consistent with current measurements from cosmological probes, and could help in explaining the large abundance of bright galaxies observed by JWST at $z&gt; 10$, largely exceeding the pre-JWST expectations in a $\Lambda CDM$ Universe. Here we explore to what extent such a scenario can account also for the early presence of massive Black Holes (BHs) with masses $M_{BH}\gtrsim 10^7\,M_{\odot}$ observed at $z\gtrsim 8$, and for the large over-abundance of AGN with respect to pre-JWST expectations. Our aim is not to provide a detailed description of BH growth, but rather to compute the maximal BH growth that can occur in cosmological models with negative $\Omega_{\Lambda}$ under the simple assumption of Eddington-limited accretion onto initial light Black Hole seeds with mass $M_{seed}\sim 10^2\,M_{\odot}$ originated from PopIII stars. To this aim we develop a simple analytic framework to connect the growth of dark matter halos to the maximal growth of BHs within the above assumptions. We show such models can account for present observations assuming values of $\Omega_{\Lambda}\approx -1$, simultaneously boosting both galaxy and AGN number counts without invoking any additional physics. This would allow us to trace the observed excess of bright and massive galaxies and the early formation of massive Black Holes and the abundance of AGN to the same cosmological origin.</description>

Abstract: We test claims of large-scale anisotropy in the local expansion rate using cluster scaling relations as distance indicators. Using a Bayesian forward model, we jointly fit the X-ray luminosity--temperature (LT) and thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich--temperature (YT) relations, marginalising over the latent cluster distances and modelling selection effects as well as peculiar velocities. The latter are modelled using reconstructions of the local peculiar velocity field where we self-consistently account for possible anisotropic redshift--distance relations via an approximate scheme. This treatment proves crucial to the inferred anisotropy and breaks the degeneracy between anisotropy in scaling relation normalisations and underlying cosmological anisotropy. We apply our method to 312 clusters at $z \lesssim 0.2$, testing dipolar, quadrupolar and general (pixelised) anisotropy models. Bayesian model selection finds no more than weak evidence for any anisotropic model. For dipole models, we obtain upper limits of $\delta H_0 / H_0 &lt; 3.2\%$ and bulk flow magnitude $&lt; 1300\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$. Our results contrast with previous claims of statistically significant anisotropy from the same data, which we attribute to our principled forward modelling of both redshifts and scaling relation observables through latent distances and our treatment of the impact of anisotropic redshift--distance relations when modelling the local peculiar velocity field. Our work highlights the importance of accurately modelling peculiar velocities when testing isotropy with distance indicators, and motivates the further development of reconstructions that self-consistently treat large-scale deviations from the Hubble flow.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Density and Gravitational Potential Fluctuations of the Interstellar Medium</title>

Abstract: Substructure in the interstellar medium (ISM) is crucial for establishing the correlation between star formation and feedback and has the capacity to significantly perturb stellar orbits, thus playing a central role in galaxy dynamics and evolution. Contemporary surveys of gas and dust emission in nearby galaxies resolve structure down to $\sim 10\,$pc scales, demanding theoretical models of ISM substructure with matching fidelity. In this work, we address this need by quantitatively characterizing the gas density in state-of-the-art MHD simulations of disk galaxies that resolve pc to kpc scales. The TIGRESS-NCR framework we employ includes sheared galactic rotation, self-consistent star formation and feedback, and nonequilibrium chemistry and cooling. We fit simple analytic models to the one-point spatial, two-point spatial, and two-point spatio-temporal statistics of the surface density fluctuation field. We find that for both solar neighborhood and inner-galaxy conditions, (i) the surface density fluctuations follow a log-normal distribution, (ii) the linear and logarithmic fluctuation power spectra are well-approximated as power laws with indices of $\approx -2.2$ and $\approx -2.8$ respectively, and (iii) lifetimes of structures at different scales are set by a combination of feedback and effective pressure terms. Additionally, we find that the vertical structure of the gas is well-modeled by a mixture of exponential and sech$^2$ profiles, allowing us to link the surface density statistics to those of the volume density and gravitational potential. We provide convenient parameterizations for incorporating realistic ISM effects into stellar-dynamical studies and for comparison with multi-wavelength observations.</description>

      <title>A Modified 3D Biconical Outflow Model: Spatial Constraints on AGN-driven Outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a modified outflow model and its application to constrain ionized outflow properties of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). By adding a rotating disk component to the biconical outflow model of Bae &amp; Woo, we find that models with a rotating disk require faster launching velocities ($\lesssim$ 1500 km s$^{-1}$) than outflow-only models to be consistent with the observed gas kinematics of local type 2 AGNs. We perform Monte Carlo simulations to reproduce the observed distribution of gas kinematics of a large sample ($\sim$ 39,000), constraining the launching velocity and opening angle. While the launching velocity is moderate for the majority of the local AGNs, the notable cases of 2 - 5 % show strong outflows with $V_{max} \sim 1000-1500$ km s$^{-1}$. By examining the seeing effect based on the mock integral field unit data, we find that the outflow sizes measured based on velocity widths tend to be overestimated when the angular size of the outflow is comparable to or smaller than the seeing. This result highlights the need for more careful treatments of the seeing effect in the outflow size measurement, yet it still supports the lack of global feedback by gas outflows for local AGNs.</description>

      <title>Connecting Star Formation in the Milky Way and Nearby Galaxies -II. An Observationally Driven Analytical Model for Predicting Cloud-Scale Star Formation Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22985v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a model by integrating observational constraints from the Milky Way and nearby galaxies to predict cloud-scale star formation rates (SFRs). In the model, we first estimate the initial total mass of clumps in a cloud based on the cloud mass, and then generate the initial clump population of the cloud using the initial clump mass function. Next, we model the star formation histories (SFHs) of the cloud to assign an age to each clump. We then sort out the intermediate-age clumps and calculate the total embedded cluster mass. Finally, we predict the SFR based on the duration of the embedded phase. The model-predicted SFR is broadly consistent with the observed SFR, supporting the plausibility of the model. The model primarily provides a theoretical framework that integrates a wide range of observational results, thereby clarifying the tasks for future observations.</description>

      <title>An Active Galaxy Cluster Merger at Cosmic Noon Revealed by JWST Weak Lensing and Multiwavelength Probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The galaxy cluster XLSSC~122 is a rare system at $z = 1.98$, hosting surprisingly evolved member galaxies when the Universe was only one-third of its present age. Leveraging deep JWST/NIRCam imaging, we perform a weak-lensing analysis and reconstruct the cluster's mass distribution, finding a mass peak that coincides with both the X-ray peak and the position of the brightest cluster galaxy. We obtain a mass estimate of $M_{200\rm c}=1.6 \pm 0.3\times 10^{14}~M_{\odot}$ and a concentration of $c_{200 \rm c}=6.3 \pm 0.3$ implied by the preferred concentration--mass relation, in agreement with recent strong-lensing estimates. The high concentration in particular motivates tests against empirical and simulation-derived concentration--mass relations. Placing our weak-lensing mass map in the context of Chandra X-ray data, MeerKAT radio imaging, ALMA+ACA/ACT Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) mapping, and new JWST intracluster light measurements, we identify consistent NE--SW elongation across datasets and a pronounced offset along the same axis between the SZ and mass/X-ray peaks, pointing to significant merger activity. XLSSC~122 thus serves as a JWST pilot study for high-$z$ lensing, demonstrating the telescope's unique ability to map cluster mass distributions at $z\sim 2$ and motivating a uniform sample of analogous systems with joint lensing, X-ray, SZ, and radio data to probe cluster assembly at cosmic noon.</description>

      <title>Fast rotations in galaxies at cosmic noon indicate central concentration of stars, dark matter or massive black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rotation curves of regularly rotating disc galaxies are a unique probe of the gravitational potential and dark matter distribution. Until recently, matter decomposition of rotation curves at $z&gt;0.5$ was challenging, not only due to the lack of high resolution kinematic data but also of both suitable photometry to accurately trace the stellar surface density and spatially-resolved sub-mm observations to trace the cold gas distribution. In this paper, we analyse three galaxies from the Archival Large Program to Advance Kinematic Analysis (ALPAKA) sample, combining highly resolved cold gas observations from ALMA with rest-frame near-infrared imaging from JWST to investigate their dynamical properties and constrain their dark matter halos. The galaxies, initially classified as regularly rotating discs based on ALMA observations alone, appear in JWST as extended and symmetric stellar discs with spiral arms. Our dynamical models reproduce the rotation of the discs in the outer parts well, but they systematically underpredict the inner rotation velocities, revealing a deficit of central mass relative to the data. This discrepancy indicates either an underestimation of the bulge masses due to variations in the stellar mass-to-light ratio or dust attenuation or the presence of overmassive black holes. Alternatively, it may suggest departures from standard dark-matter halo profiles, including enhanced central concentrations.</description>

      <title>A first GLIMPSE into star clusters populations across cosmic time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first sample of 222 high-redshift (z&gt;0.5) star clusters, detected with JWST/NIRCam in 78 magnified galaxies from different galaxy cluster fields. The majority of the systems (~60%) is observed in the very deep NIRCam observations of the cluster AbellS1063 (GLIMPSE program), showing the power that deep observations, combined with lensing, has to reveal these primordial stellar structures. We perform simultaneous size-flux estimates in all available NIRCam filters and spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting analysis to recover star cluster physical properties. All star cluster candidates have very high magnification. Star clusters and clumps show similar ages and redshift distributions, although noticeable differences are seen in their masses, sizes and stellar surface densities inherent to the lack of resolution in the latter group. We reconstruct the formation redshift of star clusters and find that the large majority of the observed star clusters show young ages (&lt;100 Myr) and seems to form at cosmic noon (CN,1&lt;z&lt;4). A small sample of CN star clusters is about 1 Gyr old, these potential globular clusters have formed well within cosmic reionization. Star clusters have stellar densities in the range 10^2 to 10^6 M/pc^2, with median values around 10^4 pc2. Their sizes and densities better overlap with those of nuclear star clusters in the local Universe. These intrinsic properties make high-z star clusters a viable channel to grow intermediate mass black holes. We use Bayesian inference to make first direct measurement of the star cluster mass function at z&gt;1, based on a subsample of 60 star clusters younger than 100 Myr and with masses above 2e6 Msun. The star cluster mass function is well described by a power-law with slope beta = -1.89 suggesting that a power-law -2 function might already be in place in the distant Universe.</description>

      <title>Prompt cusps in hierarchical dark matter halos: Implications for annihilation boost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent simulations have identified long-lived ``prompt cusps'' --  compact remnants of early density peaks with inner profiles $\rho\propto r^{-3/2}$. They can survive hierarchical assembly and potentially enhance signals of dark matter annihilation. In this work, we incorporate prompt cusps into the semi-analytic substructure framework SASHIMI, enabling a fully hierarchical, environment-dependent calculation of the annihilation luminosity that consistently tracks subhalos, sub-subhalos, and tidal stripping. We assign prompt cusps to first-generation microhalos and propagate their survival through the merger history, including an explicit treatment of cusps associated with stripped substructure. We find that the substructure hierarchy converges rapidly once a few levels are included, and that prompt cusps can raise the total annihilation boost of Milky-Way--size hosts at $z=0$ to $B\sim 50$ for fiducial cusp-occupation assumptions, compared to a subhalo-only baseline of $B_{\rm sh}\sim\mathrm{few}$. Across a wide range of host masses and redshifts, prompt cusps increase the normalization of $B(M_{\rm host},z)$ while largely preserving its mass and redshift trends. Compared to universal-average, peak-based estimates, our fiducial boosts are lower by about a factor of a few, primarily reflecting a correspondingly smaller inferred cusp abundance in host halos, highlighting the importance of unifying peak-based cusp formation with merger-tree evolution and environmental dependence.</description>

      <title>Resolving Black Hole Family Issues Among the Massive Ancestors of Very High-Spin Gravitational-Wave Events Like GW231123</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The latest detection of GW231123, a binary black hole (BH) merger with exceptionally large masses and high spins for the incoming components, has been suggested as a smoking gun for hierarchical formation. In this scenario, a first generation of BHs resulting from collapsing stars form in a dense environment. Here they can assemble dynamically and undergo subsequent mergers. We discuss three challenges for the formation of a GW231123-like event inside a star cluster: 1) The high masses of the incoming BHs appear to be in the predicted pair-instability mass gap and thus suggest that second-generation or higher-order generation BHs are involved. 2) Very high spins ($\chi_f \gtrsim 0.8$) are very unlikely for dynamically assembled BHs because of the isotropic distribution of spin vectors. 3) Hierarchically formed BHs are susceptible to receive large recoils, which could kick them out of their cluster. We simulate this scenario and show that only a few percent of mergers recover remnants within GW231123's primary spin estimate $\chi_1=0.9^{+0.10}_{-0.19}$ and are retained inside typical star clusters. A large fraction of very rapidly spinning second-generation BHs (including $\chi_f&gt;0.9$) can only form if the first-generation BHs merges with aligned spins. This is a natural outcome of massive binary star evolution scenarios, such as a chemically homogeneous evolution. This scenario also predicts equal masses for the components, implying that the resulting BHs tend to receive very low recoil kicks and would therefore likely be retained inside a cluster. We conclude that GW231123-like events, if formed in a star cluster, could require first-generation BHs with large aligned spins that evolved through stellar binary interaction, followed by the dynamical assembly for a subsequent merger. We discuss the implications for the uncertain lower edge of the putative mass gap 60-130 $\rm M_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Search for neutrino emission from blazar $\gamma$-ray flares accounting for possible neutrino time delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the results of the search for the high-energy neutrino emission associated with blazar flares, accounting for a possible lag of neutrinos with respect to the electromagnetic emission, either due to the slowness of the proton energy losses in $p\gamma$ collisions and/or proton acceleration. We perform two tests, cross-matching neutrinos with energies $E_{\nu} \gtrsim 100$ TeV from the public catalogue of neutrino alerts IceCat-1 with active galactic nuclei from two source samples based on 1) the MOJAVE database and 2) the CGRaBS catalogue, and utilising Fermi-LAT light curves from the public light curve repository. We scan over a wide range of values of the jet-frame time delay $t^{\prime}_{\mathrm{delay}}$ between the neutrino arrival and the time of the prior major $\gamma$-ray flare and find a pre-trial $\sim 2\sigma$ correlation at $t^{\prime}_{\mathrm{delay}} \sim 10^{3}$ d, which is consistent ($p_{\mathrm{post-trial}} \sim 0.1$) with expectations under the null hypothesis after trial correction.</description>

      <title>The FLAMINGO Project: Exploring the X-ray--cosmic-shear cross-correlation as a probe of large-scale structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Baryonic feedback processes associated with galaxy formation directly influence the large-scale structure by redistributing gas. Recent measurements of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect and stacks of X-ray emission from optically selected galaxy clusters suggest that feedback from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) is more efficient at expelling gas from low-mass clusters than previously thought. The measurement of the cross-correlation between cosmic shear and diffuse X-ray emission provides a new probe of the distribution of gas in groups and clusters. We use the FLAMINGO cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations to examine the X-ray--cosmic-shear cross-correlation. The cross-correlation is most sensitive to the distribution of gas in haloes with masses $10^{14}\leq M_{200\mathrm{c}}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot}\leq10^{15}$. It is sensitive to the strength of feedback, but the effects of variations in cosmology and baryonic physics are largely degenerate. We compare the FLAMINGO predictions with the cross-correlation between cosmic shear from the Dark Energy Survey and ROSAT all-sky X-ray maps. We find that, if we neglect the X-ray emission from AGN that would remain unresolved by ROSAT, then the fiducial FLAMINGO model is in excellent agreement with the data, while models with stronger or weaker feedback are ruled out. However, if we account for unresolved AGN, either using the direct FLAMINGO predictions or by abundance matching to the observed (extrapolated) AGN luminosity function, then models with stronger feedback are preferred. We conclude that to exploit the potential of the X-ray--lensing cross-correlation, it will be necessary to resolve fainter AGN, and to use external constraints to break the degeneracy between baryonic feedback and cosmology.</description>
