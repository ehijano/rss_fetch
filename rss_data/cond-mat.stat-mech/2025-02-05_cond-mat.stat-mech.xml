      <title>Speedups in nonequilibrium thermal relaxation: Mpemba and related effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most of our intuition about the behavior of physical systems is shaped by observations at or near thermal equilibrium. However, even a thermal quench can lead to states far from thermal equilibrium, where counterintuitive, anomalous effects can occur. A prime example of anomalous thermal relaxation is the Mpemba effect, in which a system prepared at a hot temperature cools down to the temperature of the cold environment faster than an identical system prepared at a warm temperature. Although reported for water more than 2000 years ago by Aristotle, the recent observations of analogous relaxation speedups in a variety of systems have motivated the search for general explanations. We review anomalous relaxation effects, which all share a nonmonotonic dependence of relaxation time versus initial ``distance" from the final state or from the phase transition. The final state can be an equilibrium or a nonequilibrium steady state. We first review the water experiments and classify the anomalous relaxation phenomena related to the Mpemba effect. We then provide a modern definition of the Mpemba effect, focusing on the theoretical frameworks of stochastic thermodynamics, kinetic theory, Markovian dynamics, and phase transitions. We discuss the recent experimental and numerical developments that followed these theoretical advances. These developments paved the way for the prediction and observation of novel phenomena, such as the inverse Mpemba effect. The review is self-contained and introduces anomalous relaxation phenomena in single- and many-body systems, both classical and quantum. We also discuss the broader relevance of the Mpemba effect, including its relation with phase transitions and its experimental implications. We end with perspectives that connect anomalous speedups to ideas for designing optimal heating/cooling protocols, heat engines, and efficient samplers.</description>

      <title>Complex entanglement entropy for complex conformal field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformal field theory underlies critical ground states of quantum many-body systems. While conventional conformal field theory is associated with positive central charges, nonunitary conformal field theory with complex-valued central charges has recently been recognized as physically relevant. Here, we demonstrate that complex-valued entanglement entropy characterizes complex conformal field theory and critical phenomena of open quantum many-body systems. This is based on non-Hermitian reduced density matrices constructed from the combination of right and left ground states. Applying the density matrix renormalization group to non-Hermitian systems, we numerically calculate the complex entanglement entropy of the non-Hermitian five-state Potts model, thereby confirming the scaling behavior predicted by complex conformal field theory.</description>

      <title>An altruistic resource-sharing mechanism for synchronization: The energy-speed-accuracy tradeoff</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synchronization among a group of active agents is ubiquitous in nature. Although synchronization based on direct interactions between agents described by the Kuramoto model is well understood, the other general mechanism based on indirect interactions among agents sharing limited resources are less known. Here, we propose a minimal thermodynamically consistent model for the altruistic resource-sharing (ARS) mechanism wherein resources are needed for individual agent to advance but a more advanced agent has a lower competence to obtain resources. We show that while differential competence in ARS mechanism provides a negative feedback leading to synchronization it also breaks detailed balance and thus requires additional energy dissipation besides the cost of driving individual agents. By solving the model analytically, our study reveals a general tradeoff relation between the total energy dissipation rate and the two key performance measures of the system: average speed and synchronization accuracy. For a fixed dissipation rate, there is a distinct speed-accuracy Pareto front traversed by the scarcity of resources: scarcer resources lead to slower speed but more accurate synchronization. Increasing energy dissipation eases this tradeoff by pushing the speed-accuracy Pareto front outwards. The connections of our work to realistic biological systems such as the KaiABC system in cyanobacterial circadian clock and other theoretical results based on thermodynamic uncertainty relation are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain the exact full counting statistics of a cellular automaton with freely propagating vacancies and charged particles that are stochastically scattered or transmitted upon collision by identifying the problem as a colored stochastic six-vertex model with one inert color. Typical charge current fluctuation at vanishing net charge follow a one-parameter distribution that interpolated between the distribution of the charged single-file class in the limit of pure reflection and a Gaussian distribution in the limit of pure transmission.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation Dissipation Relations for the Non-Reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent results demonstrate how deviations from equilibrium fluctuation-dissipation theorem can be quantified for active field theories by deriving exact fluctuations dissipation relations that involve the entropy production [M. K. Johnsrud and R. Golestanian, arXiv:2409.14977]. Here we develop and employ diagrammatic tools to perform perturbative calculations for a paradigmatic active field theory, the Non-Reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard (NRCH) model. We obtain analytical results, which serve as an illustration of how to implement the recently developed framework to active field theories, and help to illuminate the specific non-equilibrium characteristics of the NRCH field theory.</description>

      <title>Optimizing oil-water separation using fractal surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oil has become a prevalent global pollutant, stimulating the research to improve the techniques to separate oil from water. Materials with special wetting properties - primarily those that repel water while attracting oil - have been proposed as suitable candidates for this task. However, one limitation in developing efficient substrates is the limited available volume for oil absorption. In this study we investigate the efficacy of disordered fractal materials in addressing this challenge, leveraging their unique wetting properties. Using a combination of a continuous model and Monte Carlo simulations, we characterize the hydrophobicity and oleophilicity of substrates created through ballistic deposition (BD). Our results demonstrate that these materials exhibit high contact angles for water, confirming their hydrophobic nature, while allowing significant oil penetration, indicative of oleophilic behavior. The available free volume within the substrates vary from $60\%$ to $90\%$ of the total volume of the substrate depending on some parameters of the BD. By combining their water and oil wetting properties with a high availability of volume, the fractal substrates analyzed in this work achieve an efficiency in separating oil from water of nearly $98\%$, which is significantly higher compared to a micro-pillared surfaces made from the same material but lacking a fractal design.</description>

      <title>Holographic Time Crystals vs Penrose</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the large$-N$ limit, no known no-go theorem rules out thermal time crystals that spontaneously break continuous time-translation, unlike in the large volume limit. If thermal time crystals exist in holographic CFTs, they would correspond to ensemble-dominating black holes with eternally time-varying exterior geometries. We point out that recent work on a conjectured non-linear instability of slowly rotating Kerr-AdS$_4$ produced viable candidates for such states. Then we show that the existence of holographic microcanonical time crystals would imply violations of the AdS Penrose inequality (PI). We proceed to look for violations of the PI in spherical symmetry, working with Einstein-scalar gravity with the most general possible boundary conditions compatible with boundary conformal invariance. We derive a set of ODEs for maximally PI-violating initial data. Solving these numerically, we find strong evidence that in the particular case of spherical symmetry, the PI holds iff the positive mass theorem (PMT) holds. This suggests that holographic CFT$_3$ time crystals can only possibly exist at non-zero angular momentum, at least in the absence of electric charge. We also discover neutral hairy black holes in a consistent truncation of M-theory that has a PMT and boundary conditions respecting conformal invariance, disproving an existing no-hair conjecture. Finally, we show that previous PI-violating solutions by the author all existed in theories where the PMT is violated. Unfortunately, our results imply that there currently are no known examples where the PI functions as a non-trivial Swampland constraint.</description>

      <title>Postselection-free experimental observation of the measurement-induced phase transition in circuits with universal gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monitored many-body systems can exhibit a phase transition between entangling and disentangling dynamical phases by tuning the strength of measurements made on the system as it evolves. This phenomenon is called the measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT). Understanding the properties of the MIPT is a prominent challenge for both theory and experiment at the intersection of many-body physics and quantum information. Realizing the MIPT experimentally is particularly challenging due to the postselection problem, which demands a number of experimental realizations that grows exponentially with the number of measurements made during the dynamics. Proposed approaches that circumvent the postselection problem typically rely on a classical decoding process that infers the final state based on the measurement record. But the complexity of this classical process generally also grows exponentially with the system size unless the dynamics is restricted to a fine-tuned set of unitary operators. In this work we overcome these difficulties. We construct a tree-shaped quantum circuit whose nodes are Haar-random unitary operators followed by weak measurements of tunable strength. For these circuits, we show that the MIPT can be detected without postselection using only a simple classical decoding process whose complexity grows linearly with the number of qubits. Our protocol exploits the recursive structure of tree circuits, which also enables a complete theoretical description of the MIPT, including an exact solution for its critical point and scaling behavior. We experimentally realize the MIPT on Quantinuum's H1-1 trapped-ion quantum computer and show that the experimental results are precisely described by theory. Our results close the gap between analytical theory and postselection-free experimental observation of the MIPT.</description>

Abstract: This article reviews the concepts and methods of variational path sampling. These methods allow computational studies of rare events in systems driven arbitrarily far from equilibrium. Based upon a statistical mechanics of trajectory space and leveraging the theory of large deviations, they provide a perspective with which dynamical phenomena can be studied with the same types of ensemble reweighting ideas that have been used for static equilibrium properties. Applications to chemical, material, and biophysical systems are highlighted.</description>

Abstract: Maximizing the amount of work harvested from an environment is important for a wide variety of biological and technological processes, from energy-harvesting processes such as photosynthesisto energy storage systems such as fuels and batteries. Here we consider the maximization of free energy -- and by extension, the maximum extractable work -- that can be gained by a classical or quantum system that undergoes driving by its environment. We consider how the free energy gain depends on the initial state of the system, while also accounting for the cost of preparing the system. We provide simple necessary and sufficient conditions for increasing the gain of free energy by varying the initial state. We also derive simple formulae that relate the free energy gained using the optimal initial state rather than another suboptimal initial state. Finally, we demonstrate that the problem of finding the optimal initial state may have two distinct regimes, one easy and one difficult, depending on the temperatures used for preparation and work extraction. We illustrate our results on a simple model of an information engine.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recovering dynamical equations from observed noisy data is the central challenge of system identification. We develop a statistical mechanics approach to analyze sparse equation discovery algorithms, which typically balance data fit and parsimony via hyperparameter tuning. In this framework, statistical mechanics offers tools to analyze the interplay between complexity and fitness similarly to that of entropy and energy in physical systems. To establish this analogy, we define the hyperparameter optimization procedure as a two-level Bayesian inference problem that separates variable selection from coefficient inference and enables the computation of the posterior parameter distribution in closed form. Our approach provides uncertainty quantification, crucial in the low-data limit that is frequently encountered in real-world applications. A key advantage of employing statistical mechanical concepts, such as free energy and the partition function, is to connect the large data limit to thermodynamic limit and characterize the sparsity- and noise-induced phase transitions that delineate correct from incorrect identification. We thus provide a method for closed-loop inference, estimating the noise in a given model and checking if the model is tolerant to that noise amount. This perspective of sparse equation discovery is versatile and can be adapted to various other equation discovery algorithms.</description>

      <title>Local order metrics for many-particle systems across length scales</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Formulating order metrics that sensitively quantify the degree of order/disorder in many-particle systems in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$ across length scales is an outstanding challenge in physics, chemistry, and materials science. Since an infinite set of $n$-particle correlation functions is required to fully characterize a system, one must settle for a reduced set of structural information, in practice. We initiate a program to use the local number variance $\sigma_N^2(R)$ associated with a spherical sampling window of radius $R$ (which encodes pair correlations) and an integral measure derived from it $\Sigma_N(R_i,R_j)$ that depends on two specified radial distances $R_i$ and $R_j$. Across the first three space dimensions ($d = 1,2,3$), we find these metrics can sensitively describe and categorize the degree of order/disorder of 41 different models of antihyperuniform, nonhyperuniform, disordered hyperuniform, and ordered hyperuniform many-particle systems at a specified length scale $R$. Using our local variance metrics, we demonstrate the importance of assessing order/disorder with respect to a specific value of $R$. These local order metrics could also aid in the inverse design of structures with prescribed length-scale-specific degrees of order/disorder that yield desired physical properties. In future work, it would be fruitful to explore the use of higher-order moments of the number of points within a spherical window of radius $R$ [S. Torquato {\it et al}., Phys. Rev. X, \textbf{11}, 021028 (2021)] to devise even more sensitive order metrics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider non-equilibrium dynamics after quantum quenches in the mixed-field three-state Potts quantum chain in the ferromagnetic regime. Compared to the analogous setting for the Ising spin chain, the Potts model has a much richer phenomenology, which originates partly from baryonic excitations in the spectrum and partly from the various possible relative alignments of the initial magnetisation and the longitudinal field. We obtain the excitation spectrum by combining semi-classical approximation and exact diagonalisation, and we use the results to explain the various dynamical behaviours we observe. Besides recovering dynamical confinement, as well as Wannier-Stark localisation due to Bloch oscillations similar to the Ising chain, a novel feature is the presence of baryonic excitations in the quench spectroscopy. In addition, when the initial magnetisation and the longitudinal field are misaligned, both confinement and Bloch oscillations only result in partial localisation, with some correlations retaining an unsuppressed light-cone behaviour together with a corresponding growth of entanglement entropy.</description>

      <title>Dissipation enables robust extensive scaling of multipartite correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the multipartite mutual information between $N$ discrete-state stochastic units interacting in a network that is invariant under unit permutations. We show that when the system relaxes to fixed point attractors, multipartite correlations in the stationary state either do not scale extensively with $N$, or the extensive scaling is not robust to arbitrarily small perturbations of certain system parameters. In particular, robust extensive scaling cannot occur in thermodynamic equilibrium. In contrast, mutual information scales extensively when the system relaxes to time-dependent attractors (e.g., limit cycles), which can occur only far from equilibrium. This demonstrates the essential role of dissipation in the generation and maintenance of multipartite correlations. We illustrate our theory with the nonequilibrium Potts model.</description>

      <title>Formulation of entropy through work by Carnot machine and direct derivation of law of entropy non-decrease from Kelvin principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the law of entropy non-decrease directly from the Kelvin principle for simple and compound systems without using Clausius inequality. A key of the derivation is a formulation of entropy in terms of work by a Carnot machine operating between a system and a single heat reservoir, which is equivalent to Clausius entropy based on heat and Gyftopoulos-Beretta entropy based on work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Particle-particle correlation functions in ionic systems control many of their macroscopic properties. In this work, we use stochastic density functional theory to compute these correlations, and then we analyze their long-range behavior. In particular, we study the system's response to a rapid change (quench) in the external electric field. We show that the correlation functions relax diffusively toward the non-equilibrium stationary state and that in a stationary state, they present a universal conical shape. This shape distinguishes this system from systems with short-range interactions, where the correlations have a parabolic shape. We relate this temporal evolution of the correlations to the algebraic relaxation of the total charge current reported previously.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Response Theory: From Precision Limits to Strong Perturbation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19602v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the response of nonequilibrium systems to external perturbations remains a fundamental challenge in statistical physics. Here, we prove a novel universal bound stating that the response precision for state observable is fundamentally constrained to $1/2$ under single edge or vertex perturbations, independent of system size. Furthermore, we develop exact relations connecting responses to perturbations of arbitrary strengths, extending nonequilibrium response theory beyond the weak-perturbation regime. Through response equalities we also provide a novel physical interpretation of response sensitivity and recovers bounds previously obtained using graph-theoretical methods and extensive linear algebra. Our results provide a general mathematical framework applicable across diverse nonequilibrium systems and offer design principles for optimal sensing and information processing in biochemical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.00917v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A deep understanding of the mechanisms underlying many-body quantum chaos is one of the big challenges in contemporary theoretical physics. We tackle this problem in the context of a set of perturbed quadratic Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) Hamiltonians defined on graphs. This allows us to disentangle the geometrical properties of the underlying single-particle problem and the importance of the interaction terms, showing that the former is the dominant feature ensuring the single-particle to many-body chaotic transition. Our results are verified numerically with state-of-the-art numerical techniques, capable of extracting eigenvalues in a desired energy window of very large Hamiltonians. Our approach essentially provides a new way of viewing many-body chaos from a single-particle perspective.</description>

      <title>Near-future projections in continuous agent-based models for crowd dynamics: mathematical structures in use and their implications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12798v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the theoretical foundations of pedestrian models for crowd dynamics. While the topic gains momentum, current models differ widely in their mathematical structure, even if we only consider continuous agent-based models. To clarify their underpinning, we first lay mathematical foundations for the common hierarchical decomposition into strategic, tactical, and operational levels and underline the practical interest in preserving the continuity between the latter two levels by working with a floor field, rather than way-points. Turning to local navigation, we clarify how three archetypical approaches, namely, purely reactive models, anticipatory models based on the idea of times to collision, and game theory, differ in the way they extrapolate trajectories in the near future. We also insist on the oft-overlooked distinction between processes pertaining to decision-making and mechanical effects in dense settings. The implications of these differences are illustrated with a comparison of the numerical predictions of these models in the simple scenario of head-on collision avoidance between agents, by varying the walking speed, the reaction times, and the degree of courtesy of the agents, notably.</description>

      <title>Pauli Spectrum and Non-stabilizerness of Typical Quantum Many-Body States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An important question of quantum information is to characterize genuinely quantum (beyond-Clifford) resources necessary for universal quantum computing. Here, we use the Pauli spectrum to quantify how magic, beyond Clifford, typical many-qubit states are. We first present a phenomenological picture of the Pauli spectrum based on quantum typicality and then confirm it for Haar random states. We then introduce filtered stabilizer entropy, a magic measure that can resolve the difference between typical and atypical states. We proceed with the numerical study of the Pauli spectrum of states created by random circuits as well as for eigenstates of chaotic Hamiltonians. We find that in both cases the Pauli spectrum approaches the one of Haar random states, up to exponentially suppressed tails. Our results underscore differences between typical and atypical states from the point of view of quantum information.</description>

      <title>Universal correlations in chaotic many-body quantum states: Fock-space formulation of Berrys random wave model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The apparent randomness of chaotic eigenstates in interacting quantum systems hides subtle correlations dynamically imposed by their finite energy per particle. These correlations are revealed when Berrys approach for chaotic eigenfunctions in single-particle systems is lifted into many-body space. We achieve this by a many-body semiclassics analysis, appropriate for the mesoscopic regime of large but finite number of particles. We then identify the universality of both the cross-correlations and the Gaussian distribution of expansion coefficients as the signatures of chaotic eigenstates. Combined, these two aspects imprint a distinctive backbone to the morphology of eigenstates that we check against extensive quantum simulations. The universality of eigenstate correlations for fixed energy density is then a further signature of many-body quantum chaos that, while consistent with the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, lies beyond random matrix theory.</description>

      <title>Data-driven discovery of self-similarity using neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03896v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding self-similarity is a key step for understanding the governing law behind complex physical phenomena. Traditional methods for identifying self-similarity often rely on specific models, which can introduce significant bias. In this paper, we present a novel neural network-based approach that discovers self-similarity directly from observed data, without presupposing any models. The presence of self-similar solutions in a physical problem signals that the governing law contains a function whose arguments are given by power-law monomials of physical parameters, which are characterized by power-law exponents. The basic idea is to enforce such particular forms structurally in a neural network in a parametrized way. We train the neural network model using the observed data, and when the training is successful, we can extract the power exponents that characterize scale-transformation symmetries of the physical problem. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with both synthetic and experimental data, validating its potential as a robust, model-independent tool for exploring self-similarity in complex systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04770v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Emulating thermal observables on a digital quantum computer is essential for quantum simulation of many-body physics. However, thermalization typically requires a large system size due to incorporating a thermal bath, whilst limited resources of near-term digital quantum processors allow for simulating relatively small systems. We show that thermal observables and fluctuations may be obtained for a small closed system without a thermal bath. Thermal observables occur upon classically averaging quantum mechanical observables over randomized variants of their time evolution that run independently on a digital quantum processor. Using an IBM quantum computer, we experimentally find thermal occupation probabilities with finite positive and negative temperatures defined by the initial state's energy. Averaging over random evolutions facilitates error mitigation, with the noise contributing to the temperature in the simulated observables. This result fosters probing the dynamical emergence of equilibrium properties of matter at finite temperatures on noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware.</description>

The first law of stochastic thermodynamics is reformulated and the fluctuation theorems are proved on this level, with emphasis on maintaining fully general covariance and on the choice of observers.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions in (2 + 1)D subsystem-symmetric monitored quantum circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interplay of unitary evolution and projective measurements is a modern interest in the study of many-body entanglement. On the one hand, the competition between these two processes leads to the recently discovered measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT). On the other hand, measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) is a well-known computational paradigm where measurements simulate unitary evolution by utilizing the entanglement of special resources such as the two-dimensional (2D) cluster state. The entanglement properties enabling MBQC may be attributed to symmetry-protected topological (SPT) orders, particularly subsystem-symmetric topological (SSPT) orders. It was recently found that the one-dimensional cluster state may be associated with an SPT phase in random circuits respecting a global $\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, and furthermore that all phase transitions in this scenario belong to the same universality class. As resources with greater computational power feature greater symmetry, it is fruitful to investigate further any relationship between levels of symmetry in MIPTs and MBQC. In this paper we investigate MIPTs on a torus with three levels of symmetry-respecting unitary evolution interspersed by measurements. Although we find two area-law phases and one volume-law phase with distinct entanglement structures for each ensemble, the phase transition from the volume-law phase to the area-law phase associated with the 2D SSPT cluster state has variable correlation length exponent $\nu$. Whereas $\nu\approx 0.90$ for unconstrained Clifford unitaries and $\nu\approx0.83$ for globally-symmetric Cliffords, subsystem-symmetric Cliffords feature a much smaller value $\nu\approx 0.38$. We discuss how these distinct $\nu$'s quantify spacetime response scales where quantum information is manipulated by single-qubit measurements as in MBQC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02326v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Higher-order interactions underlie complex phenomena in systems such as biological and artificial neural networks, but their study is challenging due to the scarcity of tractable models. By leveraging a generalisation of the maximum entropy principle, here we introduce curved neural networks as a class of prototypical models with a limited number of parameters that are particularly well-suited for studying higher-order phenomena. Through exact mean-field descriptions, we show that these curved neural networks implement a self-regulating annealing process that can accelerate memory retrieval, leading to explosive order-disorder phase transitions with multi-stability and hysteresis effects. Moreover, by analytically exploring their memory-retrieval capacity using the replica trick near ferromagnetic and spin-glass phase boundaries, we demonstrate that these networks can enhance memory capacity and robustness of retrieval over classical associative-memory networks. Overall, the proposed framework provides parsimonious models amenable to analytical study, revealing novel higher-order phenomena in complex networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional $d$-wave ($j=2$) superconducting state may result from Cooper pairing in channels with different angular momenta and spin, such as $(l=0, s=2)$ or $(l=2, s=0)$. We consider spin-3/2 Luttinger fermions in the limit of small spin-orbit coupling parameter and with weak attractive interactions in both of these channels, and demonstrate that the stable $d$-wave superconducting phase of the system below critical temperature depends critically on the ratio of two interactions. When a weak inversion-breaking term in the kinetic energy is included, all three of the real, ferromagnetic, and cyclic phases can be realized within a narrow range around unit ratio. The result shows how models of multicomponent superconductors can be surprisingly sensitive to precise values of some of its parameters and display radically different superconducting ground states with their variation.</description>

Abstract: We investigate two-dimensional conformal field theories (CFTs) with affine $\widehat{su}(2)$ and $\widehat{su}(3)$ algebra symmetry. Their bosonic modular-invariant partition functions have been fully classified based on the ADE classification. In this work, we extend the classification to include fermionic and parafermionic CFTs with the same affine symmetries, utilizing techniques of fermionization and parafermionization. We find that the fermionic and parafermionic $\widehat{su}(2)$ models are related to non-simply laced Dynkin diagrams.</description>

      <title>On Chord Dynamics and Complexity Growth in Double-Scaled SYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the time evolution governed by the two-sided chord Hamiltonian in the double-scaled SYK model, which induces a probability distribution over operators in the double-scaled algebra. Through the bulk-to-boundary map, this distribution translates into dynamical profiles of bulk states within the chord Hilbert space. We derive analytic expressions for such profiles, valid across a broad parameter range and all time scales. Additionally, we demonstrate how distinct semi-classical behaviors emerge by localizing within specific energy regions in the semi-classical limit. We revisit the doubled Hilbert space formalism as an isometric map between the one-particle sector of the chord Hilbert space and the doubled zero-particle sector. Utilizing this map, we obtain analytic results for correlation functions and investigate the dynamical properties of operator Krylov complexity for chords, establishing an equivalence between the chord number generating function and the crossed four-point correlation function. We also explore finite-temperature effects, showing that operator spreading slows as temperature decreases. In the semi-classical limit, we perform a saddle point analysis and incorporate the one-loop determinant to derive the normalized time-ordered four-point correlation function. The leading correction reproduces the \(1/N\) connected contribution observed in the large-\(p\) SYK model at infinite temperature. Finally, we examine the time evolution of operator Krylov complexity for a matter chord in the triple-scaled regime, linking it to the renormalized two-sided length in JT gravity with matter.</description>

      <title>Fully-frustrated octahedral antiferromagnets: emergent complexity in external field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Octahedral antiferromagnets are distinguished by crystal lattices composed of octahedra of magnetic ions. In the fully frustrated case, the Heisenberg Hamiltonian can be represented as a sum of squares of total spins for each octahedral block. We study the fully frustrated spin model for a lattice of edge-shared octahedra, which corresponds to the J1-J2 fcc antiferromagnet with J2/J1 = 1/2. The magnetization process at this strongly frustrated point features a remarkably rich sequence of different magnetic phases that include fractional plateaus at m = 1/3 and 2/3 values of the total magnetization. By performing extensive Monte Carlo simulations we construct the H-T phase diagram of the classical model with eight field-induced states, which acquire stability via the order by disorder mechanism. These antiferromagnetic states have distinct spin configurations of their octahedral blocks. The same spin configurations are also relevant for the fully frustrated corner-shared model bringing an apparent similarity to their field-induced states.</description>
