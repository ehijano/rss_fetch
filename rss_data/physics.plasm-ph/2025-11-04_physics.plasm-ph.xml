      <title>Observation of Ion-wave Satellites to Laser Harmonics in Intense Picosecond Laser-Solid Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detailed spectra of harmonics produced from ultra-intense, sub-picosecond, high-contrast laser pulses incident on solid targets have shown the first observation of regular red- and blue-shifted satellites. Their frequency shift is slightly less than the frequency of a nominal, pure ion-plasma wave associated with electron critical density, where an ion-acoustic wave would be expected. We explain this as the result of a substantial reduction of Debye shielding as the intense optical fields compete to drive electrons in large-amplitude oscillations. This general effect leads to a larger, dynamical and anisotropic Debye length, which should have a broad impact on plasma physics in this regime.</description>

      <title>Experimental investigation of plasma-electrode interactions on the ZaP-HD sheared-flow-stabilized Z-pinch device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ZaP-HD sheared-flow-stabilized (SFS) Z-pinch device is a testbed for experimental investigation of plasma-electrode interactions. The graphite electrode is exposed to a high temperature, high density Z-pinch plasma while supplying large pinch currents. In-situ measurements of the gross carbon erosion flux obtained with S/XB spectroscopy exceed the expected flux from physical sputtering, but have reasonable agreement with the expected sublimation flux. Comparison of the ionization mean free paths of neutrals produced through both erosion processes shows that sublimated carbon is ionized within the sheath while sputtered carbon is ionized beyond the sheath. This suggests a process of electrode recycling and self-healing through redeposition. The sputtered carbon is primarily responsible for net erosion. Ex-situ analysis of electrode material is enabled by the design of a removable coupon. Three different plasma exposure conditions varied the pinch current and number of pulses. Net mass loss measurements support the physical picture of electrode recycling. Erosion rates range from 0.01 to 0.1 mg/C, which are comparable to existing arc discharge devices. Measurements of the microscopic surface morphology and roughness reveal irregular consolidated structures and general smoothing except at high particle fluence. Crack formation suggests the importance of repetitive thermal cycles. Definitive features of sputtering such as pitting and cratering are absent, although further study is needed to attribute the observed changes to other processes. These results indicate some alignment with erosion processes in high-powered arc discharges, which successfully operate solid electrodes in extreme environments. This provides confidence in managing electrode erosion in the SFS Z-pinch configuration.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear effects in light-ion stopping powers within real-time time-dependent density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic stopping power models describing fuel heating processes in inertial fusion energy concepts typically assume linear-response behavior through quadratic scaling with the projectile charge. We report the results of real-time time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations indicating that even for low-Z ions, nonlinear processes modify stopping powers in warm dense matter by about 10% near and below the Bragg peak. By describing partial neutralization of slow ions, analytic effective charge models capture some qualitative aspects of the TDDFT results but do not always offer quantitative accuracy. Cases where the effective charge inferred from TDDFT exceeds the bare ion charge suggest that more complex nonlinear effects also contribute. These findings will inform future improvements to more efficient stopping power models.</description>

      <title>Dragging of electric current by hydrodynamic flow at charge neutrality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory of drag in graphene double layers near charge neutrality. We work in the regime of electron hydrodynamics and account for interlayer correlations of charge puddle disorder. The drag resistivity is expressed in terms of the viscosity, intrinsic conductivity of the electron liquid, and the correlation function of the puddle disorder. The contributions of the interlayer transfer of momentum and energy to drag have opposite signs. This leads to a nonmonotonic dependence of the drag resistivity on the carrier density. For layer-symmetric doping, the drag resistivity changes sign as a function of the carrier density. At interlayer separations shorter than the disorder correlation length, the transconductivity saturates to the disorder-induced enhancement of the intralayer conductivity. We provide quantitative estimates of the effect for Dirac electron liquids in monolayer graphene and bilayer graphene double-layer devices.</description>

      <title>Sawtooth crash in tokamak as a sequence of Multi-region Relaxed MHD equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study examines the sawtooth crash phenomenon in tokamak plasmas by modelling it as a sequence of Multi-region Relaxed Magnetohydrodynamic (MRxMHD) equilibria. Using the Stepped-Pressure Equilibrium Code (SPEC), we constructed a series of equilibria representing intermediate states during the sawtooth crash, with progressively increasing reconnection regions. Numerical results demonstrated that the system prefers the lower energy non-axisymmetric equilibria with islands and is eventually back to an axisymmetric state, capturing key features of the reconnection process. Comparisons with the nonlinear MHD code M3D-C1 showed remarkable agreement on the field-line topology, the safety factor, and the current profile. However, the simplified MRxMHD model does not resolve the detailed structure of the current sheet. Despite this limitation, MRxMHD offers an insightful approach and a complementary perspective to initial-value MHD simulations.</description>

      <title>Fourier Transform Method Of A Detailed Configuration Accounting In Hot Plasma Bound-Bound Opacity Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: G.~Hazak and J.~Kurzweil discovered a method of configurational resolution of transition arrays for the Super Transition Arrays approach to the bound-bound opacity calculation. Their method is based on the representation of the photoabsorption coefficient as the Fourier transform, the linearity of the transition energy between configurations with respect to shell occupation numbers, and factorization of the probabilities of configurations on shell occupation numbers. We extend the Hazak -- Kurzweil method for the calculations with Detailed Configuration Accounting. The resulting expressions for the bound-bound opacity represent an alternative to the widely used ones and are quite convenient for numerical implementation.</description>

      <title>Transition to Petschek Reconnection in Subrelativistic Pair Plasmas: Implications for Particle Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While relativistic magnetic reconnection in pair plasmas has emerged in recent years as a candidate for the origin of radiation from extreme astrophysical environments, the corresponding subrelativistic pair plasma regime has remained less explored, leaving open the question of how relativistic physics affects reconnection. In this paper, we investigate the differences between these regimes by contrasting 2D particle-in-cell simulations of reconnection in pair plasmas with relativistic magnetization ($\sigma \gg 1$) and subrelativistic magnetization ($\sigma &lt; 1$). By utilizing unprecedentedly large domain sizes and outflow boundary conditions, we demonstrate that lowering the magnetization results in a change in the reconnection geometry from a plasmoid chain to a Petschek geometry, where laminar exhausts bounded by slow-mode shocks emanate from a single diffusion region. We attribute this change to the reduced plasmoid production rate in the low-$\sigma$ case: when the secondary tearing rate is sufficiently low, plasmoids are too few in number to prevent the system from relaxing into a stable Petschek configuration. This geometric change also affects particle energization: we show that while high-$\sigma$ plasmoid chains generate power-law energy spectra, low-$\sigma$ Petschek exhausts merely heat incoming plasma and yield negligible nonthermal acceleration. These results have implications for predicting the global current sheet geometry and the resulting energy spectrum in a variety of systems.</description>

      <title>Constructing Field Aligned Coordinate Systems for Gyrokinetic Simulations of Tokamaks in X-point Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Structures in tokamak plasmas are elongated along the direction of the magnetic field and short in the directions perpendicular to the magnetic field. Many tokamak simulation codes take advantage of this by using a field aligned coordinate system. However, field aligned coordinate systems have a coordinate singularity at magnetic X-points where the poloidal magnetic field vanishes, which makes it difficult to use field aligned coordinate systems when simulating the core and scrape-off layer (SOL) simultaneously. Here we present an algorithm for computing geometric quantities in a standard field aligned coordinate system that avoids the singularity and allows one to conduct 2D axisymmetric simulations in X-point geometries. We demonstrate the efficacy of this algorithm with an example simulation of the Spherical Tokamak for Energy Production (STEP).</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field-Line Curvature and Its Role in Particle Acceleration by Magnetically Dominated Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ first-principles, fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations to investigate magnetic field-line curvature in magnetically dominated turbulent plasmas and its role in particle acceleration through curvature-drift motion along the motional electric field. By varying the fluctuation-to-mean magnetic-field ratio $\delta B_0/B_0$, we examine curvature $\kappa$ statistics and their connection to particle acceleration. The curvature probability densities display broad power-law wings, scaling linearly in $\kappa$ below the peak and developing hard high-$\kappa$ tails for $\delta B_0/B_0 \gtrsim 1$. As the mean field strengthens, the high-$\kappa$ tails steepen, and large-curvature events are suppressed when $\delta B_0/B_0 \ll 1$. The probability density functions of magnetic field-line contraction, ${\bf v}_E \cdot {\bf \kappa}$, with ${\bf v}_E$ the field-line velocity, develop power-law tails well described by a symmetric Pareto distribution, characteristic of stochastic energy exchanges, with the tails becoming harder as $\delta B_0/B_0$ increases. Our guiding-center analysis shows that curvature-drift acceleration accounts for a substantial fraction of the energization via the motional electric field, and that it strengthens with increasing $\delta B_0/B_0$. For well-magnetized particles, curvature-drift acceleration typically exceeds ${\bf\nabla}B$ drift, polarization drift, and betatron contributions. These results identify curvature-drift acceleration as a principal pathway through which magnetized turbulence transfers energy to nonthermal particles in astrophysical plasmas.</description>
