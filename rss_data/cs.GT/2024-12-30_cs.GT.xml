      <title>Game-Theoretically Secure Distributed Protocols for Fair Allocation in Coalitional Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider game-theoretically secure distributed protocols for coalition games that approximate the Shapley value with small multiplicative error. Since all known existing approximation algorithms for the Shapley value are randomized, it is a challenge to design efficient distributed protocols among mutually distrusted players when there is no central authority to generate unbiased randomness. The game-theoretic notion of maximin security has been proposed to offer guarantees to an honest player's reward even if all other players are susceptible to an adversary.
  Permutation sampling is often used in approximation algorithms for the Shapley value. A previous work in 1994 by Zlotkin et al. proposed a simple constant-round distributed permutation generation protocol based on commitment scheme, but it is vulnerable to rushing attacks. The protocol, however, can detect such attacks.
  In this work, we model the limited resources of an adversary by a violation budget that determines how many times it can perform such detectable attacks. Therefore, by repeating the number of permutation samples, an honest player's reward can be guaranteed to be close to its Shapley value. We explore both high probability and expected maximin security. We obtain an upper bound on the number of permutation samples for high probability maximin security, even with an unknown violation budget. Furthermore, we establish a matching lower bound for the weaker notion of expected maximin security in specific permutation generation protocols. We have also performed experiments on both synthetic and real data to empirically verify our results.</description>

      <title>Reforming an Unfair Allocation by Exchanging Goods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fairly allocating indivisible goods is a frequently occurring task in everyday life. Given an initial allocation of the goods, we consider the problem of reforming it via a sequence of exchanges to attain fairness in the form of envy-freeness up to one good (EF1). We present a vast array of results on the complexity of determining whether it is possible to reach an EF1 allocation from the initial allocation and, if so, the minimum number of exchanges required. In particular, we uncover several distinctions based on the number of agents involved and their utility functions. Furthermore, we derive essentially tight bounds on the worst-case number of exchanges needed to achieve EF1.</description>

      <title>Bidding Games on Markov Decision Processes with Quantitative Reachability Objectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph games are fundamental in strategic reasoning of multi-agent systems and their environments. We study a new family of graph games which combine stochastic environmental uncertainties and auction-based interactions among the agents, formalized as bidding games on (finite) Markov decision processes (MDP). Normally, on MDPs, a single decision-maker chooses a sequence of actions, producing a probability distribution over infinite paths. In bidding games on MDPs, two players -- called the reachability and safety players -- bid for the privilege of choosing the next action at each step. The reachability player's goal is to maximize the probability of reaching a target vertex, whereas the safety player's goal is to minimize it. These games generalize traditional bidding games on graphs, and the existing analysis techniques do not extend. For instance, the central property of traditional bidding games is the existence of a threshold budget, which is a necessary and sufficient budget to guarantee winning for the reachability player. For MDPs, the threshold becomes a relation between the budgets and probabilities of reaching the target. We devise value-iteration algorithms that approximate thresholds and optimal policies for general MDPs, and compute the exact solutions for acyclic MDPs, and show that finding thresholds is at least as hard as solving simple-stochastic games.</description>

      <title>The Value of Recall in Extensive-Form Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imperfect-recall games, in which players may forget previously acquired information, have found many practical applications, ranging from game abstractions to team games and testing AI agents. In this paper, we quantify the utility gain by endowing a player with perfect recall, which we call the value of recall (VoR). While VoR can be unbounded in general, we parameterize it in terms of various game properties, namely the structure of chance nodes and the degree of absentmindedness (the number of successive times a player enters the same information set). Further, we identify several pathologies that arise with VoR, and show how to circumvent them. We also study the complexity of computing VoR, and how to optimally apportion partial recall. Finally, we connect VoR to other previously studied concepts in game theory, including the price of anarchy. We use that connection in conjunction with the celebrated smoothness framework to characterize VoR in a broad class of games.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of allocating the revenues raised via paid subscriptions to music streaming platforms among participating artists. We show that the main methods to solve streaming problems (pro-rata, user-centric and families generalizing them) can be seen as specific (well-known) rules to solve (multi-issue) claims problems. Our results permit to provide strong links between the well-established literature on claims problems and the emerging literature on streaming problems.</description>

      <title>Random Assignment of Indivisible Goods under Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.07666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of random assignment of indivisible goods, in which each agent has an ordinal preference and a constraint. Our goal is to characterize the conditions under which there always exists a random assignment that simultaneously satisfies efficiency and envy-freeness. The probabilistic serial mechanism ensures the existence of such an assignment for the unconstrained setting. In this paper, we consider a more general setting in which each agent can consume a set of items only if the set satisfies her feasibility constraint. Such constraints must be taken into account in student course placements, employee shift assignments, and so on. We demonstrate that an efficient and envy-free assignment may not exist even for the simple case of partition matroid constraints, where the items are categorized, and each agent demands one item from each category. We then identify special cases in which an efficient and envy-free assignment always exists. For these cases, the probabilistic serial cannot be naturally extended; therefore, we provide mechanisms to find the desired assignment using various approaches.</description>

      <title>Economic DAO Governance: A Contestable Control Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16980v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we propose a new form of DAO governance that uses a sequential auction mechanism to overcome entrenched control issues that have emerged for DAOs by creating a regime of temporary contestable control. The mechanism avoids potential public choice problems inherent in voting approaches but at the same time provides a vehicle that can enhance and secure value that inheres to DAO voting and other DAO non-market governance procedures. It is robust to empty voting and is code feasible. It not only facilitates the ability of DAOs to meet their normative and operational goals in the face of diverse regulatory approaches, but also strengthens the case for creating a less burdensome but at least equally effective regulatory regime for DAOs that employ the mechanism. Designed to shift control to the party with the most promising business plan, at the same time it deters value destruction by control parties, maximizes social surplus, and distributes that surplus in a way that tends to promote investment by other parties both at start up and on an on-going basis.</description>

      <title>Fair and Efficient Completion of Indivisible Goods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate the problem of fair and efficient completion of indivisible goods, defined as follows: Given a partial allocation of indivisible goods among agents, does there exist an allocation of the remaining goods (i.e., a completion) that satisfies fairness and economic efficiency guarantees of interest? We study the computational complexity of the completion problem for prominent fairness and efficiency notions such as envy-freeness up one good (EF1), proportionality up to one good (Prop1), maximin share (MMS), and Pareto optimality (PO), and focus on the class of additive valuations as well as its subclasses such as binary additive and lexicographic valuations. We find that while the completion problem is significantly harder than the standard fair division problem (wherein the initial partial allocation is empty), the consideration of restricted preferences facilitates positive algorithmic results for threshold-based fairness notions (Prop1 and MMS). On the other hand, the completion problem remains computationally intractable for envy-based notions such as EF1 and EF1+PO even under restricted preferences.</description>

      <title>Maximum Flow is Fair: A Network Flow Approach to Committee Voting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the committee voting setting, a subset of $k$ alternatives is selected based on the preferences of voters. In this paper, our goal is to efficiently compute $\textit{ex-ante}$ fair probability distributions over committees. We introduce a new axiom called $\textit{group resource proportionality}$, which strengthens other fairness notions in the literature. We characterize our fairness axiom by a correspondence with max flows on a network formulation of committee voting. Using the connection to flow networks revealed by this characterization, we introduce two voting rules which achieve fairness in conjunction with other desiderata. The first rule - the $\textit{redistributive utilitarian rule}$ - satisfies ex-ante efficiency in addition to our fairness axiom. The second rule - Generalized CUT - reduces instances of our problem to instances of the minimum-cost maximum flow problem. We show that Generalized CUT maximizes social welfare subject to our fairness axiom and additionally satisfies an incentive compatibility property known as $\textit{excludable strategyproofness}$. Lastly, we show our fairness property can be obtained in tandem with strong $\textit{ex-post}$ fairness properties - an approach known as $\textit{best-of-both-worlds}$ fairness. We strengthen existing best-or-both-worlds fairness results in committee voting and resolve an open question posed by Aziz et al. [2023].</description>

      <title>Voter Priming Campaigns: Strategies, Equilibria, and Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Issue salience is a major determinant in voters' decisions. Candidates and political parties campaign to shift salience to their advantage - a process termed priming. We study the dynamics, strategies and equilibria of campaign spending for voter priming in multi-issue multi-party settings. We consider both parliamentary elections, where parties aim to maximize their share of votes, and various settings for presidential elections, where the winner takes all. For parliamentary elections, we show that pure equilibrium spending always exists and can be computed in time linear in the number of voters. For two parties and all settings, a spending equilibrium exists such that each party invests only in a single issue, and an equilibrium can be computed in time that is polynomial in the number of issues and linear in the number of voters. We also show that in most presidential settings no equilibrium exists. Additional properties of optimal campaign strategies are also studied.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Resource Allocation with Karma: An Experimental Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02687v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A system of non-tradable credits that flow between individuals like karma, hence proposed under that name, is a mechanism for repeated resource allocation that comes with attractive efficiency and fairness properties, in theory. In this study, we test karma in an online experiment in which human subjects repeatedly compete for a resource with time-varying and stochastic individual preferences or urgency to acquire the resource. We confirm that karma has significant and sustained welfare benefits even in a population with no prior training. We identify mechanism usage in contexts with sporadic high urgency, more so than with frequent moderate urgency, and implemented as a simple (binary) karma bidding scheme as particularly effective for welfare improvements: relatively larger aggregate efficiency gains are realized that are (almost) Pareto superior. These findings provide guidance for further testing and for future implementation plans of such mechanisms in the real world.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Decentralized Actor-Critic Algorithm in General-sum Markov Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04613v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Markov games provide a powerful framework for modeling strategic multi-agent interactions in dynamic environments. Traditionally, convergence properties of decentralized learning algorithms in these settings have been established only for special cases, such as Markov zero-sum and potential games, which do not fully capture real-world interactions. In this paper, we address this gap by studying the asymptotic properties of learning algorithms in general-sum Markov games. In particular, we focus on a decentralized algorithm where each agent adopts an actor-critic learning dynamic with asynchronous step sizes. This decentralized approach enables agents to operate independently, without requiring knowledge of others' strategies or payoffs. We introduce the concept of a Markov Near-Potential Function (MNPF) and demonstrate that it serves as an approximate Lyapunov function for the policy updates in the decentralized learning dynamics, which allows us to characterize the convergent set of strategies. We further strengthen our result under specific regularity conditions and with finite Nash equilibria.</description>

      <title>Optimal Capacity Modification for Stable Matchings with Ties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10284v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Hospital/Residents (HR) problem in the presence of ties in preference lists. Among the three notions of stability, viz. weak, strong, and super stability, we focus on the notion of strong stability. Strong stability has many desirable properties, both theoretically and practically; however, its existence is not guaranteed.
  In this paper, our objective is to optimally increase the quotas of hospitals to ensure that a strongly stable matching exists in the modified instance. First, we show that if ties are allowed in residents' preference lists, it may not be possible to augment the hospital quotas to obtain an instance that admits a strongly stable matching. When residents' preference lists are strict, we explore two natural optimization criteria: (i) minimizing the total capacity increase across all hospitals (MINSUM) and (ii) minimizing the maximum capacity increase for any hospital (MINMAX). We show that the MINSUM problem admits a poly-time algorithm. However, when each hospital incurs a cost for each capacity increase, the problem becomes NP-hard, even if the costs are 0 or 1. This implies that the problem cannot be approximated to any multiplicative factor. We also consider a related problem under the MINSUM objective. Given an HR instance and a forced pair $(r^*,h^*)$, the goal is to decide if it is possible to increase hospital quotas (if necessary) to obtain a strongly stable matching that matches the pair $(r^*,h^*)$. We show a poly-time algorithm for this problem.
  We show that the MINMAX problem is NP-hard in general. When hospital preference lists have ties of length at most $\ell+1$, we give a poly-time algorithm that increases each hospital's quota by at most $\ell$. Amongst all instances obtained by at most $\ell$ augmentations per hospital, our algorithm produces a strongly stable matching that is best for residents.</description>
