      <title>Decay properties for massive Vlasov fields on Schwarzschild spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain pointwise decay estimates in time for massive Vlasov fields on the exterior of Schwarzschild spacetime. We consider massive Vlasov fields supported on the closure of the largest domain of the mass-shell where timelike geodesics either cross $\mathcal{H}^+$, or escape to infinity. For this class of Vlasov fields, we prove that the components of the energy-momentum tensor decay like $v^{-\frac{1}{3}}$ in the bounded region $\{r\leq R\}$, and like $u^{-\frac{1}{3}}r^{-2}$ in the far-away region $\{r\geq R\}$, where $R&gt;2M$ is sufficiently large. Here, $(u,v)$ denotes the standard Eddington--Finkelstein double null coordinate pair.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the quadrupolar gravitoelectric tidal Love numbers of spherical configurations made of anisotropic matter. Anisotropies are introduced within the vanishing complexity factor, while interior solutions are obtained adopting the Extended Chaplygin gas equation-of-state. A comparison with a more conventional approach is made as well.</description>

      <title>The effects of data gaps on ringdown signals with space-based joint observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In space-based gravitational wave observatories such as Taiji, LISA, and TianQin, data gaps are inevitable due to mission design, implementation, and the long duration of observations. These data gaps degrade data quality and cause spectral leakage during Fourier transformations. Since ringdown signals are a key scientific objective for these observatories, it is crucial to assess the impact of data gaps on ringdown signal observations. This study employs LISA's science requirement of maintaining a duty cycle of at least 75% to evaluate the worst-case impact of data gaps, and uses massive black hole binary catalogs to assess the average effects. Our findings indicate that, on average, data gaps increase parameter estimation errors by approximately 2.1 times for the (2,2) mode and by about 1.6 times for the (3,3) mode. Joint observation is commonly employed to alleviate the impact of data gaps. Similarly, we have evaluated the effects of joint observation with two configurations, Taiji-LISA and Taiji-TianQin, which demonstrate notable mitigation of the effects of data gaps. This work provides a quantitative assessment of data gaps on ringdown signals and highlights the significance of joint observation.</description>

      <title>Effects of additional sources on Casimir Wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this contribution we explore the consequences of including additional sources to the original Casimir energy Stress-Energy Tensor. In particular, we will discuss the effects of an additional electromagnetic field, the modification induced by non-zero temperature effects on the energy density obtained by a Casimir device and finally the effect obtained by including a massless scalar field. For each of these examples, we have introduced an auxiliary stress tensor which we have interpreted as a thermal tensor. Consequences on the size of the throat are also discussed. We will show that these additional extra fields do not destroy the traversability of the wormhole.</description>

      <title>Universal black hole solutions for all F(R) gravitational theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extended gravitational models have gained large attention in the last couple of decades. In this work, we examine the solution space of vacuum, static, and spherically symmetric spacetimes within $F(R)$ theories, introducing novel methods that reduce the vacuum equations to a single second-order equation. For the first time, we derive analytic expressions for the metric functions in terms of the arbitrary functional $F(R)$, providing detailed insight into how the gravitational action impacts the structure of spacetime. We analyze conditions under which solutions are asymptotically flat, regular at the core, and contain an event horizon, obtaining explicit expressions for entropy, temperature, and specific heat in terms of $F(R)$. By using a single metric degree of freedom, we identify the most general solution and examine its (un)physical properties, showing that resolving singularities is not possible within this restricted framework in vacuum. For the general case involving two metric functions, we use several approximation schemes to explore corrections to Schwarzschild-(anti)de Sitter spacetimes, finding that $F(R)$ extensions to General Relativity induce instabilities that are not negligible. Finally, through an analysis of axial perturbations, we derived a general expression for the potential of quasinormal modes of a black hole as a function of the arbitrary Lagrangian.</description>

      <title>Echoes from Beyond: Detecting Gravitational Wave Quantum Imprints with LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We assess the prospects for detecting gravitational wave echoes arising due to the quantum nature of black hole horizons with LISA. In a recent proposal, Bekenstein's black hole area quantization is connected to a discrete absorption spectrum for black holes in the context of gravitational radiation. Consequently, for incoming radiation at the black hole horizon, not all frequencies are absorbed, raising the possibility that the unabsorbed radiation is reflected, producing an echo-like signal closely following the binary coalescence waveform. In this work, we further develop this proposal by introducing a robust, phenomenologically motivated model for black hole reflectivity. Using this model, we calculate the resulting echoes for an ensemble of Numerical Relativity waveforms and examine their detectability with the LISA space-based interferometer. Our analysis demonstrates promising detection prospects and shows that, upon detection, LISA provides a direct probe of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. In addition, we find that the information extractable from LISA data offers valuable constraints on a wide range of quantum gravity theories.</description>

      <title>Comparison of global networks of third-generation gravitational-wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the performances of a world-wide network made by a European third-generation gravitational-wave (GW) detector, together with a 40-km Cosmic Explorer detector in the US, considering three scenarios for the European detector: (1) Einstein Telescope (ET) in its 10-km triangle configuration; (2) ET in its configuration featuring two 15-km L-shaped detectors in different sites, still taken to have all other ET characteristics (underground, and with each detector made of a high-frequency interferometer and a cryogenic low-frequency interferometer); (3) A single L-shaped underground interferometer with the ET amplitude spectral density, either with 15~km or with 20~km arm length. Overall, we find that, if a 2L configuration should be retained for ET, the network made by a single-L European underground detector together with CE-40km could already provide a very interesting intermediate step toward the construction of a full 2L+CE network, and is in any case superior to a 10-km triangle not inserted in an international network.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from Primordial Black Hole Dark Matter Spikes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of the binary black hole mergers observed by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) remains an open question. We calculate the merger rate from primordial black holes (PBHs) within the density spike around supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the center of galaxies. We show that the merger rate within the spike is comparable to that within the wider dark matter halo. We also calculate the extreme mass ratio inspiral (EMRI) signal from PBHs hosted within the density spike spiralling into their host SMBHs due to GW emission. We predict that LISA may detect $\sim10^4$ of these EMRIs with signal-to-noise ratio of 5 within a 4-year observation run, if all dark matter is made up of PBHs. Uncertainties in our rates come from the uncertain mass fraction of PBHs within the dark matter spike, relative to the host central SMBHs, which defines the parameter space LISA can constrain.</description>

      <title>Self-gravitating isothermal sphere in an expanding background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05393v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatially homogeneous thermal equilibria of self-gravitating gas, being impossible otherwise, are nevertheless allowed in an expanding background accounting for Universe's expansion. Furthermore, a fixed density at the boundary of a perturbation is a natural boundary condition keeping the mass finite inside without the need to invoke any unphysical walls. These facts allow us to develop a consistent gravitational thermodynamics of isothermal spheres inside an expanding Universe. In the canonical and grand canonical ensembles we identify an instability for both homogeneous and inhomogeneous equilibria. We discuss a potential astrophysical application. If such an instability is triggered on baryonic gas at high redshift $z &gt; 137$ when the primary baryonic component, namely atomic hydrogen, was still thermally locked to the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation, then the corresponding destabilized gaseous clouds have baryonic mass $\geq 0.8\cdot 10^5 {\rm M}_\odot$ and radius $\geq 15{\rm pc}$.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical gravity phenomenology under the causal-conditional quantum measurement prescription II: Heisenberg picture and apparent optical entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of quantum states influenced by semiclassical gravity is distinct from that in quantum gravity theory due to the presence of a state-dependent gravitational potential. This state-dependent potential introduces nonlinearity into the state evolution, of which the theory is named Schroedinger-Newton (SN) theory. The formalism for understanding the continuous quantum measurement process on the quantum state in the context of semiclassical gravity theory has been previously discussed using the Schr\"odinger picture in Paper I [1]. In this work, an equivalent formalism using the Heisenberg picture is developed and applied to the analysis of two optomechanical experiment protocols that targeted testing the quantum nature of gravity. This Heisenberg picture formalism of the SN theory has the advantage of helping the investigation of the covariance matrices of the outgoing light fields in these protocols and further the entanglement features. We found that the classical gravity between the quantum trajectories of two mirrors under continuous quantum measurement in the SN theory can induce an apparent entanglement of the outgoing light field (though there is no quantum entanglement of the mirrors), which could serve as a false alarm for those experiments designed for probing the quantum gravity induced entanglement.</description>

Abstract: We study mathematical aspects concerning two site tree-level cosmological correlators with massive internal and external states in a de Sitter universe. We employ integration by parts identities, (relative) twisted cohomology and the method of differential equations. We explicitly express the internally massive, externally conformally coupled correlator as a power series with respect to a small mass parameter, where the various terms in the series are given by multiple polylogarithms.</description>

      <title>The St\"uckelberg Path to Pure de Sitter Supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We advance the study of pure de Sitter supergravity by introducing a finite formulation of unimodular supergravity via the super-St\"uckelberg mechanism. Building on previous works, we construct a complete four-dimensional action of spontaneously broken ${\cal N}\!\!=\!\!1$ supergravity to all orders, which allows for de Sitter solutions. The introduction of finite supergravity transformations extends the super-St\"uckelberg procedure beyond the second order, offering a recursive solution to all orders in the goldstino sector. This work bridges the earlier perturbative approaches and the complete finite theory, opening new possibilities for de Sitter vacua in supergravity models and eventually string theory.</description>

Abstract: The Einstein Telescope faces a critical data analysis challenge with correlated noise, often overlooked in current parameter estimation analyses. We address this issue by presenting the statistical formulation of the likelihood that includes correlated noise for the Einstein Telescope or any detector network. By considering varying degrees of correlation, we probe the impact of noise correlations on the parameter estimation analysis of a GW150914-like event. We show that neglecting these correlations may significantly reduce the accuracy of the chirp mass reconstruction. This emphasizes how critical a proper treatment of correlated noise is, as presented in this work, to unlocking the wealth of results promised by the Einstein Telescope.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the charge of the graviton using gravitational wave observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05038v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If the graviton possesses a non-zero charge $q_g$, gravitational waves (GW) originating from astrophysical sources would experience an additional time delay due to intergalactic magnetic fields. This would result in a modification of the phase evolution of the observed GW signal similar to the effect induced by a massive graviton. As a result, we can reinterpret the most recent upper limits on the graviton's mass as constraints on the joint mass-charge parameter space, finding $|q_g|/{e} &lt; 3\times 10^{-34}$ where $e$ represents the charge of an electron. Additionally, we illustrate that a charged graviton would introduce a constant phase difference in the gravitational waves detected by two spatially separated GW detectors due to the Aharonov-Bohm effect. Using the non-observation of such a phase difference for the GW event GW190814, we establish a mass-independent constraint $|q_g|/e &lt; 2\times 10^{-26}$. To the best of our knowledge, our results constitute the first-ever bounds on the charge of the graviton. We also discuss various caveats involved in our measurements and prospects for strengthening these bounds with future GW observations.</description>

      <title>On the single versus the repetitive Penrose process in a Kerr black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08229v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extracting the rotational energy from a Kerr black hole (BH) is one of the crucial topics in relativistic astrophysics. Here, we give special attention to the Penrose ballistic process based on the fission of a massive particle $\mu_0$ into two particles $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$, occurring in the ergosphere of a Kerr BH. Bardeen et al. indicated that for the process to occur, some additional "hydrodynamical forces or superstrong radiation reactions" were needed. Wald and Chandrasekhar further expanded this idea. This animosity convinced T. Piran and collaborators to move from a simple three-body system characterizing the original Penrose process to a many-body system. This many-body approach was further largely expanded by others, some questionable in their validity. Here, we return to the simplest original Penrose process and show that the solution of the equations of motion, imposing the turning point condition on their trajectories, leads to the rotational energy extraction from the BH expected by Penrose. The efficiency of energy extraction by a single process is quantified for three different single decay processes occurring respectively at $r=1.2 M$, $r=1.5 M$, and $r=1.9 M$. An interesting repetitive model has been proposed by Misner, Thorne \&amp; Wheeler (hereafter MTW73). Indeed, it would appear that a repetitive sequence of $246$ decays of the above injection process at $r=1.2 M$ and the corresponding ones at $r=1.5 M$ and $r=1.9 M$ could extract $100\%$ of the rotational energy of the BH, so violating energy conservation. The accompanying paper, accounting for the existence of the BH irreducible mass, introduces a non-linear approach that avoids violating energy conservation and leads to a new energy extraction process.</description>

      <title>Semi-classical imprints on quasinormal mode spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18631v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute quasinormal mode frequencies for static limits of physical black holes - semi-classical black hole solutions to Einstein-Hilbert gravity characterized by the finite formation time of an apparent horizon and its weak regularity. These assumptions lead to a highly constrained yet non-trivial form of the metric and components of the energy-momentum tensor near the horizon, which contain as a special case many known models of black holes. Using a two-point M-fraction approximation to construct an interpolating metric which captures the essential near-horizon and asymptotic properties of black holes, we explore a large part of the parameter space that characterizes the near-horizon geometry. We cast the perturbation problem as a discretized homogeneous eigensystem and compute the low-lying quasinormal mode frequencies for perturbations of a massless scalar field. Working in spherical symmetry, we provide rough constraints on leading and subleading deviations from the Schwarzschild solution which arise in a semi-classical setting, and demonstrate the potential for mimicking signatures of axially-symmetric geometries from a spherically-symmetric source.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-Wave Data Analysis with High-Precision Numerical Relativity Simulations of Boson Star mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave signals detected to date are commonly interpreted under the paradigm that they originate from pairs of black holes or neutron stars. Here, we explore the alternative scenario of boson-star signals being present in the data stream. We perform accurate and long ($\sim 20$ orbits) numerical simulations of boson-star binaries and inject the resulting strain into LIGO noise. Our Bayesian inference reveals that some boson-star signals. are degenerate with current approximants, albeit with biased parameters, while others exhibit smoking-gun signatures leaving behind conspicuous residuals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05272v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, the quasinormal modes and greybody factor of charged black hole in non-commutative geometry are studied. Under the assumption of a uniformly distributed charge within the matter, we obtain the metric for a charged black hole in non-commutative geometry. We calculated the wave function and obtained the effective potential of three different perturbed fields with spin. Then we applied $6^{\rm{th}}$ order WKB method to analyze the quasinormal modes of the black hole and derived quasinormal frequencies. Futhermore, we discussed the greybody factor in different perturbed fields under this spacetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11428v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we have investigated the phase space analysis in modified Galileon cosmology, where the Galileon term is considered a coupled scalar field, $F(\phi)$. We focus on the exponential type function of $F(\phi)$ and the three well-motivated potential functions $V(\phi)$. We obtain the critical points of the autonomous system, along with their stability conditions and cosmological properties. The critical points of the autonomous system describe different phases of the Universe. In the results of our analysis, we have found the scaling solution for critical points, which determine different evolutionary eras for the Universe. The dark-energy-dominated critical points show stable behavior and indicate the Universe's late-time cosmic acceleration phase. Further, the results are examined with the cosmological data sets of the Hubble rate $H(z)$ and the Supernovae Ia.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effect of adding an interaction in the $G_3$ term of Horndeski theory, where the propagation of gravitational waves are not modified. We derive the background and perturbation equations of motion from the action. We also derive the no-ghost and Laplacian instability conditions for tensor modes and scalar mode propagation. Then we study the evolution of the matter perturbation in the quasi-static approximation. We find that the gravitational couplings to the baryonic and cold dark matter over density are modified in this theory. We introduce a concrete model of the free function in the theory and study the background and linear perturbation dynamics. We then use the genetic algorithm to test the model. We compare the $H(z)$ function of the model and the $H(z)$ curve predicted by the genetic algorithm, using the $H(z)$ data. For the perturbation sector we compute the $f\sigma_{8}$ observable for the model and compare it with the predicted function from the genetic algorithm from the $f\sigma_{8}$ data.</description>

      <title>On the convergence of cosmographic expansions in Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study cosmographic expansions of the luminosity distance for a variety of Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi models which we specify inspired by local large-scale structures of the universe. We consider cosmographic expansions valid for general spacetimes and compare to the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) limit of the expansions as well as to its naive isotropic extrapolation to an inhomogeneous universe. The FLRW expansions are often poor near the observer but become better at higher redshifts, where the light rays have reached the FLRW background. In line with this we find that the effective Hubble, deceleration and jerk parameters of the general cosmographic expansion are often very different from the global $\Lambda$CDM values, with deviations up to several orders of magnitude. By comparing with the naive isotropic extrapolation of the FLRW expansion, we assess that these large deviations are mainly due to gradients of the shear. Very close to the observer, the general cosmographic expansion is always best and becomes more precise when more expansion terms are included. However, we find that the convergence radius of the general cosmographic expansion is small for all studied models and observers and the general cosmographic expansion becomes poor for most of the studied observers already before a single LTB structure has been traversed. The small radius of convergence of the general cosmographic expansion has also been indicated by earlier work and may need careful attention before we can safely apply the general cosmographic expansion to real data.</description>

      <title>Flea on the elephant: Tidal Love numbers in subsolar primordial black hole searches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detecting subsolar objects in black hole binary mergers is considered a smoking gun signature of primordial black holes. Their supposedly vanishing tidal Love number is generically thought to help distinguish them from other subsolar and more deformable compact objects, such as neutron stars. We show that a large and detectable Love number of primordial black holes can be generated in the presence of even small disturbances of the system, thus potentially jeopardizing their discovery. However, such small perturbations are not tightly bound and are therefore disrupted before the mergers. We show that they leave a characteristic signature in the gravitational waveform that could be observed with current and future gravitational wave detectors. Thus, they may still hint towards the primordial nature of the black holes in the merger. Finally, we demonstrate that disregarding possible environmental effects in the matched-filter search for subsolar gravitational wave events can lead to a decreased sensitivity in the detectors.</description>

      <title>Slow-roll inflation from a geometric scalar-tensor model with self-interacting potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02975v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider slow-roll inflation in the context of a modified Brans-Dicke dilaton gravity. From a two self-interacting potentials $V(\phi)$, we reproduce a Starobinsky-like potential and, commonly in syperstring models, an exponential tail potential $V(\phi)\sim(1-e^{\alpha_0\phi})$, with $\alpha_0$ being a constant coefficient related to the Brans-Dicke parameter $\omega$. Using the observational bounds on the spectral index $n_s$ and tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ imposed by Planck-CMB baseline data and the BICEP2/Keck collaboration with combination with Planck 2018 and the Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations(BAO), we obtain for both models a good agreement with current observations with $n_s = 0.960 - 0.972$ and $r&lt;0.02$. In addition, the resulting large values of $\omega$ suggests a possible linkage of the inflationary regime and today's solar system bounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15460v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a full classification of general affine connections on Galilei manifolds in terms of independently specifiable tensor fields. This generalises the well-known case of (torsional) Galilei connections, i.e. connections compatible with the metric structure of the Galilei manifold. Similarly to the well-known pseudo-Riemannian case, the additional freedom for connections that are not metric-compatible lies in the covariant derivatives of the two tensors defining the metric structure (the clock form and the space metric), which however are not fully independent of each other.</description>

      <title>Kicking time back in black-hole mergers: Ancestral masses, spins, birth recoils and hierarchical-formation viability of GW190521</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pair-instability supernova (PISN) prevents black-hole formation from stellar collapse within the approximate mass range $M\in [65,130]M_\odot$. However, such black holes may form hierarchically through merging ancestral black holes, whose properties determine those of the ``child'' one: mass, spin, and recoil velocity. Crucially, the child will leave its host environment if its ``birth recoil'' exceeds the corresponding escape velocity, preventing further mergers. We exploit relations between the final recoil and spin of quasi-circular black-hole mergers to obtain posterior probability distributions for the hypothetical ancestral masses, spins and birth recoils of the component black holes of GW190521. To this, we present a Bayesian framework applicable to existing estimates for the components of black-hole merger observations. We consider both the quasi-circular (generically spinning) analysis performed by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration and the eccentric (aligned-spin) one performed by Romero-Shaw et. al. We evaluate the probability $p_{2g}$ that the GW190521 components inferred by these analyses formed from the merger of stellar-origin black holes and were retained by their environment. For the primary component, which populates the PISN gap, such scenario is strongly suppressed if GW190521 happened in a Globular Cluster with $p_{2g} \sim 10^{-3}$ unless it was quasi-circular and its ancestors had aligned-spins, uncharacteristic of hierarchical formation channels, or small spins, which yields $p_{2g} \simeq 10^{-2}$. If GW190521 was eccentric, we obtain $p_{2g} \simeq 0.1$ for any host other than an AGN, and zero for a Globular Cluster. If GW190521 was quasi-circular, a Nuclear-Star Cluster origin is possible with $p_{2g} \in (\sim 0.4 \sim ,0.8)$</description>

      <title>Interpreting DESI's evidence for evolving dark energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08056v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The latest results on baryon acoustic oscillations from DESI (Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument), when combined with cosmic microwave background and supernova data, show indications of a deviation from a cosmological constant in favour of evolving dark energy. Use of a pivot scale for the equation of state $w$ shows that this evidence is concentrated in the derivative of $w$ rather than its mean offset from $-1$, indicating a new cosmic coincidence where the mean equation of state matches that of the $\Lambda$CDM model precisely in the region probed by the observations. An equivalent way to express this is to say that the dark energy hits the maximum value that it will ever achieve within the observed window. We argue that conclusions on dark energy evolution are strongly driven by the assumed parameter priors and that this coincidence, which we are naming the PhantomX coincidence (where X stands for crossing), may be a signature of this.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the Genealogy of LIGO-Virgo Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a Bayesian inference framework to predict the merger history of LIGO-Virgo binary black holes (BHs), whose binary components may have undergone hierarchical mergers in the past. The framework relies on numerical relativity predictions for the mass, spin, and kick velocity of the remnant BHs. This proposed framework computes the masses, spins, and kicks imparted to the remnant of the parent binaries, given the initial masses and spin magnitudes of the binary constituents. We validate our approach by performing an ``injection study'' based on a constructed sequence of hierarchically formed binaries. Noise is added to the final binary in the sequence, and the parameters of the `parent' and `grandparent' binaries in the merger chain are then reconstructed. This method is then applied to three GWTC-3 events: GW190521, GW200220_061928, and GW190426_190642. These events were selected because at least one of the binary companions lies in the putative pair-instability supernova mass gap, in which stellar processes alone cannot produce BHs. Hierarchical mergers offer a natural explanation for the formation of BHs in the pair-instability mass gap. We use the backward evolution framework to predict the parameters of the parents of the primary companion of these three binaries. For instance, the parent binary of GW190521 has masses $72_{-22}^{+32}M_{\odot}$ and $31_{-23}^{+24}M_{\odot}$ within the 90% credible interval. Astrophysical environments with escape speeds $\geq100{\rm \, km \, s^{-1}}$ are preferred sites to host these events. Our approach can be readily applied to future high-mass gravitational wave events to predict their formation history under the hierarchical merger assumption.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Towards a classification of UV completable Higgs inflation in the framework of parity-even metric-affine gravity, we investigate the particle spectrum of a deformed theory in the large-$N$ limit. In a simple Higgs inflation model in metric-affine gravity, it is known that its UV cutoff is much smaller than the Planck scale. While it calls for UV completion, a concrete example has not yet been found, even with the large-$N$ limit known as a successful technique to complete an original Higgs inflation defined on the Riemannian geometry. This motivates us to study how small deformation of the simple Higgs inflation affects the emergence and properties of dynamical fields particularly in the large-$N$ limit. As a UV theory has to be free of ghosts or tachyons at least around Minkowski space, we perform the parameter search and find the healthy parameter region where a new heavy particle can propagate without these pathologies.</description>

      <title>Inflationary and Gravitational Wave Signatures of Small Primordial Black Holes as Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11948v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mounting evidence suggests that the semi-classical description of a black hole breaks down at the latest after losing an O(1) fraction of its mass. As a result, effects such as memory burden can slow down evaporation so that small primordial black holes (PBHs), in particular those in the mass range 10^6 g to 10^9 g, become viable dark matter candidates. In this paper, we investigate the production of PBHs from a prototype model of polynomial inflation with a non-minimal coupling to gravity. We show that a sufficiently small PBH mass alleviates any tension with CMB observations. Moreover, we develop efficient numerical procedures to identify model parameters and evolve Mukhanov-Sasaki modes to place bounds on the scalar-induced stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background. Whilst we identify some prospects for observation with future GW detectors, our results highlight the need to develop new experiments for high-frequency GW detection in the ~kHz to ~MHz range. Finally, we demonstrate that previously-used ans\"atze for modelling the power spectrum only yield a reliable approximation for the GW signal if some input from inflation is used.</description>
