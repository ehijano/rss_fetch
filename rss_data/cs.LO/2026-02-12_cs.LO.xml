      <title>A Weakest Precondition Calculus for Programs and Linear Temporal Specifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Auto-active program verification rests on the ability to effectively the translation from annotated programs into verification conditions that are then discharged by automated theorem provers in the background. Characteristic such tools, e.g., Why3, Dafny, and Viper, is that this process does not involve user interaction, expecting all guiding hints like invariants to be given upfront. For sequential correctness, this paradigm is well established, thanks to approaches like weakest precondition generation and symbolic execution. However, to capture temporal properties, the specification language of choice for a broader system perspective, additional concerns and challenges are introduced into the translation and proof. Approaches based on symbolic model-checking can verify such properties on system models, e.g., using automata constructions. However, ascribing temporal properties to structured and data-intensive programs is more difficult. Several program calculi have been proposed in the literature, each of which on their own falls short in some regard of supporting an auto-active workflow. However, all essential ideas, while perhaps some are not widely acknowledged, are in fact found in the literature. In this paper, we demonstrate how to assemble these ideas into a weakest-precondition calculus for linear temporal properties and demonstrate it with examples.</description>

      <title>IMITATOR4AMAS: Strategy Synthesis for STCTL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: IMITATOR4AMAS supports model checking and synthesis of memoryless imperfect information strategies for STCTL, interpreted over networks of parametric timed automata with asynchronous execution. While extending the verifier IMITATOR, IMITATOR4AMAS is the first tool for strategy synthesis in this setting. Our experimental results show a substantial speedup over previous approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.10824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define PSTCTL, a probabilistic variant of Strategic Timed CTL (STCTL), interpreted over stochastic multi-agent systems with continuous time and asynchronous execution semantics. STCTL extends TCTL with strategic operators in the style of ATL. Moreover, we demonstrate the feasibility of verification with irP-strategies.</description>

      <title>Generalized Decidability via Brouwer Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the setting of constructive mathematics, we suggest and study a framework for decidability of properties, which allows for finer distinctions than just "decidable, semidecidable, or undecidable". We work in homotopy type theory and use Brouwer ordinals to specify the level of decidability of a property. In this framework, we express the property that a proposition is $\alpha$-decidable, for a Brouwer ordinal $\alpha$, and show that it generalizes decidability and semidecidability. Further generalizing known results, we show that $\alpha$-decidable propositions are closed under binary conjunction, and discuss for which $\alpha$ they are closed under binary disjunction. We prove that if each $P(i)$ is semidecidable, then the countable meet $\forall i\in \mathbb N. P(i)$ is $\omega^2$-decidable, and similar results for countable joins and iterated quantifiers. We also discuss the relationship with countable choice. All our results are formalized in Cubical Agda.</description>

      <title>Multi-Environment MDPs with Prior and Universal Semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple-environment Markov decision processes (MEMDPs) equip an MDP with several probabilistic transition functions (one per possible environment) so that the state is observable but the environment is not. Previous work studies two semantics: (i) the universal semantics, where an adversary picks the environment; and (ii) the prior semantics, where the environment is drawn once before execution from a fixed distribution. We clarify the relation between these semantics. For parity objectives, we show that the qualitative questions, i.e. value one, coincide, and we develop a new algorithm for the general value of MEMDP with prior semantics. In particular, we show that the prior value of an MEMDP with a parity objective can be approximated to any precision with a space efficient algorithm; equivalently, the associated gap problem is decidable in PSPACE when probabilities are given in unary (and in EXPSPACE otherwise). We then prove that the universal value equals the infimum of prior values over all beliefs. This yields a new algorithm for the universal gap problem with the same complexity (PSPACE for unary probabilities, EXPSPACE in general), improving on earlier doubly-exponential-space procedures. Finally, we observe that MEMDPs under the prior semantics form an important tractable subclass of POMDPs: our algorithms exploit the fact that belief entropy never increases, and we establish that any POMDP with this property reduces effectively to a prior-MEMDP, showing that prior-MEMDPs capture a broad and practically relevant subclass of POMDPs.</description>

      <title>Towards Term-based Verification of Diagrammatic Equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A string diagram is a two-dimensional graphical representation that can be described as a one-dimensional term generated from a set of primitives using sequential and parallel compositions. Since different syntactic terms may represent the same diagram, this syntax is quotiented by a collection of coherence equations expressing equivalence up to deformation. This work lays foundations for automated reasoning about diagrammatic equivalence, motivated primarily by the verification of quantum circuit equivalences. We consider two classes of diagrams, for which we introduce normalizing term rewriting systems that equate diagrammatically equivalent terms. In both cases, we prove termination and confluence with the help of the proof assistant Isabelle/HOL.</description>

      <title>Wider systems for linear logic with fixed points: proof theory and complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate infinitary wellfounded systems for linear logic with fixed points, with transfinite branching rules indexed by some closure ordinal $\alpha$ for fixed points. Our main result is that provability in the system for some computable ordinal $\alpha$ is complete for the $\omega^{\alpha^\omega}$ level of the hyperarithmetical hierarchy.
  To this end we first develop proof theoretic foundations, namely cut elimination and focussing results, to control both the upper and lower bound analysis. Our arguments employ a carefully calibrated notion of formula rank, calculating a tight bound on the height of the (cut-free) proof search space.</description>

      <title>New Algorithms and Hardness Results for Robust Satisfiability of (Promise) CSPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we continue the study of robust satisfiability of promise CSPs (PCSPs), initiated in (Brakensiek, Guruswami, Sandeep, STOC 2023 / Discrete Analysis 2025), and obtain the following results:
  For the PCSP 1-in-3-SAT vs NAE-SAT with negations, we prove that it is hard, under the Unique Games conjecture (UGC), to satisfy $1-\Omega(1/\log (1/\epsilon))$ constraints in a $(1-\epsilon)$-satisfiable instance. This shows that the exponential loss incurred by the BGS algorithm for the case of Alternating-Threshold polymorphisms is necessary, in contrast to the polynomial loss achievable for Majority polymorphisms.
  For any Boolean PCSP that admits Majority polymorphisms, we give an algorithm satisfying $1-O(\sqrt{\epsilon})$ fraction of the weaker constraints when promised the existence of an assignment satisfying $1-\epsilon$ fraction of the stronger constraints. This significantly generalizes the Charikar--Makarychev--Makarychev algorithm for 2-SAT, and matches the optimal trade-off possible under the UGC. The algorithm also extends, with the loss of an extra $\log (1/\epsilon)$ factor, to PCSPs on larger domains with a certain structural condition, which is implied by, e.g., a family of Plurality polymorphisms.
  We prove that assuming the UGC, robust satisfiability is preserved under the addition of equality constraints. As a consequence, we can extend the rich algebraic techniques for decision/search PCSPs to robust PCSPs. The methods involve the development of a correlated and robust version of the general SDP rounding algorithm for CSPs due to (Brown-Cohen, Raghavendra, ICALP 2016), which might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Don't Eliminate Cut: Exponential Separations in LLM-Based Theorem Proving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a theoretical analysis of LLM-guided formal theorem proving in interactive proof assistants (e.g., Lean) by modeling tactic proposal as a stochastic policy in a finite-horizon deterministic MDP. To capture modern representation learning, we treat the state and action spaces as general compact metric spaces and assume Lipschitz policies. To explain the gap between worst-case hardness and empirical success, we introduce problem distributions generated by a reference policy $q$, including a latent-variable model in which proofs exhibit reusable cut/lemma/sketch structure represented by a proof DAG. Under a top-$k$ search protocol and Tsybakov-type margin conditions, we derive lower bounds on finite-horizon success probability that decompose into search and learning terms, with learning controlled by sequential Rademacher/covering complexity. Our main separation result shows that when cut elimination expands a DAG of depth $D$ into a cut-free tree of size $\Omega(\Lambda^D)$ while the cut-aware hierarchical process has size $O(\lambda^D)$ with $\lambda\ll\Lambda$, a flat (cut-free) learner provably requires exponentially more data than a cut-aware hierarchical learner. This provides a principled justification for subgoal decomposition in recent agentic theorem provers.</description>

      <title>On Qualitative Preference in Alternating-time Temporal Logic with Strategy Contexts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13436v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how to add and eliminate binary preference on plays in Alternating-time Temporal Logic (ATL) with strategy contexts on Concurrent Game Models (CGMs) by means of a translation which preserves satisfaction in models where preference-indiscernibility between plays is an equivalence relation of finite index. The elimination technique also works for a companion second-order path quantifier, which makes quantified path variables range over sets of plays that are closed under preference-indiscernibility. We argue that the preference operator and the specialized quantifier facilitate formulating interesting solution concepts such as Nash equilibrium and secure equilibrium in a straightforward way. We also present a novel translation from ATL with strategy contexts to Quantified Computation Tree Logic (QCTL). Together with the translation which eliminates preference and the specialized form of quantification, this translation allows reasoning about infinite multiplayer synchronous games on CGMs to be translated from the proposed extension of ATL with strategy contexts into QCTL. The setting is related to that of ordered objectives in the works of Bouyer, Brenguier, Markey and Ummels, except that our focus is on the use of the temporal logic languages mentioned above, and we rely on translations into QCTL for the algorithmic solutions.</description>

      <title>Towards the Usage of Window Counting Constraints in the Synthesis of Reactive Systems to Reduce State Space Explosion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21852v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The synthesis of reactive systems aims for the automated construction of strategies for systems that interact with their environment. Whereas the synthesis approach has the potential to change the development of reactive systems significantly due to the avoidance of manual implementation, it still suffers from a lack of efficient synthesis algorithms for many application scenarios. The translation of the system specification into an automaton that allows for strategy construction (if a winning strategy exists) is nonelementary in the length of the specification in S1S and doubly exponential for LTL, raising the need of highly specialized algorithms. In this article, we present an approach on how to reduce this state space explosion in the construction of this automaton by exploiting a monotonicity property of specifications. For this, we introduce window counting constraints that allow for step-wise refinement or abstraction of specifications. In an iterative synthesis procedure, those window counting constraints are used to construct automata representing over- or under-approximations (depending on the counting constraint) of constraint-compliant behavior. Analysis results on winning regions of previous iterations are used to reduce the size of the next automaton, leading to an overall reduction of the state space explosion extent. We present the implementation results of the iterated synthesis for a zero-sum game setting as proof of concept. Furthermore, we discuss the current limitations of the approach in a zero-sum setting and sketch future work in non-zero-sum settings.</description>

      <title>Applications of Interval-based Temporal Separation: the Reactivity Normal Form, Inverse $\Pi$, Craig Interpolation and Beth Definability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08640v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how interval-based temporal separation on the extension of Moszkowski's discrete time interval temporal logic (Moszkowski, 1986) by the neighbourhood modalities (ITL-NL) and a lemma which is key in establishing this form of separation in (Guelev and Moszkowski, 2022) can be used to obtain concise proofs of an interval-based form of the reactivity normal form as known from (Manna and Pnueli, 1990), a new normal form for ITL formulas which, given a state formula w, features the conditions that the maximal w- and non w-subintervals of an interval satisfying the given formula need to satisfy, the expressibility of the inverse of the temporal projection operator from (Halpern, Manna and Moszkowski, 1983), the elimination of propositional quantification in ITL-NL and, consequently, uniform Craig interpolation and Beth definability for ITL-NL.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1512.03127v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine some flexible notions of constraint satisfaction, observing some relationships between model theoretic notions of universal Horn class membership and robust satisfiability. We show the \texttt{NP}-completeness of $2$-robust monotone 1-in-3 3SAT in order to give very small examples of finite algebras with \texttt{NP}-hard variety membership problem. In particular we give a $3$-element algebra with this property, and solve a widely stated problem by showing that the $6$-element Brandt monoid has \texttt{NP}-hard variety membership problem. These are the smallest possible sizes for a general algebra and a semigroup to exhibit \texttt{NP}-hardness for the membership problem of finite algebras in finitely generated varieties.</description>

      <title>Finite model theory for pseudovarieties and universal algebra: preservation, definability and complexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.02653v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore new interactions between finite model theory and classical streams of universal algebra and semigroup theory. A key result is an example of finite algebras whose variety is not finitely axiomatisable in first order logic, but where the class of finite members are finitely axiomatisable amongst finite algebras. These algebras present a negative solution to a first order formulation of the Eilenberg-Sch\"utzenberger problem, and witness the simultaneous failure of the {\L}os-Tarski Theorem, the SP-Preservation Theorem and Birkhoff's HSP-Preservation Theorem at the finite level. The examples also show that a pseudovariety without any finite pseudoequational basis may be finitely axiomatisable in first order logic amongst finite algebras. Other results include the undecidability of deciding first order definability of the pseudovariety of a finite algebra, and a mapping from any fixed finite template constraint satisfaction problem to a first order equivalent variety membership problem.</description>

      <title>Absolute continuity, supports and idempotent splitting in categorical probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00651v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Markov categories have recently turned out to be a powerful high-level framework for probability and statistics. They accommodate purely categorical definitions of notions like conditional probability and almost sure equality, as well as proofs of fundamental results such as the Hewitt--Savage 0/1 Law, the de Finetti Theorem and the Ergodic Decomposition Theorem.
  In this work, we develop additional relevant notions from probability theory in the setting of Markov categories. This comprises improved versions of previously introduced definitions of absolute continuity and supports, as well as a detailed study of idempotents and idempotent splitting in Markov categories. Our main result on idempotent splitting is that every idempotent measurable Markov kernel between standard Borel spaces splits through another standard Borel space, and we derive this as an instance of a general categorical criterion for idempotent splitting in Markov categories.</description>

      <title>The most natural paradefinite logic relative to classical logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A paradefinite logic is a logic that can serve as the underlying logic for theories that are inconsistent or incomplete. A well-known paradefinite logic is Belnap-Dunn logic. Various expansions of Belnap-Dunn logic have been studied in the literature. In this note, it is argued that the most natural paradefinite logic relative to classical logic is the expansion of Belnap-Dunn logic with a falsity connective and an implication connective for which the standard deduction theorem holds.</description>

      <title>Implementing Grassroots Logic Programs with Multiagent Transition Systems and AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06934v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Grassroots Logic Programs (GLP) is a concurrent logic programming language with variables partitioned into paired \emph{readers} and \emph{writers}, conjuring both linear logic and futures/promises: an assignment is produced at most once via the sole occurrence of a writer (promise) and consumed at most once via the sole occurrence of its paired reader (future), and may contain additional readers and/or writers, enabling the concise expression of rich multidirectional communication modalities.
  GLP was designed as a language for grassroots platforms -- distributed systems with multiple instances that can operate independently of each other and of any global resource, and can coalesce into ever larger instances -- with its target architecture being smartphones communicating peer-to-peer. The operational semantics of Concurrent (single-agent) GLP and of multiagent GLP (maGLP) were defined via transition systems/multiagent transition systems, respectively.
  Here, we describe the mathematics developed to facilitate the workstation- and smartphone-based implementations of GLP by AI in Dart. We developed dGLP -- implementation-ready deterministic operational semantics for single-agent GLP -- and proved it correct with respect to the Concurrent GLP operational semantics; dGLP was used by AI as a formal spec, from which it developed a workstation-based implementation of GLP. We developed madGLP -- an implementation-ready multiagent operational semantics for maGLP -- and proved it correct with respect to the maGLP operational semantics; madGLP is deterministic at the agent level (not at the system level due to communication asynchrony), and is being used by AI as a formal spec from which it develops a smartphone-based implementation of maGLP.</description>
