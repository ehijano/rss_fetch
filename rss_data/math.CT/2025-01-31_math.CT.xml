      <title>Logical Aspects of Virtual Double Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis deals with two main topics: virtual double categories as semantics environments for predicate logic, and a syntactic presentation of virtual double categories as a type theory. One significant principle of categorical logic is bringing together the semantics and the syntax of logical systems in a common categorical framework. This thesis is intended to propose a double-categorical method for categorical logic in line with this principle. On the semantic side, we investigate virtual double categories as a model of predicate logic and illustrate that this framework subsumes the existing frameworks properly. On the syntactic side, we develop a type theory called FVDblTT that is designed as an internal language for virtual double categories.</description>

      <title>String Diagrams for Graded Monoidal Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a graphical syntax based on string diagrams for graded symmetric monoidal categories along with a sound and complete axiomatic system to reason about graded monoidal terms. We also provide one abstract example of presentation for the Para construction on monoidal actegories, and we instantiate it to axiomatize a variant of the graded category $\ImP$, which was recently introduced by Liell-Cock and Staton to model imprecise probability.</description>

      <title>Tensorial structure of the lifting doctrine in constructive domain theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17023v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a survey of the two-dimensional and tensorial structure of the lifting doctrine in constructive domain theory, i.e. in the theory of directed-complete partial orders (dcpos) over an arbitrary elementary topos. We establish the universal property of lifting of dcpos as the Sierpi\'nski cone, from which we deduce (1) that lifting forms a Kock-Z\"oberlein doctrine, (2) that lifting algebras, pointed dcpos, and inductive partial orders form canonically equivalent locally posetal 2-categories, and (3) that the category of lifting algebras is cocomplete, with connected colimits created by the forgetful functor to dcpos. Finally we deduce the symmetric monoidal closure of the Eilenberg-Moore resolution of the lifting 2-monad by means of smash products; these are shown to classify both bilinear maps and strict maps, which we prove to coincide in the constructive setting. We provide several concrete computations of the smash product as dcpo coequalisers and lifting algebra coequalisers, and compare these with the more abstract results of Seal. Although all these results are well-known classically, the existing proofs do not apply in a constructive setting; indeed, the classical analysis of the Eilenberg-Moore category of the lifting monad relies on the fact that all lifting algebras are free, a condition that is not known to hold constructively.</description>

      <title>On the B\'enabou-Roubaud theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a detailed proof of the B\'enabou-Roubaud theorem. As a byproduct it yields a weakening of its hypotheses: the base category does not need fibre products and the Beck-Chevalley condition, in the form of a natural transformation, can be weakened by only requiring the latter to be epi.</description>

      <title>Rewriting for Symmetric Monoidal Categories with Commutative (Co)Monoid Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.04274v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: String diagrams are pictorial representations for morphisms of symmetric monoidal categories. They constitute an intuitive and expressive graphical syntax, which has found application in a very diverse range of fields including concurrency theory, quantum computing, control theory, machine learning, linguistics, and digital circuits. Rewriting theory for string diagrams relies on a combinatorial interpretation as double-pushout rewriting of certain hypergraphs. As previously studied, there is a `tension' in this interpretation: in order to make it sound and complete, we either need to add structure on string diagrams (in particular, Frobenius algebra structure) or pose restrictions on double-pushout rewriting (resulting in 'convex' rewriting). From the string diagram viewpoint, imposing a full Frobenius structure may not always be natural or desirable in applications, which motivates our study of a weaker requirement: commutative monoid structure. In this work we characterise string diagram rewriting modulo commutative monoid equations, via a sound and complete interpretation in a suitable notion of double-pushout rewriting of hypergraphs.</description>
