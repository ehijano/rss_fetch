      <title>How Much Can Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces Augment Sky Visibility: A Stochastic Geometry Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper uses the theory of point processes and stochastic geometry to quantify the sky visibility experienced by users located in an urban environment. The general idea is to represent the buildings of this environment as a stationary marked point process, where the points represent the building locations and the marks their heights. The point process framework is first used to characterize the distribution of the blockage angle, which limits the visibility of a typical user into the sky due to the obstruction by buildings. In the context of communications, this distribution is useful when users try to connect to the nodes of an aerial or non-terrestrial network in a Line-of-Sight way. Within this context, the point process framework can also be used to investigate the gain of connectivity obtained thanks to Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces. Assuming that such surfaces are installed on the top of buildings to extend the user's sky visibility, this point process approach allows one to quantify the gain in visibility and hence the gain in connectivity obtained by the typical user. The distributional properties of visibility-related metrics are cross-validated by comparison to simulation results.</description>

      <title>The inviscid limit for long time statistics of the one-dimensional stochastic Ginzburg-Landau equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the long time statistics of a one-dimensional stochastic Ginzburg-Landau equation with cubic nonlinearity while being subjected to random perturbations via an additive Gaussian noise. Under the assumption that sufficiently many directions of the phase space are stochastically forced, we find that the dynamics is attractive toward the unique invariant probability measure with a polynomial rate that is independent of the vanishing viscosity. This relies on a coupling technique exploiting a Foias-Prodi argument specifically tailored to the system. Then, in the inviscid regime, we show that the sequence of invariant measures converges toward the invariant measure of the stochastic Schr\"odinger equation in a suitable Wasserstein distance. Together with the uniform polynomial mixing, we obtain the validity of the inviscid limit for the solutions on the infinite time horizon with a log log rate.</description>

      <title>Large deviations of one-hidden-layer neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study large deviations in the context of stochastic gradient descent for one-hidden-layer neural networks with quadratic loss. We derive a quenched large deviation principle, where we condition on an initial weight measure, and an annealed large deviation principle for the empirical weight evolution during training when letting the number of neurons and the number of training iterations simultaneously tend to infinity. The weight evolution is treated as an interacting dynamic particle system. The distinctive aspect compared to prior work on interacting particle systems lies in the discrete particle updates, simultaneously with a growing number of particles.</description>

      <title>Generalized Euler-Maclaurin formula and Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Euler-Maclaurin formula which relates a discrete sum with an integral, is generalised to the setting of Riemann-Stieltjes sums and integrals on stochastic processes whose paths are a.s. rectifiable, that is continuous and bounded variation. For this purpose, new variants of the signature are introduced, such as the flip and the sawtooth signature. The counterparts of the Bernoulli numbers that arise in the classical Euler-Maclaurin formula are obtained by choosing the appropriate integration constants in the repeated integration by parts to ``minimise the error'' of every truncation level.</description>

      <title>Study of measure-valued Markov processes. Explicit bounds for the convergence in distribution of mean-field models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of the paper is to prove that the rates of convergence in distribution for $N$-particle mean-field models are the expected one: $N^{-1}$ in Law of Large Numbers regime, and $N^{-1/2}$ in Central Limit Theorem regime. These proofs require to study empirical measures of McKean-Vlasov particle systems, and conditional laws of McKean-Vlasov processes, as measure-valued Markov processes. In particular, the expressions of the infinitesimal generators of such processes are established for measure-valued processes with general jumps. The generators being differential operators, all the proofs rely on the analytical properties of measure-variable functions, and the differentiation of such functions.</description>

      <title>Properties of Shannon and R\'{e}nyi entropies of the Poisson distribution as the functions of intensity parameter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider two types of entropy, namely, Shannon and R\'{e}nyi entropies of the Poisson distribution, and establish their properties as the functions of intensity parameter. More precisely, we prove that both entropies increase with intensity. While for Shannon entropy the proof is comparatively simple, for R\'{e}nyi entropy, which depends on additional parameter $\alpha&gt;0$, we can characterize it as nontrivial. The proof is based on application of Karamata's inequality to the terms of Poisson distribution.</description>

      <title>On sampling diluted Spin Glasses using Glauber dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin-glasses are Gibbs distributions that have been studied in CS for many decades. Recently, they have gained renewed attention as they emerge naturally in learning, inference, optimisation etc.
  We consider the Edwards-Anderson (EA) spin-glass distribution at inverse temperature $\beta$ when the underlying graph is an instance of $G(n,d/n)$. This is the random graph on $n$ vertices where each edge appears independently with probability $d/n$ and $d=\Theta(1)$. We study the problem of approximate sampling from this distribution using Glauber dynamics.
  For a range of $\beta$ that depends on $d$ and for typical instances of the EA model on $G(n,d/n)$, we show that the corresponding Glauber dynamics exhibits mixing time $O(n^{2+\frac{3}{\log^2 d}})$.
  The range of $\beta$ for which we obtain our rapid-mixing results correspond to the expected influence being $&lt;1/d$; we conjecture that this is the best possible.
  Unlike the mean-field spin-glasses, where the problem has been studied before, the diluted case has not.
  We utilise the well-known path-coupling technique. In the standard Glauber dynamics on $G(n,d/n)$, one has to deal with the so-called effect of high degree vertices. Here, rather than considering degrees, it is more natural to use a different measure on the vertices called aggregate influence.
  We build on the block-construction approach proposed by [Dyer et al. 2006] to circumvent the problem of high-degree vertices. Specifically, we first establish rapid mixing for an appropriately defined block-dynamics. We design this dynamics such that vertices of large aggregate influence are placed deep inside their blocks. Then, we obtain rapid mixing for the Glauber dynamics utilising a comparison argument.</description>

      <title>Local first integrals for stochastic differential equations</title>

Abstract: Poincar\'{e}'s classical results [H. Poincar\'{e}, Sur l'int\'{e}gration des \'{e}quations diff\'{e}rentielles du premier order et du premier degr\'{e} I and II, Rend. Circ. Mat. Palermo 5 (1891) 161-191; 11 (1897) 193-239] first provide a link between the existence of analytic first integrals and the resonant relations for analytic dynamical systems. In this paper, we show that by appropriately selecting the definition of the stochastic local first integrals, we are able to obtain the stochastic version of Poincar\'e non-integrability theorem. More specifically, we introduce two definitions of local first integrals for stochastic differential equations (SDEs) in the sense of probability one and expectation, respectively. We present the necessary conditions for the existence of functionally independent analytic or rational first integrals of SDEs via the resonances. We also show that for given integrable ordinary differential equations with some nondegeneracy conditions, there exists a linear stochastic perturbation such that the corresponding disturbed SDEs have no any analytic first integrals. Some examples are given to illustrate our results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of singular vector and singular subspace perturbations in the context of the signal plus random Gaussian noise matrix model. Assuming a low-rank signal matrix, we extend the Wedin-Davis-Kahan theorem in a fully generalized manner, applicable to any unitarily invariant matrix norm, extending previous results of O'Rourke, Vu and the author. We also obtain the fine-grained results, which encompass the $\ell_\infty$ analysis of singular vectors, the $\ell_{2, \infty}$ analysis of singular subspaces, as well as the exploration of linear and bilinear functions related to the singular vectors. Moreover, we explore the practical implications of these findings, in the context of the Gaussian mixture model and the submatrix localization problem.</description>

      <title>Rectified deep neural networks overcome the curse of dimensionality in the numerical approximation of gradient-dependent semilinear heat equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical experiments indicate that deep learning algorithms overcome the curse of dimensionality when approximating solutions of semilinear PDEs. For certain linear PDEs and semilinear PDEs with gradient-independent nonlinearities this has also been proved mathematically, i.e., it has been shown that the number of parameters of the approximating DNN increases at most polynomially in both the PDE dimension $d\in \mathbb{N}$ and the reciprocal of the prescribed accuracy $\epsilon\in (0,1)$. The main contribution of this paper is to rigorously prove for the first time that deep neural networks can also overcome the curse dimensionality in the approximation of a certain class of nonlinear PDEs with gradient-dependent nonlinearities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we explore the connection between the ranks of the magnitude homology groups of a graph and the structure of its subgraphs. To this end, we introduce variants of magnitude homology called eulerian magnitude homology and discriminant magnitude homology. Leveraging the combinatorics of the differential in magnitude homology, we illustrate a close relationship between the ranks of the eulerian magnitude homology groups on the first diagonal and counts of subgraphs which fall in specific classes. We leverage these tools to study limiting behavior of the eulerian magnitude homology groups for Erdos-Renyi random graphs and random geometric graphs, producing for both models a vanishing threshold for the eulerian magnitude homology groups on the first diagonal. This in turn provides a characterization of the generators for the corresponding magnitude homology groups. Finally, we develop an explicit asymptotic estimate the expected rank of eulerian magnitude homology along the first diagonal for these random graph models.</description>

Abstract: We investigate a $2d$-conservative lattice gas exhibiting a dynamical active-absorbing phase transition with critical density $\rho_c$. We derive the hydrodynamic equation for this model, showing that all critical exponents governing the large scale behavior near criticality can be obtained from two independent ones. We show that as the supercritical density approaches criticality, distinct length scales naturally appear. Remarkably, this behavior is different from the subcritical one. Numerical simulations support the critical relations and the scale separation.</description>

      <title>Robust SGLD algorithm for solving non-convex distributionally robust optimisation problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we develop a Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) algorithm tailored for solving a certain class of non-convex distributionally robust optimisation problems. By deriving non-asymptotic convergence bounds, we build an algorithm which for any prescribed accuracy $\varepsilon&gt;0$ outputs an estimator whose expected excess risk is at most $\varepsilon$. As a concrete application, we employ our robust SGLD algorithm to solve the (regularised) distributionally robust Mean-CVaR portfolio optimisation problem using real financial data. We empirically demonstrate that the trading strategy obtained by our robust SGLD algorithm outperforms the trading strategy obtained when solving the corresponding non-robust Mean-CVaR portfolio optimisation problem using, e.g., a classical SGLD algorithm. This highlights the practical relevance of incorporating model uncertainty when optimising portfolios in real financial markets.</description>

      <title>A general and sharp regularity condition for integro-differential equations with non-dominated measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this work is to present the regularity condition (also known in the literature as structure condition) an integro-differential operator may satisfy in order for the domination principle to hold for (sub-,super-) solutions of polynomial growth. More precisely, the framework presented in Hollender [13], in which power functions are used in order to determine the integrability conditions, is weakened by substituting the power functions with Young functions. The use of Young functions allows for sharp integrability conditions, which are crucial when one deals with limit theorems. As an immediate application, it is considered the case of parabolic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) operators, for which the regularity condition is satisfied and, consequently, the comparison principle as well. The parabolic HJB operator presented in this work can be associated to second-order (decoupled) forward-backward stochastic differential equations with jumps.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathcal P_2$ be the space of probability measures on $\R^d$ having finite second moment, and consider the Riemannian structure on $\mathcal P_2$ induced by the intrinsic derivative on the $L^2$-tangent space. By using stochastic analysis on the tangent space, we construct an Ornstein$-$Uhlenbeck (OU) type Dirichlet form on $\mathcal P_2$ whose generator is formally given by the intrinsic Laplacian with a drift. The log-Sobolev inequality holds and the associated Markov semigroup is $L^2$-compact.
  Perturbations of the OU Dirichlet form are also studied.</description>

      <title>The genealogy of nearly critical branching processes in varying environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.11612v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building on the spinal decomposition technique in Foutel-Rodier and Schertzer (2022) we prove a Yaglom limit law for the rescaled size of a nearly critical branching process in varying environment conditional on survival. In addition, our spinal approach allows us to prove convergence of the genealogical structure of the population at a fixed time horizon - where the sequence of trees are envisioned as a sequence of metric spaces - in the Gromov-Hausdorff-Prokorov (GHP) topology. We characterize the limiting metric space as a time-changed version of the Brownian coalescent point process of Popovic (2004).
  Beyond our specific model, we derive several general results allowing to go from spinal decompositions to convergence of random trees in the GHP topology. As a direct application, we show how this type of convergence naturally condenses the limit of several interesting genealogical quantities: the population size, the time to the most-recent common ancestor, the reduced tree and the tree generated by $k$ uniformly sampled individuals. As in a recent article by the authors (Foutel-Rodier and Schertzer 2022), we hope that our specific example illustrates a general methodology that could be applied to more complex branching processes.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic analysis for the generalized Langevin equation with singular potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.03637v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a system of interacting particles governed by the generalized Langevin equation (GLE) in the presence of external confining potentials, singular repulsive forces, as well as memory kernels. Using a Mori-Zwanzig approach, we represent the system by a class of Markovian dynamics. Under a general set of conditions on the nonlinearities, we study the large-time asymptotics of the multi-particle Markovian GLEs. We show that the system is always exponentially attractive toward the unique invariant Gibbs probability measure. The proof relies on a novel construction of Lyapunov functions. We then establish the validity of the small mass approximation for the solutions by an appropriate equation on any finite-time window. Important examples of singular potentials in our results include the Lennard-Jones and Coulomb functions.</description>

      <title>Palm problems arising in BAR approach and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03553v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider Palm distributions arising in a Markov process with time homogeneous transitions which is jointly stationary with multiple point processes. Motivated by a BAR approach studied in the recent paper Braverman, Dai and Miyazawa (2023}, we are interested in two problems; when this Markov process inherits the same Markov structure under the Palm distributions, and how the state changes at counting instants of the point processes can be handled to derive stationary equations when there are simultaneous counts and each of them influences the state changes. We affirmatively answer to the first problem, and propose a framework for resolving the second problem. We also discuss how those results can be applied in deriving BAR's for the diffusion approximation of queueing models in heavy traffic. In particular, as their new application, the heavy traffic limit of the stationary distribution is derived for a single server queue with a finite waiting room. Those examples show how the BAR approach is useful under the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Strong limit theorems for empirical halfspace depth trimmed regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study empirical variants of the halfspace (Tukey) depth of a probability measure $\mu$, which are obtained by replacing $\mu$ with the corresponding weighted empirical measure. We prove analogues of the Marcinkiewicz--Zygmund strong law of large numbers and of the law of the iterated logarithm in terms of set inclusions and for the Hausdorff distance between the theoretical and empirical variants of depth trimmed regions. In the special case of $\mu$ being the uniform distribution on a convex body $K$, the depth trimmed regions are convex floating bodies of $K$, and we obtain strong limit theorems for their empirical estimators.</description>

      <title>Operation with Concentration Inequalities and Conjugate of Parallel Sum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08206v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following the concentration of the measure approach, we consider the transformation $\Phi(Z)$ of a random variable $Z$ having a general concentration function $\alpha$. If the transformation $\Phi$ is $\lambda$-Lipschitz with $\lambda$ deterministic, the concentration function of $\Phi$ is immediately deduced to be equal to $\alpha(\cdot/\lambda)$. If the variations of $\Phi$ are bounded by a random variable $\Lambda$ having a concentration function (around $0$) $\beta: \mathbb R_+\to \mathbb R$, this paper sets that $\Phi(Z)$ has a concentration function analogous to $\gamma = (\alpha^{-1} \cdot \beta^{-1})^{-1}$. We apply this result to generalize Hanson Wright inequality, we express $\gamma$ with the conjugate functions of the parallel sum of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ and further consider the case where $\Lambda$ is the product of $n$ random variables to provide useful insights to the so-called "multilevel concentration".</description>

      <title>Sharp bounds for max-sliced Wasserstein distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain essentially matching upper and lower bounds for the expected max-sliced 1-Wasserstein distance between a probability measure on a separable Hilbert space and its empirical distribution from $n$ samples. By proving a Banach space version of this result, we also obtain an upper bound, that is sharp up to a log factor, for the expected max-sliced 2-Wasserstein distance between a symmetric probability measure $\mu$ on a Euclidean space and its symmetrized empirical distribution in terms of the norm of the covariance matrix of $\mu$ and the diameter of the support of $\mu$.</description>

      <title>Quenched CLT for ancestral lineages of logistic branching random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider random walks in dynamic random environments which arise naturally as spatial embeddings of ancestral lineages in spatial locally regulated population models. In particular, as the main result, we prove the quenched central limit theorem for a random walk in dynamic random environment generated by time reversal of logistic branching random walks in a regime where the population density is sufficiently high. As an important tool we consider as auxiliary models random walks in dynamic random environments defined in terms of the time-reversal of oriented percolation. We show that the quenched central limit theorem holds if the influence of the random medium on the walks is suitably weak. The proofs of the quenched central limit theorems in these models rely on coarse-graining arguments and a construction of regeneration times for a pair of conditionally independent random walks in the same medium, combined with a coupling that relates them to a pair of independent random walks in two independent copies of the medium.</description>

      <title>The Threshold Energy of Low Temperature Langevin Dynamics for Pure Spherical Spin Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.07956v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Langevin dynamics for spherical $p$-spin models, focusing on the short time regime described by the Cugliandolo-Kurchan equations. Confirming a prediction of [Cugliandolo-Kurchan, Phys. Rev. Lett. 1993], we show the asymptotic energy achieved is exactly $E_{\infty}(p)=2\sqrt{\frac{p-1}{p}}$ in the low temperature limit. The upper bound uses hardness results for Lipschitz optimization algorithms and applies for all temperatures. For the lower bound, we prove the dynamics reaches and stays above the lowest energy of any approximate local maximum. In fact the latter behavior holds for any Hamiltonian obeying natural smoothness estimates, even with disorder-dependent initialization and on exponential time-scales.</description>
