      <title>OUGS: Active View Selection via Object-aware Uncertainty Estimation in 3DGS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have achieved state-of-the-art results for novel view synthesis. However, efficiently capturing high-fidelity reconstructions of specific objects within complex scenes remains a significant challenge. A key limitation of existing active reconstruction methods is their reliance on scene-level uncertainty metrics, which are often biased by irrelevant background clutter and lead to inefficient view selection for object-centric tasks. We present OUGS, a novel framework that addresses this challenge with a more principled, physically-grounded uncertainty formulation for 3DGS. Our core innovation is to derive uncertainty directly from the explicit physical parameters of the 3D Gaussian primitives (e.g., position, scale, rotation). By propagating the covariance of these parameters through the rendering Jacobian, we establish a highly interpretable uncertainty model. This foundation allows us to then seamlessly integrate semantic segmentation masks to produce a targeted, object-aware uncertainty score that effectively disentangles the object from its environment. This allows for a more effective active view selection strategy that prioritizes views critical to improving object fidelity. Experimental evaluations on public datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the efficiency of the 3DGS reconstruction process and achieves higher quality for targeted objects compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, while also serving as a robust uncertainty estimator for the global scene.</description>

      <title>An FPT algorithm for the embeddability of graphs into two-dimensional simplicial complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.06236v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the embeddability problem of a graph G into a two-dimensional simplicial complex C: Given G and C, decide whether G admits a topological embedding into C. The problem is NP-hard, even in the restricted case where C is homeomorphic to a surface. We prove that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable in the size of the two-dimensional complex, by providing an O(2^{poly(c)}.n^2)-time algorithm. If G embeds into C, we can compute a representation of an embedding in the same amount of time. Moreover, we show that several known problems reduce to this one, such as the crossing number and the planarity number problems, and, under some conditions, the embedding extension problem.
  Our approach is to reduce to the case where G has bounded branchwidth via an irrelevant vertex method, and to apply dynamic programming. We do not rely on any component of the existing linear-time algorithms for embedding graphs on a fixed surface, but only on algorithms from graph minor theory. However, by combining our results with a linear-time algorithm for embedding graphs on surfaces and with a very recent result for the irrelevant vertex method, we can decide whether G embeds into C in f(c).O(n) time, for some function f.</description>

      <title>Oriented Spanners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17097v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a point set $P$ in the Euclidean plane and a parameter $t$, we define an \emph{oriented $t$-spanner} $G$ as an oriented subgraph of the complete bi-directed graph such that for every pair of points, the shortest closed walk in $G$ through those points is at most a factor $t$ longer than the shortest cycle in the complete graph on $P$. We investigate the problem of computing sparse graphs with small oriented dilation.
  As we can show that minimising oriented dilation for a given number of edges is NP-hard in the plane, we first consider one-dimensional point sets. While obtaining a $1$-spanner in this setting is straightforward, already for five points such a spanner has no plane embedding with the leftmost and rightmost point on the outer face.
  This leads to restricting to oriented graphs with a one-page book embedding on the one-dimensional point set. For this case we present a dynamic program to compute the graph of minimum oriented dilation that runs in $\mathcal{O}(n^7)$ time for $n$ points, and a greedy algorithm that computes a $5$-spanner in $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$ time.
  Expanding these results finally gives us a result for two-dimensional point sets: we prove that for convex point sets the greedy triangulation results in a plane oriented $t$-spanner with $t=7.2 \cdot t_g$, where $t_g$ is an upper bound on the dilation of the greedy triangulation.</description>
