      <title>Aircraft routing: periodicity and complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aircraft routing problem is one of the most studied problems of operations research applied to aircraft management. It involves assigning flights to aircraft while ensuring regular visits to maintenance bases. This paper examines two aspects of the problem.
  First, we explore the relationship between periodic instances, where flights are the same every day, and periodic solutions. The literature has implicitly assumed-without discussion-that periodic instances necessitate periodic solutions, and even periodic solutions in a stronger form, where every two airplanes perform either the exact same cyclic sequence of flights, or completely disjoint cyclic sequences. However, enforcing such periodicity may eliminate feasible solutions. We prove that, when regular maintenance is required at most every four days, there always exist periodic solutions of this form.
  Second, we consider the computational hardness of the problem. Even if many papers in this area refer to the NP-hardness of the aircraft routing problem, such a result is only available in the literature for periodic instances. We establish its NP-hardness for a non-periodic version. Polynomiality of a special but natural case is also proven.</description>

      <title>Balanced Steinhaus triangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Steinhaus triangle modulo $m$ is a finite down-pointing triangle of elements in the finite cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$ satisfying the same local rule as the standard Pascal triangle modulo $m$. A Steinhaus triangle modulo $m$ is said to be balanced if it contains all the elements of $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$ with the same multiplicity. In this paper, the existence of infinitely many balanced Steinhaus triangles modulo $m$, for any positive integer $m$, is shown. This is achieved by considering periodic triangles generated from interlaced arithmetic progressions. This positively answers a weak version of a problem, due to John C. Molluzzo in 1978, that has remained unsolved to date for the even values of $m\geqslant 12$.</description>

      <title>Space-Efficient Hierholzer: Eulerian Cycles in O(m) Time and O(n) Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a simple variant of Hierholzer's algorithm that finds an Eulerian cycle in a (multi)graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges using $\mathrm{O}(n \lg m)$ bits of working memory. This substantially improves the working space compared to standard implementations of Hierholzer's algorithm, which use $\mathrm{O}(m \lg n)$ bits of space. Our algorithm runs in linear time, like the classical versions, but avoids an $\mathrm{O}(m)$-size stack of vertices or storing information for each edge. To our knowledge, this is the first linear-time algorithm to achieve this space bound, and the method is very easy to implement. The correctness argument, by contrast, is surprisingly subtle; we give a detailed formal proof. The space savings are particularly relevant for dense graphs or multigraphs with large edge multiplicities.</description>

      <title>Parameterized complexity of isometric path partition: treewidth and diameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the parameterized complexity of the Isometric Path Partition problem when parameterized by the treewidth ($\mathrm{tw}$) of the input graph, arguably one of the most widely studied parameters. Courcelle's theorem shows that graph problems that are expressible as MSO formulas of constant size admit FPT algorithms parameterized by the treewidth of the input graph. This encompasses many natural graph problems. However, many metric-based graph problems, where the solution is defined using some metric-based property of the graph (often the distance) are not expressible as MSO formulas of constant size. These types of problems, Isometric Path Partition being one of them, require individual attention and often draw the boundary for the success story of parameterization by treewidth.
  In this paper, we prove that Isometric Path Partition is $W[1]$-hard when parameterized by treewidth (in fact, even pathwidth), answering the question by Dumas et al. [SIDMA, 2024], Fernau et al. [CIAC, 2023], and confirming the aforementioned tendency. We complement this hardness result by designing a tailored dynamic programming algorithm running in $n^{O(\mathrm{tw})}$ time. This dynamic programming approach also results in an algorithm running in time $\textrm{diam}^{O(\mathrm{tw}^2)} \cdot n^{O(1)}$, where $\textrm{diam}$ is the diameter of the graph. Note that the dependency on treewidth is unusually high, as most problems admit algorithms running in time $2^{O(\mathrm{tw})}\cdot n^{O(1)}$ or $2^{O(\mathrm{tw} \log (\mathrm{tw}))}\cdot n^{O(1)}$. However, we rule out the possibility of a significantly faster algorithm by proving that Isometric Path Partition does not admit an algorithm running in time $\textrm{diam}^{o(\mathrm{tw}^2/(\log^3(\mathrm{tw})))} \cdot n^{O(1)}$, unless the Randomized-ETH fails.</description>

      <title>Improved lower bounds on the maximum size of graphs with girth 5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new algorithm for improving lower bounds on $ex(n;\{C_3,C_4\})$, the maximum size (number of edges) of an $n$-vertex graph of girth at least 5. The core of our algorithm is a variant of a hill-climbing heuristic introduced by Exoo, McKay, Myrvold and Nadon (2011) to find small cages. Our algorithm considers a range of values of $n$ in multiple passes. In each pass, the hill-climbing heuristic for a specific value of $n$ is initialized with a few graphs obtained by modifying near-extremal graphs previously found for neighboring values of $n$, allowing to `propagate' good patterns that were found. Focusing on the range $n\in \{74,75, \dots, 198\}$, which is currently beyond the scope of exact methods, our approach yields improvements on existing lower bounds for $ex(n;\{C_3,C_4\})$ for all $n$ in the range, except for two values of $n$ ($n=96,97$).</description>

      <title>On near optimal colorable graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13932v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A class of graphs $\cal G$ is said to be \emph{near optimal colorable} if there exists a constant $c\in \mathbb{N}$ such that every graph $G\in \cal G$ satisfies $\chi(G) \leq \max\{c, \omega(G)\}$, where $\chi(G)$ and $\omega(G)$ respectively denote the chromatic number and clique number of $G$. The class of near optimal colorable graphs is an important subclass of the class of $\chi$-bounded graphs which is well-studied in the literature. In this paper, we show that the class of ($F, K_4-e$)-free graphs is near optimal colorable, where $F\in \{P_1+2P_2,2P_1+P_3,3P_1+P_2\}$ and the graph $K_4-e$ is commonly referred as the {\em diamond}. This partially answers a question of Ju and Huang [Theoretical Computer Science 993 (2024) Article No.: 114465] and is related to a question of Schiermeyer (unpublished). Furthermore, using these results with some earlier known results, we also provide an alternate proof to the fact that the \textsc{Chromatic Number} problem for the class of ($F, K_4-e$)-free graphs is solvable in polynomial time, where $F\in \{P_1+2P_2,2P_1+P_3,3P_1+P_2\}$.</description>

      <title>Graphs with nonnegative resistance curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07756v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article introduces and studies a new class of graphs motivated by discrete curvature. We call a graph resistance nonnegative if there exists a distribution on its spanning trees such that every vertex has expected degree at most two in a random spanning tree; these are precisely the graphs that admit a metric with nonnegative resistance curvature, a discrete curvature introduced by Devriendt and Lambiotte. We show that this class of graphs lies between Hamiltonian and $1$-tough graphs and, surprisingly, that a graph is resistance nonnegative if and only if its twice-dilated matching polytope intersects the interior of its spanning tree polytope. We study further characterizations and basic properties of resistance nonnegative graphs and pose several questions for future research.</description>

      <title>($P_2+P_4$, $K_4-e$)-free graphs are nearly $\omega$-colorable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02543v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a graph $G$, $\chi(G)$ and $\omega(G)$ respectively denote the chromatic number and clique number of $G$. In this paper, we show the following results: (i) If $G$ is a ($P_2+P_4$, $K_4-e$)-free graph with $\omega(G)\geq 3$, then $\chi(G)\leq \max\{6, \omega(G)\}$, and the bound is tight for each $\omega(G)\notin \{4,5\}$. (ii) If $G$ is a ($P_2+P_4$, $K_4-e$)-free graph with $\omega(G)= 4$, then $\chi(G)= 4$. These results extend the chromatic bounds known for the class of ($P_2+P_2$, $K_4-e$)-free graphs and for the class of ($P_2+P_3$, $K_4-e$)-free graphs, improve the bound of Chen and Zhang [arXiv:2412.14524 [math.CO], 2024] given for the class of ($P_2+P_4$, $K_4-e$)-free graphs, partially answer a question of Ju and the third author [Theor. Comp. Sci. 993 (2024) Article No.: 114465] on `near optimal colorable graphs', and a question of Schiermeyer (unpublished) on the chromatic bound for ($P_7$, $K_4-e$)-free graphs.</description>
