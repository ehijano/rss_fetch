      <title>Euler-Poincare characteristic pair of orientable $\Pi$-symmetric super manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Euler-Poincare characteristic, or Euler characteristic in short, is a fundamental topological invariant of compact manifolds that plays a crucial role in a variety of geometric and topological situations. From this point of view, we tried to expand this important concept in super geometry. In this article, we introduce Euler-Poincare characteristic pair in the category of $\Pi$-symmetric super manifolds. This is done by finding the self-intersection pair of each super manifold.</description>

      <title>The equations of Gauss, Codazzi and Ricci of surfaces in 4-dimensional space forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $N$ be a Riemannian or neutral $4$-dimensional space form. In this paper, the expressions of the equations of Gauss, Codazzi and Ricci of a space-like or time-like surface in $N$ given in [6] are naturally understood in terms of the induced connection of the two-fold exterior power of the pull-back bundle on the surface. We observe that a space-like or time-like surface in $N$ such that the twistor lifts are nondegenerate is given by relations among functions in the above expressions related to the second fundamental form. In the case where $N$ is a Lorentzian $4$-dimensional space form, we define the complex twistor lifts of a space-like or time-like surface in $N$ and we have analogous discussions and results in terms of the induced connection of the complexification of the two-fold exterior power of the pull-back bundle. We characterize a space-like surface in $N$ such that the covariant derivative of a suitable complex twistor lift by $\partial /\partial \overline{w}$ vanishes.</description>

      <title>Finite generation of the ring of holomorphic functions with polynomial growth on the K\"{a}hler-Ricci shrinker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let (X, g, J, f ) be a non-compact gradient shrinking Kahler-Ricci soliton. We prove that if the scalar curvature of X satisfies a mild assumption, then OP (X), the ring of holomorphic functions with polynomial growth on X, is finitely generated. This gives a partial confirmation to a conjecture of Munteanu and Wang (cf.[MW14]).</description>

      <title>Abstract cone operators and Lipschitz rigidity for scalar curvature on singular manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the index theory for twisted Dirac operators acting on sections of Lipschitz bundles over non-compact manifolds, we prove Llarull-type comparison results in scalar curvature geometry. They apply to spin Riemannian manifolds with cone-type singularities and Lipschitz comparison maps to spheres.
  We use the language of abstract cone operators which are introduced and studied in a general functional analytic setting and which may be of independent interest.
  Applying this discussion to spherical suspensions of odd-dimensional closed manifolds, we generalize a Lipschitz rigidity result of the first three named authors from even to odd dimensions. Under stronger conditions, this has already been shown by Lee-Tam using geometric flows and by Baer using an upper estimate for the smallest Dirac eigenvalue.</description>

      <title>Nearly $G_2$-manifolds and $G_2$-Laplacian co-flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nearly $G_2$-structures define positive Einstein metrics in $7$ dimensions and are critical points, up to scale, for a geometric flow of co-closed $G_2$-structures with good analytic properties called the modified $G_2$-Laplacian co-flow. We introduce a suitable normalization of this flow so that nearly $G_2$-structures are stable under rescaling. However, we show that many nearly $G_2$-structures are unstable for this flow: specifically, all those naturally arising from 3-Sasakian geometry. In particular, we demonstrate that the standard nearly $G_2$-structure on the round 7-sphere is an unstable critical point with high index.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an extension of the Gromov--Zimmer Embedding Theorem for Cartan geometries of [3] to tractor bundles carrying any invariant connection, including tractor connections and prolongation connections of first BGG operators for parabolic geometries. As an application, we prove a rigidity result for conformal actions of special pseudo-unitary groups on closed, simply connected, analytic pseudo-Riemannian manifolds.</description>

      <title>Directional Pliability, Whitney Extension, and Lusin Approximation for Curves in Carnot Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that, in arbitrary Carnot groups, pliability in a subset of directions is sufficient to guarantee the existence of a Whitney-type extension and a Lusin approximation for curves with tangent vectors in the same set of directions. We apply this to show that every horizontal curve in the Engel group must intersect a $C^{1}$ horizontal curve in a set of positive measure.</description>

      <title>EuLearn: A 3D database for learning Euler characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present EuLearn, the first surface datasets equitably representing a diversity of topological types. We designed our embedded surfaces of uniformly varying genera relying on random knots, thus allowing our surfaces to knot with themselves. EuLearn contributes new topological datasets of meshes, point clouds, and scalar fields in 3D. We aim to facilitate the training of machine learning systems that can discern topological features. We experimented with specific emblematic 3D neural network architectures, finding that their vanilla implementations perform poorly on genus classification. To enhance performance, we developed a novel, non-Euclidean, statistical sampling method adapted to graph and manifold data. We also introduce adjacency-informed adaptations of PointNet and Transformer architectures that rely on our non-Euclidean sampling strategy. Our results demonstrate that incorporating topological information into deep learning workflows significantly improves performance on these otherwise challenging EuLearn datasets.</description>

      <title>Symplectic semi-characteristics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the symplectic semi-characteristic of a 4n-dimensional closed symplectic manifold. First, we define the symplectic semi-characteristic using the mapping cone complex model of the primitive cohomology. Second, using a vector field with nondegenerate zero points, we prove a counting formula for the symplectic semi-characteristic. As corollaries, we obtain an Atiyah type vanishing property and the fact that the symplectic semi-characteristic is independent of the choices of symplectic forms.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically non-negative Ricci curvature, elliptic Kato constant and isoperimetric inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16812v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ABP method for proving isoperimetric inequalities has been first employed by Cabr\'e in $\mathbb{R}^n$, then developed by Brendle, notably in the context of non-compact Riemannian manifolds of non-negative Ricci curvature and positive asymptotic volume ratio. In this paper, we expand upon their approach and prove isoperimetric inequalities (sharp in the limit) in the presence of a small amount of negative curvature. First, we consider smallness of the negative part $\mathrm{Ric}_-$ of the Ricci curvature in terms of its elliptic Kato constant. Indeed, the Kato constant turns out to control the non-negativity of the ($\infty$-)Bakry-\'Emery Ricci-tensor of a suitable conformal deformation of the manifold, and the ABP method can be implemented in this setting. Secondly, we show that the smallness of the Kato constant is ensured provided that the asymptotic volume ratio is positive and either $M$ has one end and asymptotically non-negative sectional curvature, or there is a suitable polynomial decay of $\mathrm{Ric}_{-}$, and the relative volume comparison condition known as $\textbf{(VC)}$ holds. To show this latter fact, we enhance techniques elaborated by Li-Tam and Kasue to obtain new estimates of the Green function valid on the whole manifold.</description>

      <title>The power series expansions of logarithmic Sobolev, $\mathcal{W}$- functionals and scalar curvature rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06117v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain that the logarithmic Sobolev and $\mathcal{W}$-functionals admit remarkable power series expansions when appropriate test functions are selected. Using these expansions formulas, we prove that for an open subset $V$ in an $n$-dimensional manifold $M$ with $\bar{V}\subset M$ satisfying: (a)The scalar curvature of $V$ satisfies the lower bound:$$\operatorname{Sc}(x) \geq n(n-1)K \quad \text{for all } x \in V,$$ (b) The isoperimetric profile of $V$ is no less than that of space form $M^n_K$:$$ \operatorname{I}(V,\beta) := \inf_{\substack{\Omega\subset V \\ \mathrm{Vol}(\Omega)=\beta}} \mathrm{Area}(\partial \Omega) \geq \operatorname{I}(M^n_K,\beta) \quad \text{for some } \beta_0&gt;0 \text{ and all } 0&lt;\beta&lt;\beta_0,$$\textbf{then} the sectional curvature of $V$ must satisfy $$\operatorname{Sec}(x) = K \quad \text{for all } x \in V.$$ Additionally, we derive some new scalar curvature rigidity theorems concerninglogarithmic Sobolev inequality and Perelman's $\boldsymbol{\mu}$-functional.</description>

      <title>Coulomb Gauges and Regularity for Stationary Weak Yang$-$Mills Connections in Supercritical Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19910v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that stationary Yang$-$Mills fields in dimensions 5 belonging to the variational class of weak connections are smooth away from a closed singular set $S$ of vanishing 1-dimensional Hausdorff measure. Our proof is based on an $\varepsilon$-regularity theorem, which generalizes to this class of weak connections the existing previous $\varepsilon$-regularity results by G. Tian for smooth connections, by Y. Meyer and the second author for Sobolev and approximable connections, and by T. Tao and G. Tian for admissible connections (which are weak limits of smooth Yang$-$Mills fields). On the path towards establishing $\varepsilon$-regularity, a pivotal step is the construction of controlled Coulomb gauges for general weak connections under small Morrey norm assumptions.</description>

Abstract: Let $N$ be a Riemannian, Lorentzian or neutral $4$-dimensional space form with constant sectional curvature $L_0$. In this paper, we obtain a characterization of space-like surfaces in $N$ with flat normal connection and parallel normal vector fields. In addition, we obtain a generic characterization of space-like surfaces in $N$ with flat normal connection, $K\equiv L_0$ which do not admit any parallel normal vector fields. For time-like surfaces in $N$ with flat normal connection, we obtain analogous results.</description>
