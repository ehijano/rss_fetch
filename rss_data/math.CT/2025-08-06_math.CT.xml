      <title>Orbifold completion of 3-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06485v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a general theory of 3-dimensional ``orbifold completion'', to describe (generalised) orbifolds of topological quantum field theories as well as all their defects. Given a semistrict 3-category $\mathcal{T}$ with adjoints for all 1- and 2-morphisms (more precisely, a Gray category with duals), we construct the 3-category $\mathcal{T}_{\textrm{orb}}$ as a Morita category of certain $E_1$-algebras in $\mathcal{T}$ which encode triangulation invariance. We prove that in $\mathcal{T}_{\textrm{orb}}$ again all 1- and 2-morphisms have adjoints, that it contains $\mathcal{T}$ as a full subcategory, and we argue, but do not prove, that it satisfies a universal property which implies $(\mathcal{T}_{\textrm{orb}})_{\textrm{orb}} \cong \mathcal{T}_{\textrm{orb}}$. This is a categorification of the work in [CR]. Orbifold completion by design allows us to lift the orbifold construction from closed TQFT to the much richer world of defect TQFTs. We illustrate this by constructing a universal 3-dimensional state sum model with all defects from first principles, and we explain how recent work on defects between Witt equivalent Reshetikhin--Turaev theories naturally appears as a special case of orbifold completion.</description>

      <title>(Non-)vanishing results for extensions between simple outer functors on free groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16881v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we study cohomological properties of the category of polynomial outer functors on free groups, which are the functors from the category of finitely generated free groups to the category of rational vector spaces which send all inner automorphisms to the identity morphism, and which satisfy a certain polynomiality property. More precisely, we prove vanishing and non-vanishing results for the Ext groups between simple polynomial outer functors. This work is inspired by an earlier result of Vespa for the category of all polynomial functors from finitely generated free groups to rational vector spaces; it follows in particular from her results that, in this larger category, the Ext groups between simple functors are always concentrated in a specific single degree. Our main results show that, when we pass to the full subcategory of polynomial outer functors, Ext groups between simple functors are sometimes non-trivial outside of this specific degree.</description>

      <title>Path spaces of pushouts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12339v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a span of spaces, one can form the homotopy pushout and then take the homotopy pullback of the resulting cospan. We give a concrete description of this pullback as the colimit of a sequence of approximations, using what we call the zigzag construction. We also obtain a description of loop spaces of homotopy pushouts. Using the zigzag construction, we reproduce generalisations of the Blakers-Massey theorem and fundamental results from Bass-Serre theory. We also describe the loop space of a wedge and show that it splits after suspension. Our construction can be interpreted in a large class of $(\infty,1)$-categories and in homotopy type theory, where it resolves the long-standing open problem of showing that a pushout of 0-types is 1-truncated. The zigzag construction is closely related to the James construction, but works in greater generality.</description>
