      <title>Effective Field Theory Constraints on Primordial Black Holes from the High-Redshift Lyman-$\alpha$ Forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present updated constraints on the abundance of primordial black holes (PBHs) dark matter from the high-redshift Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data from MIKE/HIRES experiments. Our analysis leverages an effective field theory (EFT) description of the 1D flux power spectrum, allowing us to analytically predict the Lyman-$\alpha$ fluctuations on quasi-linear scales from first principles. Our EFT-based likelihood enables robust inference across redshifts $z = 4.2-5.4$ and down to scales of 100 kpc, within previously unexplored regions of parameter space for this dataset. We derive new bounds on the PBH fraction with respect to the total dark matter $f_{\text{PBH}}$, excluding populations with $f_{\text{PBH}} \gtrsim 10^{-3}$ for masses $M_{\text{PBH}} \sim 10^{4}-10^{16} M_{\odot}$. This offers the leading constraint for PBHs heavier than $10^{9} M_{\odot}$ and highlights the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest as a uniquely sensitive probe of new physics models that modify the structure formation history of our universe.</description>

      <title>Hubble constant constraint using 117 FRBs with a more accurate probability density function for ${\rm DM}_{\rm diff}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are among the most mysterious astronomical transients. Due to their short durations and cosmological distances, their dispersion measure (DM) - redshift ($z$) relation is useful for constraining cosmological parameters and detecting the baryons in the Universe. The increasing number of localized FRBs in recent years has provided more precise constraints on these parameters. In this project, we collect 117 of the latest, localized FRBs, discuss the effect of a more accurate $\sigma_{\rm diff}$ in the probability density function ($p_{\rm diff}$) for ${\rm DM}_{\rm diff}$, and rewrite their likelihood convolution to better constrain the parameters above. We find that the widely used approximation $\sigma_{\rm diff} \sim F/\sqrt{z}$ only works under contrived assumptions. In general, one should use an accurate method to derive this parameter from $p_{\rm diff}$. Our method yields a constraint of $H_0\Omega_b f_{\rm diff} = 2.812_{-0.258}^{+0.250}$ or $H_0 = 66.889_{-5.460}^{+6.754}$ when combining the FRB data with CMB measurements and taking $f_{\rm diff} = 0.84$. This fully analytical correction helps us to better constrain cosmological parameters with the increasing number of localized FRBs available today.</description>

      <title>Bianchi Type I Model Cannot Explain the Observed CMB Angular Acoustic Scale Directional Variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anisotropic cosmological models have been gaining attention due to various observational hints of large-scale anisotropies. One of the most surprising evidences for the latter is the discovery of a dipole-like directional variation in cosmological parameters extracted from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data. In this work, we show that the directional variation of the CMB angular acoustic angle calculated with the fully asymmetric Bianchi Type I metric, a simple extension of the standard Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker metric, cannot account for the observed dipole-like anisotropy.</description>

      <title>CLASH-VLT: The variance of the velocity anisotropy profiles of galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The velocity anisotropy profiles, $\beta(r)$, of galaxy clusters are directly related to the shape of the orbits of their member galaxies. Knowledge of $\beta(r)$ is important to understand the assembly process of clusters and the evolutionary processes of their galaxies, and to improve the determination of cluster masses based on cluster kinematics. We determine the $\beta(r)$ of nine massive clusters at redshift $0.19 \leq z \leq 0.45$ from the CLASH-VLT data set, with 150 to 950 spectroscopic members each, to understand how much cluster-to-cluster variance exists in the $\beta(r)$ of different clusters and what is the main driver of this variance. We select spectroscopic cluster members with the CLUMPS algorithm calibrated on cosmological simulations. We apply the MAMPOSSt code to the distribution of cluster members in projected phase-space to constrain the cluster mass profile, $M(r)$, using priors derived from a previous gravitational lensing analysis. Given the MAMPOSSt best-fit solution for $M(r)$, we then solve the inversion of the Jeans equation to determine $\beta(r)$ without assumptions of its functional form. We also run the DS+ code to identify subclusters and characterize the dynamical status of our clusters. The average $\beta(r)$ is slightly radial, with the anisotropy increasing from $\beta \simeq 0.2$ at the cluster center, to $\beta \simeq 0.4$ at the virial radius. There is substantial variance in the $\beta(r)$ of the individual clusters, that cannot be entirely accounted for by the observational uncertainties. Clusters of lower mass and with a low concentration per given mass have more tangential $\beta(r)$'s. Clusters hosting a rich subcluster have $\beta(r)$ deviating more strongly from the average $\beta(r)$.</description>

      <title>The impact of galaxy bias on cross-correlation tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cross-correlation of galaxies at different redshifts with other tracers of the large-scale structure can be used to reconstruct the cosmic mean of key physical quantities, and their evolution over billions of years, at high precision. However, a correct interpretation of these measurements must ensure that they are independent of the clustering properties of the galaxy sample used. In this paper we explore different prescriptions to extract tomographic reconstruction measurements and use the FLAMINGO hydrodynamic simulations to show that a robust estimator, independent of the small-scale galaxy bias, can be constructed. We focus on the tomographic reconstruction of the halo bias-weighted electron pressure $\langle bP_e\rangle$ and star-formation density $\langle b\rho_{\rm SFR}\rangle$, which can be reconstructed from tomographic analysis of Sunyaev-Zel'dovich and cosmic infrared background maps, respectively. We show that these quantities can be reconstructed with an accuracy of 1-3\% over a wide range of redshifts, using different galaxy samples. We also show that these measurements can be accurately interpreted using the halo model, assuming a sufficiently reliable model can be constructed for the halo mass function, large-scale halo bias, and for the dependence of the physical quantities being reconstructed on halo mass.</description>

      <title>Constraints on transition redshift utilizing the latest H(z) measurements and comments on the Hubble tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The motivation of this paper is to obtain reliable constraints of transition redshift ($z_{ztr}$) and, in combination with the evolution of the Hubble constant ($H_{0}$) that could alleviate the Hubble tension, discuss the possible origin of the tension. Utilizing the latest H(z) measurements and different methods ($\Lambda$CDM model, Cosmography, and Gaussian process method), we investigated the impact of methodology and dataset on $z_{ztr}$ constraints, and find that the choice of method has a greater impact on $z_{tr}$ than the observations themselves. Through a statistical analysis of the $z_{ztr}$ constraints from 2004 to 2024, we find that total $z_{tr}$ constraints (2004$-$2024) can be well described by a Gaussian function with the mean value 0.65 and the standard deviation 0.16; that is, $\bar{z}_{tr}$(all) = 0.65 $\pm$ 0.16. And we confirmed that both dataset and methodology can indeed significantly affect the final constraints. The screened $z_{tr}$ constraints with free $H_{0}$ gives a new result $\bar{z}_{tr}$(free) = 0.64 $\pm$ 0.16. Coincidentally, the $z_{tr}$ results overlap with the initial moment of $H_{0}$ evolution ($H_{0}$ value starts to deviate from the Planck result). This may suggest that the Hubble tension might be closely related to this particular period in the evolution of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Cosmic string gravitational wave backgrounds at LISA: I. Signal survey, template reconstruction, and model comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a catalog of gravitational wave background (GWB) signal templates from cosmic-string networks, based on relevant models proposed in the literature. We classify templates as conventional, based on standard cosmology and Nambu-Goto results (VOS and BOS), and beyond conventional, based on modifications of a) the loop number density (LRS, super, metastable, current-carrying strings), b) the expansion history (non-standard cosmologies, extra degrees of freedom, either thermal or secluded), or c) the loop properties (birth length, power emission). Using the SBI package $\texttt{GWBackFinder}$, we quantify the reconstruction precision of each signal by LISA, scanning over their parameter space, and performing model comparisons. For conventional signals, LISA reconstructs the tension $G\mu$ with an error $\lesssim 10\%$ for $G\mu \gtrsim 5\cdot 10^{-15}$, which decreases down to $2-3\%$ for $G\mu \gtrsim 10^{-12}$. BOS and VOS modelings become distinguishable confidently for $G\mu \gtrsim 5\cdot 10^{-13}$. For beyond-conventional signals, we identify SNR and error-threshold intervals for each parameter, and determine (for few examples) the regions where they can be distinguished from conventional signals. Analogous quality reconstruction studies of cosmic-string GWBs, superimposed over leading astrophysical foregrounds in the LISA window, will be presented in a series of upcoming papers.</description>

      <title>Constraints on DBI dark energy with chameleon mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the Dirac Born Infeld chameleon scalar field model in light of the latest cosmological observations, analyzing the model both with the incorporation of the chameleon mechanism and without it. Results from current cosmological observations, such as Pantheon Plus, DES Y5, DESI DR2, and the compressed Planck likelihood, are used to constrain the model. We consider the AdS throat in the form of $f(\phi) = \lambda / \phi^4$ and a potential $V(\phi) = m_0^2 \phi^2 + m_1^2 \phi^4$ .One interesting finding from our analysis is that, without the chameleon mechanism, the mean value of $m_1 \simeq 0$ indicates the self-interaction of the DBI field could potentially be negligible. Constraints on the potential parameters do not appear when considering the chameleon mechanism, but the warp parameter and chameleon coupling parameter are forced to satisfy $\eta \geq 0$ and $\beta \leq 0$. Different choices of $\beta$ render the same background cosmological parameters. The equation of state $w_{\rm DE}$ resides more in the quintessence region in the past. There is no phantom crossing in this model under our assumption of the warp throat and potential. By computing the $\Delta \text{AIC}$ relative to the $\Lambda$CDM model, we study statistical model comparison. The model as a candidate of dynamical dark energy is observationally viable at the cosmological background level.</description>

      <title>Combined tracer analysis for DESI 2024 BAO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates how the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 1 (DR1) and future baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) analyses can optimally combine overlapping tracers (galaxies of distinct types) in the same redshift range. We make a unified catalog of Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) and Emission Line Galaxies (ELGs) in the redshift range 0.8 &lt; z &lt; 1.1 and investigate the impact on the BAO constraints. DESI DR1 contains ~30% of the final DESI LRG sample and less than 25% of the final ELG sample, and the combination of LRGs and ELGs increases the number density and reduces the shot noise. We developed a pipeline to merge the overlapping tracers using galaxy bias as an approximately optimal weight and tested the pipeline on a suite of Abacus simulations, calibrated on the final version of the DESI Early Data Release. When applying our pipeline to the DESI DR1 catalog, we find an improvement in the BAO constraints of 11% for $\alpha_\mathrm{iso}$ and ~7.0% for $\alpha_\mathrm{AP}$ consistent with our findings in mock catalogs. Our analysis was integrated into the DESI DR1 BAO analysis to produce the LRG+ELG result in the 0.8 &lt; z &lt; 1.1 redshift bin, which provided the most precise BAO measurement from DESI DR1 with a 0.86% constraint on the BAO distance scale and a $9.1\sigma$ detection of the isotropic BAO feature.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Accuracy of Reionization Prescriptions in Semi-analytic Models of the First Stars and Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semi-analytic models are a valuable tool to study the first stars and galaxies. Their numerical efficiency makes it possible to survey broad regions of astrophysical parameter space across large volumes and redshift ranges. Following reionization in these models is necessary since star formation is suppressed in ionized regions due to photoheating of the gas. Here we evaluate the accuracy of three semi-analytic reionization prescriptions (two previously developed and one new model) by comparing their three-dimensional distribution of ionized bubbles to the Renaissance hydrodynamical cosmological radiative transfer simulations. We find that the previously existing models accurately determine the distribution of the larger bubbles within our ${\sim}6$ comoving Mpc simulation box, but that these models fail to take into account self-shielded neutral gas in dense filaments. Thus, these prescriptions overestimate the fraction of halos in HII regions impacted by reionization feedback by up to an order of magnitude (depending on halo mass and redshift). This leads to an unrealistically large effect of reionization feedback on Pop III stars and low-mass metal-enriched galaxies. Our newly developed model takes into account the density structure of the cosmic web, leading to good agreement with Renaissance in the fraction of halos found in ionized regions.</description>

      <title>XRISM Reveals Complex Multi-Temperature Structures in the Abell 2029 Galaxy Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present $\sim$500 ks XRISM observations covering the central and two northern regions of the Abell 2029 galaxy cluster. Resolve enables us to distinguish multiple emission lines from hydrogen-like and helium-like iron (Fe) ions. This study focuses on the multi-temperature structure of Abell 2029 using line-ratio diagnostics. Using a single-temperature collisionally ionized equilibrium model, we measure average plasma temperatures of 6.73 keV, 7.61 keV, and 8.14 keV in the central, inner northern, and outer northern regions, respectively, spanning a radial range up to 700 kpc. To further investigate thermal structure, we derive excitation and ionization temperatures by comparing observed emission-line flux ratios with atomic database predictions. Significant deviations from the single-temperature CIE model in the central and inner northern regions indicate the presence of multi-phase gas. The excitation and ionization temperatures range from 2.85 keV to 8.5 keV in the central region, 4.3 keV to 9.8 keV in the inner northern region, and 8.3 keV to 10.4 keV in the outer northern region. These temperature distributions are largely consistent with the previously observed temperature gradient of A2029. However, Resolve detects two notably cooler components--3.42 keV in the central region and $\sim$4.3 keV in the inner northern region--likely associated with displaced cool gas due to gas sloshing. Additionally, we thermally resolve a 2.85 keV gas component at the core of A2029--potentially a significant development in our understanding of gas cooling. We propose that this cooler gas is a direct product of ongoing cooling processes in A2029, having already cooled to its present temperature. If this temperature structure is stable and no heating mechanism is present, this reservoir is likely to cool to even lower temperatures and form stars.</description>

      <title>Search for gravitational waves from eccentric binary black holes with an effective-one-body template</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As gravitational wave astronomy has entered an era of routine detections, it becomes increasingly important to precisely measure the physical parameters of individual events and infer population properties. Eccentricity is a key observable, suggesting that binaries form in a dense stellar environment through dynamical encounters. This work performs the first matched-filtering search for gravitational waves from eccentric binary black holes (BBHs) covering the mass range $[5, 200]~M_\odot$ and eccentricity at 20 Hz up to 0.5 with a newly developed effective-one-body waveform model. Throughout the third observation run of LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA, we identify 28 BBH events with a false alarm rate below once per 100 yr; all of which were previously reported in the GWTC-3 and 4-OGC catalogs. Additional candidates with false alarm rates between once per 1 and 100 yr are also reported. We perform an injection campaign to characterize the sensitive volume time of our search pipeline. Assuming that none of the eccentric BBH events were missed by previous searches, our results provide constraints on the event rate of eccentric BBHs in the mass range [5, 30] $M_\odot$. For a 30-30 $M_\odot$ BBH with eccentricity 0.5, the event rate is limited to less than 0.06 Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$; this marks an order of magnitude improvement for sensitive volume compared with the previous search with a minimally modeled algorithm without using templates.</description>

      <title>CRAFTS for HI cosmology: I. data processing pipeline and validation tests</title>

Abstract: We present the calibration procedures and validation of source measurement with the data of the Commensal Radio Astronomy FAST Survey (CRAFTS) for \HI intensity mapping by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST). Using 70-hour drift-scan observation with the L-band (1.05-1.45GHz) 19-beam receiver, we obtain the data covering $270\,\rm deg^2$ sky area. We employ both the pulsar backend and the spectrum backend to calibrate the spectral time-ordered-data (TOD) before projecting them onto HEALPix maps. We produce calibrated TOD with frequency resolution of 30kHz and time resolution of 1s and the map data-cube with frequency resolution of 30kHz and spatial resolution of $2.95\,\rm arcmin^2$. We examine the pointing errors, noise overflow, RFI contamination and their effect on the data quality. The resulting noise level is $\sim$ 5.7mJy for the calibrated TOD and 1.6mJy for the map, consistent with the theoretical predictions within 5\% at RFI-free channels. We also validate the data by Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and find the residual map looks thermal noise dominated after removing 30 modes. We identify 447 isolated bright continuum sources in our data matching the NRAO-VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) catalog, with relative flux error of 8.3\% for TOD and 6.6\% for the map-level. We also measure the \HI emission of 90 galaxies with redshift $z&lt;0.07$ and compare with \HI-MaNGA spectra, yielding an overall relative \HI integral flux error of 16.7\%. These results provide an important first step in assessing the feasibility of conducting cosmological \HI detection with CRAFTS.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Continuous Gravitational Waves from Supermassive Black Hole Binaries in Realistic Pulsar Timing Array Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays recently found evidence for a gravitational wave background (GWB), likely the stochastic overlap of GWs from many supermassive black hole binaries. Anticipating a continuous gravitational wave (CW) detection from a single binary soon to follow, we examine how well current Bayesian methods can detect CWs and characterize their binary properties by modeling the response of the NANOGrav 15-year pulsar timing array to simulated binary populations. We run Markov Chain Monte Carlo searches for CWs in these datasets and compare them to quicker detection statistics including the optimal signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), matched filter detection statistic, and reduced log-likelihood ratio between the signal and noise models calculated at the injected parameters. The latter is the best proxy for Bayesian detection fractions, corresponding to a 50% detection fraction (by Bayes factors &gt; 10 favoring a CW detection over noise-only model) at an S/N = 4.6. Source confusion between the GWB and a CW, or between multiple CWs, can cause false detections and unexpected dismissals. 53% of realistic binary populations consistent with the recently observed GWB have successful CW detections. 82% of these CWs are in the 4th or 5th frequency bin of the 16.03 yr dataset (6.9 and 10.8 nHz), with 95th percentile regions spanning 4-12nHz frequencies, 0.7-20$\times10^9 M_\odot$ chirp masses, 60Mpc-8Gpc luminosity distances, and 18-13,000 sq. deg 68% confidence localization areas. These successful detections often poorly recover the chirp mass, with only 29% identifying the chirp mass accurately to within 1 dex with a 68% posterior width also narrower than 1 dex.</description>

      <title>Comparison of dark energy models using late-universe observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the framework of general relativity, dark energy was proposed to explain the cosmic acceleration. A pivotal inquiry in cosmology is to determine whether dark energy is the cosmological constant, and if not, the challenge lies in constraining how it evolves with time. In this paper, we utilize the latest observational data to constrain some typical dark energy models, and make a comparison for them according to their capabilities of fitting the current data. Our study is confined to late-universe observations, including the baryon acoustic oscillation, type Ia supernova, cosmic chronometer, and strong gravitational lensing time delay data. We employ the Akaike information criterion (AIC), deviance information criterion (DIC), and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) to assess the worth of models. The AIC and DIC analyses indicate that all dark energy models outperform the $\Lambda$CDM model. However, the BIC analysis leaves room for $\Lambda$CDM due to its heavier penalty on the model complexity. Compared to $\Lambda$CDM, most dark energy models are robustly supported by AIC and DIC while being explicitly disfavored by BIC. The models that are robustly favored by AIC and DIC and not explicitly disfavored by BIC include the $w$CDM, interacting dark energy, and Ricci dark energy models. Furthermore, we observe that an alternative modified gravity model exhibits superior performance when compared with $\Lambda$CDM across all information criteria.</description>

      <title>Future Parameter Constraints from Weak Lensing CMB and Galaxy Lensing Power- and Bispectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Upcoming stage 4 surveys, such as the Simons Observatory, LSST, and Euclid, are poised to measure weak gravitational lensing of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and galaxies with unprecedented precision. While the power spectrum is the standard statistic used to analyze weak lensing data, non-Gaussianity from non-linear structure growth encodes additional cosmological information in higher-order statistics. We forecast the ability of future surveys to constrain cosmological parameters using the weak lensing power spectrum and bispectrum from both CMB and galaxy surveys, including their cross-correlations. We consider an eight-parameter model ($\Lambda$CDM + $\sum m_\nu$ + $w_0$) and assess constraints for stage 4 survey specifications. In the absence of systematics, both the CMB and galaxy lensing bispectra are found to be detectable at high signal-to-noise. We test two priors: a ''strong'' one based on constraints from CMB temperature and $E$-mode polarization anisotropies, and a ''weak'' one with minimal assumptions. With the weak prior, the bispectrum significantly improves parameter constraints by breaking degeneracies. For strong priors, improvements are more limited, especially for the CMB bispectrum. On small scales, where non-linear effects dominate, the bispectrum's constraining power can rival that of the power spectrum. We also find strong synergy between CMB and galaxy lensing; combining both probes leads to tighter constraints, particularly on neutrino mass. It was recently found that the CMB lensing bispectrum is strongly affected by the Born approximation, so we also consider post-Born corrections but find that our main conclusions remain the same. These results highlight the potential of higher-order lensing statistics and motivate further work on neglected effects such as non-Gaussian covariance, instrumental systematics, and baryonic feedback.</description>

      <title>Detecting Axion-Like Particles with Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.11980v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Future gamma-ray experiments, such as the e-ASTROGAM and AMEGO telescopes, can detect the Hawking radiation of photons from primordial black holes (PBHs) if they make up a fraction or all of dark matter. PBHs can analogously also Hawking radiate new particles, which is especially interesting if these particles are mostly secluded from the Standard Model (SM) sector, since they might therefore be less accessible otherwise. A well-motivated example of this type is axion-like particles (ALPs) with a tiny coupling to photons. We assume that the ALPs produced by PBHs decay into photons well before reaching the earth, so these will augment the photons directly radiated by the PBHs. Remarkably, we find that the peaks in the energy distributions of ALPs produced from PBHs are different than the corresponding ones for Hawking radiated photons due to the spin-dependent greybody factor. Therefore, we demonstrate that this process will in fact distinctively modify the PBHs' gamma-ray spectrum relative to the SM prediction. We use monochromatic asteroid-mass PBHs as an example to show that e-ASTROGAM can observe the PBH-produced ALP gamma-ray signal (for masses up to ~60 MeV) and further distinguish it from Hawking radiation without ALPs. By measuring the gamma-ray signals, e-ASTROGAM can thereby probe yet unexplored parameters in the ALP mass and photon coupling.</description>

      <title>Hunting axion dark matter with anti-ferromagnets: a case study with nickel oxide</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that nickel oxide, which is already a very promising target to look for sub-MeV dark matter scattering, can be employed to hunt axion dark matter, with masses in the meV range and couplings to electrons allowing them to potentially be QCD axions. We describe the interactions between axions and the collective excitations of nickel oxide in terms of a universal effective field theory, built solely out of symmetry arguments. The processes of conversion into one or two excitations provide, respectively, a narrowband and a broadband channel for the axion search, and the possibility of varying an external magnetic field up to a phase transition point allows to cover a large portion of a yet unexplored parameter space, reaching axion masses down to few fractions of an meV. Our results underline nickel oxide as an ideal candidate for a multi-purpose target for light dark matter searches.</description>

      <title>Dark energy under a gauge symmetry: A review of gauged quintessence and its implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review the gauged quintessence scenario, wherein the quintessence scalar field responsible for dark energy is promoted to a complex field charged under a dark $U(1)$ gauge symmetry. This construction leads to new and potentially rich cosmological phenomenology. After a concise recap of the standard quintessence scenario, we highlight how a $U(1)$ gauge invariance alters the dynamics of the scalar and the associated dark gauge boson. We survey the evolution of both fields across cosmic history, discuss their possible production via a misalignment mechanism, and examine implications for the Hubble tension. We also comment on potential non-gravitational signals of gauged quintessence through kinetic mixing (the dark photon vector portal).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent study[1] has suggested that warm inflation may be realized with Standard Model gauge interaction alone. Motivated by this framework, we investigate the gravitational wave spectrum and graviton-portal dark matter production through the freeze-in process generated during warm inflation scenarios. We perform a comparative analysis for different dissipation terms, focusing on their distinct gravitational wave signatures in the high-frequency regime. Our findings reveal qualitative and quantitative differences in the spectral behavior, offering a preliminary pathway for discriminating among various inflationary and dark matter models through high-frequency gravitational wave signals.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing Neutron Star vs. Low-Mass Black Hole Binaries with Postmerger Gravitational Waves $-$ Sensitivity to Transmuted Black Holes and Non-Annihilating Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15951v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The astrophysical origin of observed low-mass compact binary coalescences in the 1-2.5 $M_{\odot}$ range remains ambiguous. Both binary neutron star (BNS) and binary low-mass black hole (LMBH) mergers produce nearly identical inspiral waveforms, and electromagnetic follow-up is not always possible. Distinguishing between these scenarios therefore presents a key challenge. We demonstrate that waveform differences in the late-inspiral to postmerger epochs create significant mismatches that will be detectable by planned detectors, viz., NEMO, Cosmic Explorer, and Einstein Telescope, while the currently operational LIGO A+ will be effective only for nearby sources. These differences are enhanced for stiffer equations of state. We show how the redshift-dependent compact binary merger rate inferred from gravitational wave observations can be parsed into BNS and LMBH components, accounting for misclassification probability. We forecast model-independent 90% exclusion sensitivities for the LMBH fraction. Interpreting these LMBHs as dark matter capture-induced transmuted black holes, we convert exclusion sensitivities into projected exclusion bounds on heavy non-annihilating dark matter. Our results illustrate how gravitational wave measurements can disentangle compact object populations and provide new insights into particle dark matter interactions.</description>

      <title>Synthesizer: a Software Package for Synthetic Astronomical Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03888v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Synthesizer, a fast, flexible, modular and extensible platform for modelling synthetic astrophysical observables. Synthesizer can be used for a number of applications, but is predominantly designed for generating mock observables from analytical and numerical galaxy formation simulations. These use cases include (but are not limited to) analytical modelling of the star formation and metal enrichment histories of galaxies, the creation of mock images and integral field unit observations from particle based simulations, detailed photoionisation modelling of the central regions of active galactic nuclei, and spectro-photometric fitting. We provide a number of stellar population synthesis models, photoionisation code configurations, dust models, and imaging configurations that can be used 'out-of-the-box' interactively. We invite and encourage the community to use, test and develop the code, and hope that the foundation developed will provide a flexible framework for a number of tasks in forward and inverse modelling of astrophysical observables. The code is publicly available at https://synthesizer-project.github.io/</description>
