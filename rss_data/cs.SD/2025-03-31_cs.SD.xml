      <title>Hierarchical Label Propagation: A Model-Size-Dependent Performance Booster for AudioSet Tagging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AudioSet is one of the most used and largest datasets in audio tagging, containing about 2 million audio samples that are manually labeled with 527 event categories organized into an ontology. However, the annotations contain inconsistencies, particularly where categories that should be labeled as positive according to the ontology are frequently mislabeled as negative. To address this issue, we apply Hierarchical Label Propagation (HLP), which propagates labels up the ontology hierarchy, resulting in a mean increase in positive labels per audio clip from 1.98 to 2.39 and affecting 109 out of the 527 classes. Our results demonstrate that HLP provides performance benefits across various model architectures, including convolutional neural networks (PANN's CNN6 and ConvNeXT) and transformers (PaSST), with smaller models showing more improvements. Finally, on FSD50K, another widely used dataset, models trained on AudioSet with HLP consistently outperformed those trained without HLP. Our source code will be made available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Tune It Up: Music Genre Transfer and Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep generative models have been used in style transfer tasks for images. In this study, we adapt and improve CycleGAN model to perform music style transfer on Jazz and Classic genres. By doing so, we aim to easily generate new songs, cover music to different music genres and reduce the arrangements needed in those processes. We train and use music genre classifier to assess the performance of the transfer models. To that end, we obtain 87.7% accuracy with Multi-layer Perceptron algorithm. To improve our style transfer baseline, we add auxiliary discriminators and triplet loss to our model. According to our experiments, we obtain the best accuracies as 69.4% in Jazz to Classic task and 39.3% in Classic to Jazz task with our developed genre classifier. We also run a subjective experiment and results of it show that the overall performance of our transfer model is good and it manages to conserve melody of inputs on the transferred outputs.

      <title>Enhancing Dance-to-Music Generation via Negative Conditioning Latent Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conditional diffusion models have gained increasing attention since their impressive results for cross-modal synthesis, where the strong alignment between conditioning input and generated output can be achieved by training a time-conditioned U-Net augmented with cross-attention mechanism. In this paper, we focus on the problem of generating music synchronized with rhythmic visual cues of the given dance video. Considering that bi-directional guidance is more beneficial for training a diffusion model, we propose to enhance the quality of generated music and its synchronization with dance videos by adopting both positive rhythmic information and negative ones (PN-Diffusion) as conditions, where a dual diffusion and reverse processes is devised. Specifically, to train a sequential multi-modal U-Net structure, PN-Diffusion consists of a noise prediction objective for positive conditioning and an additional noise prediction objective for negative conditioning. To accurately define and select both positive and negative conditioning, we ingeniously utilize temporal correlations in dance videos, capturing positive and negative rhythmic cues by playing them forward and backward, respectively. Through subjective and objective evaluations of input-output correspondence in terms of dance-music beat alignment and the quality of generated music, experimental results on the AIST++ and TikTok dance video datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms SOTA dance-to-music generation models.</description>

      <title>Enhance Generation Quality of Flow Matching V2A Model via Multi-Step CoT-Like Guidance and Combined Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Creating high-quality sound effects from videos and text prompts requires precise alignment between visual and audio domains, both semantically and temporally, along with step-by-step guidance for professional audio generation. However, current state-of-the-art video-guided audio generation models often fall short of producing high-quality audio for both general and specialized use cases. To address this challenge, we introduce a multi-stage, multi-modal, end-to-end generative framework with Chain-of-Thought-like (CoT-like) guidance learning, termed Chain-of-Perform (CoP). First, we employ a transformer-based network architecture designed to achieve CoP guidance, enabling the generation of both general and professional audio. Second, we implement a multi-stage training framework that follows step-by-step guidance to ensure the generation of high-quality sound effects. Third, we develop a CoP multi-modal dataset, guided by video, to support step-by-step sound effects generation. Evaluation results highlight the advantages of the proposed multi-stage CoP generative framework compared to the state-of-the-art models on a variety of datasets, with FAD 0.79 to 0.74 (+6.33%), CLIP 16.12 to 17.70 (+9.80%) on VGGSound, SI-SDR 1.98dB to 3.35dB (+69.19%), MOS 2.94 to 3.49(+18.71%) on PianoYT-2h, and SI-SDR 2.22dB to 3.21dB (+44.59%), MOS 3.07 to 3.42 (+11.40%) on Piano-10h.</description>

      <title>DeepSound-V1: Start to Think Step-by-Step in the Audio Generation from Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Currently, high-quality, synchronized audio is synthesized from video and optional text inputs using various multi-modal joint learning frameworks. However, the precise alignment between the visual and generated audio domains remains far from satisfactory. One key factor is the lack of sufficient temporal and semantic alignment annotations in open-source video-audio and text-audio benchmarks. Therefore, we propose a framework for audio generation from videos, leveraging the internal chain-of-thought (CoT) of a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) to enable step-by-step reasoning without requiring additional annotations. Additionally, a corresponding multi-modal reasoning dataset is constructed to facilitate the learning of initial reasoning in audio generation. In the experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in reducing misalignment (voice-over) in generated audio and achieving competitive performance compared to various state-of-the-art models. The evaluation results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across multiple metrics. Specifically, the F DP aSST indicator is reduced by up to 10.07%, the F DP AN N s indicator by up to 11.62%, and the F DV GG indicator by up to 38.61%. Furthermore, the IS indicator improves by up to 4.95%, the IB-score indicator increases by up to 6.39%, and the DeSync indicator is reduced by up to 0.89%.</description>

      <title>Cross-Technology Generalization in Synthesized Speech Detection: Evaluating AST Models with Modern Voice Generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper evaluates the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) architecture for synthesized speech detection, with focus on generalization across modern voice generation technologies. Using differentiated augmentation strategies, the model achieves 0.91% EER overall when tested against ElevenLabs, NotebookLM, and Minimax AI voice generators. Notably, after training with only 102 samples from a single technology, the model demonstrates strong cross-technology generalization, achieving 3.3% EER on completely unseen voice generators. This work establishes benchmarks for rapid adaptation to emerging synthesis technologies and provides evidence that transformer-based architectures can identify common artifacts across different neural voice synthesis methods, contributing to more robust speech verification systems.</description>

      <title>Lend a Hand: Semi Training-Free Cued Speech Recognition via MLLM-Driven Hand Modeling for Barrier-free Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cued Speech (CS) is an innovative visual communication system that integrates lip-reading with hand coding, designed to enhance effective communication for individuals with hearing impairments. Automatic CS Recognition (ACSR) refers to the AI-driven process of automatically recognizing hand gestures and lip movements in CS, converting them into text. However, previous work often relies on complex fusion modules and training techniques. Additionally, due to the limited amount of data in CS, the extraction of hand features, as well as recognition modeling, has consistently been subpar, significantly limiting the effectiveness of ACSR. To address this issue, we have innovatively explored the capabilities of Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in recognizing hand shapes and positions in CS. More precisely, we propose a new Semi Training-Free paradigm for ACSR, named STF-ACSR. This approach leverages zero-shot recognition of hand movements through the Chinese CS Prompt Module (CCSPM), which equipped a training-free keyframe filtering and customized prompt engineering based on MLLM. It then integrates the recognition results into the lip-reading model using a Minimalist Fusion Module (MFM), effectively achieving superior recognition results. Furthermore, specifically for this study, we have supplemented the existing dataset of 6 normal hearing CS cuers by recording additional data from 8 cuers with hearing impairments, resulting in a new mixed dataset. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that STF-ACSR significantly outperforms previous methods on both normal and hearing-impaired data. Implementation and checkpoints are available at https://github.com/DennisHgj/STF_ACSR.</description>

      <title>Baseline Systems and Evaluation Metrics for Spatial Semantic Segmentation of Sound Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Immersive communication has made significant advancements, especially with the release of the codec for Immersive Voice and Audio Services. Aiming at its further realization, the DCASE 2025 Challenge has recently introduced a task for spatial semantic segmentation of sound scenes (S5), which focuses on detecting and separating sound events in spatial sound scenes. In this paper, we explore methods for addressing the S5 task. Specifically, we present baseline S5 systems that combine audio tagging (AT) and label-queried source separation (LSS) models. We investigate two LSS approaches based on the ResUNet architecture: a) extracting a single source for each detected event and b) querying multiple sources concurrently. Since each separated source in S5 is identified by its sound event class label, we propose new class-aware metrics to evaluate both the sound sources and labels simultaneously. Experimental results on first-order ambisonics spatial audio demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed systems and confirm the efficacy of the metrics.</description>

      <title>DeepAudio-V1:Towards Multi-Modal Multi-Stage End-to-End Video to Speech and Audio Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Currently, high-quality, synchronized audio is synthesized using various multi-modal joint learning frameworks, leveraging video and optional text inputs. In the video-to-audio benchmarks, video-to-audio quality, semantic alignment, and audio-visual synchronization are effectively achieved. However, in real-world scenarios, speech and audio often coexist in videos simultaneously, and the end-to-end generation of synchronous speech and audio given video and text conditions are not well studied. Therefore, we propose an end-to-end multi-modal generation framework that simultaneously produces speech and audio based on video and text conditions. Furthermore, the advantages of video-to-audio (V2A) models for generating speech from videos remain unclear. The proposed framework, DeepAudio, consists of a video-to-audio (V2A) module, a text-to-speech (TTS) module, and a dynamic mixture of modality fusion (MoF) module. In the evaluation, the proposed end-to-end framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on the video-audio benchmark, video-speech benchmark, and text-speech benchmark. In detail, our framework achieves comparable results in the comparison with state-of-the-art models for the video-audio and text-speech benchmarks, and surpassing state-of-the-art models in the video-speech benchmark, with WER 16.57% to 3.15% (+80.99%), SPK-SIM 78.30% to 89.38% (+14.15%), EMO-SIM 66.24% to 75.56% (+14.07%), MCD 8.59 to 7.98 (+7.10%), MCD SL 11.05 to 9.40 (+14.93%) across a variety of dubbing settings.</description>

      <title>Make Some Noise: Towards LLM audio reasoning and generation using sound tokens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating audio comprehension and generation into large language models (LLMs) remains challenging due to the continuous nature of audio and the resulting high sampling rates. Here, we introduce a novel approach that combines Variational Quantization with Conditional Flow Matching to convert audio into ultra-low bitrate discrete tokens of 0.23kpbs, allowing for seamless integration with text tokens in LLMs. We fine-tuned a pretrained text-based LLM using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to assess its effectiveness in achieving true multimodal capabilities, i.e., audio comprehension and generation. Our tokenizer outperforms a traditional VQ-VAE across various datasets with diverse acoustic events. Despite the substantial loss of fine-grained details through audio tokenization, our multimodal LLM trained with discrete tokens achieves competitive results in audio comprehension with state-of-the-art methods, though audio generation is poor. Our results highlight the need for larger, more diverse datasets and improved evaluation metrics to advance multimodal LLM performance.</description>

      <title>Audio-Plane: Audio Factorization Plane Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Talking Head Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Talking head synthesis has become a key research area in computer graphics and multimedia, yet most existing methods often struggle to balance generation quality with computational efficiency. In this paper, we present a novel approach that leverages an Audio Factorization Plane (Audio-Plane) based Gaussian Splatting for high-quality and real-time talking head generation. For modeling a dynamic talking head, 4D volume representation is needed. However, directly storing a dense 4D grid is impractical due to the high cost and lack of scalability for longer durations. We overcome this challenge with the proposed Audio-Plane, where the 4D volume representation is decomposed into audio-independent space planes and audio-dependent planes. This provides a compact and interpretable feature representation for talking head, facilitating more precise audio-aware spatial encoding and enhanced audio-driven lip dynamic modeling. To further improve speech dynamics, we develop a dynamic splatting method that helps the network more effectively focus on modeling the dynamics of the mouth region. Extensive experiments demonstrate that by integrating these innovations with the powerful Gaussian Splatting, our method is capable of synthesizing highly realistic talking videos in real time while ensuring precise audio-lip synchronization. Synthesized results are available in https://sstzal.github.io/Audio-Plane/.</description>

      <title>FireRedTTS-1S: An Upgraded Streamable Foundation Text-to-Speech System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a high-quality streaming foundation text-to-speech system, FireRedTTS-1S, upgraded from the streamable version of FireRedTTS. FireRedTTS-1S achieves streaming generation via two steps: text-to-semantic decoding and semantic-to-acoustic decoding. In text-to-semantic decoding, a semantic-aware speech tokenizer converts the speech signal into semantic tokens, which can be synthesized from the text via a semantic language model in an auto-regressive manner. Meanwhile, the semantic-to-acoustic decoding module simultaneously translates generated semantic tokens into the speech signal in a streaming way via a super-resolution causal audio codec and a multi-stream acoustic language model. This design enables us to produce high-quality speech audio in zero-shot settings while presenting a real-time generation process with low latency under 150ms. In experiments on zero-shot voice cloning, the objective results validate FireRedTTS-1S as a high-quality foundation model with comparable intelligibility and speaker similarity over industrial baseline systems. Furthermore, the subjective score of FireRedTTS-1S highlights its impressive synthesis performance, achieving comparable quality to the ground-truth recordings. These results validate FireRedTTS-1S as a high-quality streaming foundation TTS system.</description>

      <title>ERSAM: Neural Architecture Search For Energy-Efficient and Real-Time Social Ambiance Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.10727v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social ambiance describes the context in which social interactions happen, and can be measured using speech audio by counting the number of concurrent speakers. This measurement has enabled various mental health tracking and human-centric IoT applications. While on-device Socal Ambiance Measure (SAM) is highly desirable to ensure user privacy and thus facilitate wide adoption of the aforementioned applications, the required computational complexity of state-of-the-art deep neural networks (DNNs) powered SAM solutions stands at odds with the often constrained resources on mobile devices. Furthermore, only limited labeled data is available or practical when it comes to SAM under clinical settings due to various privacy constraints and the required human effort, further challenging the achievable accuracy of on-device SAM solutions. To this end, we propose a dedicated neural architecture search framework for Energy-efficient and Real-time SAM (ERSAM). Specifically, our ERSAM framework can automatically search for DNNs that push forward the achievable accuracy vs. hardware efficiency frontier of mobile SAM solutions. For example, ERSAM-delivered DNNs only consume 40 mW x 12 h energy and 0.05 seconds processing latency for a 5 seconds audio segment on a Pixel 3 phone, while only achieving an error rate of 14.3% on a social ambiance dataset generated by LibriSpeech. We can expect that our ERSAM framework can pave the way for ubiquitous on-device SAM solutions which are in growing demand.</description>

      <title>Multi-modal Speech Transformer Decoders: When Do Multiple Modalities Improve Accuracy?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decoder-only discrete-token language models have recently achieved significant success in automatic speech recognition. However, systematic analyses of how different modalities impact performance in specific scenarios remain limited. In this paper, we investigate the effects of multiple modalities on recognition accuracy on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Our experiments suggest that: (1) Integrating more modalities can increase accuracy; in particular, our paper is, to our best knowledge, the first to show the benefit of combining audio, image context, and lip information; (2) Images as a supplementary modality for speech recognition provide the greatest benefit at moderate noise levels, moreover, they exhibit a different trend compared to inherently synchronized modalities like lip movements; (3) Performance improves on both synthetic and real-world datasets when the most relevant visual information is filtered as a preprocessing step.</description>

      <title>Circumventing shortcuts in audio-visual deepfake detection datasets with unsupervised learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00175v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Good datasets are essential for developing and benchmarking any machine learning system. Their importance is even more extreme for safety critical applications such as deepfake detection - the focus of this paper. Here we reveal that two of the most widely used audio-video deepfake datasets suffer from a previously unidentified spurious feature: the leading silence. Fake videos start with a very brief moment of silence and based on this feature alone, we can separate the real and fake samples almost perfectly. As such, previous audio-only and audio-video models exploit the presence of silence in the fake videos and consequently perform worse when the leading silence is removed. To circumvent latching on such unwanted artifact and possibly other unrevealed ones we propose a shift from supervised to unsupervised learning by training models exclusively on real data. We show that by aligning self-supervised audio-video representations we remove the risk of relying on dataset-specific biases and improve robustness in deepfake detection.</description>

      <title>MegaTTS 3: Sparse Alignment Enhanced Latent Diffusion Transformer for Zero-Shot Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18924v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While recent zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) models have significantly improved speech quality and expressiveness, mainstream systems still suffer from issues related to speech-text alignment modeling: 1) models without explicit speech-text alignment modeling exhibit less robustness, especially for hard sentences in practical applications; 2) predefined alignment-based models suffer from naturalness constraints of forced alignments. This paper introduces \textit{MegaTTS 3}, a TTS system featuring an innovative sparse alignment algorithm that guides the latent diffusion transformer (DiT). Specifically, we provide sparse alignment boundaries to MegaTTS 3 to reduce the difficulty of alignment without limiting the search space, thereby achieving high naturalness. Moreover, we employ a multi-condition classifier-free guidance strategy for accent intensity adjustment and adopt the piecewise rectified flow technique to accelerate the generation process. Experiments demonstrate that MegaTTS 3 achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot TTS speech quality and supports highly flexible control over accent intensity. Notably, our system can generate high-quality one-minute speech with only 8 sampling steps. Audio samples are available at https://sditdemo.github.io/sditdemo/.</description>
