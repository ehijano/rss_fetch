      <title>Leveraging AES Padding: dBs for Nothing and FEC for Free in IoT Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) represents a significant advancement in digital technology, with its rapidly growing network of interconnected devices. This expansion, however, brings forth critical challenges in data security and reliability, especially under the threat of increasing cyber vulnerabilities. Addressing the security concerns, the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is commonly employed for secure encryption in IoT systems. Our study explores an innovative use of AES, by repurposing AES padding bits for error correction and thus introducing a dual-functional method that seamlessly integrates error-correcting capabilities into the standard encryption process. The integration of the state-of-the-art Guessing Random Additive Noise Decoder (GRAND) in the receiver's architecture facilitates the joint decoding and decryption process. This strategic approach not only preserves the existing structure of the transmitter but also significantly enhances communication reliability in noisy environments, achieving a notable over 3 dB gain in Block Error Rate (BLER). Remarkably, this enhanced performance comes with a minimal power overhead at the receiver - less than 15% compared to the traditional decryption-only process, underscoring the efficiency of our hardware design for IoT applications. This paper discusses a comprehensive analysis of our approach, particularly in energy efficiency and system performance, presenting a novel and practical solution for reliable IoT communications.</description>

      <title>G\"odel Number based Clustering Algorithm with Decimal First Degree Cellular Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a decimal first degree cellular automata (FDCA) based clustering algorithm is proposed where clusters are created based on reachability. Cyclic spaces are created and configurations which are in the same cycle are treated as the same cluster. Here, real-life data objects are encoded into decimal strings using G\"odel number based encoding. The benefits of the scheme is, it reduces the encoded string length while maintaining the features properties. Candidate CA rules are identified based on some theoretical criteria such as self-replication and information flow. An iterative algorithm is developed to generate the desired number of clusters over three stages. The results of the clustering are evaluated based on benchmark clustering metrics such as Silhouette score, Davis Bouldin, Calinski Harabasz and Dunn Index. In comparison with the existing state-of-the-art clustering algorithms, our proposed algorithm gives better performance.</description>

      <title>Probing Quantum Telecloning on Superconducting Quantum Processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15579v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum information can not be perfectly cloned, but approximate copies of quantum information can be generated. Quantum telecloning combines approximate quantum cloning, more typically referred as quantum cloning, and quantum teleportation. Quantum telecloning allows approximate copies of quantum information to be constructed by separate parties, using the classical results of a Bell measurement made on a prepared quantum telecloning state. Quantum telecloning can be implemented as a circuit on quantum computers using a classical co-processor to compute classical feed forward instructions using if statements based on the results of a mid-circuit Bell measurement in real time. We present universal, symmetric, optimal $1 \rightarrow M$ telecloning circuits, and experimentally demonstrate these quantum telecloning circuits for $M=2$ up to $M=10$, natively executed with real time classical control systems on IBM Quantum superconducting processors, known as dynamic circuits. We perform the cloning procedure on many different message states across the Bloch sphere, on $7$ IBM Quantum processors, optionally using the error suppression technique X-X sequence digital dynamical decoupling. Two circuit optimizations are utilized, one which removes ancilla qubits for $M=2, 3$, and one which reduces the total number of gates in the circuit but still uses ancilla qubits. Parallel single qubit tomography with MLE density matrix reconstruction is used in order to compute the mixed state density matrices of the clone qubits, and clone quality is measured using quantum fidelity. These results present one of the largest and most comprehensive NISQ computer experimental analyses on (single qubit) quantum telecloning to date. The clone fidelity sharply decreases to $0.5$ for $M &gt; 5$, but for $M=2$ we are able to achieve a mean clone fidelity of up to $0.79$ using dynamical decoupling.</description>

      <title>Hybrid quantum-classical computation for automatic guided vehicles scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by global efforts to develop quantum computing for practical, industrial-scale challenges, we showcase the effectiveness of state-of-the-art hybrid quantum-classical solvers in addressing the business-centric optimization problem of scheduling Automatic Guided Vehicles (AGVs). These solvers leverage a noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) device, specifically a D-Wave quantum annealer. In our study, the hybrid solvers exhibit non-zero quantum processing times, indicating a significant contribution of the quantum component to solution efficiency. This hybrid methodology performs comparably to existing classical solvers, thus indicating `quantum readiness' for scheduling tasks. Our analysis focuses on a practical, business-oriented scenario: scheduling AGVs within a factory constrained by limited space, simulating a realistic production setting. Our new approach concerns mapping a realistic AGV problem onto a problem reminiscient of railway scheduling and demonstrating that the AGV problem more suits quantum computing than the railway counterpart and is more dense in terms of an average number of constraints per variable. We demonstrate that a scenario involving 15 AGVs, which holds practical significance due to common bottlenecks like shared main lanes leading to frequent deadlocks, can be efficiently addressed by a hybrid quantum-classical solver within seconds. Consequently, our research paves the way for the near-future business adoption of hybrid quantum-classical solutions for AGV scheduling, anticipating that forthcoming improvements in manufacturing efficiency will increase both the number of AGVs deployed and the premium on factory space.</description>

      <title>ActSonic: Recognizing Everyday Activities from Inaudible Acoustic Waves Around the Body</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present ActSonic, an intelligent, low-power active acoustic sensing system integrated into eyeglasses that can recognize 27 different everyday activities (e.g., eating, drinking, toothbrushing) from inaudible acoustic waves around the body with a time resolution of one second. It only needs a pair of miniature speakers and microphones mounted on each hinge of eyeglasses to emit ultrasonic waves to create an acoustic aura around the body. Based on the position and motion of various body parts, the acoustic signals are reflected with unique patterns captured by the microphone and analyzed by a customized self-supervised deep learning framework to infer the performed activities. ActSonic was deployed in a user study with 19 participants across 19 households to evaluate its efficacy. Without requiring any training data from a new user (leave-one-participant-out evaluation), ActSonic was able to detect 27 activities, achieving an average F1-score of 86.6% in fully unconstrained scenarios and 93.4% in prompted settings at participants' homes.</description>
