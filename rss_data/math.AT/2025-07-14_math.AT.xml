      <title>Branching space of multipointed d-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the notion of short directed path, we introduce the branching space of a multipointed $d$-space. We prove that for any q-cofibrant multipointed $d$-space, it is homeomorphic to the branching space of the q-cofibrant flow obtained by applying the categorization functor. As an application, we deduce a purely topological proof of the invariance of the branching space and of the branching homology of cellular multipointed $d$-spaces up to globular subdivision. By reversing the time direction, the same results are obtained for the merging space and the merging homology.</description>

      <title>Bousfield-Kan completion as a codensity $\infty$-monad</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a theory of codensity monads associated with full subcategories in the setting of $\infty$-categories. For an $\infty$-monad $\mathcal{M}$ on an $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}$ that admits homotopy totalizations, we consider the $\mathcal{M}$-completion functor defined as the homotopy totalization of the canonical cosimplicial functor associated with $\mathcal{M}$. We prove that the $\mathcal{M}$-completion is the codensity $\infty$-monad of a full subcategory $\mathcal{A}(\mathcal{M})\subseteq \mathcal{C}$ spanned by objects that admit a structure of $\mathcal{M}$-algebra. This implies that the $\mathcal{M}$-completion is the terminal object in the $\infty$-category of $\infty$-monads preserving all objects of $\mathcal{A}(\mathcal{M})$. As an application, we prove that the classical Bousfield-Kan $R$-completion functor is the codensity $\infty$-monad of the full $\infty$-subcategory in the $\infty$-category of spaces $\mathcal{K}(R) \subseteq \mathsf{Spc}$ spanned by the empty space and the products of Eilenberg-MacLane spaces of $R$-modules. As a corollary, we obtain two universal properties of the Bousfield-Kan $R$-completion: it is the terminal $\mathcal{K}(R)$-preserving coaugmented functor, and the terminal $\mathcal{K}(R)$-preserving $\infty$-monad.</description>

      <title>Topological Sequence Analysis of Genomes: Category Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sequence data, such as DNA, RNA, and protein sequences, exhibit intricate, multi-scale structures that pose significant challenges for conventional analysis methods, particularly those relying on alignment or purely statistical representations. In this work, we introduce category-based topological sequence analysis (CTSA ) of genomes. CTSA models a sequence as a resolution category, capturing its hierarchical structure through a categorical construction. Substructure complexes are then derived from this categorical representation, and their persistent homology is computed to extract multi-scale topological features. Our models depart from traditional alignment-free approaches by incorporating structured mathematical formalisms rooted in sequence topology. The resulting topological signatures provide informative representations across a variety of tasks, including the phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 variants and the prediction of protein-nucleic acid binding affinities. Comparative studies were carried out against six state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results demonstrate that CTSA achieves excellent and consistent performance in these tasks, suggesting its general applicability and robustness. Beyond sequence analysis, the proposed framework opens new directions for the integration of categorical and homological theories for biological sequence analysis.</description>

      <title>Free phases of Majorana fermions: Tenfold ways compared</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a mathematically rigorous classification of symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases of neutral free fermions. Our approach utilizes Karoubi triples with negative squares, thought of as polarizations. We prove that neutral free fermion SPT phases protected by a symmetry algebra $A$ are classified by the real $K$-theory group $K_2(A^{op})$, and demonstrate how our classification reproduces known results in the presence of charge. Our formalism also allows for symmetries described by groups, potentially with time-reversal, using the formalism of fermionic groups and their fermionic group $C^*$-algebras. Our classification extends to positive spatial dimensions and includes weak phases using the crystalline equivalence principle. Our approach clarifies and unifies various existing tenfold way classifications by establishing their equivalence through Morita equivalences of symmetry algebras. We expect our classification to be the natural domain for the free-to-interacting map proposed by Freed and Hopkins.</description>

      <title>Topological feature selection for time series data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use tools from applied topology for feature selection on time series data. Given a multivariate time series, we employ persistent homology to assign weights to individual components and construct weighted embeddings whose topological features are optimized according to a chosen objective. We show that, along affine paths in the space of weights, the persistence diagram evolves piecewise linearly. This enables explicit and efficient computation of directional derivatives and gradient-based optimization. We prove that for objective functions on persistence diagrams that are Lipschitz with respect to a $p$-Wasserstein distance, the evaluation of the function along a gradient-descent path is Lipschitz. We apply our method to synthetic and biological data sets and demonstrate that our approach selects informative combinations of variables that recover the coordinated dynamics.</description>

      <title>Bisections of mass assignments by parallel hyperplanes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a result on the bisection of mass assignments by parallel hyperplanes on Euclidean vector bundles. Our methods consist of the development of a novel lifting method to define the configuration space--test map scheme, which transforms the problem to a Borsuk--Ulam-type question on equivariant fiber bundles, along with a new computation of the parametrized Fadell--Husseini index. As the primary application, we show that any $d+k+m-1$ mass assignments to linear $d$-spaces in $\mathbb{R}^{d+m}$ can be bisected by $k$ parallel hyperplanes in at least one $d$-space, provided that the Stirling number of the second kind $S(d+k+m-1, k)$ is odd. This generalizes all known cases of a conjecture by Sober\'on and Takahashi, which asserts that any $d+k-1$ measures in $\mathbb{R}^d$ can be bisected by $k$ parallel hyperplanes.</description>

      <title>Higher Koszul duality and $n$-affineness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study $\mathbb{E}_n$-Koszul duality for pairs of algebras of the form $\mathrm{C}_{\bullet}(\Omega^{n}_*X;\Bbbk) \leftrightarrow \mathrm{C}^{\bullet}(X;\Bbbk)$, and the closely related question of $n$-affineness for Betti stacks. It was expected, but not known, that $\mathbb{E}_n$-Koszul duality should induce a kind of Morita equivalence between categories of iterated modules. We establish this rigorously by proving that the $(\infty,n)$-category of iterated modules over $\mathrm{C}_{\bullet}(\Omega_*^{n+1}X;\Bbbk)$ is equivalent to the $(\infty,n)$-category of quasi-coherent sheaves of $(\infty,n-1)$-categories on $\mathrm{cSpec}(\mathrm{C}^{\bullet}(X;\Bbbk))$, where $\mathrm{cSpec}(\mathrm{C}^{\bullet}(X;\Bbbk))$ is the cospectrum of $\mathrm{C}^{\bullet}(X;\Bbbk)$. By the monodromy equivalence, these categories are also equivalent to the category of higher local systems on $X$, $n\mathbf{LocSysCat}^{n-1}(X;\Bbbk)$. Our result is new already in the classical case $n=1$, although it can be seen to recover well known formulations of $\mathbb{E}_1$-Koszul duality as a Morita equivalence of module categories (up to appropriate completions of the $t$-structures). We also investigate (higher) affineness properties of Betti stacks. We give a complete characterization of $n$-affine Betti stacks, in terms of the $0$-affineness of their iterated loop space. As a consequence, we prove that $n$-truncated Betti stacks are $n$-affine; and that $\pi_{n+1}(X)$ is an obstruction to $n$-affineness.</description>
