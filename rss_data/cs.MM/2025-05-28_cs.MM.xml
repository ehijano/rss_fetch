      <title>Towards Structure-aware Model for Multi-modal Knowledge Graph Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) play a key role in promoting various multimedia and AI applications. However, with the explosive growth of multi-modal information, traditional knowledge graph completion (KGC) models cannot be directly applied. This has attracted a large number of researchers to study multi-modal knowledge graph completion (MMKGC). Since MMKG extends KG to the visual and textual domains, MMKGC faces two main challenges: (1) how to deal with the fine-grained modality information interaction and awareness; (2) how to ensure the dominant role of graph structure in multi-modal knowledge fusion and deal with the noise generated by other modalities during modality fusion. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel MMKGC model named TSAM, which integrates fine-grained modality interaction and dominant graph structure to form a high-performance MMKGC framework. Specifically, to solve the challenges, TSAM proposes the Fine-grained Modality Awareness Fusion method (FgMAF), which uses pre-trained language models to better capture fine-grained semantic information interaction of different modalities and employs an attention mechanism to achieve fine-grained modality awareness and fusion. Additionally, TSAM presents the Structure-aware Contrastive Learning method (SaCL), which utilizes two contrastive learning approaches to align other modalities more closely with the structured modality. Extensive experiments show that the proposed TSAM model significantly outperforms existing MMKGC models on widely used multi-modal datasets.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Audiovisual Mismatch in Visual-Guide Audio Captioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current vision-guided audio captioning systems frequently fail to address audiovisual misalignment in real-world scenarios, such as dubbed content or off-screen sounds. To bridge this critical gap, we present an entropy-aware gated fusion framework that dynamically modulates visual information flow through cross-modal uncertainty quantification. Our novel approach employs attention entropy analysis in cross-attention layers to automatically identify and suppress misleading visual cues during modal fusion. Complementing this architecture, we develop a batch-wise audiovisual shuffling technique that generates synthetic mismatched training pairs, greatly enhancing model resilience against alignment noise. Evaluations on the AudioCaps benchmark demonstrate our system's superior performance over existing baselines, especially in mismatched modality scenarios. Furthermore, our solution demonstrates an approximately 6x improvement in inference speed compared to the baseline.</description>

      <title>Reference-Guided Identity Preserving Face Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Preserving face identity is a critical yet persistent challenge in diffusion-based image restoration. While reference faces offer a path forward, existing reference-based methods often fail to fully exploit their potential. This paper introduces a novel approach that maximizes reference face utility for improved face restoration and identity preservation. Our method makes three key contributions: 1) Composite Context, a comprehensive representation that fuses multi-level (high- and low-level) information from the reference face, offering richer guidance than prior singular representations. 2) Hard Example Identity Loss, a novel loss function that leverages the reference face to address the identity learning inefficiencies found in the existing identity loss. 3) A training-free method to adapt the model to multi-reference inputs during inference. The proposed method demonstrably restores high-quality faces and achieves state-of-the-art identity preserving restoration on benchmarks such as FFHQ-Ref and CelebA-Ref-Test, consistently outperforming previous work.</description>

      <title>MapStory: LLM-Powered Text-Driven Map Animation Prototyping with Human-in-the-Loop Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce MapStory, an LLM-powered animation authoring tool that generates editable map animation sequences directly from natural language text. Given a user-written script, MapStory leverages an agentic architecture to automatically produce a scene breakdown, which decomposes the script into key animation building blocks such as camera movements, visual highlights, and animated elements. Our system includes a researcher component that accurately queries geospatial information by leveraging an LLM with web search, enabling the automatic extraction of relevant regions, paths, and coordinates while allowing users to edit and query for changes or additional information to refine the results. Additionally, users can fine-tune parameters of these blocks through an interactive timeline editor. We detail the system's design and architecture, informed by formative interviews with professional animators and an analysis of 200 existing map animation videos. Our evaluation, which includes expert interviews (N=5) and a usability study (N=12), demonstrates that MapStory enables users to create map animations with ease, facilitates faster iteration, encourages creative exploration, and lowers barriers to creating map-centric stories.</description>

      <title>AudioGenie: A Training-Free Multi-Agent Framework for Diverse Multimodality-to-Multiaudio Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodality-to-Multiaudio (MM2MA) generation faces significant challenges in synthesizing diverse and contextually aligned audio types (e.g., sound effects, speech, music, and songs) from multimodal inputs (e.g., video, text, images), owing to the scarcity of high-quality paired datasets and the lack of robust multi-task learning frameworks. Recently, multi-agent system shows great potential in tackling the above issues. However, directly applying it to MM2MA task presents three critical challenges: (1) inadequate fine-grained understanding of multimodal inputs (especially for video), (2) the inability of single models to handle diverse audio events, and (3) the absence of self-correction mechanisms for reliable outputs. To this end, we propose AudioGenie, a novel training-free multi-agent system featuring a dual-layer architecture with a generation team and a supervisor team. For the generation team, a fine-grained task decomposition and an adaptive Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) collaborative entity are designed for dynamic model selection, and a trial-and-error iterative refinement module is designed for self-correction. The supervisor team ensures temporal-spatial consistency and verifies outputs through feedback loops. Moreover, we build MA-Bench, the first benchmark for MM2MA tasks, comprising 198 annotated videos with multi-type audios. Experiments demonstrate that our AudioGenie outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across 9 metrics in 8 tasks. User study further validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of quality, accuracy, alignment, and aesthetic.

      <title>FGS-Audio: Fixed-Decoder Framework for Audio Steganography with Adversarial Perturbation Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) has made high-fidelity generated audio widely available across the Internet, offering an abundant and versatile source of cover signals for covert communication. Driven by advances in deep learning, current audio steganography frameworks are mainly based on encoding-decoding network architectures. While these methods greatly improve the security of audio steganography, they typically employ elaborate training workflows and rely on extensive pre-trained models. To address the aforementioned issues, this paper pioneers a Fixed-Decoder Framework for Audio Steganography with Adversarial Perturbation Generation (FGS-Audio). The adversarial perturbations that carry secret information are embedded into cover audio to generate stego audio. The receiver only needs to share the structure and weights of the fixed decoding network to accurately extract the secret information from the stego audio, thus eliminating the reliance on large pre-trained models. In FGS-Audio, we propose an audio Adversarial Perturbation Generation (APG) strategy and design a lightweight fixed decoder. The fixed decoder guarantees reliable extraction of the hidden message, while the adversarial perturbations are optimized to keep the stego audio perceptually and statistically close to the cover audio, thereby improving resistance to steganalysis. The experimental results show that the method exhibits excellent anti-steganalysis performance under different relative payloads, outperforming existing SOTA approaches. In terms of stego audio quality, FGS-Audio achieves an average PSNR improvement of over 10 dB compared to SOTA method.</description>

      <title>Multi-MLLM Knowledge Distillation for Out-of-Context News Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal out-of-context news is a type of misinformation in which the image is used outside of its original context. Many existing works have leveraged multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for detecting out-of-context news. However, observing the limited zero-shot performance of smaller MLLMs, they generally require label-rich fine-tuning and/or expensive API calls to GPT models to improve the performance, which is impractical in low-resource scenarios. In contrast, we aim to improve the performance of small MLLMs in a more label-efficient and cost-effective manner. To this end, we first prompt multiple teacher MLLMs to generate both label predictions and corresponding rationales, which collectively serve as the teachers' knowledge. We then introduce a two-stage knowledge distillation framework to transfer this knowledge to a student MLLM. In Stage 1, we apply LoRA fine-tuning to the student model using all training data. In Stage 2, we further fine-tune the student model using both LoRA fine-tuning and DPO on the data points where teachers' predictions conflict. This two-stage strategy reduces annotation costs and helps the student model uncover subtle patterns in more challenging cases. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance using less than 10% labeled data.</description>

      <title>Spatial Knowledge Graph-Guided Multimodal Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have significantly enhanced their capabilities; however, their spatial perception abilities remain a notable limitation. To address this challenge, multimodal data synthesis offers a promising solution. Yet, ensuring that synthesized data adhere to spatial common sense is a non-trivial task. In this work, we introduce SKG2Data, a novel multimodal synthesis approach guided by spatial knowledge graphs, grounded in the concept of knowledge-to-data generation. SKG2Data automatically constructs a Spatial Knowledge Graph (SKG) to emulate human-like perception of spatial directions and distances, which is subsequently utilized to guide multimodal data synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that data synthesized from diverse types of spatial knowledge, including direction and distance, not only enhance the spatial perception and reasoning abilities of MLLMs but also exhibit strong generalization capabilities. We hope that the idea of knowledge-based data synthesis can advance the development of spatial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Hearing from Silence: Reasoning Audio Descriptions from Silent Videos via Vision-Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13062v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humans can intuitively infer sounds from silent videos, but whether multimodal large language models can perform modal-mismatch reasoning without accessing target modalities remains relatively unexplored. Current text-assisted-video-to-audio (VT2A) methods excel in video foley tasks but struggle to acquire audio descriptions during inference. We introduce the task of Reasoning Audio Descriptions from Silent Videos (SVAD) to address this challenge and investigate vision-language models' (VLMs) capabilities on this task. To further enhance the VLMs' reasoning capacity for the SVAD task, we construct a CoT-AudioCaps dataset and propose a Chain-of-Thought-based supervised fine-tuning strategy. Experiments on SVAD and subsequent VT2A tasks demonstrate our method's effectiveness in two key aspects: significantly improving VLMs' modal-mismatch reasoning for SVAD and effectively addressing the challenge of acquiring audio descriptions during VT2A inference.</description>
