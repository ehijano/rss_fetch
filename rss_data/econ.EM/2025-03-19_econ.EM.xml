      <title>Heterogeneous Treatment Effects in Regression Discontinuity Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Empirical studies using Regression Discontinuity (RD) designs often explore heterogeneous treatment effects based on pretreatment covariates. However, the lack of formal statistical methods has led to the widespread use of ad hoc approaches in applications. Motivated by common empirical practice, we develop a unified, theoretically grounded framework for RD heterogeneity analysis. We show that a fully interacted local linear (in functional parameters) model effectively captures heterogeneity while still being tractable and interpretable in applications. The model structure holds without loss of generality for discrete covariates, while for continuous covariates our proposed (local functional linear-in-parameters) model can be potentially restrictive, but it nonetheless naturally matches standard empirical practice and offers a causal interpretation for RD applications. We establish principled bandwidth selection and robust bias-corrected inference methods to analyze heterogeneous treatment effects and test group differences. We provide companion software to facilitate implementation of our results. An empirical application illustrates the practical relevance of our methods.</description>

      <title>How does Bike Absence Influence Mode Shifts Among Dockless Bike-Sharing Users? Evidence From Nanjing, China</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dockless bike-sharing (DBS) users often encounter difficulties in finding available bikes at their preferred times and locations. This study examines the determinants of the users' mode shifts in the context of bike absence, using survey data from Nanjing, China. An integrated choice and latent variable based on multinomial logit was employed to investigate the impact of socio-demographic, trip characteristics, and psychological factors on travel mode choices. Mode choice models were estimated with seven mode alternatives, including bike-sharing related choices (waiting in place, picking up bikes on the way, and picking up bikes on a detour), bus, taxi, riding hailing, and walk. The findings show that under shared-bike unavailability, users prefer to pick up bikes on the way rather than take detours, with buses and walking as favored alternatives to shared bikes. Lower-educated users tend to wait in place, showing greater concern for waiting time compared to riding time. Lower-income users, commuters, and females prefer picking up bikes on the way, while non-commuters and males opt for detours. The insights gained in this study can provide ideas for solving the problems of demand estimation, parking area siting, and multi-modal synergies of bike sharing to enhance utilization and user satisfaction.</description>

      <title>Bounds for within-household encouragement designs with interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain partial identification of direct and spillover effects in settings with strategic interaction and discrete treatments, outcome and independent instruments. We consider a framework with two decision-makers who play pure-strategy Nash equilibria in treatment take-up, whose outcomes are determined by their joint take-up decisions. We obtain a latent-type representation at the pair level. We enumerate all types that are consistent with pure-strategy Nash equilibria and exclusion restrictions, and then impose conditions such as symmetry, strategic complementarity/substitution, several notions of monotonicity, and homogeneity. Under any combination of the above restrictions, we provide sharp bounds for our parameters of interest via a simple Python optimization routine. Our framework allows the empirical researcher to tailor the above menu of assumptions to their empirical application and to assess their individual and joint identifying power.</description>

      <title>Minnesota BART</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vector autoregression (VAR) models are widely used for forecasting and macroeconomic analysis, yet they remain limited by their reliance on a linear parameterization. Recent research has introduced nonparametric alternatives, such as Bayesian additive regression trees (BART), which provide flexibility without strong parametric assumptions. However, existing BART-based frameworks do not account for time dependency or allow for sparse estimation in the construction of regression tree priors, leading to noisy and inefficient high-dimensional representations. This paper introduces a sparsity-inducing Dirichlet hyperprior on the regression tree's splitting probabilities, allowing for automatic variable selection and high-dimensional VARs. Additionally, we propose a structured shrinkage prior that decreases the probability of splitting on higher-order lags, aligning with the Minnesota prior's principles. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach improves predictive accuracy over the baseline BART prior and Bayesian VAR (BVAR), particularly in capturing time-dependent relationships and enhancing density forecasts. These findings highlight the potential of developing domain-specific nonparametric methods in macroeconomic forecasting.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric estimation of conditional densities by generalized random forests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13251v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Considering a continuous random variable Y together with a continuous random vector X, I propose a nonparametric estimator f^(.|x) for the conditional density of Y given X=x. This estimator takes the form of an exponential series whose coefficients Tx = (Tx1,...,TxJ) are the solution of a system of nonlinear equations that depends on an estimator of the conditional expectation E[p(Y)|X=x], where p is a J-dimensional vector of basis functions. The distinguishing feature of the proposed estimator is that E[p(Y)|X=x] is estimated by generalized random forest (Athey, Tibshirani, and Wager, Annals of Statistics, 2019), targeting the heterogeneity of Tx across x. I show that f^(.|x) is uniformly consistent and asymptotically normal, allowing J to grow to infinity. I also provide a standard error formula to construct asymptotically valid confidence intervals. Results from Monte Carlo experiments are provided.</description>

      <title>Inference on Multiple Winners with Applications to Microcredit and Economic Mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While policymakers and researchers are often concerned with conducting inference based on a data-dependent selection, a strictly larger class of inference problems arises when considering multiple data-dependent selections, such as when selecting on statistical significance or quantiles. Given this, we study the problem of conducting inference on multiple selections, which we dub the inference on multiple winners problem. In this setting, we encounter both selective and multiple testing problems, making existing approaches either not applicable or too conservative. Instead, we propose a novel, two-step approach to the inference on multiple winners problem, with the first step modeling the selection of winners, and the second step using this model to conduct inference only on the set of likely winners. Our two-step approach reduces over-coverage error by up to 96%. We apply our two-step approach to revisit the winner's curse in the creating moves to opportunity (CMTO) program, and to study external validity issues in the microcredit literature. In the CMTO application, we find that, after correcting for the inference on multiple winners problem, we fail to reject the possibility of null effects in the majority of census tracts selected by the CMTO program. In our microcredit application, we find that heterogeneity in treatment effect estimates remains largely unaffected even after our proposed inference corrections.</description>

      <title>Debiased Nonparametric Regression for Statistical Inference and Distributionally Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20173v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study proposes a debiasing method for smooth nonparametric estimators. While machine learning techniques such as random forests and neural networks have demonstrated strong predictive performance, their theoretical properties remain relatively underexplored. In particular, many modern algorithms lack guarantees of pointwise and uniform risk convergence, as well as asymptotic normality. These properties are essential for statistical inference and robust estimation and have been well-established for classical methods such as Nadaraya-Watson regression. To ensure these properties for various nonparametric regression estimators, we introduce a model-free debiasing method. By incorporating a correction term that estimates the conditional expected residual of the original estimator, or equivalently, its estimation error, into the initial nonparametric regression estimator, we obtain a debiased estimator that satisfies pointwise and uniform risk convergence, along with asymptotic normality, under mild smoothness conditions. These properties facilitate statistical inference and enhance robustness to covariate shift, making the method broadly applicable to a wide range of nonparametric regression problems.</description>
