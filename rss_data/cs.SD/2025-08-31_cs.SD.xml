      <title>WaveLLDM: Design and Development of a Lightweight Latent Diffusion Model for Speech Enhancement and Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-quality audio is essential in a wide range of applications, including online communication, virtual assistants, and the multimedia industry. However, degradation caused by noise, compression, and transmission artifacts remains a major challenge. While diffusion models have proven effective for audio restoration, they typically require significant computational resources and struggle to handle longer missing segments. This study introduces WaveLLDM (Wave Lightweight Latent Diffusion Model), an architecture that integrates an efficient neural audio codec with latent diffusion for audio restoration and denoising. Unlike conventional approaches that operate in the time or spectral domain, WaveLLDM processes audio in a compressed latent space, reducing computational complexity while preserving reconstruction quality. Empirical evaluations on the Voicebank+DEMAND test set demonstrate that WaveLLDM achieves accurate spectral reconstruction with low Log-Spectral Distance (LSD) scores (0.48 to 0.60) and good adaptability to unseen data. However, it still underperforms compared to state-of-the-art methods in terms of perceptual quality and speech clarity, with WB-PESQ scores ranging from 1.62 to 1.71 and STOI scores between 0.76 and 0.78. These limitations are attributed to suboptimal architectural tuning, the absence of fine-tuning, and insufficient training duration. Nevertheless, the flexible architecture that combines a neural audio codec and latent diffusion model provides a strong foundation for future development.</description>

      <title>RARR : Robust Real-World Activity Recognition with Vibration by Scavenging Near-Surface Audio Online</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One in four people dementia live alone, leading family members to take on caregiving roles from a distance. Many researchers have developed remote monitoring solutions to lessen caregiving needs; however, limitations remain including privacy preserving solutions, activity recognition, and model generalizability to new users and environments. Structural vibration sensor systems are unobtrusive solutions that have been proven to accurately monitor human information, such as identification and activity recognition, in controlled settings by sensing surface vibrations generated by activities. However, when deploying in an end user's home, current solutions require a substantial amount of labeled data for accurate activity recognition. Our scalable solution adapts synthesized data from near-surface acoustic audio to pretrain a model and allows fine tuning with very limited data in order to create a robust framework for daily routine tracking.</description>

      <title>Full-Frequency Temporal Patching and Structured Masking for Enhanced Audio Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformers and State-Space Models (SSMs) have advanced audio classification by modeling spectrograms as sequences of patches. However, existing models such as the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) and Audio Mamba (AuM) adopt square patching from computer vision, which disrupts continuous frequency patterns and produces an excessive number of patches, slowing training, and increasing computation. We propose Full-Frequency Temporal Patching (FFTP), a patching strategy that better matches the time-frequency asymmetry of spectrograms by spanning full frequency bands with localized temporal context, preserving harmonic structure, and significantly reducing patch count and computation. We also introduce SpecMask, a patch-aligned spectrogram augmentation that combines full-frequency and localized time-frequency masks under a fixed masking budget, enhancing temporal robustness while preserving spectral continuity. When applied on both AST and AuM, our patching method with SpecMask improves mAP by up to +6.76 on AudioSet-18k and accuracy by up to +8.46 on SpeechCommandsV2, while reducing computation by up to 83.26%, demonstrating both performance and efficiency gains.</description>

      <title>DRASP: A Dual-Resolution Attentive Statistics Pooling Framework for Automatic MOS Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A pooling mechanism is essential for mean opinion score (MOS) prediction, facilitating the transformation of variable-length audio features into a concise fixed-size representation that effectively encodes speech quality. Existing pooling methods typically operate at a singular granularity, concentrating either on a comprehensive global perspective or a detailed frame-level analysis, which may overlook complementary perceptual insights. To address this limitation, we introduce the Dual-Resolution Attentive Statistics Pooling (DRASP) framework. DRASP integrates both coarse-grained, global statistical summaries and fine-grained, attentive analyses of perceptually significant segments. This dual-view architecture empowers our model to formulate a more thorough and robust representation, capturing both the overarching structural context and salient local details concurrently. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and strong generalization ability of the proposed framework. It consistently outperforms various baseline methods across diverse datasets (MusicEval and AES-Natural), MOS prediction backbones (including a CLAP-based model and AudioBox-Aesthetics), and different audio generation systems, achieving a relative improvement of 10.39% in system-level Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (SRCC) over the widely-used average pooling approach.</description>

      <title>Can Layer-wise SSL Features Improve Zero-Shot ASR Performance for Children's Speech?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems often struggle to accurately process children's speech due to its distinct and highly variable acoustic and linguistic characteristics. While recent advancements in self-supervised learning (SSL) models have greatly enhanced the transcription of adult speech, accurately transcribing children's speech remains a significant challenge. This study investigates the effectiveness of layer-wise features extracted from state-of-the-art SSL pre-trained models - specifically, Wav2Vec2, HuBERT, Data2Vec, and WavLM in improving the performance of ASR for children's speech in zero-shot scenarios. A detailed analysis of features extracted from these models was conducted, integrating them into a simplified DNN-based ASR system using the Kaldi toolkit. The analysis identified the most effective layers for enhancing ASR performance on children's speech in a zero-shot scenario, where WSJCAM0 adult speech was used for training and PFSTAR children speech for testing. Experimental results indicated that Layer 22 of the Wav2Vec2 model achieved the lowest Word Error Rate (WER) of 5.15%, representing a 51.64% relative improvement over the direct zero-shot decoding using Wav2Vec2 (WER of 10.65%). Additionally, age group-wise analysis demonstrated consistent performance improvements with increasing age, along with significant gains observed even in younger age groups using the SSL features. Further experiments on the CMU Kids dataset confirmed similar trends, highlighting the generalizability of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot KWS for Children's Speech using Layer-Wise Features from SSL Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerous methods have been proposed to enhance Keyword Spotting (KWS) in adult speech, but children's speech presents unique challenges for KWS systems due to its distinct acoustic and linguistic characteristics. This paper introduces a zero-shot KWS approach that leverages state-of-the-art self-supervised learning (SSL) models, including Wav2Vec2, HuBERT and Data2Vec. Features are extracted layer-wise from these SSL models and used to train a Kaldi-based DNN KWS system. The WSJCAM0 adult speech dataset was used for training, while the PFSTAR children's speech dataset was used for testing, demonstrating the zero-shot capability of our method. Our approach achieved state-of-the-art results across all keyword sets for children's speech. Notably, the Wav2Vec2 model, particularly layer 22, performed the best, delivering an ATWV score of 0.691, a MTWV score of 0.7003 and probability of false alarm and probability of miss of 0.0164 and 0.0547 respectively, for a set of 30 keywords. Furthermore, age-specific performance evaluation confirmed the system's effectiveness across different age groups of children. To assess the system's robustness against noise, additional experiments were conducted using the best-performing layer of the best-performing Wav2Vec2 model. The results demonstrated a significant improvement over traditional MFCC-based baseline, emphasizing the potential of SSL embeddings even in noisy conditions. To further generalize the KWS framework, the experiments were repeated for an additional CMU dataset. Overall the results highlight the significant contribution of SSL features in enhancing Zero-Shot KWS performance for children's speech, effectively addressing the challenges associated with the distinct characteristics of child speakers.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Central Frequencies Locally Competitive Algorithm for Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing, inspired by nervous systems, revolutionizes information processing with its focus on efficiency and low power consumption. Using sparse coding, this paradigm enhances processing efficiency, which is crucial for edge devices with power constraints. The Locally Competitive Algorithm (LCA), adapted for audio with Gammatone and Gammachirp filter banks, provides an efficient sparse coding method for neuromorphic speech processing. Adaptive LCA (ALCA) further refines this method by dynamically adjusting modulation parameters, thereby improving reconstruction quality and sparsity. This paper introduces an enhanced ALCA version, the ALCA Central Frequency (ALCA-CF), which dynamically adapts both modulation parameters and central frequencies, optimizing the speech representation. Evaluations show that this approach improves reconstruction quality and sparsity while significantly reducing the power consumption of speech classification, without compromising classification accuracy, particularly on Intel's Loihi 2 neuromorphic chip.</description>

      <title>Robust Localization of Partially Fake Speech: Metrics and Out-of-Domain Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03468v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Partial audio deepfake localization poses unique challenges and remain underexplored compared to full-utterance spoofing detection. While recent methods report strong in-domain performance, their real-world utility remains unclear. In this analysis, we critically examine the limitations of current evaluation practices, particularly the widespread use of Equal Error Rate (EER), which often obscures generalization and deployment readiness. We propose reframing the localization task as a sequential anomaly detection problem and advocate for the use of threshold-dependent metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, which better reflect real-world behavior. Specifically, we analyze the performance of the open-source Coarse-to-Fine Proposal Refinement Framework (CFPRF), which achieves a 20-ms EER of 7.61% on the in-domain PartialSpoof evaluation set, but 43.25% and 27.59% on the LlamaPartialSpoof and Half-Truth out-of-domain test sets. Interestingly, our reproduced version of the same model performs worse on in-domain data (9.84%) but better on the out-of-domain sets (41.72% and 14.98%, respectively). This highlights the risks of over-optimizing for in-domain EER, which can lead to models that perform poorly in real-world scenarios. It also suggests that while deep learning models can be effective on in-domain data, they generalize poorly to out-of-domain scenarios, failing to detect novel synthetic samples and misclassifying unfamiliar bona fide audio. Finally, we observe that adding more bona fide or fully synthetic utterances to the training data often degrades performance, whereas adding partially fake utterances improves it.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Duration Model for Text Speech Alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Speech-to-text alignment is a critical component of neural text to speech (TTS) models. Autoregressive TTS models typically use an attention mechanism to learn these alignments on-line, while non-autoregressive end to end TTS models rely on durations extracted from external sources. In this paper, we propose a novel duration prediction framework that can give promising phoneme-level duration distribution with given text. In our experiments, the proposed duration model has more precise prediction and adaptation ability to conditions, compared to previous baseline models. Specifically, it makes a considerable improvement on phoneme-level alignment accuracy and makes the performance of zero-shot TTS models more robust to the mismatch between prompt audio and input audio.</description>

      <title>Efficient Sparse Coding with the Adaptive Locally Competitive Algorithm for Speech Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08188v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Researchers are exploring novel computational paradigms such as sparse coding and neuromorphic computing to bridge the efficiency gap between the human brain and conventional computers in complex tasks. A key area of focus is neuromorphic audio processing. While the Locally Competitive Algorithm has emerged as a promising solution for sparse coding, offering potential for real-time and low-power processing on neuromorphic hardware, its applications in neuromorphic speech classification have not been thoroughly studied. The Adaptive Locally Competitive Algorithm builds upon the Locally Competitive Algorithm by dynamically adjusting the modulation parameters of the filter bank to fine-tune the filters' sensitivity. This adaptability enhances lateral inhibition, improving reconstruction quality, sparsity, and convergence time, which is crucial for real-time applications. This paper demonstrates the potential of the Locally Competitive Algorithm and its adaptive variant as robust feature extractors for neuromorphic speech classification. Results show that the Locally Competitive Algorithm achieves better speech classification accuracy at the expense of higher power consumption compared to the LAUSCHER cochlea model used for benchmarking. On the other hand, the Adaptive Locally Competitive Algorithm mitigates this power consumption issue without compromising the accuracy. The dynamic power consumption is reduced to a range of 4 to 13 milliwatts on neuromorphic hardware, three orders of magnitude less than setups using Graphics Processing Units. These findings position the Adaptive Locally Competitive Algorithm as a compelling solution for efficient speech classification systems, promising substantial advancements in balancing speech classification accuracy and power efficiency.</description>

      <title>Spatio-spectral diarization of meetings by combining TDOA-based segmentation and speaker embedding-based clustering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a spatio-spectral, combined model-based and data-driven diarization pipeline consisting of TDOA-based segmentation followed by embedding-based clustering. The proposed system requires neither access to multi-channel training data nor prior knowledge about the number or placement of microphones. It works for both a compact microphone array and distributed microphones, with minor adjustments. Due to its superior handling of overlapping speech during segmentation, the proposed pipeline significantly outperforms the single-channel pyannote approach, both in a scenario with a compact microphone array and in a setup with distributed microphones. Additionally, we show that, unlike fully spatial diarization pipelines, the proposed system can correctly track speakers when they change positions.</description>
