      <title>Singularity reversal of Schwarzschild black holes in Anti-de-Sitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a non-metastable de-Sitter infinitesimal patch as a replacement for the theoretical singularity that occurs during the description of maximally extended Schwarzschild Anti-de Sitter spacetimes. This corresponds to a highly non-perturbative modification of the entangled sector or a dual thermofield double state. We speculate that the de-Sitter core may alter late-time correlators, regulate divergences, and appear as a deformation in the growth of holographic complexity. The description involves a copy of the conformal field theory associated with Israel Junction conditions and an entangled state. We also discuss a version of the possible solution of the Page Curve via. The evaporation of non-metastable space its range of impact in its solution.</description>

      <title>Closed Foldy-Wouthuysen transformations for fermions moving in gauge-invariant time-dependent electromagnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previously, we obtained closed expressions for energy operators in the Foldy-Wouthuysen representation in the presence of static electric fields. In this case, we also established a connection between the Foldy-Wouthuysen representation and the Feynman-Gell-Mann representation. In this work, we generalize these results for the case of fermions moving in time-dependent gauge-invariant electromagnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Non-Perturbative $S$-matrix Renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a renormalization group flow equation for a functional that generates $S$-matrix elements and which captures similarities to the well-known Wetterich and Polchinski equations. While the latter ones respectively involve the effective action and Schwinger functional, which are genuine off-shell objects, the presented flow equation has the advantage of working more directly with observables, i.e. scattering amplitudes. Compared to the Wetterich equation, our flow equation also greatly simplifies the notion of going on-shell, in the sense of satisfying the quantum equations of motion. In addition, unlike the Wetterich equation, it is polynomial and does not require a Hessian inversion. The approach is a promising direction for non-perturbative quantum field theories, allowing one to work more directly with scattering amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Mass-deformed Super Yang-Mills theory on $\mathbb T^4$: sum over twisted sectors, $\mathbf{\theta}$-angle, and CP violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study $SU(N)$ super Yang-Mills theory with a small gaugino mass $m$ and vacuum angle $\theta$ on the four-torus $\mathbb{T}^4$ with 't Hooft twisted boundary conditions. Introducing a detuning parameter $\Delta$, which measures the deviation from an exactly self-dual $\mathbb{T}^4$, and working in the limits $mLN \ll \Lambda LN \ll 1$ and $ \frac{(N-1) m^2 L^2}{4 \pi} \ll \Delta \ll 1$, where $L$ is the torus size and $\Lambda$ the strong-coupling scale, we compute the scalar and pseudo-scalar condensates to leading order in $m^2L^2/\Delta$. The twists generate fractional-charge instantons, and we show that summing over all such contributions is crucial for reproducing the correct physical observables in the decompactified strong-coupling regime. From a Hamiltonian perspective, the sum over twisted sectors, already at small torus size, projects in the $m=0$ limit onto a definite superselection sector of the $\mathbb{R}^4$ theory. In the massless limit, we recover the exact value of the gaugino condensate $|\langle \lambda \lambda \rangle| = 16\pi^2 \Lambda^3$, and demonstrate how a spurious $U(1)$ symmetry eliminates all $CP$-violating effects. Our results are directly testable in lattice simulations, and our method extends naturally to non-supersymmetric gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Genuine multi-entropy, dihedral invariants and Lifshitz theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-invariants are local unitary invariants of state replicas introduced as potential new probes of multipartite entanglement and correlations in quantum many-body systems. In this paper, we investigate two multi-invariants for tripartite pure states, namely multi-entropy and dihedral invariant. We compute the (genuine) multi-entropy for groundstates of Lifshitz theories, and obtain its analytical continuation to noninteger values of R\'enyi index. We show that the genuine multi-entropy can be expressed in terms of mutual information and logarithmic negativity. For general tripartite pure states, we demonstrate that dihedral invariants are directly related to R\'enyi reflected entropies. In particular, we show that the dihedral permutations of replicas are equivalent to the reflected construction, or alternatively to the realignment of density matrices.</description>

      <title>Quantum-group-invariant $D^{(2)}_{n+1}$ models: Bethe ansatz and finite-size spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the quantum integrable spin chain models associated with the Jimbo R-matrix based on the quantum affine algebra $D^{(2)}_{n+1}$, subject to quantum-group-invariant boundary conditions parameterized by two discrete variables $p=0,\dots, n$ and $\varepsilon = 0, 1$. We develop the analytical Bethe ansatz for the previously unexplored case $\varepsilon = 1$ with any $n$, and use it to investigate the effects of different boundary conditions on the finite-size spectrum of the quantum spin chain based on the rank-$2$ algebra $D^{(2)}_3$. Previous work on this model with periodic boundary conditions has shown that it is critical for the range of anisotropy parameters $0&lt;\gamma&lt;\pi/4$, where its scaling limit is described by a non-compact CFT with continuous degrees of freedom related to two copies of the 2D black hole sigma model. The scaling limit of the model with quantum-group-invariant boundary conditions depends on the parameter $\varepsilon$: similarly as in the rank-$1$ $D^{(2)}_2$ chain, we find that the symmetry of the lattice model is spontaneously broken, and the spectrum of conformal weights has both discrete and continuous components, for $\varepsilon=1$. For $p=1$, the latter coincides with that of the $D^{(2)}_2$ chain, which should correspond to a non-compact brane related to one black hole CFT in the presence of boundaries. For $\varepsilon=0$, the spectrum of conformal weights is purely discrete.</description>

      <title>Flat Space Holography via AdS/BCFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a new class of AdS/BCFT setups, where the world-volumes of end-of-the-world branes (EOW branes) are given by flat spaces, to explore flat space holography from an AdS bulk. We show that they provide gravity duals of CFTs in the presence of null boundaries. Our holographic calculations lead to many new predictions on entanglement entropy, correlation functions and partition functions for CFTs with null boundaries. By considering a bulk region between two EOW branes, we present an AdS/BCFT explanation that the flat space gravity is dual to a Carrollian CFT (CCFT), including the swing surface calculation of entanglement entropy.</description>

      <title>Dark Energy and the Symbiosis Between Micro-physics and Cosmology (Naturally)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These lectures aim to highlight the remarkable symbiosis that currently exists between the physics of the very small and the physics of the very large, using the unsolved puzzle of the nature of Dark Energy as a vehicle for so doing. The lectures first summarize what we know observationally about the properties of Dark Energy (and the Dark sector more broadly) and then discuss several approaches to explain them. Along the way this involves determining the types of interactions that would on general grounds be expected to be present in the low-energy limit of fundamental theories involving the many hierarchy of scales we see around us. This includes (but is not limited to) a discussion of technical naturalness (and `t Hooft naturalness) as well as the arguments for their use as a criterion for distinguishing amongst candidate theories. Some recent approaches I find promising are briefly summarized at the end.</description>

      <title>Vacuum currents in elliptic pseudosphere tubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the effects of spatial topology, curvature, and magnetic flux on the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the current density for a charged scalar field in (2+1)-dimensional spacetime. The elliptic pseudosphere is considered as an exactly solvable background geometry. The topological contribution is separated in the Hadamard function for general phases in the periodicity condition along the compact dimension. Two equivalent expressions are provided for the component of the current density in that direction. The corresponding VEV is a periodic function of the magnetic flux with a period equal to the flux quantum. In the flat spacetime limit, we recover the result for a conical space with a general value of the planar angle deficit. Near the origin of the elliptic pseudosphere, the effect of the spatial curvature on the vacuum current density is weak. The same applies for small values of the length of the compact dimension. Using the conformal relations between the elliptic pseudosphere and the (2+1)-dimensional de Sitter spacetime with a planar angle deficit, we determine the current densities for a conformally coupled massless scalar field in the static and hyperbolic vacuum states of locally de Sitter spacetime.</description>

      <title>Dissipation suppression for an Unruh-DeWitt battery with a reflecting boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the framework of open quantum systems, we study the dynamics of an accelerated quantum battery (QB), modeled as an Unruh-DeWitt detector interacting with a real massless scalar quantum field. The QB is driven by an external classical force acting as a charger. A major challenge in this setup is the environment-induced decoherence, which leads to energy dissipation of the QB. Accelerated motion exacerbates this dissipation, manifesting effects analogous to those experienced by a static QB in a thermal bath in free space, consistent with the Unruh effect. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a reflecting boundary in a space, which modifies the vacuum fluctuations of the field and leads to a position-dependent suppression of dissipation for the Unruh-DeWitt QB. Our analysis reveals that as the QB approaches the boundary, the relevant dissipation is significantly reduced. In particular, when the QB is placed extremely close to the boundary, the dissipation is nearly eliminated, as if the QB were a closed system. Furthermore, we identify a characteristic length scale associated with the acceleration of QB. When the distance between the QB and the boundary is much smaller than this scale, the boundary effectively suppresses dissipation, and this suppression effect becomes identical for both an accelerated QB and a static QB in a thermal bath. Conversely, when the distance is beyond this scale, the suppression effect weakens and manifests a significant difference between these two cases. Our findings demonstrate the potential of boundary-induced modifications in vacuum fluctuations to effectively suppress dissipation, offering valuable insights for optimizing QB performance. This work paves the way for the development of high-efficiency quantum energy storage systems in the relativistic framework.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics and Criticality of Noncommutative RN-AdS Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by string theory topics, we investigate the Reissner Nordstrom AdS black holes in noncommutative spacetime with Lorentzian smeared distributions. Concretely, we study certain thermodynamic properties including the criticality behaviors by computing the relevant quantities. For large radius approximations, we first derive the asymptotic expansions of the mass and charge functions appearing in the metric function of such black holes. Then, we approach the thermodynamics in the extended phase space. After the stability discussion, we examine the P V criticality in noncommutative geometry by calculating the corresponding thermodynamic quantities. As a result, we show that the proposed black holes exhibit certain similarities with Van der Waals fluid systems. Finally, we present a discussion on the Joule Thomson expansion showing perfect universality results appearing in charged AdS black holes.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic and observational implications of black holes in toroidal geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic and observational implications for the charged torus-like black holes, a class of solutions distinct from the classical Schwarzschild black holes. We explicitly derive the fundamental thermodynamic properties, such as heat capacity, P-V diagram, isothermal compressibility, Helmholtz free energy, and Gibbs free energy, under different entropy models. We find that only the exponential corrected entropy demonstrates multiple phase transitions, which we validate with the Ricci Scalar divergence obtained from the Ruppeiner formalism. This indicates that exponential corrected entropy is more sensitive to BH's microstructure as compared to the Hawking-Bekenstein and R\`{e}nyi entropy models. In addition, we study the sparsity and emission rates of Hawking radiation, demonstrating that exponential correction entropy yields more consistent and stable behavior. In our observational analysis, we graphically demonstrate the behavior of redshift, blueshift, and gravitational shift, and identify specific conditions where the photon sphere radius exceeds the innermost stable circular orbit radius, which depends on the values of parameters such as electric charge and cosmological constant. The novel insight of this work is that despite this violation, our computed redshift, blueshift, and gravitational shifts fall within the range of the observational data of NGC 4258 and UGC 3789.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of energy lies at the foundation of physical science. In general relativity and quantum field theory, the positivity and conservation of energy are encapsulated by the so-called energy-momentum tensor and the energy conditions. In recent efforts to unify fundamental physics with quantum information, the energy conditions have come to play a crucial role in establishing numerous theorems. In this article, we review the basics of energy conditions in general relativity and their applications in gravitational physics, quantum field theory, and the holographic principle. Through these applications, we explore the profound connection between the energy conditions and quantum information</description>

      <title>High Temperature Scalar Partition Function on General Stationary Backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high temperature equilibrium partition function of a real scalar field nonminimally coupled to the scalar curvature is computed at second order in the derivative expansion on a generic stationary background. Using covariant perturbation theory, the expression of the thermal partition function at second order in powers of curvatures is also obtained, including its nonlocal contributions. For conformal coupling, the Weyl anomaly at fourth order in derivatives and second order in curvatures is evaluated using both expansions and the results found to be consistent.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first-principles quantization of a damped scalar field within the framework of classical action principle of non-conservative systems using doubled dynamical variables. We consider a non-conservative potential term constructed to describe a linear damping of the scalar field for quantization using canonical and path-integral formalisms, and derive the two-point Green's function along with the spectral function, which are consistent with known results from the well-known in-in formalism.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{N}=2$ AdS hypermultiplets in harmonic superspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the harmonic superspace formulation of $\mathcal{N}=2$ hypermultiplet in AdS$_4$ background, starting from the proper realization of $4D, \mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal group $SU(2,2|2)$ on the analytic subspace coordinates. The key observation is that $\mathcal{N}=2$ AdS$_4$ supergroup $OSp(2|4)$ can be embedded as a subgroup in the superconformal group through introducing a constant symmetric matrix $c^{(ij)}$ and identifying the AdS supercharge as $\Psi^i_\alpha = Q^i_\alpha + c^{ik} S_{k\alpha}$, with $Q$ and $S$ being generators of the standard and conformal $4D, {\cal N}=2$ supersymmetries. Respectively, the AdS cosmological constant is given by the square of $c^{(ij)}$, $\Lambda = -6 c^{ij}c_{ij}$. We construct the $OSp(2|4)$ invariant hypermultiplet mass term by adding, to the coordinate AdS transformations, a piece realized as an extra $SO(2)$ rotation of the hypermultiplet superfield. It is analogous to the central charge $x_5$ transformation of flat $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry and turns into the latter in the super Minkowski limit. As another new result, we explicitly construct the superfield Weyl transformation to the $OSp(2|4)$ invariant AdS integration measure over the analytic superspace, which provides, in particular, a basis for unconstrained superfield formulations of the AdS$_4$-deformed $\mathcal{N}=2$ hyper K\"ahler sigma models. We find the proper redefinition of $\theta$ coordinates ensuring the AdS-covariant form of the analytic superfield component expansions.</description>

      <title>On symmetry breaking in the self-dual higher-spin theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the symmetry-broken phase of the self-dual (chiral) sector of higher-spin theory in four dimensions. To that end, we construct a two-parameter vacuum that breaks the AdS symmetry but remains symmetric under the leftover Poincar\'{e} algebra in three dimensions. The vacuum non-zero fields include spin-two AdS frame fields and a scalar, which has a profile that extends along the AdS radial direction. The two free parameters correspond to two scalar branches of conformal dimensions $\Delta=1$ and $\Delta=2$. Focusing on the $\Delta=1$ branch, we analyze the dynamics of free fields around this vacuum and examine its holographic dual. We observe that certain higher spin states decouple in the broken phase. This is illustrated by a set of gauge fluctuations, which acquire no source from higher-spin currents, leading to their complete decoupling, except for the gauge field associated with spin one. The dual higher-spin currents appear to be disentangled from the gauge fields and generally do not conserve; however, their lower-spin components with helicities $s = -1, 0$, and $\pm 1/2$ remain unaffected by the symmetry breaking. Notably, the helicity $s=+1$ current, while deformed, remains conserved.</description>

      <title>Bosonic Bogoliubov transformations as Lorentz boosts in $(c,{\overline c})=(1,1)$ conformal field theories with marginal $J{\overline J }$ deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider conformal field theories with central charges $(c,{\overline c})=(1,1)$ that are invariant under the exchange of the holomorphic and antiholomorphic sectors, in both bosonic and fermionic realizations that are meaningful for condensed matter systems. The effect of marginal current-current $(J,{\overline J})$ perturbations is to induce a deformation of the Hilbert space given by a Lorentz boost in the 2D space of currents, which is identified with a Bogoliubov transformation. The rapidity of the boost is determined by the coupling constant of the marginal perturbation. When the perturbation is diagonal in the original currents of the theory, there is a linear relation between the two, and non-linear otherwise. In the fermionic cases, both free and with Calogero-Sutherland interactions, the marginal perturbation corresponds to backward scattering processes.</description>

      <title>A double copy from twisted (co)homology at genus g</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a family of generalized hypergeometric integrals defined on punctured Riemann surfaces of genus g. These integrals are closely related to g-loop string amplitudes in chiral splitting, where one leaves the loop-momenta, moduli and all but one puncture un-integrated. We study the twisted homology groups associated to these integrals, and determine their intersection numbers. We make use of these homology intersection numbers to write a double-copy formula for the "complex" version of these integrals -- their closed-string analogues. To verify our findings, we develop numerical tools for the evaluation of the integrals in this work. This includes the recently introduced Enriquez kernels -- integration kernels for higher-genus polylogarithms.</description>

      <title>Splitting and gluing in sine-dilaton gravity: matter correlators and the wormhole Hilbert space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sine-dilaton gravity has been proposed as the holographic dual of the double scaled SYK (DSSYK) model. In this work, we examine this duality by deriving general matter correlation functions directly from the bulk perspective. A novel technique we develop is to treat matter lines in the bulk as end-of-the-world (EOW) branes, allowing us to implement a splitting and gluing procedure on the bulk spacetime. This geometric procedure gives rise to the structure of two-sided multi-particle wormhole Hilbert space. In contrast to previous Hilbert space constructions in DSSYK, the length basis in our case factorizes across the subregions, whereas the energy basis acquires a non-local, state-dependent structure determined by the EOW brane quantization in each subregion. Different choices of splitting correspond to distinct representations of the same Hilbert space, all of which are equivalent for physical observables. Based on this framework, we compute general correlation functions, including the OTOC, and show that they exactly reproduce the DSSYK results obtained from chord diagrams. By calculating the OTOC in different representations, we uncover a new identity for the 6j-symbol of the quantum group $\mathcal{U}_q(su(1,1))$. Finally, the resulting wormhole Hilbert space enables us to go beyond the disk to compute matter correlation functions on the double trumpet and to include bulk matter loops.</description>

      <title>Covariant quantization of totally antisymmetric tensor-spinor field in $AdS_d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the quantization of a recently proposed model describing a totally antisymmetric rank-$p$ tensor-spinor field (a fermionic $p$-form theory) in $d$-dimensional anti-de Sitter (AdS) space. The model provides a new nontrivial example of a reducible gauge theory, in which gauge transformations are linearly dependent and the degree of reducibility increases with $p$. It is well known that in such cases the standard Faddeev-Popov-DeWitt prescription for the generating functional is not applicable. We quantize the fermionic $p$-form theory using the general Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) formalism, employing two distinct gauge fermions associated with gauge-fixing functions of different admissible ranks, confirming the independence from the gauge choice. As a result, we obtain the quantum effective action in terms of a sequence of functional determinants corresponding to specific Dirac-like operators on AdS space.</description>

      <title>Classical eikonal in relativistic scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical eikonal is defined to be the generator of all scattering observables in a scattering problem in classical mechanics. It was originally introduced as the log of the quantum S-matrix in the classical limit. But its classical nature calls for a definition and computational methods independent of quantum mechanics. In this paper, we formulate a classical interaction picture which serves as the foundation of the classical eikonal. Our emphasis is on generality. In perturbation theories, both Hamiltonian deformation and symplectic deformation are considered. Particles and fields are treated on a similar footing. The causality prescription of the propagator is essentially the same for non-relativistic and relativistic kinematics. For a probe particle in electromagnetic or gravitational background, we present all order formulas for the perturbative eikonal. In the electromagnetic setting, we also illustrate how the eikonal encodes the information on radiation of external fields.</description>

      <title>Time-like Janus Solution -- holographic global quantum quench --</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a time-like Janus solution, which is mediated by a time-dependent dilaton field in asymptotic AdS spacetime. This solution breaks the null energy condition, but we argue that it is nevertheless useful as a toy model of holographic global quantum quench. The dual CFT is given by conformal perturbation theory, where the primary scalar operator that is dual to the bulk dilaton field is coupled with a global-quench-type time-dependent source. We compute one-point functions of the scalar operator and the stress-energy tensor, and confirm that the results are consistent with the proposed CFT picture. We also evaluate the holographic entanglement entropy for late time after the global quench, and show that the result agrees with the CFT computation. The stability of the time-like Janus solution against a scalar perturbation is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis with Projective Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) provides a sufficient condition for thermalization of isolated quantum systems. While the standard ETH is formulated in the absence of degeneracy, physical systems often possess symmetries that induce degenerate energy eigenstates. In this paper, we investigate ETH in the presence of nontrivial projective representations of Abelian symmetries, which arise naturally from 't Hooft anomalies. We argue that such projective structures can lead to degenerate excited states, and how the ETH can be formulated under such degeneracies. In the presence of projective charges supplied by symmetry operators, our projective-representation ETH indicates that the stationary values of the operators are described by the generalized Gibbs ensemble instead of the standard Gibbs ensemble. Our findings elucidate the role of symmetry and degeneracy in quantum thermalization and pave the way for further exploration of the ETH in anomalous symmetry settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the background charged bosonic free-field approach to the rational principal quantum Drinfeld-Sokolov (QDS) $\mathcal{W} \big[ \widehat{g} \big](p,p')$ minimal models with boundaries, where $g$ is a simple bosonic Lie algebra. We express their Ishibashi states using the free-field Ishibashi states, and calculate disk two-point correlation functions using the free-field vertex operators with intertwiner insertions. The integral results are obtained by repeatedly applying the Euler-type integral expression and the Taylor expansions of Lauricella's hypergeometric functions $F_{D}^{(n)}$. We also discuss the QDS $\mathcal{W} $ algebras related to a semi-simple Lie algebra $g$, and apply a coset free-field resolution to express diagonal ADE coset $\mathcal{W}$ minimal Ishibashi states.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the late-time behavior of the thermal two-point function for a Bose gas in a curved space-time with a Killing horizon. We demonstrate that the late-time behavior undergoes a sharp transition at a critical temperature, reminiscent of a phase transition. Contrary to expectations for typical gases, the relaxation time does not vanish at high temperatures but instead saturates to a constant value that depends on the imaginary part of the lowest quasinormal modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that the holographic thermal propagator in 4 spacetime dimensions can be related to the Nekrasov-Shatashvili limit of the $\Omega$-deformed ${\cal N}=2$ supersymmetric $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills theory with $N_f=4$ hypermultiplets. There are two expansions involved: one is the expansion in small temperature which in the Seiberg-Witten language is equivalent to the semiclassical expansion in inverse powers of the large adjoint vev and the second is the expansion in instanton numbers. Working in the simplified case of zero energy, we find that the latter expansion gives rise to quasi-modular forms which can be resummed as functions of Eisenstein series. The so obtained series in positive powers of small temperature shows clear signs of being asymptotic.</description>

      <title>Canonical Forms as Dual Volumes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study dual volume representations of canonical forms for positive geometries in projective spaces, expressing their rational canonical functions as Laplace transforms of measures supported on the convex dual of the semialgebraic set. When the measure is non-negative, we term the geometry completely monotone, reflecting the property of its canonical function. We identify a class of positive geometries whose canonical functions admit such dual volume representations, characterized by the algebraic boundary cut out by a hyperbolic polynomial, for which the geometry is a hyperbolicity region. In particular, simplex-like minimal spectrahedra are completely monotone, with representing measures related to the Wishart distribution, capturing volumes of spectrahedra or their boundaries. We explicitly compute these measures for positive geometries in the projective plane bounded by lines and conics or by a nodal cubic, revealing periods evaluating to transcendental functions. This dual volume perspective reinterprets positive geometries by replacing logarithmic differential forms with probability measures on the dual, forging new connections to partial differential equations, hyperbolicity, convexity, positivity, algebraic statistics, and convex optimization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum gravity, the gravitational path integral involves a sum over topologies, representing the joining and splitting of multiple universes. To account for topology change, one is led to allow the creation and annihilation of closed and open universes in a framework often called third quantization or universe field theory. We argue that since topology change in gravity is a rare event, its contribution to exponentially late-time physics is universally described by a Poisson process. This universal Poisson process is responsible for the plateau in the multi-boundary generalization of the spectral form factor at late times. In the Fock space of closed baby universes, this universality implies that the statistics of the total number of baby universes is captured by a coherent state. Allowing for the creation of asymptotic open universes calls for a noncommutative generalization of a Poisson process. We propose such an operator algebraic framework, called Poissonization, which takes as input the observable algebra and a (unnormalized) state of a quantum system and outputs a von Neumann algebra of a many-body theory represented on its symmetric Fock space. Physically, Poissonization is a generalization of the coherent state vacua of bipartite quantum systems or matrix quantum mechanics. The multi-boundary correlators of the Marolf-Maxfield toy model of baby universes, and the sum over bordisms of closed-open 2D topological quantum field theory, are entirely captured by Poissonization. In the Jackiew-Teitelboim gravity, the universal Poisson process reproduces the late-time correlators in the $\tau$-scaling limit.</description>

      <title>Bilinear higher-spin currents in the unfolded formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classification of primary non-trivial bilinear currents in the 4d higher-spin theory is obtained. It is interpreted in terms of the known classification of cubic Lagrangian vertices in the 4d higher-spin theory. It is shown that some currents join to the action with the tail of higher-derivative terms (as it happens with the Fradkin-Vasiliev $2-s-s$ vertex). The analysis is based on the $\sigma_-$-cohomology technique of the unfolded formalism.</description>

      <title>The Symplectic Geometry of p-Form Gauge Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate interacting antisymmetric tensor gauge theory in a configuration space consisting of a pair of dual field strengths which has a natural symplectic structure. The field equations are formulated as the intersection of a pair of submanifolds of this infinite-dimensional symplectic configuration space, one of which is a Lagrangian submanifold while the other is either a coisotropic or Lagrangian submanifold, depending on the topology. Chern-Simons interactions give the configuration space an interesting global structure. We consider in detail the example of a six-dimensional theory of a 3-form field strength coupled to Yang-Mills theory via a Chern-Simons interaction. Our approach applies to a broad class of gauge systems.</description>

      <title>Extending the Dynamical Systems Toolkit: Coupled Fields in Multiscalar Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a two-field scalar model consisting of an axion-saxion pair with both kinetic and potential couplings, as motivated by string theory compactifications. We extend the dynamical systems (DS) toolkit by introducing a new set of variables that not only close the system and enable a systematic stability analysis, but also disentangle the role of the kinetic coupling. Within this framework we derive a compact, general expression for the non-geodesicity (turning-rate) parameter evaluated at fixed points, valid for arbitrary couplings. This provides a transparent way of diagnosing non-geodesic dynamics, with direct applications to both dark energy and multifield inflation. We first consider exponential coupling functions to establish analytic control and facilitate comparison with previous literature. In this case, we uncover a pair of genuinely non-geodesic fixed points, which act as attractors within a submanifold of the full system. In contrast, when the axion shift symmetry remains unbroken, our analysis shows that the apparent non-geodesic fixed point reported previously does not persist once the full dynamics are taken into account. Finally, we illustrate how our approach naturally extends to more realistic string-inspired models, such as power-law axion potentials combined with exponential saxion couplings, and present an explicit supergravity realisation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I will describe tree level soft theorems for Chern Simons QED and QCD in 4+1 dimensions. Soft theorems have been studied in various context in the past. Recently, there has been renewed interest in these theorems due to their connection with asymptotic symmetries and gauge invariance. Chern Simons theories are gauge invariant only up to a boundary term. Hence, they make for an interesting case to study the relationship between gauge invariance and soft theorems. The aim of this work is to include corrections due to the addition of Chern-Simons terms in the gauge field action. I will start with an overview of Chern-Simons theories in 4+1 dimensions. Then I will move on to a discussion on soft theorems in gauge invariant QFT at the subleading order using Sen's covariantisation procedure. Finally, I will calculate the correction due to the addition of a Chern-Simons term for both QED and QCD.</description>

      <title>NNLO electron structure functions (PDFs) from SCET</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the electron structure functions, aka parton distribution functions (PDFs), to NNLO in QED. The calculation is based on the definition of the PDFs in terms of operator matrix elements in soft collinear effective theory (SCET) and directly performed in momentum space. The electron PDFs describe the universal effects of collinear initial state radiation (ISR) off the electron (or positron) in DIS or $e^+ e^-$ collision events. The parton collinear to the electron that enters the hard scattering process governed by the energy scale $Q$ can be a photon or a (anti)fermion with mass $m_f \sim m_e \ll Q$. Our SCET momentum-space calculation confirms earlier results obtained from a QED computation in Mellin space and extends them by taking more than one massive fermion flavor into account. The well-known factorization of sufficiently inclusive cross sections into PDFs with massive fermions and hard partonic cross sections with massless fermions at leading order in $m_e/Q$ is discussed from the SCET perspective. Analogies to the nonperturbative PDFs and collinear factorization in QCD are pointed out. Based on this factorization DGLAP-type resummation of large logarithms of the ratio $m_e/Q$ is straightforward.</description>

Abstract: The Eisenhart lift is extended to the dynamics described by action-dependent Lagrangians. The resulting Brinkmann metrics depends on all coordinates. It is shown that the symmetries of the initial dynamics result in the existence of (conformal) Killing vectors of Brinkmann metric. An example is given of equivalent time- and action-dependent descriptions which result in conformally equivalent metrics.</description>

      <title>Big bounce and black bounce in quasi-topological gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the framework of quasi-topological (QT) gravity, we propose a novel model which is characterized by a bounce of the spacetime such that the singularity in standard general relativity can be avoided in both cosmological and black hole setups. Specifically, in the cosmological background, this model reproduces the modified Friedmann equation proposed in loop quantum cosmology, while in a black hole background, it produces a black bounce metric identical to that of the quantum Oppenheimer-Snyder (qOS) model. This model resolves the singularity presented in the qOS model and provides a unified, manifestly covariant framework for general spacetimes, from which both the modified Friedmann equation and the qOS black hole metric can be derived. Furthermore, it establishes a profound correspondence between the effective dynamics of loop quantum cosmology and the QT gravity theory, suggesting that certain quantum gravitational effects in loop quantum gravity can be captured by adding an infinite tower of higher-curvature corrections to the Einstein-Hilbert action.</description>

      <title>The Evolution of Heavy-Ion Physics: A Data-Driven Analysis of Quark Matter Conferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a data-driven analysis of Quark Matter conferences from 2011 to 2025, investigating trends in geographical representation, research emphasis, and methodological strategies. Using a dataset of over 10,000 presentations, the evolution of heavy-ion physics through its premier conference series is examined. The distribution of presentations across countries and institutions shows the global reach of the field while highlighting opportunities for broader international engagement. Research topics show clear temporal trends, with certain physics concepts rising and falling in prominence, and a gradual shift from facility-focused to phenomenon-focused research. The analysis reveals increasing integration between theoretical and experimental approaches over time, reflecting a maturing field where these complementary domains strengthen and enhance each other. These findings provide quantitative insights that the evolution of heavy-ion physics is strengthened by international collaboration at conferences. The analytical methods developed here could help other scientific communities understand their own patterns of knowledge sharing and development.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate heat propagation in rigidly rotating bodies within the theory of general relativity. Using a first-order gradient expansion, we derive a universal partial differential equation governing the temperature evolution. This equation is hyperbolic, causal, and stable, and it naturally accounts for both rotational and gravitational Tolman-Ehrenfest effects. Any other first-order theory consistent with established physics (including the parabolic theories used in neutron star cooling models) must be equivalent to our formulation within an error that is of higher order in gradients. As a case study, we analyze heat transfer in solid cylinders rotating around their symmetry axis, so that the tangential speed approaches the speed of light on the surface. We also compute the relativistic rotational corrections to the cooling law of black bodies.</description>

      <title>Improving the Precision of First-Principles Calculation of Parton Physics from Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Momentum Effective Theory (LaMET) provides a general framework for computing the multi-dimensional partonic structure of the proton from first principles using lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD). In this effective field theory approach, LaMET predicts parton distributions through a power expansion and perturbative matching of a class of Euclidean observables -- quasi-distributions -- evaluated at large proton momenta. Recent advances in lattice renormalization, such as the hybrid scheme with leading-renormalon resummation, together with improved matching kernel that incorporates higher-loop corrections and resummations, have enhanced both the perturbative and power accuracy of LaMET, enabling a reliable quantification of theoretical uncertainties. Moreover, the Coulomb-gauge correlator approach further simplifies lattice analyses and improves the precision of transverse-momentum-dependent structures, particularly in the non-perturbative region. State-of-the-art LaMET calculations have already yielded certain parton observables with significant phenomenological impact. In addition, the recently proposed kinematically enhanced lattice interpolation operators promise access to unprecedented proton momenta with greatly improved signal-to-noise ratios, which will extend the range of LaMET prediction and further suppress the power corrections. The remaining challenges, such as controlling excited-state contamination in lattice matrix elements and extracting gluonic distributions, are expected to benefit from emerging lattice techniques for ground-state isolation and noise reduction. Thus, lattice QCD studies of parton physics have entered an exciting stage of precision control and systematic improvement, which will have a broader impact for nuclear and particle experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hawking-R\'enyi model requires the R\'enyi entropy thermodynamic temperature of a black hole to be identical with the surface gravity defined-, Hawking temperature. We investigate this approach for stationary black hole space-times, and show that a locally Kiselev-type behavior around the horizon with a coupled anisotropic fluid is sufficient to provide a solution to the problem. In addition, due to the rotating motion, an extra shift has also to be present in the effective mass of the black hole, which is determined by the rotation parameter, $a$, and the R\'enyi parameter, $\lambda$. We consider space-times with and without electric charge, and show that the functional form of the solution is the same for both cases. A full thermodynamic analysis of the model falls beyond the scope of this Letter, the main achievements are the derivation and interpretation of the solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the temperature of the McVittie black holes in cavities. The cavities are isothermal boxes that can make the McVittie black holes thermodynamically stable. The McVittie black holes are dynamical black holes, so the traditional action method can hardly be used to calculate the cavity temperature. We find that the cavity temperature $T_c$ can be derived from the McVittie black hole temperature $T_+$ and the Tolman relation. By setting $H^2$ to be $\Lambda/3$, we also get the cavity temperature of de Sitter black holes, which are interestingly the same with the results from the action method, but our method is much more easier.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It was recently proposed that predictions of Lorentz-breaking space-time foam models from string theory may be compatible with the suggestion of light-speed variation from gamma-ray burst studies. Our analysis of foam-modified kinematics shows that despite the subluminal photon velocities explaining photon time delays one may, and in certain circumstances does, keep intact the electromagnetic showers essential for the detection and identification of cosmic photons. In contrast to other~(mostly phenomenological) approaches to Lorentz violations with modified dispersions leading to drastic changes on the formation length for the cascade development in the atmosphere and in detectors, there is the possibility that the dispersion effect in the present string foam model avoids such modifications and the theory naturally escapes the shower formation constraints from recent observations.</description>

      <title>Topology of Fermi seas and geometry of their boundaries for free particles in one and two-dimensional lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Free gases of spinless fermions moving on a geometric background with lattice symmetries are considered. Their Fermi seas and corresponding boundaries may be classified according to their topological properties at zero temperature. This is accomplished by considering the flat orbifolds $R^{d}/\Gamma$, with $\Gamma$ being the crystallographic group of symmetry in $d$-dimensional momentum space. For $d=1$, there are 2 topological classes: a circumference, corresponding to an insulator and an interval, identified as a conductor. For $d=2$, the number of topological classes extends to 17: there are 8 with the topology of a disk identified as conductors and 4 corresponding to a 2-sphere matching insulators, both sets eventually including finite numbers of conical singularities and reflection corners at the boundaries. The rest of the listing includes single cases corresponding to insulators (2-torus, real projective plane, Klein bottle) and conductors (annulus, M\"obius strip). Physical interpretations of the singularities are provided, as well as examples that fit within this listing. Given the topological nature of this classification, its results are expected to be robust against small perturbative interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I summarise recent progress on light-ray focusing and horizon thermodynamics in general diffeomorphism-invariant theories of gravity coupled to bosonic matter. In pure gravity and with scalar or vector fields, the null-null gravitational equation of motion on a linearly perturbed Killing horizon generalises the Raychaudhuri equation, defining a generalised expansion that never increases under the null energy condition. This proves a generalised focusing theorem and defines an increasing horizon entropy (Wall entropy). When higher-spin fields are present, the generalised focusing theorem persists subject to a "higher-spin focusing condition", which I propose as a physical consistency constraint on higher-spin theories.</description>

      <title>Machine learning driven identification of heavy flavor decay leptons in proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of heavy-flavor hadrons is topical in the era of precision measurements, which is useful to test theories based on pQCD. The heavy-flavor hadrons are produced initially during heavy-ion or hadronic collisions and are one of the best probes to understand the initial stages of the collisions as well as the system evolution. In experiments, the heavy-flavor sectors are studied directly via their decay to different hadrons or di-leptons or via their semi-leptonic decay, which is accompanied by additional neutrinos. However, their measurement in experiments is resource-intensive and requires input from different Monte-Carlo event generators. In this study, we provide an independent method based on Machine Learning algorithms to separate such leptons coming from heavy-flavor semi-leptonic decays. We use PYTHIA8 to generate events for this study, which gives a good qualitative and quantitative description of heavy-flavor production in $pp$ collisions. We use the XGBoost model for this study, which is trained with $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13.6$~TeV. We use DCA, pseudorapidity, and transverse momentum as the input to the machine. The ML model provides an accuracy of 98\% for heavy-flavor decay electrons and almost 100\% for heavy-flavor decay muons.</description>

      <title>Stability of Relativistic Spheres Powered by Energy Profile in Einstein Gauss-Bonnet Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the dynamical irregularity of the locally anisotropic spherical fluids in the context of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory. We aim to describe the causes of energy-density irregularity of self-gravitating fluids and explain how those causes evolved from a homogeneous distribution at first. After computing field equations, we formulate two independent components of evolution equations. This expression involves the Weyl tensor and dynamical variables that would lead us to explain the emergence of inhomogeneity patterns. The relevant quantities involved in the irregularities within the initially homogeneous system are analyzed by considering particular non-dissipative and dissipative distribution cases. We find the theoretical irregularity factor consistent with astrophysical observations. With this relation, it is explicitly demonstrated that in the presence of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity terms, the inhomogeneity term decreases its role gradually as the observer moves away from the center towards the boundary surface.</description>

Abstract: We present a purely geometric and exact description of the interior dynamics of a Schwarzschild black hole, formulated without invoking any specific gravitational theory and free of charges beyond its total mass ${\cal M}$. Its dynamical evolution gives rise to new singularities absent in the static case, whose resolution imposes highly restrictive conditions on gravitational collapse.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider spherically symmetric static black hole configurations that obey the vacuum equation of state: $p_{r}=-\rho $, where $p_{r}$ is the radial pressure, $\rho $ being energy density. We find in a closed form the metric for an arbitrary equation of state for tangential pressure $p_{\theta }(\rho )$. The corresponding formulas enable us to embrace compact Schwarzschild-like configurations and dispersed systems. They include metrics with a regular center and singular ones. In a particular case, the metric of the Kiselev black hole is reproduced.</description>

      <title>Big Bang Nucleosynthesis constraints on the cosmological evolution in a Universe with a Weylian Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects that arise from the inclusion of Weylian boundary terms in the Einstein gravitational field equations in the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) framework. With the help of the generalized Friedmann equations for a Universe with a Weylian boundary, obtained for a Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker FLRW metric, three distinct cosmological models can be constructed. The cosmological evolution is determined by a dissipative scalar field, and by the Weyl vector coming from the boundary. Several cosmological scenarios are obtained via the appropriate splitting of the generalized energy conservation equation. In the present work we obtain relevant constraints on these models by using the BBN data. In particular, the effects on the BBN that arise in the post warm-inflationary era will be examined by theoretically evaluating the measured abundances of relic nuclei (Hydrogen, Deuterium, Helium-3, Helium-4, and Lithium-7). We consider firstly the primordial mass fraction estimates, and their deviations due to changes in the freezing temperature, which impose an upper limit on the effective energy density obtained from the modified Friedmann equations. The deviation from the standard energy density of the radiative plasma is therefore constrained by the abundances of the Helium-4 nuclei. Secondly, an upper limit will be considered in a numerical analysis performed through the usage of the \texttt{PRyMordial} software package, with the help of which we calculate the primordial abundances of the light elements by evaluating the thermonuclear rates within the considered modified gravity framework. Finally, an MCMC analysis will validate the cosmological model with Weylian boundary contributions, imposing relevant constraints on the initial conditions of the cosmos. The methodology is implemented in the python code \texttt{genesys}, which is available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>$w$-mode oscillation of neutron star in a new relativistic hybrid model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how the pulsation frequencies of axial gravitational-wave modes ($w$-modes) in a non-rotating neutron star depend on its composition, particularly when including quarkyonic matter and fermionic dark matter. These modes emerge from the coupling between the star's fluid component and the gravitational field of general relativity, which are highly damped and characterized by complex frequencies with comparable real and imaginary parts. Using a relativistic mean field formalism for the nucleonic component, we modeled the neutron star's interior, while the exterior is analyzed through the complex-coordinate method to determine the $w$-modes. Our study employs a realistic equation of state, based on different physical assumptions and covering a broad area of observational constraints, starting from finite nuclei to nuclear matter with extreme conditions. The numerical findings demonstrate that axial $w$-modes provide valuable insights into the properties of neutron star matter, highlighting their significance in probing the star's internal structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The properties of the Melvin-type spacetime with a positive cosmological constant $\Lambda$ in $d$-dimensional Einstein--Maxwell gravity is studied. The solution is parametrised in terms of the `de Sitter radius' $\ell\propto\Lambda^{-1/2}$ and the magnetic field parameter $\beta$, and they are warped products of the form $\mathbb{R}^{1,d-3}\times S^2$, where $\mathbb{R}^{1,d-3}$ is the $(d-2)$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime and $S^2$ is topologically a two-sphere which contains a conical singularity, whose nature depends on the product $\beta\ell$. In the limit $\ell\rightarrow\infty$, the $S^2$ decompactifies and the $d$-dimensional Melvin universe is recovered. The Freund--Rubin-type flux compactification model is shown to be another particular limit of this solution. We also calculate the flux and geodesics in this spacetime.</description>

Abstract: Black Hole (BH) Quasi-Normal Modes (QNMs) and Greybody Factors (GBFs) are key signatures of BH dynamics that are crucial for testing fundamental physics via gravitational waves. Recent studies of the BH pseudospectrum have revealed instabilities in QNMs. Here, we introduce a new perspective using hidden symmetries in the BH dynamics, specifically the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) integrals - an infinite series of conserved quantities. By analyzing modified BH potentials, we find strong evidence that KdV integrals are valuable indicators for detecting instabilities in QNMs and GBFs.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Loschmidt echoes from operator growth in noisy quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of Loschmidt echoes in noisy quantum many-body systems without conservation laws. We first show that the operator Loschmidt echo in noisy unitary dynamics is equivalent to the operator norm of the corresponding dissipative dynamics upon noise averaging. We then analyze this quantity in two complementary ways, revealing universal dynamical behavior. First, we develop a heuristic picture for generic Floquet systems that connects Loschmidt echoes, out-of-time-order correlators, and operator growth, which is valid at any dissipation strength. We assert that the Loschmidt echo has two dynamical regimes depending on the time $t$ and the strength of the noise $p$: Gaussian decay for $pt\ll1$ and exponential decay (with a noise-independent decay rate) for $pt\gg1$. Lastly, we rigorously prove all our results for a solvable chaotic many-body quantum circuit, the dissipative random phase model -- thus providing exact insight into dissipative quantum chaos.</description>

      <title>Reduced fidelities for free fermions out of equilibrium: From dynamical quantum phase transitions to Mpemba effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the out-of-equilibrium dynamics after a quantum quench of the reduced fidelities between the states of a subregion $A$ at different times. Precisely, we consider the fidelity between the time-dependent state of $A$ and its initial value, as well as with the state at infinite time. We denote these fidelities as the reduced Loschmidt echo (RLE) and the final-state fidelity (FSF), respectively. If region $A$ is the full systems, the RLE coincide with the standard Loschmidt echo. We focus on quenches from Gaussian states in several instances of the XY spin chain. In the hydrodynamic limit of long times and large sizes of $A$, with their ratio fixed, the reduced fidelities admit a quasiparticle picture interpretation. Interestingly, for some quenches in the hydrodynamic regime the RLE features a complicated structure with an infinite sequence of nested lightcones, corresponding to quasiparticles with arbitrary large group velocities. This leads to a ''staircase'' of cusp-like singularities in the time-derivative of the fidelity. At the sub-hydrodynamic regime for some quenches the RLE exhibits cusp-like singularities, similar to the so-called dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPT). We conjecture a criterion for the occurrence of the DQPT and for the ''critical'' times at which the singularities occur. Finally, we discuss the hydrodynamic limit of the FSF. In particular, we show that it provides a valuable tool to detect the so-called quantum Mpemba effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first study of how dark matter environments influence nonlinear gravitational memory from intermediate-mass-ratio binaries. Incorporating dark matter effects-gravitational potential, dynamical friction, and accretion-we compute nonlinear memory for both bound and unbound orbits under dark matter minispikes and Navarro-Frenk-White profiles. For quasi-circular orbits within a minispike profile, we further account empirically for the evolution of the dark matter density. Our findings reveal significant deviations from the vacuum case, with important implications for the detectability of gravitational memory by future gravitational wave observatories. These results underscore the role of astrophysical environments in shaping gravitational memory, strengthening its interpretation as a hereditary imprint of past binary evolution and providing a novel bridge between dark matter physics and memory effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum field theory, photon pairs can be excited out of the vacuum under the influence of dynamical gravitational fields. If the classical electromagnetic duality symmetry held at the quantum level, equal numbers of right- vs left-handed modes would be excited. However, a quantum chiral-like anomaly is known to affect this symmetry. In this work, we explore more experimentally accessible manifestations of this anomaly in analogue-gravity systems. Specifically, we describe the physical mechanism by which rotating, accelerating waveguides can induce an imbalance between right- and left-handed photons excited from the vacuum -- effectively signaling the emergence of the electromagnetic duality anomaly in controlled laboratory settings. To build physical intuition, we review first the Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly in 1+1 dimensions, which elegantly illustrates the connection between asymmetric particle pair creation and chiral anomalies.</description>

      <title>A Calogero Model with root string representatives of infinite order Coxeter orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a worked example for the new extensions of the multi-particle Calogero model endowed with infinite Weyl group symmetry of affine and hyperbolic type. Building upon the hyperbolic extension of the $A_3$-Kac-Moody algebra, we construct an explicit realisation of the model in terms of infinite root systems generated from Coxeter orbits. To address the challenge of summing over infinitely many roots, we introduce root string representatives that span the invariant root space while preserving invariance under the affine Weyl group. This approach yields closed-form expressions for the potentials, which by construction are invariant under the full affine Weyl symmetry. Moreover, we demonstrate that in an appropriate infinite-coordinate limit the model reduces smoothly to the conventional four particle $A_3$-Calogero system. Our construction constitutes a systematic method for implementing infinite-dimensional symmetries into Calogero-type models, thus broadening their algebraic and physical applicability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the scale dependence of parton distribution functions is vital for precision physics at hadron colliders. The well-known DGLAP evolution equation relates this scale dependence to the QCD splitting functions, which can be calculated perturbatively in terms of the anomalous dimensions of leading-twist gauge-invariant operators. The computation of the latter in general requires one to take into account contributions of gauge-variant (or alien) operators. In this talk, we discuss the systematic study of these alien operators at arbitrary spin. Specifically, using generalized BRST symmetry relations, we derive the one-loop couplings and Feynman rules of the aliens necessary to perform the operator renormalization up to four loops in QCD. This provides an important step towards the determination of the four-loop splitting functions which will be of significant phenomenological importance at future colliders.</description>

      <title>Boundary Renormalization Group Flow of Entanglement Entropy at a (2+1)-Dimensional Quantum Critical Point</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the second order R\'enyi entanglement entropy at the quantum critical point of spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on a columnar dimerized square lattice. The universal constant $\gamma$ in the area-law scaling $S_{2}(\ell) = \alpha\ell - \gamma$ is found to be sensitive to the entangling surface configurations, with $\gamma_{\text{sp}} &gt; 0$ for strong-bond-cut (special) surfaces and $\gamma_{\text{ord}} &lt; 0$ for weak-bond-cut (ordinary) surfaces, which is attributed to the distinct conformal boundary conditions. Introducing boundary dimerization drives a renormalization group (RG) flow from the special to the ordinary boundary criticality, and the constant $\gamma$ decreases monotonically with increasing dimerization strength, demonstrating irreversible evolution under the boundary RG flow. These results provide strong numerical evidence for a higher-dimensional analog of the $g$-theorem, and suggest $\gamma$ as a characteristic function for boundary RG flow in (2+1)-dimensional conformal field theory.</description>

      <title>Recent developments in semiclassical gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semiclassical gravity (SG) aims to describe the semiclassical regime of quantum gravity. In SG quantum fields curve classical spacetime in an effective way through the expectation value of their stress-energy tensor, while propagating in the spacetime they curve. I discuss some advances in SG in three directions: (i) in understanding structural properties or special solutions of SG in spacetimes with isometries or special Hadamard states (ii) in understanding the initial value formulation and (iii) in black hole evaporation and why information loss is not expected. Semiclassical frameworks beyond SG are briefly surveyed. The hope is that this short note will provide a good set of references and indicate interesting open problems and directions.</description>

      <title>Doppler shifted Hawking radiation from acoustic black holes in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a hydrodynamic flow, with flow becoming supersonic at some point, the subsonic-supersonic boundary behaves as the horizon of a black hole. Possibility of detecting Hawking radiation from such acoustic black holes has been investigated in a variety of laboratory systems, ranging from cold atom systems, to condensed matter systems with hydrodynamic flow of electrons, to relativistic heavy-ion collisions (at relatively lower collision energies). Ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions, with boost-invariant longitudinal flow of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in a wide rapidity window has eluded this remarkable possibility because in this case the black hole horizon is dynamical, moving away from center with sound velocity, leading to infinite red shift of Hawking radiation. We show here that such a conclusion is premature. The QGP flow at very large rapidities, necessarily deviates from Bjroken boost invariant flow. Due to this, an observer close to that region sees black hole horizon with a finite redshift. It leads to non-trivial prediction of Hawking radiation affecting particle momentum distributions for a window of rapidities, leaving near central rapidity regions unaffected.</description>

      <title>Counting gauge-invariant states with matter fields and finite gauge groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gauge theories with finite gauge groups have applications to quantum simulation and quantum gravity. Recently, the exact number of gauge-invariant states was computed for pure gauge theories on arbitrary lattices. In this work, we generalize this counting to include the case of scalar and fermionic matter, as well as various kinds of boundary conditions. As a byproduct, we consider several related questions, such as the implementation of charge conjugation for a generic finite group. These results are relevant for resource estimation and also as a crosscheck when working in a gauge-invariant basis.</description>

      <title>Softening holographic nuclear matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Baryons in the holographic Witten-Sakai-Sugimoto model are described by instanton solutions on the flavor branes. A commonly used approximation for dense baryonic matter replaces the many-instanton solution by a simpler, spatially homogeneous, ansatz, which requires a discontinuity in the holographic direction of the non-abelian gauge field in order to account for topological baryon number. We point out that the simplest configuration with a single jump - often used in previous studies - results in matter at saturation density that is much stiffer than real-world nuclear matter. This is improved, although not completely remedied, by adding a second jump. We present a systematic discussion of all possible configurations up to four jumps, dynamically computing locations of and behavior at the discontinuities. We find solutions that continuously connect to those based on pointlike baryons, thus, for the first time, establishing a concrete link between the instantonic and homogeneous pictures. This is supported by translating the multi-jump profiles of the gauge field into gauge invariant multi-layer charge distributions. The most important of our novel configurations has a block-like structure in the bulk, becomes pointlike at low density and/or large coupling, and is energetically preferred over all previously studied configurations. Therefore, our work lays the ground for improved predictions from holography for dense nuclear matter in neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Polarized tau decay and CP violation in ultraperipheral heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of $\tau$-lepton polarization in ultraperipheral heavy-ion collisions (UPCs) as a novel application of the intense electromagnetic fields generated in such processes. In particular, we analyze the decay distributions of polarized $\tau$-leptons produced via photon-photon fusion, focusing on both leptonic and semi-leptonic channels. We show that the external magnetic field present in UPCs induces a preferred spin quantization axis, which modifies the angular and energy distributions of $\tau$ decay products relative to the standard helicity frame. By formulating the spin polarization along the magnetic field direction, we derive modified polarization-sensitive observables and demonstrate how kinematic selections can retain nonvanishing polarization signals even after ensemble averaging. Furthermore, we propose that the relative polarization of $\tau^-$ and $\tau^+$, accessible through complementary angular ranges of their decay products, serves as a sensitive observable for potential CP-violating effects. This framework provides a pathway for future experimental studies at the LHC and future colliders to exploit polarized $\tau$ decays in UPCs as an application of the strong electromagnetic fields to probe new sources of CP violation.</description>

      <title>The non-minimal 3-form cosmology and the rise of the cuscuton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the 3-form theory with non-minimal coupling to gravity in an expanding Universe. First, we assume that the background is homogeneous and isotropic, and that the three-form is coupled to both the Ricci scalar and the Ricci tensor. We show that in this case, it propagates three degrees of freedom: a scalar mode and two tensor ones. Then, we consider an anisotropic background that corresponds to a Bianchi Type I Universe, and set the coupling with the Ricci tensor to zero. We show that, similarly to the Proca theory with non-minimal coupling to gravity, this case leads to two branches for the background solutions - depending on the values of the 3-form. However, in contrast to the Proca case, we show that no extra modes appear. We explore the no-ghost conditions and speed of propagation for all three modes in both branches. Finally, we show that one of the branches can be written as a theory of a constrained scalar, coupled to a cuscuton field.</description>

Abstract: It is well-known that the trace-free Einstein tensor of a pseudo-Riemannian metric cannot arise by variation of a local diffeomorphism-invariant action functional with the (inverse) metric as field variable. We show that this statement remains true even for general local actions, without the assumption of diffeomorphism invariance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.03307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a six-dimensional gauge theory compactified on a torus with magnetic flux, translational symmetry in the extra dimensions is broken. As a result, a massless Nambu-Goldstone boson appears in the four-dimensional effective Lagrangian. We show that a model with two $U(1)$ gauge symmetries includes a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone scalar boson, whose mass is finite but shielded from large quantum corrections. This opens the door to achieving scalar masses in the TeV range. Additionally, we explore the presence of tachyons in the effective Lagrangian for $SU(2)$ gauge theories. By introducing a scalar field in the adjoint representation of $SU(2)$ with a finite vacuum expectation value, we demonstrate that tachyonic modes can be eliminated for sufficiently large values of the coupling constant, while preserving fermion chirality in the model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.03884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We continue the study in [1] of a strongly coupled (2+1)-dimensional gauge theory subject to an external rotating electric field. The system is modelled holographically as a D3/D5 probe intersection. We add temperature to the D3 background and analyze the phase diagram. Also here, the conductive phase extends down to vanishing external electric field at discrete values of the frequencies where vector meson Floquet condensates form. For all temperatures, at given intercalated frequencies, we find new dual states that we name Floquet suppression points, where the vacuum polarization vanishes even in the presence of an electric field. From the data we infer that these states exist both in the conductive and insulating phases. In the massless limit we find a linear and instantaneous conductivity law, recovering known general results in 2+1 dimensions. We also examine the photovoltaic AC and DC current as the response to an oscillating probe electric field and see that rising the temperature suppresses the photovoltaic Hall current. All the results obtained carry over qualitatively unaltered to the case of D3/D7.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The inflationary paradigm has transformed our understanding of the early universe; yet most inflationary models are considered geodesically past-incomplete, suggesting a beginning of time or a primordial Big Bang singularity. The Borde--Guth--Vilenkin (BGV) theorem is often cited as demonstrating that all eternally inflating spacetimes must be past-incomplete. Utilizing a new theorem establishing geodesic completeness in generalized cosmologies, we present a simple, explicit class of inflationary solutions that are smooth, nonsingular, and geodesically complete for all time, including into the past. These models exhibit localized NEC violation but remain globally well-behaved in both temporal directions. The NEC violation is confined, allowing nonlocal quantum energy conditions such as the ANEC and SNEC to be satisfied. Our results suggest that eternal inflation can arise from controlled NEC-violating dynamics, offering a new, nonsingular, and past-eternal picture of the universe.</description>

      <title>Von Neumann Algebras in Double-Scaled SYK</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09021v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been argued that a finite effective temperature emerges and characterizes the thermal property of double-scaled SYK model in the infinite temperature limit. Meanwhile, in the static patch of de Sitter, the maximally entangled state satisfies a KMS condition at infinite temperature, suggesting the Type II$_1$ nature of the observable algebra gravitationally dressed to the observer. In this work, we analyze the double-scaled algebra generated by chord operators in the double-scaled SYK model and demonstrate that it exhibits features reflecting both perspectives. Specifically, we prove that the algebra is a Type II$_1$ factor, and that the empty state with no chord satisfies the tracial property, in agreement with expectations from earlier work. We further show that this state is cyclic and separating for the double-scaled algebra, based on which we explore its modular structure. We then explore various physical limits of the theory, drawing connections to JT gravity, the Hilbert space of baby universes, and Brownian double-scaled SYK. We also present analytic solutions to the energy spectrum in both the zero- and one-particle sectors of the left/right chord Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>The Schwarzian from gauge theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01540v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The continuum of holographic dual gravitational charges is recovered out of the discrete spectrum of $U(N)$ $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM on $\mathbb{R}\times S^3\,$. In such a limit, the free energy of the free gauge theory is computed up to logarithmic contributions and exponentially suppressed contributions. Assuming the supergravity dual prediction to correctly capture strong-coupling results in field theory, the answer is bound to encode a complete low-temperature expansion of the Gibbons-Hawking gravitational on-shell action, valid well beyond the vicinity of supersymmetric black hole solutions. The formula recovers the long awaited Schwarzian contribution at low enough temperatures for certain choices of flows to the continuum. One such choice identifies the chemical potentials and thermodynamic charges in field theory with the chemical potentials and thermodynamic charges of the dual black holes. For such a flow the computed mass-gap kinematically matches the conjectured strong-coupling result obtained by Boruch, Heydeman, Iliesiu and Turiaci in supergravity, including small $1/\lambda$-corrections. The {emergent} reparameterizations, broken by the selection of the Schwarzian, correspond to redefinitions of the relevant cutoff scale. Observations are made regarding the existence of $\frac{1}{8}$-BPS black holes and how this is in tension with BPS inequalities. The RG-flow procedure leading to these results opens a way to understanding the emergence of chaos in gauge theories and its relation to non-extremal and non-supersymmetric black hole physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new way to perform path integrals in quantum mechanics by using a quantum version of Hamilton-Jacobi theory. In classical mechanics, Hamilton-Jacobi theory is a powerful formalism, however, its utility is not explored in quantum theory beyond approximation schemes. The canonical transformation enables one to set the new Hamiltonian to constant or zero, but keeps the information about solution in Hamilton's characteristic function. To benefit from this in quantum theory, one must work with a formulation in which classical Hamiltonian is used. This uniquely points to phase space path integral. However, the main variable in HJ-formalism is energy, not time. Thus, we are led to consider Fourier transform of path integral, spectral path integral, $\tilde Z(E)$. The evaluation of path integral reduces to determining the quantum Hamilton's characteristic functions (which can be achieved via an asymptotic analysis), and a discrete sum over the quantum period lattice, generalizing Gutzwiller's sum.</description>

Abstract: We review some classic works on ground state entanglement entropy in $(1+1)$-dimensional free scalar field theory. We point out identifications between the methods for the calculation of entanglement entropy and we show how the formalism developed for the discretized theory can be utilized in order to obtain results in the continuous theory. We specify the entanglement spectrum and we calculate the entanglement entropy for the theory defined on an interval of finite length $L$. Finally, we derive the modular Hamiltonian directly, without using the modular flow, via the continuous limit of the expressions obtained in the discretized theory. In a specific coordinate system, the modular Hamiltonian assumes the form of a free field Hamiltonian on the Rindler wedge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The entanglement entropy of a massless scalar field in de Sitter space depends on multiple scales, such as the radius of the entangling surface, the Hubble constant and the UV cutoff. We perform a high-precision numerical calculation using a lattice model in order to determine the dependence on these scales in the Bunch-Davies vacuum. We derive the leading de Sitter corrections to the flat-space entanglement entropy for subhorizon entangling radii. We analyze the structure of the finite-size effects and we show that the contribution to the entanglement entropy of the sector of the theory with vanishing angular momentum depends logarithmically on the size of the overall system, which extends beyond the horizon.</description>

Abstract: In quantum systems, purification can map mixed states into pure states and a non-unitary evolution into a unitary one by enlarging the Hilbert space. We establish a connection between the complexities of mixed quantum states and their purification, proposing new inequalities among these complexities. By examining single qubits, two-qubit Werner states, 8-dimensional Gaussian random unitary ensemble, and infinite-dimensional systems, we demonstrate how these relationships manifest across a broad class of systems. We find that the spread complexity of purification of a vacuum state evolving into a thermal state equals the average number of Rindler particles. This complexity is also shown to adhere to the Lloyd-like bound, indicating a further relation to the quantum speed limit. Finally, using mutual Krylov complexity, we observe subadditivity of the Krylov complexities, which contrasts with known results from holographic volume complexity. We put forward Krylov mutual complexity as a diagnosis of a potential gravity dual of Krylov complexities.</description>

      <title>Scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity: Infrared causality and detectability of GW observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10973v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate time delays of wave scatterings around black hole backgrounds in scalar-tensor effective field theories of gravity. The scalar-Gauss-Bonnet (sGB) couplings, being corrections of the lowest orders, can give rise to hairy black holes. By requiring infrared causality, we impose lower bounds on the cutoff scales of the theories. With these bounds, we further discuss the detectability of sGB gravity in gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers. Compared with the gravitational effective field theories that contain only the two tensor modes, adding extra degrees of freedom, such as adding a scalar, opens up a detectable window in the planned observations.</description>

      <title>$R^2$--Inflation Derived from 4d Strings, the Role of the Dilaton, and Turning the Swampland into a Mirage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on a previously derived superstring model possessing a cosmological sector that mimics Starobinsky inflation, we analyze several questions addressed in the recent literature: the generation of an effective $R^2$-term, the stability of the sgoldstino , the modular symmetry of the inflaton potential and the large distance swampland conjecture. We first show that the presence of the string dilaton stabilizes the sgoldstino direction in the supersymmetric case and no modification of the K\"ahler potential is needed. This is a generic property of a large class of Starobinsky type models within the framework of no-scale supergravity. We then present an explicit example of a string derived inflaton potential where the large values of the inflaton field during inflation imply a decompactification of two extra dimensions, while the scale of inflation is generated by higher order $\alpha'$-corrections via expectation values that cancel the D-term of an anomalous $U(1)$ symmetry and break the modular symmetry of the scalar potential. As a result, the scale of inflation is much lower than the compactification scale which at the end of inflation is fixed at the free-fermionic self-dual point at an (approximate) supersymmetric minimum.</description>

      <title>The 3BF theory as a TQFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the path integral quantization of the topological 3BF theory, whose gauge symmetry is described by a 3-group. This theory is relevant for the quantization of general relativity coupled to Standard Model of elementary particles. We explicitly construct a state sum corresponding to the discretized path integral of a 3BF action. Being a topological invariant of 4-dimensional manifolds with boundary, this state sum gives rise to a topological quantum field theory (TQFT), realized as a functor between the category of cobordisms and the category of Hilbert spaces. After an introduction to appropriate category theory concepts and the construction of the state sum, we provide an explicit proof that it satisfies all Atiyah's axioms, and thus represents a genuine TQFT. The formulation of this TQFT represents a major step in the spinfoam quantization programme for a realistic theory of quantum gravity with matter.</description>

Abstract: This article continues previous work done in arXiv:2406.01907. It is shown in more detail how vacuum partition functions and the cosmological constant vanish at all orders of perturbation theory. Further, all-multiplicity higher-loop amplitudes are given and shown to be modular invariant, to have proper factorization, and to be UV-finite at least up to one-loop level, formally even to all levels. Therefore, the model provides a modular invariant and unitary N=8 supergravity theory in twistor space with embedded Super-Yang-Mills and promising UV-finiteness behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the $O(N)$--symmetric $\phi^6$ theory in three spacetime dimensions using dimensional regularisation and minimal subtraction. The predictions of other methods are scrutinised in a large-$N$ expansion. We show how the tricritical line of fixed point emerges in a strict $N\to\infty$ limit but argue that it is not a physical manifestation. For the first time in this explicit manner, we compute the effective potential at next-to-leading order in the $1/N$-expansion and discuss its stability. The Bardeen-Moshe-Bander phenomenon is also analysed at next-to-leading order, and we demonstrate that it disappears without breaking the scale invariance spontaneously. Our findings indicate that the UV fixed point found by Pisarski persists at large $N$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Starting from a theory on $S^3\times S^3$ and dimensionally reducing, we compute the full partition function, including flux and instanton contributions, for an $\mathcal{N}=1$ theory of vector multiplets and hypermultiplets on five-dimensional toric Sasakian manifolds $Y^{p,q}$. Dimensionally reducing, we obtain the partition function for Pestun-like theories on a class of manifolds whose topology is $S^2\times S^2$. Generalizing the procedure starting from branched covers of $S^3\times S^3$, we reduce to a theory on $Y^{p,q}$ with codimension two twist defects. Exploiting a proposed equivalence with partition functions on spaces with orbifold singularities, our results provide the partition function of an $\mathcal{N}=2$ theory on the product of two spindles.</description>

      <title>Restricting One-Loop radiative effects in quantum gravity: Demonstrating 4D GR as an EFT and its consistent unification with the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09796v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In ``On restricting to one-loop order the radiative effects in quantum gravity" (Brandt, Frenkel, and McKeon, 2020) \cite{Brandt2020}, a Lagrange multiplier (LM) field is introduced into the Einstein-Hilbert action, removing all multi-loop graviton diagrams and confining quantum-gravity corrections to just one loop. The resulting one-loop effective action carries a term proportional to {$\ln(\mu/\Lambda)$}, which they suggest could be experimentally determined, hinting at direct measurements of quantum-gravity effects. We {demonstrate}, however, that {$\mu$ and $\Lambda$} emerge from a chosen renormalization scheme, not from physical observables, implying that {$\ln(\mu/\Lambda)$} signals a finite UV cutoff in this ``LM renormalization scheme.'' Although Newton's constant remains fixed (no running of {$G_N$}), the resulting logarithmic dependence encodes a limited domain of validity for General Relativity (GR) in four dimensions, thereby demonstrating explicitly that 4D GR behaves as an effective field theory (EFT) for energies below the cutoff. {Using the Appelquist-Carazzone decoupling theorem, we prove mathematically that this framework has a well-defined low-energy limit.} We then illustrate how this truncated, renormalized gravity sector can be consistently unified with the Standard Model (SM), yielding a finite and renormalized EFT encompassing both gravity and particle physics up to a scale {$\Lambda_{\text{grav}}$}. Our work represents a breakthrough in theoretical physics with a first successful unification of gravity with the Standard Model through a fully renormalizable and EFT framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the kinetic theory of a weakly interacting quantum field. Assuming a state that is close to homogeneous and stationary, we derive a closed kinetic equation for the rate of change of the occupation numbers, perturbatively in the coupling. For a dilute gas, this reproduces the quantum Boltzmann equation, which only accounts for two-to-two scattering processes. Our expression goes beyond this, with terms accounting for multi-particle scattering processes, which are higher order in the density.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we revisit the exact computation of the round sphere partition function of 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ circular quiver Chern-Simons theories with mass and Fayet-Iliopoulos (FI) deformations. Utilizing the Fermi gas formalism, we derive the large $N$ expansion of the partition function and determine the Airy function structure, parameterized by three functions $C$, $B$ and $A$. We propose a novel closed-form expression for $A$ that incorporates the effects of FI parameters and satisfies various consistency constraints from quiver reductions. As an application, by using an accidental coincidence of the Fermi gas density matrices we extend our results to the squashed sphere partition function of $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theories with an adjoint hypermultiplet and multiple fundamental hypermultiplets. Our findings provide further evidence for the universality of the Airy function structure in supersymmetric gauge theories of multiple M2-branes.</description>

Abstract: We study coupling selection rules of chiral matter fields in heterotic string theory with standard embedding. These selection rules are determined by topological properties of Calabi-Yau threefolds. We classify coupling selection rules on complete intersection Calabi-Yau threefolds for $h^{1,1}\leq 5$. It is found that all of these selection rules for $h^{1,1}\leq 5$ are understood by combinations of only five types of fusion rules.</description>

This realization arises from a specialized factorization of the structure function within the defining relations of the quantum toroidal algebra of $\mathfrak{gl}_1$. Utilizing this free field realization, we further develop intertwining operators for the quantum toroidal algebra of $\mathfrak{gl}_1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20897v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the well-studied genus zero case, bases of $\mathrm{d}\log$ integrands with integer leading singularities define Feynman integrals that automatically satisfy differential equations in canonical form. Such integrand bases can be constructed without input from the differential equations and without explicit involvement of dimensional regularization parameter $\epsilon$. We propose a generalization of this construction to genus one geometry arising from the appearance of elliptic curves. We argue that a particular choice of algebraic one-forms of the second kind that avoids derivatives is crucial. We observe that the corresponding Feynman integrals satisfy a special form of differential equations that has not been previously reported, and that their solutions order by order in $\epsilon$ yield pure functions. We conjecture that our integrand-level construction universally leads to such differential equations.</description>

Abstract: We investigated the Goon-Penco(GP) relationship in (n+1)-dimensional black branes with an arbitrary cosmological constant. Our analysis revealed that the GP relation preserved its form in four-dimensional and (n+1)-dimensional spacetimes, demonstrating its universal behavior with respect to dimensionality. Furthermore, we established that the GP relation exhibits universality across all states of the black hole, including those associated with the event horizon and the cosmological horizon. These findings confirm that the GP relationship remains valid for (n+1)-dimensional black holes and black branes with an arbitrary cosmological constant, independent of the coordinate system employed.</description>

Abstract: It is known that the double-scaled SYK model (DSSYK) reduces to JT gravity with a negative cosmological constant by zooming in on the lower edge $E=-E_0$ of the spectrum. We find that the de Sitter JT gravity (i.e. JT gravity with a positive cosmological constant) is reproduced from DSSYK by taking a scaling limit around the upper edge $E=E_0$ of the spectrum. We also argue that the appearance of de Sitter JT gravity is consistent with the behavior of the classical solution of the sine dilaton gravity.</description>

Abstract: We argue that \emph{perturbatively flat vacua} (PFVs) introduced in \cite{Demirtas:2019sip} are dual to M-theory compactifications on $G_2$-manifolds, enabling the enumeration of novel $G_2$-manifolds via solutions to Diophantine equations in type IIB flux quanta. Independently, we show that warping corrections to the effective action of type IIB flux vacua grow parametrically at large complex structure, and we demonstrate that these corrections can nonetheless be captured by a classical geometric computation in M-theory.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning the 6d Supergravity Landscape</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we apply both supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms to the study of the string landscape and swampland in 6-dimensions. Our data are the (almost) anomaly-free 6-dimensional $\mathcal{N} = (1,0)$ supergravity models, characterised by the Gram matrix of anomaly coefficients. Our work demonstrates the ability of machine learning algorithms to efficiently learn highly complex features of the landscape and swampland. Employing an autoencoder for unsupervised learning, we provide an auto-classification of these models by compressing the Gram matrix data to 2-dimensions. Through compression, similar models cluster together, and we identify prominent features of these clusters. The autoencoder also identifies outlier models which are difficult to reconstruct. One of these outliers proves to be incredibly difficult to combine with other models such that the $\text{tr}R^{4}$ anomaly vanishes, making its presence in the landscape extremely rare. Further, we utilise supervised learning to build two classifiers predicting (1) model consistency under probe string insertion (precision: 0.78, predicting consistency for 214,837 models with reasonable certainty) and (2) inconsistency under anomaly inflow (precision: 0.91, predicting inconsistency for 1,909,359 models). Notably, projecting these predictions onto the autoencoder's 2-dimensional latent layer shows consistent models clustering together, further indicating that the autoencoder has learnt interesting and complex features of the set of models and potentially offers a novel approach to mapping the landscape and swampland of 6-dimensional supergravity theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19412v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Cardy-Rabinovici model is a toy model of the lattice $U(1)$ gauge theories to study various oblique confinement states associated with the nonzero $\theta$ angles. We reformulate the $2$d version of this model using the modified Villain lattice formalism, and we establish the exact $\theta$ periodicity for the Witten effect and the strong-weak duality at the finite lattice spacings. We then study the phase structure of this model based on the duality, symmetry and anomaly, and the perturbative renormalization group.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes and complexity in saddle-dominated SU(N) spin systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study SU($N$) spin systems that mimic the behavior of particles in $N$-dimensional de Sitter space for $N=2,3$. Their Hamiltonians describe a dynamical system with hyperbolic fixed points, leading to emergent quasinormal modes at the quantum level. These manifest as quasiparticle peaks in the density of states. For a particle in 2-dimensional de Sitter, we find both principal and complementary series densities of states from a PT-symmetric version of the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, having two hyperbolic fixed points in the classical phase space. We then study different spectral and dynamical properties of this class of models, including level spacing statistics, two-point functions, squared commutators, spectral form factor, Krylov operator and state complexity. We find that, even though the early-time properties of these quantities are governed by the saddle points -- thereby in some cases mimicking corresponding properties of chaotic systems, a close look at the late-time behavior reveals the integrable nature of the system.</description>

Abstract: Cascading RG flows are characteristic of $\mathcal{N}=1$ gauge theories realized by D3-branes probing singularities in the presence of fractional branes. A celebrated example is the Klebanov-Strassler model, which exhibits an infinite cascade that ends with confinement. In this work, we explore a related setup where the addition of an orientifold plane modifies the cascade structure: the RG flow now consists of a finite number of steps, originating from a UV fixed point with a finite number of degrees of freedom. We provide a supergravity solution dual to this flow, that reproduces all its salient features. The string frame curvature can be kept small up to parametrically large values of the holographic coordinate, larger than the one at which the first cascade step occurs.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Sectors in Chord Space and Relational Holography in the DSSYK</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21447v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In holography, gauging symmetries of the boundary theory leads to important modifications in the bulk. In this work, we study constraints to gauge symmetry sectors in the chord Hilbert space of the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) with matter, and we connect them to different proposals of its bulk dual. These sectors include chord parity symmetry, corresponding to End-Of-The-World (ETW) branes and Euclidean wormholes in sine dilaton gravity; and relative time-translations in a doubled DSSYK model (resulting from a single DSSYK with an infinitely heavy matter chord) used in de Sitter holography. We define and evaluate partition functions and thermal correlation functions of the ETW brane and Euclidean wormhole systems in the boundary theory. We deduce the holographic dictionary by matching geodesic lengths in the bulk with the spread complexity of the parity-gauged DSSYK. The Euclidean wormholes of fixed size are perturbatively stable, and their baby universe Hilbert space is non-trivial only when matter is added. We conclude studying the constraints in the path integral of the doubled DSSYK. We derive the gauge invariant operator algebra of one of the DSSYKs dressed to the other one and discuss its holographic interpretation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that a spatially random Yukawa-type interaction between a Fermi surface and critical bosons can produce linear-in-temperature resistivity, the defining signature of strange metals. In this article, we systematically classify all scalar couplings of the form $(\psi^{\dagger}\psi)^n\phi^m$ in arbitrary dimensions to identify possible candidates for strange-metal behaviour within this disordered framework. We find that only the Yukawa-type interaction in $(2+1)$ dimensions yields linear resistivity. Combined with previous results showing that spatially random QED-type couplings also produce such linearity, we conclude that spatially random Yukawa and QED-type interaction with external vector exhaust the class of random couplings capable of producing linear resistivity.</description>

      <title>Pair production of massive charged vector bosons from the worldline</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a worldline formulation for a massive spin-1 particle interacting with an electromagnetic background. Two first-quantized descriptions of the spin degrees of freedom are considered: one based on bosonic oscillators and the other on fermionic oscillators. Focusing initially on the bosonic model -- which can accommodate particles of arbitrary integer spin -- we review how quantization in the spin-1 sector, performed both via Dirac's method and BRST quantization, reproduces the free Proca field theory. We then introduce coupling to an external electromagnetic field and demonstrate that Maxwell's equations for the background emerge as a consistency condition for the nilpotency of the BRST charge on the spin-1 sector. Encouraged by this result, which proves the viability of the particle model, we proceed to construct a path integral quantization of the worldline action for the charged spin-1 particle on the circle. This yields the one-loop effective Lagrangian for a constant electromagnetic field induced by a massive charged vector boson. As expected, the result reveals a vacuum instability, which we quantify by deriving the pair production rate for the vector bosons, recovering previous results obtained in quantum field theory. For comparison, we repeat the analysis using the standard $\mathcal{N}=2$ spinning particle model, which contains fermionic worldline degrees of freedom, finding identical results. Finally, we comment on possible extensions of the worldline models to include effective interactions and briefly explore their implications for pair production.</description>

Abstract: Higher-point correlation functions encode the data of infinitely many 4-point correlators in conformal field theory (CFT). In this paper, we develop new tools to efficiently extract this data from multi-point crossing equations. Concretely, we generalize the functionals constituting the so-called Polyakov bootstrap of 4-point correlators to the case of 5-point functions in one-dimensional CFTs. We first construct the crossing symmetric Polyakov blocks, and then derive sum-rules by requiring consistency with the operator product expansion (OPE). This procedure leads to two classes of functionals controlling OPE coefficients of double- and triple-twist families. After extensively checking the validity of the associated sum-rules, we apply our functionals to the truncated 5-point bootstrap where we find several advantages with respect to more standard derivative functionals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05808v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a data-driven method for holographic bulk reconstruction that works even when the spacetime is not asymptotically AdS. Given the data of boundary Green functions within a finite frequency window, we iteratively adjust a bulk metric with a finite radial cutoff until its holographic Green functions reproduce the boundary data. Based on the holographic Wilsonian renormalization group for the Klein-Gordon equation in an undetermined curve space, we construct a radial flow equation and transform it into a Neural ODE, which is an infinite-depth neural network for modeling continuous dynamics. Assuming the double-trace coupling $h$ in the Wilsonian action is real, we demonstrate that the Neural ODE can effectively learn the metrics with AdS, Lifshitz, and hyperscaling violated asymptotics. In particular, we apply the algorithm to the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model which slightly deviates from the conformal limit. In the hyperparameter space spanned by the rescaled temperature $\bar{T}$ and the radial cutoff $\epsilon$, we identify a critical curve along which the learned metric is close to AdS$_2$ black hole with finite cutoff. We derive an approximate analytical expression for this curve, from which an effective bulk dual of the SYK coupling $v$ is established. Our work provides a promising way for using machine learning to depict the novel bulk geometry dual to the non-conformal boundary systems in the real world.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computing the Euclidean spacetime action on-shell provides a useful way of both testing holographic proposals and determining the string theory sphere partition function. We consider families of three-dimensional linear dilaton spacetimes for which there are holographic proposals that share features of a $T\overline{T}$-deformed CFT. We extend the holographic renormalization program beyond AdS to this class of geometries by identifying the boundary terms needed for a well-defined variational principle and a finite on-shell action. We show that the spacetime energy or mass determined from the on-shell action matches the $T\overline{T}$-deformed two-dimensional CFT energy. This provides more evidence for the role of the $T\overline{T}$ deformation in this holographic correspondence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, an Operator Product Expansion method has been proposed for renormalization in quantum field theories. This method extracts UV divergences from two-point propagator-type integrals, and it is believed to be applicable to generic QFTs. In the present work, we apply the OPE method to the renormalization of scalar theory with cubic interactions in six-dimensions. We have successfully computed the 5-loop corrections to the anomalous dimensions of the $\phi^Q$ operator, as well as the large $N$ expansion of scaling dimensions at the Wilson-Fisher fixed point to $1/N^5$ order. This computation sets a new loop-order record for the anomalous dimension of the $\phi^Q$ operator in cubic scalar theory, and further demonstrates the efficiency and capacity of the OPE method in renormalization.</description>

Abstract: We consider Einstein gravity minimally coupled to two Maxwell fields and one (real) dilaton scalar. We study the electrically-charged spherically-symmetric and static solutions that are asymptotic to Minkowski spacetime. General solutions are described by four independent parameters: mass $M$, two electric charges $(Q_1,Q_2)$ and the scalar charge $\Sigma$. For black holes, the scalar charge is not independent, but a function of $(M,Q_1,Q_2)$. We provide a set of formulae relating the mass to the charges, which allows us to determine $\Sigma(M,Q_1,Q_2)$ without having to solve the black hole equations. Our results confirm the weaker version of the no-hair theorem conjecture involving one real scalar: it can be turned on in a black hole, but it does not have a continuous independent hairy parameter.</description>

Abstract: I perform a template-based search for stimulated emission of Hawking radiation (or Boltzmann echoes) by combining the gravitational wave data from 47 binary black hole merger events observed by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration. With a Bayesian inference approach, I found no statistically significant evidence for this signal in either of the 3 Gravitational Wave Transient Catalogs GWTC-1, GWTC-2 and GWTC-3. While the data does not provide definitive evidence against the presence of Boltzmann echoes, the Bayesian evidence for most events falls within the range of 0.3-1.6, with the hypothesis of a common (non-vanishing) echo amplitude for all mergers being weakly disfavoured at 2:5 odds. The only exception is GW190521, the most massive and confidently detected event ever observed, which shows a positive evidence of 9.2 for stimulated Hawking radiation. The ''look-elsewhere'' effect for this outlier event is assessed by applying two distinct methods to add simulated signals in real data, before and after the event, giving false (true) positive detection probabilities for higher Bayes factors of $1.5^{+1.2}_{-0.9}\%$, $4.4^{+2.0}_{-2.0} \%$ ($35 \pm 7 \%$, $35 \pm 15 \%$). An optimal combination of posteriors yields an upper limit of $A &lt; 0.4$ (at $90\%$ confidence level) for a universal echo amplitude, whereas $A \sim 1$ was predicted in the canonical model. To ensure the robustness of the results, I have employed an additional method to combine the events hierarchically. This approach involves using a target gaussian distribution and extracting the parameters from multiple uncertain observations, which may be affected by selection biases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11947v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the effects of the time evolution of the matter-gravity coupling on the luminosity distance, showing it can provide a natural explanation to the apparent Hubble tension. The gravitational coupling evolution induces a modification of the Friedman equation with respect to the $\Lambda$CDM model, which we study in both the Einstein and Jordan frame. We consider a phenomenological parametrization of the low redshift variation of the coupling in a narrow redshift shell, showing how it can affect the distance of the anchors used to calibrate supernovae (SNe), while higher redshift background observations are not affected. This effect is purely geometrical, and it is not related to any change of the intrinsic SNe physical properties. The effects of a time varying gravity coupling only manifest on sufficiently long time scales, such as in cosmological observations at different redshifts, and if ignored lead to apparent tensions in the values of cosmological parameters estimated with observations from different epochs of the Universe history.</description>

Abstract: We show that gravitational leptogenesis with dynamical $CPT$ breaking in an expanding universe can be reconciled with the exponential $f(R)$ gravity model, which introduces only one additional parameter $\beta$ compared to the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. This model incorporated axions as cold dark matter. For $L$ violating interactions, we consider both a non-supersymmetric model with heavy right-handed neutrino decay and a supersymmetric model with sneutrino decay. For both cases, we have shown that the required baryonic asymmetry could be obtained. We have also shown the variation of decoupling temperature for lepton number violating interactions with the $\beta$ parameter in exponential $f(R)$ gravity. Lepton number-violating model parameters are constrained with the $\beta$ through the decoupling temperature. An upper bound on the $\beta$ parameter of the exponential $f(R)$ gravity is also obtained.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Quantum Field Theory Simulations on NISQ Devices with Hamiltonian Truncation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computers can efficiently simulate highly entangled quantum systems, offering a solution to challenges facing classical simulation of Quantum Field Theories (QFTs). This paper presents an alternative to traditional methods for simulating the real-time evolution in QFTs by leveraging Hamiltonian Truncation (HT). As a use case, we study the Schwinger model, systematically reducing the complexity of the Hamiltonian via HT while preserving essential physical properties. For the observables studied in this paper, the HT approach converges quickly with the number of qubits, allowing for the interesting physics processes to be captured without needing many qubits. Identifying the truncated free Hamiltonian's eigenbasis with the quantum device's computational basis avoids the need for complicated and costly state preparation routines, reducing the algorithm's overall circuit depth and required coherence time. As a result, the HT approach to simulating QFTs on a quantum device is well suited to Noisy-Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, which have a limited number of qubits and short coherence times. We validate our approach by running simulations on a NISQ device, showcasing strong agreement with theoretical predictions. We highlight the potential of HT for simulating QFTs on quantum hardware.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19267v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a quiver description for Cherkis bow varieties in arbitrary type. We explain how this generalizes the construction of Nakajima quiver varieties. We give criteria for stability, non-emptiness, smoothness and discuss deformations. In the appendix, we discuss the relation between the quiver description and the original Cherkis' construction of bow varieties.</description>

      <title>Causal structure of nonhomogeneous dust collapse in effective loop quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22943v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the causal structure for spherically symmetric dust collapse within a model of effective loop quantum gravity in midisuperspace framework. We develop a general strategy (working beyond the dynamical model of our consideration) for constructing double null coordinates, allowing the extraction of conformal diagrams within single coordinate charts. With the methods introduced, we confirm that the homogeneous Oppenheimer-Snyder collapse scenario resembles the Reissner-Nordstr\"om-like picture. For the nonhomogenous collapse scenario, we construct the conformal diagrams, subsequently, we study its relevant properties, in particular, dust particles' trajectories, apparent horizons and shell-crossing singularities. We conclude that a significant region of spacetime remains inaccessible to the model's dynamics due to the formation of the shell-crossing singularities. The question of whether a timelike singularity, similar to that in the homogeneous dust ball collapse scenario, arises in the nonhomogeneous case remains unresolved. Furthermore, we find that phenomena such as black hole explosions or gravitational shock waves cannot be witnessed by an external observer who does not cross any horizon. Indeed, the collapse cannot take place within single asymptotic region.</description>

      <title>Subsystem Thermalization Hypothesis in Quantum Spin Chains with Conserved Charges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the thermalization hypothesis of pure states in quantum Ising chain with $Z_2$ symmetry, XXZ chain with $U(1)$ symmetry, and XXX chain with $SU(2)$ symmetries. Two kinds of pure states are considered: the energy eigenstates and the typical states evolved unitarily from the random product states for a long enough period. We further group the typical states by their expectation values of the conserved charges and consider the fine-grained thermalization hypothesis. We compare the locally (subsystem) reduced states of typical states/eigenstates with the ones of the corresponding thermal ensemble states. Besides the usual thermal ensembles such as the (micro-)canonical ensemble without conserved charges and the generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE) with all conserved charges included, we also consider the so-called partial-GGEs (p-GGEs), which include only part of the conserved charges in the thermal ensemble. Moreover, in the framework of p-GGE, the Hamiltonian and other conserved charges are on an equal footing. The introduction of p-GGEs extends quantum thermalization to a more general scope. The validity of the subsystem thermalization hypothesis can be quantified by the smallness of the relative entropy of the reduced states obtained from the GGE/p-GGE and the typical states/eigenstates. We examine the validity of the thermalization hypothesis by numerically studying the relative entropy demographics. We show that the thermalization hypothesis holds generically for the small enough subsystems for various p-GGEs. Thus, our framework extends the universality of quantum thermalization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore a square-law k-inflation using the Hamilton-Jacobi approach. Focusing on scenarios where the Hubble parameter exhibits a power-law dependence on the k-field, our analysis encompasses the computations of crucial observables, such as the scalar power spectrum, the tensor-to-scalar ratio, and the scalar spectral index. We further constrain the model's parameters using Planck data and present a specific form of the potential. Our results demonstrate that the model aligns well with observational data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19862v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the traditional moments approach in lattice QCD, based on operator product expansion (OPE), can be realized in a way that utilizes derivatives in momentum rather than in distance. This also avoids power divergent mixings, and thus allows to extract moments order by order, to all orders in principle. Moreover, by exploiting the symmetry of lattice matrix elements,we can determine the even and odd moments separately. As a demonstrative example, we determine the first three moments beyond the tensor charge gT of the isovector quark transversity distribution in the nucleon.</description>

      <title>Creation of Wave Packets for Quantum Chromodynamics on Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the most ambitious goals of quantum simulation of quantum field theory is the description of scattering in real time, which would allow not only for computation of scattering amplitudes, but also for studying the collision process step by step. The initial state of such simulation is made of typically two wave packets of stable particles moving on top of the vacuum, whose preparation is difficult. Here we extend a previous work to create wave packets of a general kind of particle from the vacuum in lattice gauge theories in various dimensions, including three-dimensional QCD for the first time. The conceptual foundation of this approach is the Haag-Ruelle scattering theory, and the only theoretical limitation is given by the presence of massless particles. In the context of digital quantum computation, the wave packet creation from the vacuum is implemented with the technique known as LCU (linear combination of unitaries). The preparation is performed successfully upon measuring an ancillary register with a certain probability, which vanishes polynomially in the lattice spacing, the wave-packet energy and the momentum narrowness.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Scattering Processes with Continuous-Variable Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a framework for simulating the real-time dynamics of quantum field theories (QFTs) using continuous-variable quantum computing (CVQC). Focusing on ($1+1$)-dimensional $\varphi^4$ scalar field theory, the approach employs the Hamiltonian formalism to map the theory onto a spatial lattice, with fields represented as quantum harmonic oscillators. Using measurement-based quantum computing, we implement non-Gaussian operations for CQVC platforms. The study introduces methods for preparing initial states with specific momenta and simulating their evolution under the $\varphi^4$ Hamiltonian. Key quantum objects, such as two-point correlation functions, validate the framework against analytical solutions. Scattering simulations further illustrate how mass and coupling strength influence field dynamics and energy redistribution. Thus, we demonstrate CVQC's scalability for larger lattice systems and its potential for simulating more complex field theories.</description>

      <title>Page Time of Primordial Black Holes in the Standard Model and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04430v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Page time marks the moment when the von Neumann entropy of the emitted Hawking radiation equals the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of an evaporating black hole, which is assumed to quantify its degrees of freedom as seen from the outside. Beyond this point, from unitarity we would expect that the entropy of the radiation begins to decrease, ensuring that information is eventually recovered. In this work, we investigate the dependence of the Page time on black hole properties and the particle content of nature. Specifically, we analyze its sensitivity to the Standard Model (SM) and potential Beyond-the-SM degrees of freedom, incorporating the effects of particle masses. We find that a Schwarzschild primordial black hole (PBH) with an initial mass of $6.23\times 10^{14}~{\rm g}$ would have a Page time equal to the age of the Universe, assuming emission of SM particles only. We further explore the impact of a non-negligible PBH angular momentum, finding that light spin-2 particles are predominantly emitted before the Page time. Specifically, for initial angular momenta values exceeding $a_\star &gt; 0.5$, approximately $70\%$ of the total graviton emission occurs prior to the Page time for PBHs with an initial mass $M_{\rm BH} \lesssim 10^{10}~{\rm g}$. Finally, we discuss the implications for PBH phenomenology, particularly regarding potential constraints from $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ measurements.</description>

      <title>Testing the consistency of new Amati-correlated gamma-ray burst dataset cosmological constraints with those from better-established cosmological data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are promising cosmological probes for exploring the Universe at intermediate redshifts ($z$). We analyze 151 Fermi-observed long GRBs (datasets A123 and A28) to simultaneously constrain the Amati correlation and cosmological parameters within six spatially flat and nonflat dark energy models. We find that these datasets are standardizable via a single Amati correlation, suggesting their potential for cosmological analyses. However, constraints on the current value of the nonrelativistic matter density parameter from A123 and the combined A123 + A28 data exhibit $&gt;2\sigma$ tension with those derived from a joint analysis of better-established Hubble parameter [$H(z)$] and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data for most considered cosmological models. This tension indicates that these GRB data are unsuitable for jointly constraining cosmological parameters with better-established $H(z)$ + BAO and similar data. Although the A28 data constraints are consistent with the $H(z)$ + BAO data constraints, its limited sample size (28 GRBs) and high intrinsic scatter ($\sim0.7$) diminishes its statistical power compared to existing datasets.</description>

      <title>Flipped Rotating Axion Non-minimally Coupled to Gravity: Baryogenesis and Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the co-genesis of baryon asymmetry and dark matter can be achieved through the rotation of an axion-like particle, driven by a flip in the vacuum manifold's direction at the end of inflation. This can occur if the axion has a periodic non-minimal coupling to gravity, while preserving the discrete shift symmetry. In non-oscillating inflation models, after inflation there is typically a period of kination (with $w = 1$). In this case, it is shown that the vacuum manifold of the axion is flipped and the axion begins rotating in field space, because it can slide across the decreasing potential barrier as in Ricci reheating. Such a rotating axion can generate the baryon asymmetry of the Universe through spontaneous baryogenesis, while at later epochs it can oscillate as dark matter. The period of kination makes the primordial gravitational waves (GW) generated during inflation sharply blue-tilted which constrains the parameter space due to GW overproduction, while being testable by next generation CMB experiments. As a concrete example, we show that such a cogenesis of baryon asymmetry and dark matter can be realized for the axion as the Majoron in the Type-I seesaw setup, predicting mass ranges for the Majoron below sub eVs, with right-handed neutrino mass above $\mathcal{O}(10^{8})$ GeV. We also show that in order to avoid fragmentation of the axion condensate during the rotation, we require the non-minimal coupling $\xi \sim (f/m_P)^2 $ or somewhat larger, where $f$ is the axion decay constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12112v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, several papers have claimed that superhorizon curvature perturbations are not conserved at the one-loop level in single-field inflation models if there is a transient ultra-slow-roll period. In this work, we point out that the contributions from the counterterms were overlooked in the recent papers. We show that the counterterm contributions play a crucial role in canceling the one-loop power spectrum of superhorizon curvature perturbations in the comoving gauge.</description>

      <title>Effect of primary scalar hair on black hole's strong lensing in Beyond Horndeski Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the gravitational lensing effects of a static, asymptotically flat black hole with primary scalar hair in Beyond Horndeski gravity, focusing on the strong lensing regime. Recently, in Ref. [1], we placed constraints on the scalar hair parameter by analyzing its thermodynamic stability and the black hole shadow. In this work, we further investigate the strong lensing properties of the black hole, which form the basis of shadow formation, and employ observational data from the Event Horizon Telescope to derive more precise constraints on the scalar hair parameter. Additionally, we compute the shape and position of different lensed images of a thin accretion disk and argue that the observed black hole shadow corresponds to the secondary image of the emitting disk. Using this interpretation, we perform a new set of constraints on the scalar hair. Furthermore, we discuss why higher-order images are not suitable for astrophysical constraints, highlighting the limitations posed by their faintness and observational challenges. Finally, we find that models satisfying these constraints exhibit local instabilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05434v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate the statistics of peaks of non-Gaussian random fields and implement it to study the sphericity of peaks. For non-Gaussianity of the local type, we present a general formalism valid regardless of how large the deviation from Gaussian statistics is. For general types of non-Gaussianity, we provide a framework that applies to any system with a given power spectrum and the corresponding bispectrum in the regime in which contributions from higher-order correlators can be neglected. We present an explicit expression for the most probable values of the sphericity parameters, including the effect of non-Gaussianity on the shape. We show that the effects of small perturbative non-Gaussianity on the sphericity parameters are negligible, as they are even smaller than the subleading Gaussian corrections. In contrast, we find that large non-Gaussianity can significantly distort the peak configurations, making them much less spherical.</description>

      <title>Non-modal effects in black hole perturbation theory: Transient Superradiance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the non-modal stability of black hole spacetimes under linear perturbations. We show that large-amplitude growth can occur at finite time, despite asymptotic decay of linear perturbations. In the example presented, the physical mechanism is a transient form of superradiance, and is qualitatively similar to the transition to turbulence in Navier-Stokes shear flows. As part of the construction we provide a theorem for the positivity of QNM energies, and introduce a truncated-Hamiltonian approach to black hole pseudospectra which does not suffer from convergence issues.</description>

      <title>Boundary criticality for the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the boundary criticality for the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa (GNY) models. Employing interacting Dirac fermions on a honeycomb lattice with armchair boundaries, we use determinate quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) simulation to uncover rich boundary criticalities at the quantum phase transition to a charge-density-wave (CDW) insulator, including the ordinary, special, and extraordinary transitions. The Dirac fermions satisfy a Dirichlet boundary condition, while the boson field, representing the CDW order, obeys Dirichlet and Neumann conditions at the ordinary and special transitions, respectively, thereby enriching the critical GNY model. We develop a perturbative $4-\epsilon$ renormalization group approach to compute the boundary critical exponents. Our framework generalizes to other GNY universality class variants and provides theoretical predictions for experiments.</description>

      <title>Probing the quantum speed limit and entanglement in flavor oscillations of neutrino-antineutrino system in curved spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a spinning primordial black hole (PBH) described by the Kerr metric in Kerr-Schild polar coordinates. We derive an analytical expression for the four-vector gravitational potential in the underlying Hermitian Dirac Hamiltonian using these coordinates. This gravitational potential introduces an axial vector term in the Dirac equation in curved spacetime. We find that the magnitudes of the temporal and spatial components of the four-vector gravitational potential are significantly affected by the angle of the position vector of the spinor with respect to the spin axis of the PBH, its radial distance from the PBH, and the strength of the specific angular momentum of the PBH. These potentials modify the effective mass matrix of the neutrino-antineutrino system and significantly affect the transition probabilities during the flavor oscillation of the neutrino-antineutrino system. We then use the transition probability to investigate the quantum speed limit time bound ratio for the two-flavor oscillation of the neutrino-antineutrino system in curved spacetime. This helps us estimate how quickly the initial neutrino flavor state evolves over time under the influence of the gravitational field. Finally, we discuss quantum correlations such as entanglement entropy during the two-flavor oscillation of the neutrino-antineutrino system near a spinning PBH.</description>

      <title>Generalized susceptibilities and the properties of charm degrees of freedom across the QCD crossover temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the generalized charm susceptibilities in 2+1 flavor QCD on the lattice at several lattice spacings. We show that, below the chiral crossover, these susceptibilities are well described by the hadron resonance gas (HRG) model if charmed hadrons not listed in tables of the Particle Data Group are included. However, the HRG description abruptly breaks down just above the chiral crossover. To understand this, we use a model for the charm pressure in which it is expressed as the sum of partial pressures from charmed baryons, charmed mesons, and charm quarks. We present continuum estimates of these partial pressures and find that, while the partial pressures of charmed mesons and baryons drop below their respective HRG predictions, the charm quark pressure becomes non-zero above the chiral crossover.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and particle production from cosmological perturbations: a quantum optical simulation approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a computational framework based on the Gaussian formalism and symplectic circuit representation to explore cosmological perturbations during inflation. These tools offer an efficient means to study entanglement generation and particle production, particularly when analytical methods become insufficient and numerical simulations are essential. By evolving an initial Bunch-Davies vacuum through a two-mode squeezer, we simulate the behavior of the von Neumann entropy and logarithmic negativity across a wide range of cosmological backgrounds, each characterized by a distinct equation of state. The von Neumann entropy obtained via QuGIT simulations is compared with analytic R\'enyi entropy bounds, thereby validating the accuracy of our circuit implementation of the cosmological squeezing Hamiltonian in both accelerating and decelerating scenarios. We further investigate the role of thermal noise and demonstrate how the von Neumann entropy and logarithmic negativity are affected by its presence.</description>

      <title>On the Determination of Collisional Stopping Power via Kaluza-Klein Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, the tools of general relativity are used to analytically derive collisional stopping power and a linkage between higher-dimensional field theory and transport phenomena is proposed. We start from a Kaluza-Klein inspired, five-dimensional diffeomorphism-invariant action, and upon compactification, obtain a four-dimensional effective theory in which the matter fields are treated to be brane-localized. The medium response to the projected electron is encoded in symmetric tensor fields coupled covariantly to both electromagnetic and fermionic parts via Lagrangian-derived interactions. When $R_c \sim \Lambda_{\text{EM}}^{-1}$, $\Lambda_{\text{EM}} \gg m_e$ and $g_4^2 = \frac{3\pi^2 m_e v}{4\gamma^3 R_c^2 e^2 \Lambda_{\text{EM}}}$ are satisfied, the leading term of Bethe-M{\o}ller formula is shown to be recovered in the large $R$ limit. The construction presented here may serve as an alternative approach that uses compactification geometry and medium excitations to determine observable couplings and stopping power. The model intrinsically supports phenomena linked to anisotropy and nonlinear response, as well as gravitational or extra-dimensional effects in laboratory-scale systems via the study of stopping power and particle range. The construction is gauge invariant, behaves consistently under limiting conditions, and can be matched to experimental stopping data through a single effective normalization constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a recent conjecture of the fourth named author with P. Norbury that states a system of universal polynomial relations among the kappa classes on the moduli spaces of algebraic curves. The proof involves localization and materialization analysis of the spin Gromov-Witten theory of the projective line and is dictated by $\mathbb{Z}_2$-equivariant topological recursion.</description>

      <title>Incompressible quantum liquid on the four-dimensional sphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of quantum Hall effect (QHE) is a foundation of topological physics, inspiring extensive explorations of its high-dimensional generalizations. Notably, the four dimensional (4D) QHE has been experimentally realized in synthetic quantum systems, including cold atoms, photonic lattices, and metamaterials. However, the many-body effect in the 4D QHE system remains poorly understood. In this study, we explore this problem by formulating the microscopic wavefunctions inspired by Laughlin's seminal work. Employing a generalized pseudo-potential framework, we derive an exact microscopic Hamiltonian consisting of two-body projectors that annihilate the microscopic wavefunctions. Diagonalizations on a small size system show that the quasi-hole states remain zero energy while the quasi-particle states exhibit a finite gap, in consistency with an incompressible state. Furthermore, the pairing distribution is calculated to substantiate the liquid-like nature of the wavefunction. Our work provides a preliminary understanding to the fractional topological states in high dimension.</description>

      <title>On the Dynamics of Extended Bodies and the GravoThermo Memory Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-linearity of the theory of gravity induces a hysteresis effect in both the systems interacting with gravity and in the gravitational field. The effect is usually referred to as the memory effect. In this paper, we explore this phenomenon in the context of the dynamics of extended rotating objects in the presence of a gravitational wave pulse. Then, we consider an ensemble of such objects and show that a redistribution of spin orientations takes place as a gravitational wave passes through. We examine how this redistribution, changes the partition function and the thermodynamic quantities including entropy and energy of the system. The result shows that some information about the source of the gravitation wave is encoded in the thermodynamics of the system.</description>

      <title>Critical quantum liquids and the cuprate high temperature superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for the cuprate superconductors, rooted in a fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*) description of the intermediate-temperature pseudogap phase at low doping. The FL* theory predicted hole pockets each of fractional area $p/8$ at hole doping $p$, in contrast to the area $p/4$ in a spin density wave state or its thermal fluctuation. A recent magnetotransport observation of the Yamaji angle is in good agreement with area $p/8$.
  We review a theory for the FL* phase of a single-band model using a pair of ancilla qubits on each site. Its mean field theory yields hole pockets of area $p/8$, and matches the gapped photoemission spectrum in the anti-nodal region of the Brillouin zone. Fluctuations are described by the SU(2) gauge theory of a background spin liquid with critical Dirac spinons. A Monte Carlo study of the thermal SU(2) gauge theory transforms the hole pockets into Fermi arcs. One route to confinement upon lowering temperature yields a $d$-wave superconductor via a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition of $h/(2e)$ vortices, with nodal Bogoliubov quasiparticles featuring anisotropic velocities and vortices surrounded by charge order halos. An alternative route produces a charge-ordered metallic state that exhibits quantum oscillations in agreement with experimental data.
  Increasing doping from the FL* phase drives a transition to a conventional Fermi liquid at large doping, passing through an intermediate strange metal regime. We formulate a theory of this metal using a critical quantum `charge' liquid of mobile electrons in the presence of disorder, developed via an extension of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model.
  At low temperatures, and across optimal and over doping, we address the regimes of extended non-Fermi liquid behavior by Griffiths effects near quantum phase transitions in disordered metals.</description>
