      <title>Active Learning for Discovering Complex Phase Diagrams with Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a Bayesian active learning algorithm that efficiently elucidates phase diagrams. Using a novel acquisition function that assesses both the impact and likelihood of the next observation, the algorithm iteratively determines the most informative next experiment to conduct and rapidly discerns the phase diagrams with multiple phases. Comparative studies against existing methods highlight the superior efficiency of our approach. We demonstrate the algorithm's practical application through the successful identification of the entire phase diagram of a spin Hamiltonian with antisymmetric interaction on Honeycomb lattice, using significantly fewer sample points than traditional grid search methods and a previous method based on support vector machines. Our algorithm identifies the phase diagram consisting of skyrmion, spiral and polarized phases with error less than 5% using only 8% of the total possible sample points, in both two-dimensional and three-dimensional phase spaces. Additionally, our method proves highly efficient in constructing three-dimensional phase diagrams, significantly reducing computational and experimental costs. Our methodological contributions extend to higher-dimensional phase diagrams with multiple phases, emphasizing the algorithm's effectiveness and versatility in handling complex, multi-phase systems in various dimensions.</description>

      <title>Descriptors-free Collective Variables From Geometric Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhanced sampling simulations make the computational study of rare events feasible. A large family of such methods crucially depends on the definition of some collective variables (CVs) that could provide a low-dimensional representation of the relevant physics of the process. Recently, many methods have been proposed to semi-automatize the CV design by using machine learning tools to learn the variables directly from the simulation data. However, most methods are based on feed-forward neural networks and require as input some user-defined physical descriptors. Here, we propose to bypass this step using a graph neural network to directly use the atomic coordinates as input for the CV model. This way, we achieve a fully automatic approach to CV determination that provides variables invariant under the relevant symmetries, especially the permutational one. Furthermore, we provide different analysis tools to favor the physical interpretation of the final CV. We prove the robustness of our approach using different methods from the literature for the optimization of the CV, and we prove its efficacy on several systems, including a small peptide, an ion dissociation in explicit solvent, and a simple chemical reaction.</description>

      <title>Isometric tensor network optimization for extensive Hamiltonians is free of barren plateaus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.14320v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explain why and numerically confirm that there are no barren plateaus in the energy optimization of isometric tensor network states (TNS) for extensive Hamiltonians with finite-range interactions which are, for example, typical in condensed matter physics. Specifically, we consider matrix product states (MPS) with open boundary conditions, tree tensor network states (TTNS), and the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA). MERA are isometric by construction and, for the MPS and TTNS, the tensor network gauge freedom allows us to choose all tensors as partial isometries. The variance of the energy gradient, evaluated by taking the Haar average over the TNS tensors, has a leading system-size independent term and decreases according to a power law in the bond dimension. For a hierarchical TNS (TTNS and MERA) with branching ratio $b$, the variance of the gradient with respect to a tensor in layer $\tau$ scales as $(b\eta)^\tau$, where $\eta$ is the second largest eigenvalue of a Haar-average doubled layer-transition channel and decreases algebraically with increasing bond dimension. The absence of barren plateaus substantiates that isometric TNS are a promising route for an efficient quantum-computation-based investigation of strongly-correlated quantum matter. The observed scaling properties of the gradient amplitudes bear implications for efficient TNS initialization procedures.</description>

      <title>Scaling of contraction costs for entanglement renormalization algorithms including tensor Trotterization and variational Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21006v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) is a hierarchical class of tensor network states motivated by the real-space renormalization group. It is used to simulate strongly correlated quantum many-body systems. For prominent MERA structures in one and two spatial dimensions, we determine the optimal scaling of contraction costs as well as corresponding contraction sequences and algorithmic phase diagrams. This is motivated by recent efforts to employ MERA in hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, where the MERA tensors are Trotterized, i.e., chosen as circuits of quantum gates, and observables as well as energy gradients are evaluated by sampling causal-cone states. We investigate whether tensor Trotterization and/or variational Monte Carlo (VMC) sampling can lead to quantum-inspired classical MERA algorithms that perform better than the traditional optimization of full MERA based on the exact evaluation of energy gradients. Algorithmic phase diagrams indicate the best MERA method depending on the scaling of the energy accuracy and the number of Trotter steps with the bond dimension. The results suggest substantial gains due to VMC for two-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Crystal Properties and Defects in CdZnTe Radiation Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: CdZnTe-based detectors are highly valued because of their high spectral resolution, which is an essential feature for nuclear medical imaging. However, this resolution is compromised when there are substantial defects in the CdZnTe crystals. In this study, we present a learning-based approach to determine the spatially dependent bulk properties and defects in semiconductor detectors. This characterization allows us to mitigate and compensate for the undesired effects caused by crystal impurities. We tested our model with computer-generated noise-free input data, where it showed excellent accuracy, achieving an average RMSE of 0.43% between the predicted and the ground truth crystal properties. In addition, a sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the effect of noisy data on the accuracy of the model.</description>

      <title>Dependence of the Solar Wind Plasma Density on Moderate Geomagnetic Activity Elucidated by Potential Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relationship between a moderate level of geomagnetic activity, represented by the Kp index (2- - 5+), and solar wind conditions were revealed based on Potential Learning (PL), and dependence of particular solar wind plasma density (NP) on moderate geomagnetic conditions was discussed. It has poorly been understood from what stage of geomagnetic activity NP begins to control the Kp level. Previously, PL succeeded to extract the most influential solar wind parameters at an extremely low (0 - 1+) and high (6- - 9) Kp ranges under southward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) conditions. The IMF three components, solar wind flow speed (VX), and NP obtained from the 21-year OMNI solar wind database were used as the PL input parameters. PL extracted VX as the most significant parameter for the moderate Kp level under southward IMF conditions and NP is the second most influential parameter. Based on the examination of the statistical relationship between VX and NP under extremely low, high, and moderate Kp levels using the PL database, geomagnetic conditions remain high while NP becomes large, even if VX decreases (or remains similar). This shows that both VX and NP govern geomagnetic activity, following the relational equation between Kp and the solar wind plasma parameter. Based on the relation between VX and NP clarified by PL and incidental statistical studies using PL input data, we also revealed that NP begins to affect the Kp level from moderate geomagnetic activity level. These results suggest that even under southward IMF conditions, the geomagnetic activity might be influenced by fast (slow) VX and low (high) NP. Our results would greatly help understand general relationship between solar wind conditions and geomagnetic activity under various IMF conditions, and forecast the geomagnetic activity under extreme solar wind conditions.</description>

      <title>Statistical Finite Elements via Interacting Particle Langevin Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a class of interacting particle Langevin algorithms to solve inverse problems for partial differential equations (PDEs). In particular, we leverage the statistical finite elements (statFEM) formulation to obtain a finite-dimensional latent variable statistical model where the parameter is that of the (discretised) forward map and the latent variable is the statFEM solution of the PDE which is assumed to be partially observed. We then adapt a recently proposed expectation-maximisation like scheme, interacting particle Langevin algorithm (IPLA), for this problem and obtain a joint estimation procedure for the parameters and the latent variables. We consider three main examples: (i) estimating the forcing for linear Poisson PDE, (ii) estimating the forcing for nonlinear Poisson PDE, and (iii) estimating diffusivity for linear Poisson PDE. We provide computational complexity estimates for forcing estimation in the linear case. We also provide comprehensive numerical experiments and preconditioning strategies that significantly improve the performance, showing that the proposed class of methods can be the choice for parameter inference in PDE models.</description>

      <title>Low-Temperature Electron Transport in [110] and [100] Silicon Nanowires: A DFT - Monte Carlo study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effects of very low temperature on the electron transport in a [110] and [100] axially aligned unstrained silicon nanowires (SiNWs) are investigated. A combination of semi-empirical 10-orbital tight-binding method, density functional theory (DFT), and Ensemble Monte Carlo (EMC) methods are used. Both acoustic and optical phonons are included in the electron-phonon scattering rate calculations covering both intra-subband and inter-subband events. A comparison with room temperature (300 K) characteristics shows that for both nanowires, the average electron steady-state drift velocity increases at least 2 times at relatively moderate electric fields and lower temperatures. Furthermore, the average drift velocity in [110] nanowires is 50 percent more than that of [100] nanowires, explained by the difference in their conduction subband effective mass. Transient average electron velocity suggests that there is a pronounced streaming electron motion at low temperature which is attributed to the reduced electron-phonon scattering rates.</description>

      <title>An effective and reliable approach to the phase problem in single-shot single-particle Coherent Diffraction Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent Diffraction Imaging (CDI) is an experimental technique to get images of isolated structures by recording the light scattered off the sample. Thanks to the extremely bright and short coherent light pulses provided by X-ray Free Electron Lasers, CDI makes it possible to study nanostructures in the gas phase and get time-resolved snapshots of their ultrafast dynamics with unprecedented resolution. In principle, the sample density can be recovered from the scattered light field through a straightforward Fourier Transform operation. However, only the amplitude of the field is recorded, while the phase is lost during the measurement process and has to be retrieved by means of suitable, well-established, phase retrieval algorithms. We present the Memetic Phase Retrieval (MPR) method, an improved approach to the phase retrieval problem, which makes use of a combination of existing phase retrieval algorithms and evolutionary algorithms to mitigate the shortcomings of conventional approaches. We benchmark the method on experimental data acquired in two experimental campaigns at SwissFEL and European XFEL. Imaging results on isolated nanostructures reveal considerable stability of the algorithm's behavior on the input parameters, as well as the capability of identifying the solution in challenging conditions. A user-friendly implementation of the MPR method is released as open-source software, aiming at being a reference tool for the FEL imaging community.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.15190v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear operators with long distance spatiotemporal dependencies are fundamental in modeling complex systems across sciences, yet learning these nonlocal operators remains challenging in machine learning. Integral equations (IEs), which model such nonlocal systems, have wide ranging applications in physics, chemistry, biology, and engineering. We introduce Neural Integral Equations (NIE), a method for learning unknown integral operators from data using an IE solver. To improve scalability and model capacity, we also present Attentional Neural Integral Equations (ANIE), which replaces the integral with self-attention. Both models are grounded in the theory of second kind integral equations, where the indeterminate appears both inside and outside the integral operator. We provide theoretical analysis showing how self-attention can approximate integral operators under mild regularity assumptions, further deepening previously reported connections between transformers and integration, and deriving corresponding approximation results for integral operators. Through numerical benchmarks on synthetic and real world data, including Lotka-Volterra, Navier-Stokes, and Burgers' equations, as well as brain dynamics and integral equations, we showcase the models' capabilities and their ability to derive interpretable dynamics embeddings. Our experiments demonstrate that ANIE outperforms existing methods, especially for longer time intervals and higher dimensional problems. Our work addresses a critical gap in machine learning for nonlocal operators and offers a powerful tool for studying unknown complex systems with long range dependencies.</description>

      <title>A robust and adaptive GenEO-type domain decomposition preconditioner for $\mathbf{H}(\mathbf{curl})$ problems in three-dimensional general topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we design, analyse and test domain decomposition methods for linear systems of equations arising from conforming finite element discretisations of positive Maxwell-type equations, namely for $\mathbf{H}(\mathbf{curl})$ problems. It is well known that convergence of domain decomposition methods rely heavily on the efficiency of the coarse space used in the second level. We design adaptive coarse spaces that complement a near-kernel space made from the gradient of scalar functions. The new class of preconditioner is inspired by the idea of subspace decomposition, but based on spectral coarse spaces, and is specially designed for curl-conforming discretisations of Maxwell's equations in heterogeneous media on general domains which may have holes. We also address the practical robustness of various solvers in the case of non-trivial topologies and/or high aspect ratio of the domain.</description>

      <title>Non-homogeneous anisotropic bulk viscosity for acoustic wave attenuation in weakly compressible methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A major limitation of the weakly compressible approaches to simulate incompressible flows is the appearance of artificial acoustic waves that introduce a large mass conservation error and lead to spurious oscillations in the force coefficients. In this work, we propose a non-homogeneous anisotropic bulk viscosity term to effectively damp the acoustic waves. By implementing this term in a computational framework based on the recently proposed general pressure equation, we demonstrate that the non-homogeneous and anisotropic nature of the term makes it significantly more effective than the isotropic homogeneous version widely used in the literature. Moreover, it is computationally more efficient than the pressure (or mass) diffusion term, which is an alternative mechanism used to suppress acoustic waves. We simulate a range of benchmark problems to comprehensively investigate the performance of the bulk viscosity on the effective suppression of acoustic waves, mass conservation error, order of convergence of the solver, and computational efficiency. The proposed form of the bulk viscosity enables fairly accurate modelling of the initial transients of unsteady simulations, which is highly challenging for weakly compressible approaches, and to the best of our knowledge, existing approaches can't provide an accurate prediction of such transients.</description>

      <title>Exploring Ground and Excited States via Single Reference Coupled-Cluster Theory and Algebraic Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The exploration of the root structure of coupled cluster equations holds both foundational and practical significance for computational quantum chemistry. This study provides insight into the intricate root structures of these non-linear equations at both the CCD and CCSD level of theory. We utilize computational techniques from algebraic geometry, specifically the monodromy and parametric homotopy continuation methods, to calculate the full solution set. We compare the computed CC roots against various established theoretical upper bounds, shedding light on the accuracy and efficiency of these bounds. We hereby focus on the dissociation processes of four-electron systems such as (H$_2$)$_2$ in both D$_{2{\rm h}}$ and D$_{\infty {\rm h}}$ configurations, H$_4$ symmetrically distorted on a circle, and lithium hydride. We moreover investigate the ability of single-reference coupled cluster solutions to approximate excited state energies. We find that multiple CC roots describe energies of excited states with high accuracy. Our investigations reveal that for systems like lithium hydride, CC not only provides high-accuracy approximations to several excited state energies but also to the states themselves.</description>
