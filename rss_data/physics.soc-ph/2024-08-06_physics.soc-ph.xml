      <title>A Comparative Analysis of Wealth Index Predictions in Africa between three Multi-Source Inference Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Poverty map inference is a critical area of research, with growing interest in both traditional and modern techniques, ranging from regression models to convolutional neural networks applied to tabular data, images, and networks. Despite extensive focus on the validation of training phases, the scrutiny of final predictions remains limited. Here, we compare the Relative Wealth Index (RWI) inferred by Chi et al. (2021) with the International Wealth Index (IWI) inferred by Lee and Braithwaite (2022) and Esp\'in-Noboa et al. (2023) across six Sub-Saharan African countries. Our analysis focuses on identifying trends and discrepancies in wealth predictions over time. Our results show that the predictions by Chi et al. and Esp\'in-Noboa et al. align with general GDP trends, with differences expected due to the distinct time-frames of the training sets. However, predictions by Lee and Braithwaite diverge significantly, indicating potential issues with the validity of the model. These discrepancies highlight the need for policymakers and stakeholders in Africa to rigorously audit models that predict wealth, especially those used for decision-making on the ground. These and other techniques require continuous verification and refinement to enhance their reliability and ensure that poverty alleviation strategies are well-founded.</description>

      <title>Dynamical toy model of interacting $N$ agents robustly exhibiting Zipf's law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a dynamical toy model of agents which possess a quantity and have an interaction radius depending on the amount of the quantity. They exchange the quantity with agents existing within their interaction radii. It is shown in the paper that the distribution of the quantity of agents is robustly governed by Zipf's law for a small density of agents independent of the number of agents and the type of interaction, despite the simplicity of the rules. The model can exhibit other power laws with different exponents and the Gaussian distributions. The difference in the mechanism underlying Zipf's law and other power laws are studied by mapping the systems into graphs and investigating quantities characterizing the mapped graph. Thus, this model suggests one of the origins of Zipf's law, i.e., the most common fundamental characteristics necessary for Zipf's law to appear.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary dynamics in stochastic nonlinear public goods games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the evolution of cooperation in multiplayer games is of vital significance for natural and social systems. An important challenge is that group interactions often leads to nonlinear synergistic effects. However, previous models mainly focus on deterministic nonlinearity where the arise of synergy or discounting effect is determined by certain conditions, ignoring uncertainty and stochasticity in real-world systems. Here, we develop a probabilistic framework to study the cooperative behavior in stochastic nonlinear public goods games. Through both analytical treatment and Monte Carlo simulations, we provide comprehensive understanding of social dilemmas with stochastic nonlinearity in both well-mixed and structured populations. We find that increasing the degree of nonlinearity makes synergy more advantageous when competing with discounting, thereby promoting cooperation. Interestingly, we show that network reciprocity loses effectiveness when the probability of synergy is small. Moreover, group size exhibits nonlinear effects on group cooperation regardless of the underlying structure. Our findings thus provide novel insights into how stochastic nonlinearity influences the emergence of prosocial behavior.</description>

      <title>Identifying influential node groups in networks with core-periphery structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying influential spreaders is a crucial problem for practical applications in network science. The core-periphery(C-P) structure, common in many real-world networks, comprises a densely interconnected group of nodes(core) and the rest of the sparsely connected nodes subordinated to the core(periphery). Core nodes are expected to be more influential than periphery nodes generally, but recent studies suggest that this is not the case in some networks. In this work, we look for mesostructural conditions that arise when core nodes are significantly more influential than periphery nodes. In particular, we investigate the roles of the internal and external connectivity of cores in their relative influence. We observe that the internal and external connectivity of cores are broadly distributed, and the relative influence of the cores is also broadly distributed in real-world networks. Our key finding is that the internal connectivity of cores is positively correlated with their relative influence, whereas the relative influence increases up to a certain value of the external connectivity and decreases thereafter. Finally, results from the model-generated networks clarify the observations from the real-world networks. Our findings provide a structural condition for influential cores in networks and shed light on why some cores are influential and others are not.</description>

      <title>Inferring firm-level supply chain networks with realistic systemic risk from industry sector-level data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Production networks constitute the backbone of every economic system. They are inherently fragile as several recent crises clearly highlighted. Estimating the system-wide consequences of local disruptions (systemic risk) requires detailed information on the supply chain networks (SCN) at the firm-level, as systemic risk is associated with specific mesoscopic patterns. However, such information is usually not available and realistic estimates must be inferred from available sector-level data such as input-output tables and firm-level aggregate output data. Here we explore the ability of several maximum-entropy algorithms to infer realizations of SCNs characterized by a realistic level of systemic risk. We are in the unique position to test them against the actual Ecuadorian production network at the firm-level. Concretely, we compare various properties, including the Economic Systemic Risk Index, of the Ecuadorian production network with those from four inference models. We find that the most realistic systemic risk content at the firm-level is retrieved by the model that incorporates information about firm-specific input disaggregated by sector, indicating the importance of correctly accounting for firms' heterogeneous input profiles across sectors. Our results clearly demonstrate the minimal amount of empirical information at the sector level that is necessary to statistically generate synthetic SCNs that encode realistic firm-specific systemic risk.</description>

      <title>Gender differences in collaboration and career progression in physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine gender differences in collaboration networks and academic career progression in physics. We use the likelihood and time to become a principal investigator (PI) and the length of an author's career to measure career progression. Utilising logistic regression and accelerated failure time models, we examine whether the effect of collaboration behaviour varies by gender. We find that, controlling for the number of publications, the relationship between collaborative behaviour and career progression is almost the same for men and women. Specifically, we find that those who eventually reach principal investigator (PI) status, tend to have published with more unique collaborators. In contrast, publishing repeatedly with the same highly interconnected collaborators and/or larger number of coauthors per publication is characteristic of shorter career lengths and those that do not attain PI status. We observe that the tie strength is stronger for women than men, and women tend to collaborate in more tightly connected and larger groups than men. Finally, we observe that women are less likely to attain the status of PI throughout their careers and have a lower survival probability compared to men, which calls for policies to close this crucial gap.</description>

      <title>Reducing COVID-19 Misinformation Spread by Introducing Information Diffusion Delay Using Agent-based Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the explosive growth of the Coronavirus Pandemic (COVID-19), misinformation on social media has developed into a global phenomenon with widespread and detrimental societal effects. Despite recent progress and efforts in detecting COVID-19 misinformation on social media networks, this task remains challenging due to the complexity, diversity, multi-modality, and high costs of fact-checking or annotation. In this research, we introduce a systematic and multidisciplinary agent-based modeling approach to limit the spread of COVID-19 misinformation and interpret the dynamic actions of users and communities in evolutionary online (or offline) social media networks. Our model was applied to a Twitter network associated with an armed protest demonstration against the COVID-19 lockdown in Michigan state in May, 2020. We implemented a one-median problem to categorize the Twitter network into six key communities (nodes) and identified information exchange (links) within the network. We measured the response time to COVID-19 misinformation spread in the network and employed a cybernetic organizational method to monitor the Twitter network. The overall misinformation mitigation strategy was evaluated, and agents were allocated to interact with the network based on the measured response time and feedback. The proposed model prioritized the communities based on the agents response times at the operational level. It then optimized agent allocation to limit the spread of COVID19 related misinformation from different communities, improved the information diffusion delay threshold to up to 3 minutes, and ultimately enhanced the mitigation process to reduce misinformation spread across the entire network.</description>

      <title>Are EU low-carbon structural funds efficient in reducing emissions?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the effectiveness of the ``low-carbon economy'' expenditures from European Structural and Investment Funds in fostering reductions in greenhouse gas emissions within European regions, focusing on the 2007-2013 and 2014-2020 programme periods. By decomposing emissions time series into trend and cycle components and considering them within a panel data framework, our research highlights that the impacts of low-carbon economy expenditures vary, qualitatively and quantitatively, with the targeted regions' development level. We find significant emissions reductions in developed and transition regions yet less favourable outcomes in less developed areas. Further analysis into specific greenhouse gas emissions types (CO$_2$, CH$_4$, and N$_2$O) reveals inconsistent impacts, underscoring the complexity of achieving emissions reductions. Our findings emphasise the need for tailored environmental strategies that accommodate the economic disparities of regions in the European Union.</description>

      <title>Why distinctiveness centrality is distinctive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper responds to a commentary by Neal (2024) regarding the Distinctiveness centrality metrics introduced by Fronzetti Colladon and Naldi (2020). Distinctiveness centrality offers a novel reinterpretation of degree centrality, particularly emphasizing the significance of direct connections to loosely connected peers within (social) networks. This response paper presents a more comprehensive analysis of the correlation between Distinctiveness and the Beta and Gamma measures. All five distinctiveness measures are considered, as well as a more meaningful range of the {\alpha} parameter and different network topologies, distinguishing between weighted and unweighted networks. Findings indicate significant variability in correlations, supporting the viability of Distinctiveness as alternative or complementary metrics within social network analysis. Moreover, the paper presents computational complexity analysis and simplified R code for practical implementation. Encouraging initial findings suggest potential applications in diverse domains, inviting further exploration and comparative analyses.</description>

      <title>Optimal policy for control of epidemics with constrained time intervals and region-based interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a policy model coupled with the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) epidemic model to study interactions between policy-making and the dynamics of epidemics. We consider both single-region policies, as well as game-theoretic models involving interactions among several regions, and hierarchical interactions among policy-makers modeled as multi-layer games. We assume that the policy functions are piece-wise constant with a minimum time interval for each policy stage, considering policies cannot change frequently in time or they cannot be easily followed. The optimal policy is obtained by minimizing a cost function which consists of an implementation cost, an impact cost, and, in the case of multi-layer games, a non-compliance cost. We show in a case study of COVID-19 in France that when the cost function is reduced to the impact cost and is parameterized as the final epidemic size, the solution approximates that of the optimal control in Bliman et al, J. Optim. Theory Appl., 189, 2021, for sufficiently small minimum policy time interval. For a larger time interval however the optimal policy is a step down function, quite different from the step up structure typically deployed during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we present a counterfactual study of how the pandemic would have evolved if herd immunity was reached during the second wave in the county of Los Angeles, California. Lastly, we study a case of three interacting counties with and without a governing state.</description>

      <title>Multi-level Traffic-Responsive Tilt Camera Surveillance through Predictive Correlated Online Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In urban traffic management, the primary challenge of dynamically and efficiently monitoring traffic conditions is compounded by the insufficient utilization of thousands of surveillance cameras along the intelligent transportation system. This paper introduces the multi-level Traffic-responsive Tilt Camera surveillance system (TTC-X), a novel framework designed for dynamic and efficient monitoring and management of traffic in urban networks. By leveraging widely deployed pan-tilt-cameras (PTCs), TTC-X overcomes the limitations of a fixed field of view in traditional surveillance systems by providing mobilized and 360-degree coverage. The innovation of TTC-X lies in the integration of advanced machine learning modules, including a detector-predictor-controller structure, with a novel Predictive Correlated Online Learning (PiCOL) methodology and the Spatial-Temporal Graph Predictor (STGP) for real-time traffic estimation and PTC control. The TTC-X is tested and evaluated under three experimental scenarios (e.g., maximum traffic flow capture, dynamic route planning, traffic state estimation) based on a simulation environment calibrated using real-world traffic data in Brooklyn, New York. The experimental results showed that TTC-X captured over 60\% total number of vehicles at the network level, dynamically adjusted its route recommendation in reaction to unexpected full-lane closure events, and reconstructed link-level traffic states with best MAE less than 1.25 vehicle/hour. Demonstrating scalability, cost-efficiency, and adaptability, TTC-X emerges as a powerful solution for urban traffic management in both cyber-physical and real-world environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15449v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The initial phase of an epidemic is often characterized by an exponential increase in the number of infected individuals. In this Letter, we predict the exponential spreading rate of an epidemic on a complex network. We first find an expression of the reproduction number for a network, based on the degree distribution, the network assortativity, and the level of clustering. We then connect this reproduction number and the disease infectiousness to the spreading rate. Our result holds for a broad range of networks, apart from networks with very broad degree distribution, where no clear exponential regime is present. Our theory bridges the gap between classic epidemiology and the theory of complex network, with broad implications for model inference and policy making.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.01653v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We expand the calculation of the upper bound on epidemic overshoot in SIR models to account for nonlinear incidence. We lay out the general procedure and restrictions to perform the calculation analytically for nonlinear functions in the number of susceptibles. We demonstrate the procedure by working through several examples and also numerically study what happens to the upper bound on overshoot when nonlinear incidence manifests in the form of epidemic dynamics over a contact network. We find that both steeper incidence terms and larger contact heterogeneity can increase the range of communicable diseases at which the overshoot remains a relatively large public health hazard.</description>

Abstract: We present a nation-wide network analysis of non-fatal opioid-involved overdose journeys in the United States. Leveraging a unique proprietary dataset of Emergency Medical Services incidents, we construct a journey-to-overdose geospatial network capturing nearly half a million opioid-involved overdose events spanning 2018-2023. We analyze the structure and sociological profiles of the nodes, which are counties or their equivalents, characterize the distribution of overdose journey lengths, and investigate changes in the journey network between 2018 and 2023. Our findings include that authority and hub nodes identified by the HITS algorithm tend to be located in urban areas and involved in overdose journeys with particularly long geographical distances.</description>
