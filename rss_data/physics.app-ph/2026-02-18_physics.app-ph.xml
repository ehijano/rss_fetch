      <title>Tailoring multiple scattering acoustic media with perfect transmission for non-Abelian braiding and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple scattering of waves in complex media can be harnessed and tailored for diverse phenomena in sound and light. Despite the tremendous progress enabled by technologies such as time-reversal propagation and wavefront shaping, the full control of transmission matrix remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose a multi-scattering-based approach to design reflectionless complex media with a unitary transmission matrix of arbitrary structures. As such, the perfect transmission of waves through such a medium performs a unitary operation. Based on this principle, we experimentally demonstrated braiding of multiple waveguide modes in an acoustic waveguide via multiple scattering and showed non-Abelian characteristics arising from the concatenation of distinct complex media. Furthermore, we show that the principle can be extended for realizing arbitrary unitary operations beyond braiding. Our scheme uses generalized Wigner-Smith operators to design the optimal acoustic complex media with near-arbitrary targeted functionalities. The scheme is generally applicable beyond acoustics, with broad implications to other wave types. Our results demonstrate unprecedented control over multiple-scattering waves and are relevant to applications that require precise control over propagation, such as multiplexed communications, wave-based logic operations, and computations.</description>

      <title>Transforming Computational Lithography with AC and AI -- Faster, More Accurate, and Energy-efficient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From climate science to drug discovery, scientific computing demands have surged dramatically in recent years -- driven by larger datasets, more sophisticated models, and higher simulation fidelity. This growth rate far outpaces transistor scaling, leading to unsustainably rising costs, energy consumption, and emissions. Semiconductor manufacturing is no exception. Computational lithography -- involving transferring circuitry to silicon in diffraction-limited conditions -- is the largest workload in semiconductor manufacturing. It has also grown exceptionally complex as miniaturization has advanced in the angstrom-era, requiring more accurate modeling, intricate corrections, and broader solution-space exploration. Accelerated computing (AC) offers a solution by dramatically freeing up the compute and power envelope. AI augments these gains by serving as high-fidelity surrogates for compute-intensive steps. Together, they present a sustainable, next-generation computing platform for scientific workloads. This new paradigm needs a fundamental redesign of the software stack. For computational lithography, NVIDIA cuLitho reinvents the core primitives -- diffractive optics, computational geometry, multi-variant optimization, data processing -- to achieve a transformative 57X end-to-end acceleration. Beyond dramatically faster cycles, this expanded compute envelope enables more rigorous solutions, including curvilinear masks, high-numerical aperture extreme ultraviolet (high-NA EUV) lithography, and subatomic modeling. We reinvest a small fraction of the freed-up compute to include through-focus correction for better process resilience. Silicon experiments at IMEC show significant benefits compared to conventional methods -- 35% better process window and 19% better edge placement error. This is the first quantified chip-scale demonstration of the lithography benefits of AC and AI in silicon.</description>

      <title>Systematic study of high performance GeSn photodiodes with thick absorber for SWIR and extended SWIR detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Germanium-tin (GeSn) photodiodes potentiate a viable solution to integrate SWIR and extended SWIR detection technology into CMOS processing line. However, challenges in the growth of thick, high quality GeSn limit the device absorber thickness, making it impossible to ascertain the performance limit of GeSn photodiodes. An in-depth understanding of their device physics and a clear optimization pathway towards commercial-grade devices remain elusive. This work presents a systematic empirical study of GeSn photodiodes with thick absorber (2 to 8% Sn content, up to 2630 nm thick), showing high responsivity up to 0.59 A.W-1 at 1.55 {\mu}m and 0.43 A.W-1 at 2 {\mu}m wavelengths, low dark current density down to 2 x 10-2 A.cm-2, and high detection cutoff wavelengths up to 2.1 and 2.5 {\mu}m at 5% and 8% Sn, respectively. Using specific doping design (P-i-N and N-i-P), an in-depth analysis is presented on the impact of junction position, p-type background carrier concentration, bulk/ surface defects and photocarrier diffusion length - on photodetection performance. Different optimization strategies for GeSn photodiodes, in particular at high Sn content, are proposed.</description>

      <title>Environment-Driven Emergence of Higher-Order Collective Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collective behavior is commonly attributed to direct interactions among system components. Using a minimal stochastic model, we show that higher-order collective structure can instead emerge from shared stochastic environments, even in the absence of interactions. Quantified via the O-information, environmental fluctuations induce both redundant and synergistic dependencies, with the latter occupying larger regions of the correlation space. We establish a no-go theorem showing that time-independent coupling between the system variables and a shared stochastic environment rules out synergistic higher-order behavior. Crucially, this constraint can be overcome dynamically: transitions between redundancy and synergy arise from time-dependent environmental coupling or from the nontrivial interplay between shared environments and direct interactions. Together, these results identify environmental mediation as a distinct mechanism of higher-order collective organization beyond the conventional interaction-centric paradigm.</description>

      <title>Optofluidic light routing via analytically configuring streamlines of micro-flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformation optics (TO) is a new method to design metamaterials that can manipulate electromagnetic fields. Inspired by the traditional TO techniques which is mostly based on the solid metamaterials with a limited range of tunability, a novel streamline tracing-based transformation optofluidics (STTOF) method is proposed to manipulate the light path by analytically designating the light-carrying streamlines of the flow in a two-dimensional circular bounded domain. A dipole flow model is built to analytically calculate the streamlines of the flow field inside the domain which allocates the optical/fluidic source and sink pairs at arbitrary positions. Liquid core/liquid cladding (L2) configuration is used in the experiment to trace the light via a specific streamline. Experimental results verify that the light paths agree well with the theoretical predictions, and demonstrate that a good range of tunability can be achieved by adjusting the flow rates and the source-sink positions of optical/fluidic source and sink pairs.</description>

      <title>Grip as Needed, Glide on Demand: Ultrasonic Lubrication for Robotic Locomotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Friction is the essential mediator of terrestrial locomotion, yet in robotic systems it is almost always treated as a passive property fixed by surface materials and conditions. Here, we introduce ultrasonic lubrication as a method to actively control friction in robotic locomotion. By exciting resonant structures at ultrasonic frequencies, contact interfaces can dynamically switch between "grip" and "slip" states, enabling locomotion. We developed two friction control modules, a cylindrical design for lumen-like environments and a flat-plate design for external surfaces, and integrated them into bio-inspired systems modeled after inchworm and wasp ovipositor locomotion. Both systems achieved bidirectional locomotion with nearly perfect locomotion efficiencies that exceeded 90%. Friction characterization experiments further demonstrated substantial friction reduction across various surfaces, including rigid, soft, granular, and biological tissue interfaces, under dry and wet conditions, and on surfaces with different levels of roughness, confirming the broad applicability of ultrasonic lubrication to locomotion tasks. These findings establish ultrasonic lubrication as a viable active friction control mechanism for robotic locomotion, with the potential to reduce design complexity and improve efficiency of robotic locomotion systems.</description>

      <title>Three-Dimensional Optical-Electrical Simulation of Cs2AgBiBr6 Double Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite significant advances in lead-free perovskite photovoltaics, achieving a balance among environmental safety and high optoelectronic performance remains challenging. The inorganic double perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6 has emerged as a promising candidate owing to its robust three-dimensional crystal structure and suitable visible-range bandgap. However, best power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) for Cs2AgBiBr6 solar cells reported so far - 6.37% experimentally and 27.78% in numerical studies - remain below the theoretical performance potential, largely due to suboptimal charge transport layers, and interface-related recombination losses. Here, we address this gap using a 3D finite-element method (FEM) implemented in COMSOL Multiphysics, which couples optical simulations with semiconductor drift-diffusion transport. To our knowledge, this work represents the first comprehensive 3D FEM-based study of a double halide perovskite solar cell. Screening of 25 electron transport layer (ETL)-hole transport layer (HTL) combinations identifies CeO2 and P3HT as the optimal ETL and HTL respectively. Device performance is further analyzed through systematic variation of layer thicknesses, doping concentrations and defect densities within the FTO/CeO2/Cs2AgBiBr6/P3HT/Au architecture. Under optimized parameters, the simulated device achieves a PCE of 31.76%, representing the theoretical upper bound predicted by the model. Overall, this work demonstrates 3D physics-based device engineering as a decisive pathway for overcoming efficiency bottlenecks in lead-free double perovskite photovoltaics.</description>

      <title>Polarization-resolved measurement of forward volume spin waves by micro-focused Brillouin light scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how the micro-focused BLS signal of forward volume spin waves is formed and why it remains observable despite symmetry-based "suppression" expectations. A reciprocity-theorem based model with vectorial diffraction-limited focusing identifies the nonnegligible longitudinal focal-field component as the key element responsible for BLS sensitivity in the forward volume geometry. We further demonstrate that full polarization analysis, implemented through polarizer-analyzer maps of coherently excited spin waves, provides information beyond the conventional crossed polarizer-analyzer readout. In a BiYIG thin film, the measured maps exhibit Stokes/anti-Stokes polarization asymmetries and nontrivial patterns that stem from quadratic magneto-optical coupling terms. Fitting the data with a model including Voigt and Cotton-Mouton contributions yields an effective Cotton-Mouton constant and shows that the quadratic response is comparable to the linear Voigt contribution.</description>

      <title>Tunable microwave frequency synthesis with optically-derived spectral purity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microwave synthesizers are central to test and measurement systems across applications including wireless communications, radar, spectroscopy, and time and frequency metrology. State-of-the-art microwave sources, however, are fundamentally constrained by trade-offs between frequency tunability and spectral purity. Electro-optic frequency division (eOFD) is an emerging technique for dividing down the purity of optical sources to the microwave domain. Previously reported eOFD-based synthesizers generally have limited tunability due to feedback stabilization requirements. Here we demonstrate a feed-forward eOFD architecture in which the frequency tunability of a microwave source is preserved while optical spectral purity is divided through feed-forward cancellation, without any downstream electronic frequency synthesis. By canceling the phase noise of the microwave source without feedback, this eOFD approach removes loop bandwidth and source noise constraints observed in prior eOFD architectures. We achieve octave-spanning tunability, including the entire X-band, with phase noise below -140 dBc/Hz at kilohertz offsets and a high-frequency noise floor between -155 dBc/Hz and -145 dBc/Hz for carrier frequencies from 8 to 16 GHz. This performance corresponds to single-femtosecond integrated timing jitter, enabling, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of coherent, optically referenced microwave synthesis under wide tuning with this level of spectral purity.</description>

      <title>Experimental characterization of cohesive laws for mode-II interlaminar fracture in geometrically scaled composites using through-thickness deformation analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work proposes an experimental framework to characterize a cohesive law for mode-II interlaminar fracture and demonstrates its implementation. For a size effect study, geometrically scaled end-notched flexure specimens were tested using microscopic and macroscopic digital image correlation (DIC) systems. The fracture energy was characterized using a compliance calibration method and Ba\v{z}ant's type-II size effect law for comparison. In the proposed experimental framework, the DIC data were post-processed using three steps: coordinate transformation, curve fitting, and through-thickness deformation analysis. Different magnitudes of separation values were measured from different sizes at fracture loads, implying size effect and partial development of cohesive laws. Modeling and simulations were intended to validate the proposed method and demonstrate the utilization of the experimental data. Additionally, challenges related to finding a single cohesive law for geometrically scaled specimens of a single material were exposed. A single cohesive law for the scaled specimens was developed and proposed as a material property of the specimen material. The fracture energy of the single law was smaller than the energy obtained from the size effect analysis, while the sizes of fracture process zones at fracture loads were smaller than the experimental measurements. However, the global fracture behaviors of the models showed good agreement with the experimental data of the mid-size specimen while showing reasonable agreement with the other sizes. Furthermore, the single law successfully captured local fracture behaviors by showing partial cohesive zone development at the fracture loads and matching the microscopic measurement of the separation values.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20366v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultrafast pump-probe imaging reveals that the efficiency of optical excitation of coherent spins waves in epitaxial iron garnet films can be effectively controlled by an external electric field at room temperature. Although a femtosecond laser pulse alone does not excite any pronounced coherent spin oscillations, an electrical gating with the field of 0.5 MV/m dramatically changes the outcome in a laser-induced launching of spin waves. The effect, demonstrated under room-temperature conditions, is estimated to be orders of magnitude larger than in magnetic van der Waals semiconductors observed at 10 K. This electrical gating of laser-induced spin dynamics enriches opto-magnonics with a new tool and thus opens up a new avenue in fundamental and applied magnonics research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spontaneous orientation polarization (SOP) of polar molecules is formed in vacuum-deposited films by tilting their permanent dipole moment against the substrate surface direction. In this study, we developed SOP molecules with high structural asymmetry by introducing multiple fluoroalkyl groups into polar molecules because SOP is driven by asymmetric intermolecular interactions on the film surface during the vacuum deposition. The developed polar molecules exhibited high dipole orientation degrees in vacuum-deposited films and achieved a high surface potential growth rate relative to the film thickness, over -350 mV nm-1, which is a record high for the reported compounds. Furthermore, the dipolar layers introduced at organic thin-film interfaces in hole-only devices and organic photovoltaics to study the impact of dipole interlayers on device performance. The characteristics of the device were observed to be significantly influenced by the SOP polarity, suggesting that the SOP at the organic thin-film interface plays a crucial role in charge transfer and energy level alignment. The findings of this study provide methodologies for the formation of highly anisotropic glassy films, leading to improved performance of organic devices.</description>

      <title>Electropolishing-Induced Topographic Defects in Niobium: Insights and Implications for Superconducting Radio Frequency Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electropolishing is the premier surface preparation method for high-Q, high-gradient superconducting RF cavities made of Nb. This leaves behind an apparently smooth surface, yet the achievable peak magnetic fields fall well below the superheating field of Nb, in most cases. In this work, the ultimate surface finish of electropolishing was investigated by studying its effect on highly polished Nb samples. Electropolishing introduces high slope angle sloped-steps at grain boundaries. The magnetic field enhancement and superheating field suppression factors associated with such a geometry are calculated in the London theory. Despite the by-eye smoothness of electropolished Nb, such defects compromise the stability of the low-loss Meissner state, likely limiting the achievable peak accelerating fields in superconducting RF cavities. Finally, the impact of surface roughness on impurity diffusion is investigated which can link surface roughness to the effectiveness of heat treatments like low-temperature baking or nitrogen infusion in the vortex nucleation or hydride hypotheses. Surface roughness tends to decrease the effective dose of impurities as a result of the expansion of impurities into regions with greater internal angle. The effective dose of impurities can be protected by minimizing slope angles and step heights, ensuring uniformity.</description>
