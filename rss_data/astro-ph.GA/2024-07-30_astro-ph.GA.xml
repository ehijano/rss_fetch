      <title>Observations of phosphorus-bearing molecules in the interstellar medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chemistry of phosphorus (31P) in space is particularly significant due to the key role it plays in biochemistry on Earth. Utilising radio and infrared spectroscopic observations, several key phosphorus-containing molecules have been detected in interstellar clouds, circumstellar shells, and even extragalactic sources. Among these, phosphorus nitride (PN) was the first P-bearing molecule detected in space, and still is the species detected in the largest number of sources. Phosphorus oxide (PO) and phosphine (PH3) were also crucial species due to their role both in chemical networks and in forming biogenic compounds. The still limited high-angular resolution observations performed so far are shading light on the geometrical distribution of these molecules, which represent crucial insights on their formation processes. Observations have also highlighted the challenges and complexities associated with detecting and understanding phosphorus chemistry in space, owing to the low elemental abundance of P relative to other elements. This review article provides a state-of-art picture of the observational results obtained so far on phosphorus compounds in the interstellar medium. Special attention is given to star-forming regions, and to their implications for our understanding of prebiotic chemistry and the potential for life beyond Earth. Our knowledge of the dominant formation and destruction pathways of the most abundant species has improved, but critical questions remain open, among which: what is (are) the main phosphorus carrier(s) in space? Upcoming facilities will offer new opportunities to both detect new phosphorus-bearing molecules and enlarge the number of sources in which the chemistry of P can be studied. The synergy between observations, models, laboratory experiments, and computational works is mandatory to progress in this field.</description>

      <title>Semi-Empirical Approach to [CII] Line Intensity Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The line intensity mapping technique involves measuring the cumulative emission from specific spectral lines emitted by galaxies and intergalactic gas. This method provides a way to study the matter distribution and the evolution of large-scale structures throughout the history of the Universe. However, modeling intensity mapping from ab-initio approaches can be challenging due to significant astrophysical uncertainties and noticeable degeneracies among astrophysical and cosmological parameters. To address these challenges, we develop a semi-empirical, data-driven framework for galaxy evolution, which features a minimal set of assumptions and parameters gauged on observations. By integrating this with stellar evolution and radiative transfer prescriptions for line emissions, we derive the cosmic [CII] intensity over an extended redshift range $0 \lesssim z \lesssim 10$. Our approach is quite general and can be easily applied to other key lines used in intensity mapping studies, such as [OIII] and the CO ladder. We then evaluate the detectability of the [CII] power spectra using current and forthcoming observational facilities. Our findings offer critical insights into the feasibility and potential contributions of intensity mapping for probing the large-scale structure of the Universe and understanding galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>GA-NIFS: Multi-phase outflows in a star-forming galaxy at $z \sim 5.5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galactic outflows driven by star formation or active galactic nuclei are typically formed by multi-phase gas whose temperature spans over 4 orders of magnitude. Probing the different outflow components requires multi-wavelength observations and long exposure times, especially in the distant Universe. So far, most of the high-z studies have focused on a single gas phase, but this kind of analysis may potentially miss a non-negligible fraction of the total outflowing gas content. In this work, we analyze the spatially resolved rest-frame UV and optical emission from HZ4, the highest redshift main sequence star-forming galaxy having a detected [C II] outflow, which traces the neutral gas component. Our goal is to study the ionized interstellar medium in the galaxy and the properties of the ionized outflow as traced by the [O III]$\lambda$5007\r{A} and H$\alpha$ emission lines. We exploit JWST/NIRSpec observations in the integral field spectroscopy mode to investigate the galaxy properties by making use of the brightest rest-frame optical emission lines. Their high spectral and spatial resolution allows us to trace the ionized outflow from broad line wings and spatially resolve it. We also re-analyze the [C II] ALMA data to compare the neutral atomic and ionized outflow morphologies, masses, and energetics. We find that the system consists of a galaxy merger, instead of a rotating disk as originally inferred from low-resolution [C II] observations, and hosts an extended ionized outflow. The ionized outflow is being launched from a region hosting an intense burst of star formation and extends over 4 kpc from the launch site. The neutral and ionized outflows are almost co-spatial, but the mass loading factor in the ionized gas phase is two orders of magnitude smaller than in the neutral phase, as found for other lower redshift multi-phase outflows.</description>

      <title>Deep rest-UV JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy of early galaxies: the demographics of CIV and N-emitters in the reionization era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST has recently discovered a subset of reionization era galaxies with ionized gas that is metal poor in oxygen and carbon but heavily-enriched in nitrogen. This abundance pattern is almost never seen in lower redshift galaxies but is commonly observed in globular cluster stars. We have recently demonstrated that this peculiar abundance pattern appears in a compact ($\simeq 20$ pc) metal-poor galaxy undergoing a strong burst of star formation. This galaxy was originally selected based on strong CIV emission, indicating a hard radiation field rarely seen locally. In this paper, we present JWST/NIRSpec observations of another reionization-era galaxy known to power strong CIV emission, the $z=7.04$ gravitationally-lensed galaxy A1703-zd6. The emission line spectrum reveals this is a metal poor galaxy ($12+\log(\rm O/H) = 7.47\pm0.19$) dominated by a young stellar population ($1.6^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$ Myr) that powers a very hard ionizing spectrum (CIV EW = 19.4 $\unicode{x212B}$, He II EW = 2.2 $\unicode{x212B}$). The ISM is highly-enriched in nitrogen ($\log(\rm N/O)=-0.6$) with very high electron densities ($8-19\times10^4$ cm$^{-3}$) and extreme ionization conditions rarely seen at lower redshift. We also find intense CIV emission (EW$\gtrsim20$ $\unicode{x212B}$) in two new $z\gtrsim 6$ metal poor galaxies. To put these results in context, we search for UV line emission in a sample of 737 $z\gtrsim 4$ galaxies with NIRSpec spectra, establishing that 40(30)% of systems with [OIII]+H$\beta$ EW $&gt;2000\unicode{x212B}$ have NIV] (CIV) detections with EW$&gt;5$ $\unicode{x212B}$ ($&gt;10$ $\unicode{x212B}$). These results suggest high N/O ratios and hard ionizing sources appear in a brief phase following a burst of star formation in compact high density stellar complexes.</description>

      <title>A self-consistent framework to study magnetic fields with strong gravitational lensing and polarised radio sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a unified approach that, given a strong gravitationally lensed polarised source, self-consistently infers its complex surface brightness distribution and the lens galaxy mass-density profile, magnetic field and electron density from interferometric data. The method is fully Bayesian, pixellated and three-dimensional: the source light is reconstructed in each frequency channel on a Delaunay tessellation with a magnification-adaptive resolution. We tested this technique using simulated interferometric observations with a realistic model of the lens, for two different levels of source polarisation and two different lensing configurations. For all data sets, the presence of a Faraday rotating screen in the lens is supported by the data with strong statistical significance. In the region probed by the lensed images, we can recover the Rotation Measure and the parallel component of the magnetic field with an average error between 0.6 and 11 rad m$^{-2}$ and 0.3 and 3 nG, respectively. Given our choice of model, we find the electron density is the least well-constrained component due to a degeneracy with the magnetic field and disk inclination. The background source total intensity, polarisation fraction, and polarisation angle are inferred with an error between 4 and 10 per cent, 15 and 50 per cent, and 1 to 12 degrees, respectively. Our analysis shows that both the lensing configuration and the intrinsic model degeneracies play a role in the quality of the constraints that can be obtained.</description>

      <title>The PAU Survey: The quasar UV and Ly$\alpha$ luminosity functions at $2.7&lt;z&lt;5.3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) and ultraviolet (UV) luminosity function (LF), in bins of redshift, of quasars selected in the Physics of the Accelerating Universe Survey (PAUS). A sample of 915 objects was selected at $2.7&lt;z&lt;5.3$ within an effective area of $\sim 36$ deg$^2$ observed in 40 narrow-band filters (NB; FWHM $\sim 120$ \r{A}). We cover the intermediate-bright luminosity regime of the LF $(10^{43.5}&lt;(L_{{\rm Ly}\alpha}/{\rm erg\,s}^{-1})&lt;10^{45.5}$; $-29&lt;M_{\rm UV}&lt;-24)$. The continuous wavelength coverage of the PAUS NB set allows a very efficient target identification and precise redshift measurements. We show that our method is able to retrieve a fairly complete ($C\sim 85\%$) and pure ($P\sim 90\%$) sample of Ly$\alpha$ emitting quasars for $L_{{\rm Ly}\alpha}&gt;10^{44}$ ${\rm erg\,s}$$^{-1}$. In order to obtain corrections for the LF estimation, and assess the accuracy of our selection method, we produced mock catalogs of $0&lt;z&lt;4.3$ quasars and galaxies that mimic our target population and their main contaminants. Our results show a clear evolution of the Ly$\alpha$ and UV LFs, with a declining tendency in the number density of quasars towards increasing redshifts. In addition, the faint-end power-law slope of the Ly$\alpha$ LF becomes steeper with redshift, suggesting that the number density of Ly$\alpha$-bright quasars declines faster than that of fainter emitters. By integrating the Ly$\alpha$ LF we find that the total Ly$\alpha$ emitted by bright quasars per unit volume rapidly declines with increasing redshift, being sub-dominant to that of star-forming galaxies by several orders of magnitude by $z\sim 4$. Finally, we stack the NB pseudo-spectra of a visually selected "golden sample" of 591 quasars to obtain photometric composite SEDs in bins of redshift, enabling to measure the mean IGM absorption by the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest as a function of redshift.</description>

      <title>UNCOVERing the Faint-End of the z=7 [OIII] Luminosity Function with JWST's F410M Medium Bandpass Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong emission from doubly ionized oxygen is a beacon for some of the most intensely star forming galaxies known. JWST enables the search for this beacon in the early universe with unprecedented sensitivity. In this work, we extend the study of faint [OIII]$_{5008}$ selected galaxies by an order of magnitude in line luminosity. We use publicly available UNCOVER DR1 JWST/NIRCam and HST imaging data of the cluster lensing field, Abell 2744, to identify strong (rest-frame EW$&gt;500$\AA) [OIII]$_{5008}$ emitters at $z\sim7$ based on excess F410M flux. We find $N=68$ $z\sim7$ [OIII] candidates, with a subset of $N=33$ that have deep HST coverage required to rule-out lower redshift interlopers (13.68 arcmin$^2$ with F814W $5\sigma$ depth $&gt;28$ AB). Such strong emission lines can lead to very red colors that could be misinterpreted as evidence for old, massive stellar populations, but are shown to be due to emission lines where we have spectra. Using this deep HST sample and completeness simulations, which calculate the effective survey volume of the UNCOVER lensing field as a function of [OIII] luminosity, we derive a new [OIII] luminosity function (LF) extending to $41.09&lt;\rm{log}_{10}(L/\rm{erg\,s}^{-1})&lt;42.35$ which is an order of magnitude deeper than previous $z\sim6$ [OIII] LFs based on JWST slitless spectroscopy. This LF is well fit by a power law with a faint-end slope of $\alpha=-2.07^{+0.22}_{-0.23}$. There is little or no evolution between this LF and published [OIII] LFs at redshifts $3\lesssim z\lesssim7$, and no evidence of a turnover at faint luminosities. The sizes of these extreme [OIII] emitters are broadly similar to their low redshift counterparts, the green peas. The luminosity function of [OIII] emitters matches that of Lyman-$\alpha$ at the bright end, suggesting that many of them should be Lyman-$\alpha$ emitters.</description>

      <title>The winds, metallicity, rotational velocities and mass loss rate of the hot, contact binary TU Muscae (HD100213)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A model of the TU Muscae binary system has been developed by a study of 23 SWP spectrophotometric images obtained with the IUE satellite telescope and downloaded from the IUE Archive. The images are well distributed in Keplerian orbital phase thereby permitting a simultaneous fitting of the C IV wind-line profile by the SEI method and the light curve for the same bandpass by means of a program similar to that of Wilson and Devinney. The result is a set of parameters characterizing the physical and geometric properties of the wind envelopes surrounding the stars.
  Surprisingly, there is no evidence for a P Cygni profile or strong, distinguishable shock front in the system, as has been found for similar investigations of EM Carinae and HD159176. This is probably a result of the contact nature of the binary and the high temperature environment of such a shock. That is, most of the carbon ions in the shock are more highly ionized. Based on the parameters for the SEI fit to the C IV profile, the value for the ionization fraction of C IV in the wind was calculated to be 10-4. With this value, the mass loss rate calculated from two independent equations, was found to be about 10-6 solar masses/yr. The line blanketing or metallicity was found to be erratically variable with orbital phase and time, indicating a variable amount of fast moving, dense clouds in the winds and/or a great amount of turbulence. The meaning of rotational velocities for the stars is problematic and depends on what point on the photospheres one is considering.</description>

      <title>Weak Gravitational Lensing around Low Surface Brightness Galaxies in the DES Year 3 Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements using a sample of low surface brightness galaxies (LSBGs) drawn from the Dark Energy Survey Year 3 (Y3) data as lenses. LSBGs are diffuse galaxies with a surface brightness dimmer than the ambient night sky. These dark-matter-dominated objects are intriguing due to potentially unusual formation channels that lead to their diffuse stellar component. Given the faintness of LSBGs, using standard observational techniques to characterize their total masses proves challenging. Weak gravitational lensing, which is less sensitive to the stellar component of galaxies, could be a promising avenue to estimate the masses of LSBGs. Our LSBG sample consists of 23,790 galaxies separated into red and blue color types at $g-i\ge 0.60$ and $g-i&lt; 0.60$, respectively. Combined with the DES Y3 shear catalog, we measure the tangential shear around these LSBGs and find signal-to-noise ratios of 6.67 for the red sample, 2.17 for the blue sample, and 5.30 for the full sample. We use the clustering redshifts method to obtain redshift distributions for the red and blue LSBG samples. Assuming all red LSBGs are satellites, we fit a simple model to the measurements and estimate the host halo mass of these LSBGs to be $\log(M_{\rm host}/M_{\odot}) = 12.98 ^{+0.10}_{-0.11}$. We place a 95% upper bound on the subhalo mass at $\log(M_{\rm sub}/M_{\odot})&lt;11.51$. By contrast, we assume the blue LSBGs are centrals, and place a 95% upper bound on the halo mass at $\log(M_\mathrm{host}/M_\odot) &lt; 11.84$. We find that the stellar-to-halo mass ratio of the LSBG samples is consistent with that of the general galaxy population. This work illustrates the viability of using weak gravitational lensing to constrain the halo masses of LSBGs.</description>

      <title>The GLEAMing of the first supermassive black holes: III. Radio sources with ultra-faint host galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present deep near-infrared $K_{\rm s}$-band imaging for 35 of the 53 sources from the high-redshift ($z &gt; 2$) radio galaxy candidate sample defined in Broderick et al. (2022). These images were obtained using the High-Acuity Widefield $K$-band Imager (HAWK-I) on the Very Large Telescope. Host galaxies are detected for 27 of the sources, with $K_{\rm s} \approx 21.6$$-$$23.0$ mag (2$''$ diameter apertures; AB). The remaining eight targets are not detected to a median $3\sigma$ depth of $K_{\rm s} \approx 23.3$ mag ($2''$ diameter apertures). We examine the radio and near-infrared flux densities of the 35 sources, comparing them to the known $z &gt; 3$ powerful radio galaxies with 500-MHz radio luminosities $L_{500\,{\rm MHz}} &gt; 10^{27}$ W Hz$^{-1}$. By plotting 150-MHz flux density versus $K_{\rm s}$-band flux density, we find that, similar to the sources from the literature, these new targets have large radio to near-infrared flux density ratios, but extending the distribution to fainter flux densities. Five of the eight HAWK-I deep non-detections have a median $3\sigma$ lower limit of $K_{\rm s} \gtrsim 23.8$ mag ($1.5''$ diameter apertures); these five targets, along with a further source from Broderick et al. (2022) with a deep non-detection ($K_{\rm s} \gtrsim 23.7$ mag; $3\sigma$; $2''$ diameter aperture) in the Southern H-ATLAS Regions $K_{\rm s}$-band Survey, are considered candidates to be ultra-high-redshift ($z &gt; 5$) radio galaxies. The extreme radio to near-infrared flux density ratios ($&gt;10^5$) for these six sources are comparable to TN J0924$-$2201, GLEAM J0856$+$0223 and TGSS J1530$+$1049, the three known powerful radio galaxies at $z &gt; 5$. For a selection of galaxy templates with different stellar masses, we show that $z \gtrsim 4.2$ is a plausible scenario for our ultra-high-redshift candidates if the stellar mass $M_{\rm *} \gtrsim 10^{10.5}\,{\rm M}_\odot$.

      <title>IllustrisTNG in the HSC-SSP: No Shortage of Thin Disk Galaxies in TNG50</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a thorough analysis of the projected shapes of nearby galaxies in both observations and cosmological simulations. We implement a forward-modeling approach to overcome the limitations in previous studies which hinder accurate comparisons between observations and simulations. We measure axis ratios of $z=0$ (snapshot 99) TNG50 galaxies from their synthetic Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) images and compare them with those obtained from real HSC-SSP images of a matched galaxy sample. Remarkably, the comparison shows excellent agreement between observations and the TNG50 simulation. Specifically, for galaxies with stellar masses $10\leq \log (M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) \leq 11.5$, we find $\lesssim 0.1\sigma$ tensions between the observation and the simulation, whereas previous studies found $\gtrsim 10\sigma$ tensions due to lack of thin galaxies in simulations. We reveal that low-mass galaxies ($M_{\star}\lesssim 10^{9.5}$) in TNG50 are thicker than their observed counterparts in HSC-SSP and attribute this to the spurious dynamical heating effects that artificially puff up galaxies. We also find that despite the overall broad agreement, TNG50 galaxies are more concentrated than the HSC-SSP ones at the low- and high-mass end of the stellar mass range of $9.0\leq \log (M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) \leq 11.2$ and are less concentrated at intermediate stellar masses. But we argue that the higher concentrations of the low-mass TNG50 galaxies are not likely the cause of their thicker/rounder appearances. Our study underscores the critical importance of conducting mock observations of simulations and applying consistent measurement methodologies to facilitate proper comparison with observations.</description>

      <title>Measuring Resolved Star Formation Histories from High-Precision Color-Magnitude Diagrams with StarFormationHistories.jl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how and when galaxies formed stars over the history of the Universe is fundamental to the study of galaxy evolution. The star formation histories (SFHs) of galaxies in the local Universe can be measured with high precision using deep imaging with space telescopes. Such resolved SFHs are based on modelling the observed color-magnitude diagram (CMD) with stellar evolution models and rely on age-sensitive features like the main sequence turn-off to measure a galaxy's star formation rate as a function of time. There are many other population-level parameters that factor into these measurements, such as the stellar initial mass function (IMF), binary fraction, and metallicity, to name a few. We present and release StarFormationHistories.jl, a modular, open-source Julia package for measuring resolved SFHs with a focus on model flexibility for these types of population parameters. The code can model unresolved photometric binaries and supports arbitrary IMFs. Random uncertainties in the SFH measurements can be quantified with Monte Carlo posterior sampling methods. We illustrate the performance of the package on JWST/NIRCAM data of the Local Group dwarf irregular galaxy WLM $\left(M_v\approx-14.2\right)$, which exhibits a complex, well-sampled CMD, and HST/ACS data of the ultra-faint Milky Way satellite dwarf galaxy Horologium I $\left(M_v\approx-3.7\right)$, which has a much simpler but sparser CMD.</description>

      <title>Filamentary mass accretion towards the high-mass protobinary system G11.92-0.61 MM2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present deep, sub-arcsecond ($\sim$2000 AU) resolution ALMA 0.82 mm observations of the former high-mass prestellar core candidate G11.92-0.61 MM2, recently shown to be an $\sim$500 AU-separation protobinary. Our observations show that G11.92-0.61 MM2, located in the G11.92-0.61 protocluster, lies on a filamentary structure traced by 0.82 mm continuum and N$_2$H$^+$(4-3) emission. The N$_2$H$^+$(4-3) spectra are multi-peaked, indicative of multiple velocity components along the line of sight. To analyse the gas kinematics, we performed pixel-by-pixel Gaussian decomposition of the N$_2$H$^+$ spectra using SCOUSEPY and hierarchical clustering of the extracted velocity components using ACORNS. Seventy velocity- and position-coherent clusters (called "trees") are identified in the N$_2$H$^+$-emitting gas, with the 8 largest trees accounting for &gt;60% of the fitted velocity components. The primary tree, with $\sim$20% of the fitted velocity components, displays a roughly north-south velocity gradient along the filamentary structure traced by the 0.82 mm continuum. Analysing a $\sim$0.17 pc-long substructure, we interpret its velocity gradient of $\sim$10.5 km s$^{-1}$pc$^{-1}$ as tracing filamentary accretion towards MM2 and estimate a mass inflow rate of $\sim$1.8$\times10^{-4}$ to 1.2$\times10^{-3}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. Based on the recent detection of a bipolar molecular outflow associated with MM2, accretion onto the protobinary is ongoing, likely fed by the larger-scale filamentary accretion flows. If 50% of the filamentary inflow reaches the protostars, each member of the protobinary would attain a mass of 8 M$_\odot$ within $\sim1.6\times$10$^5$ yr, comparable to the combined timescale of the 70 $\mu$m- and MIR-weak phases derived for ATLASGAL-TOP100 massive clumps using chemical clocks.</description>

      <title>The Class 0 protostars in Orion: Characterizing the properties of their magnetized envelopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study connecting the physical properties of protostellar envelopes to the morphology of the envelope-scale magnetic field. We use the ALMA polarization observations of 55 young prtostars at 0.87 mm on $\sim400-3000$ au scales from the {\em B}-field Orion Protostellar Survey (BOPS) to infer the envelope-scale magnetic field and both dust and gas emission on comparable scales to measure the envelope properties. We find that the protostellar envelopes with compact polarized dust emission tend to have lower envelope masses, than the sources with more extended envelopes. We also find that protostars showing hourglass-field morphologies tend to have lower velocity dispersions in their envelopes, whereas systems with spiral-field morphologies have higher velocity dispersion. Combining with the disk properties taken from the Orion VLA/ALMA Nascent Disk and Multiplicity (VANDAM) survey, we connect envelope properties to fragmentation. Our results suggest that envelope mass may not correlate with fragmentation, whereas turbulence appears to promote fragmentation. On the other hand, we find that fragmentation is suppressed in systems with pinched magnetic fields, suggesting that the magnetic field play a role on providing additional support against gravitational collapse, and the formation of an hourglass-like field may coincide with enhanced magnetic braking that removes angular momentum and hinders the formation of embedded disks. Nevertheless, significant misalignment between magnetic field and outflow axes tends to reduce magnetic braking, leading to the formation of larger disks.</description>

      <title>The Nature of 500 micron Risers III: A Small Complete Sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Herschel surveys have found large numbers of sources with red far-IR colours, and spectral energy distributions (SEDs) rising from 250 to 500$\mu$m: 500 risers. The nature and role of these sources is not fully understood. We here present Submillimeter Array (SMA) interferometric imaging at 200 GHz of a complete sample of five 500 risers with F500 $&gt;$ 44 mJy selected within a 4.5 square degree region of the XMMLSS field. These observations can resolve the separate components of multiple sources and allow cross identification at other wavelengths using the extensive optical-to-IR data in this field. Of our five targets we find that two are likely gravitationally lensed, two are multiple sources, and one an isolated single source. Photometric redshifts, using optical-to-IR data and far-IR/submm data, suggest they lie at redshifts $z \sim 2.5 - 3.5$. Star formation rates and stellar masses estimated from the SEDs show that the majority of our sources lie on the star-formation rate-stellar mass `main sequence', though with outliers both above and below this relation. Of particular interest is our most multiple source which consists of three submm emitters and one submm-undetected optical companion within a 7 arcsecond region, all with photometric redshifts $\sim$ 3. One of the submm emitters in this group lies above the `main sequence', while the optical companion lies well below the relation, and has an estimated stellar mass of 3.3$\pm 1.3 \times$10$^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$. We suggest this object is a forming brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) in the process of accreting actively star forming companions.</description>

      <title>Cluster membership analysis with supervised learning and $N$-body simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Membership analysis is an important tool for studying star clusters. There are various approaches to membership determination, including supervised and unsupervised machine learning (ML) methods. We perform membership analysis using the supervised machine learning approach. We train and test our ML models on two sets of star cluster data: snapshots from $N$-body simulations and 21 different clusters from the Gaia Data Release 3 data. We explore five different ML models: Random Forest (RF), Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, Feed-Forward Neural Networks, and K-Nearest Neighbors. We find that all models produce similar results, with RF showing slightly better accuracy. We find that a balance of classes in datasets is optional for successful learning. The classification accuracy depends strongly on the astrometric parameters. The addition of photometric parameters does not improve performance. We do not find a strong correlation between the classification accuracy and clusters' age, mass, and half-mass radius. At the same time, models trained on clusters with a larger number of members generally produce better results.</description>

      <title>The "Yes, Magellanic Clouds Again" survey: preliminary results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present preliminary findings from the photometric survey "Yes, Magellanic Clouds Again" (YMCA, PI: V. Ripepi), covering 110 square degrees in the outer regions of the Magellanic Clouds (MCs), a pair of interacting galaxies and the most massive dwarf satellites of the Milky Way. %The survey achieves a notable photometric depth, allowing us to resolve faint, old stellar populations. Among the key results, we discovered four star clusters (SCs) within the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) exhibiting ages within the so-called "age gap", a period deemed so far devoid of SCs. Additionally, we unveiled an ancient stellar system associated with the LMC, featuring structural properties in between the globular clusters and the ultra-faint dwarf galaxies of the Local Group. These discoveries significantly contribute to our understanding of the MCs' evolution and their complex interaction history.</description>

      <title>JOYS+: link between ice and gas of complex organic molecules. Comparing JWST and ALMA data of two low-mass protostars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A rich inventory of complex organic molecules (COMs) has been observed in high abundances in the gas phase toward Class 0 protostars. These molecules are suggested to be formed in ices and sublimate in the warm inner envelope close to the protostar. However, only the most abundant COM, methanol (CH3OH), has been firmly detected in ices before the era of James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Now it is possible to detect the interstellar ices of other COMs and constrain their ice column densities quantitatively. We aim to determine the column densities of several oxygen-bearing COMs (O-COMs) in both gas and ice for two low-mass protostellar sources, NGC 1333 IRAS 2A and B1-c, as case studies in our JWST Observations of Young protoStars (JOYS+) program. By comparing the column density ratios w.r.t. CH3OH between both phases measured in the same sources, we can probe into the evolution of COMs from ice to gas in the early stages of star formation. We are able to fit the fingerprints range of COM ices between 6.8 and 8.8 um in the JWST/MIRI-MRS spectra of B1-c using similar components as recently used for IRAS 2A. We claim detection of CH4, OCN-, HCOO-, HCOOH, CH3CHO, C2H5OH, CH3OCH3, CH3OCHO, and CH3COCH3 in B1-c, and upper limits are estimated for SO2, CH3COOH, and CH3CN. The comparison of O-COM ratios w.r.t CH3OH between ice and gas shows two different cases. 1) the column density ratios of CH3OCHO and CH3OCH3 match well between the two phases, which may be attributed to a direct inheritance from ice to gas or strong chemical links with CH3OH. 2) the ice ratios of CH3CHO and C2H5OH w.r.t. CH3OH are higher than the gas ratios by 1-2 orders of magnitudes. This difference can be explained by the gas-phase reprocessing following sublimation, or different spatial distributions of COMs in the envelope.</description>

      <title>Self-similar cluster structures in massive star-forming regions: Isolated evolution from clumps to embedded clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We used the dendrogram algorithm to decompose the surface density distributions of stars into hierarchical structures. These structures were tied to the multiscale structures of star clusters. A similar power-law for the mass-size relation of star clusters measured at different scales suggests a self-similar structure of star clusters. We used the minimum spanning tree method to measure the separations between clusters and gas clumps in each massive star-forming region. The separations between clusters, between clumps, and between clusters and clumps were comparable, which indicates that the evolution from clump to embedded cluster proceeds in isolation and locally, and does not affect the surrounding objects significantly. By comparing the mass functions of the ATLASGAL clumps and the identified embedded clusters, we confirm that a constant star formation efficiency of $\approx$ 0.33 can be a typical value for the ATLASGAL clumps.</description>

      <title>Tetrahedral grids in Monte Carlo radiative transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. 3D numerical simulations of radiative transfer are crucial for understanding complex astrophysical objects. For Monte Carlo radiative transfer, the spatial grid design is critical yet complex. Common grids include hierarchical octree and unstructured Voronoi grids, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Tetrahedral grids, widely used in ray-tracing graphics, are a potential alternative. Aims. We explore the possibilities, advantages, and limitations of tetrahedral grids for Monte Carlo radiative transfer, comparing their performance with other grid structures. Method. We integrated a tetrahedral grid structure, using the TetGen library, into the SKIRT Monte Carlo radiative transfer code. Tetrahedral grids can be imported or adaptively constructed and refined within SKIRT. We implemented an efficient grid traversal method using Pl\"ucker coordinates and Pl\"ucker products. Results. We validated the tetrahedral grid construction and traversal algorithm with 2D radiative transfer benchmarks. In a simple 3D model, we compared the performance of tetrahedral, octree, and Voronoi grids. The octree grid outperformed the others in traversal speed, while the tetrahedral grid had the lowest grid quality. Overall, tetrahedral grids performed worse than octree and Voronoi grids. Conclusion. While tetrahedral grids may not be ideal for most astrophysical simulations, they offer a viable unstructured alternative to Voronoi grids for specific applications, such as post-processing hydrodynamical simulations on tetrahedral or unstructured grids.</description>

      <title>Retrospective Search for Strongly Lensed Supernovae in the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.03578v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The introduction of deep wide-field surveys in recent years and the adoption of machine learning techniques have led to the discoveries of $\mathcal{O}(10^4)$ strong gravitational lensing systems and candidates. However, the discovery of multiply lensed transients remains a rarity. Lensed transients and especially lensed supernovae are invaluable tools to cosmology as they allow us to constrain cosmological parameters via lens modeling and the measurements of their time delays. In this paper, we develop a pipeline to perform a targeted lensed transient search. We apply this pipeline to 5807 strong lenses and candidates, identified in the literature, in the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys Data Release 9 (DR9) footprint. For each system, we analyze every exposure in all observed bands (DECam $g$, $r$, and $z$). Our pipeline finds, groups, and ranks detections that are in sufficient proximity temporally and spatially. After the first round of inspection, for promising candidate systems, we further examine the newly available DR10 data (with additional $i$ and $\textrm{Y}$ bands). Here we present our targeted lensed supernova search pipeline and seven new lensed supernova candidates, including a very likely lensed supernova $-$ probably a Type Ia $-$ in a system with an Einstein radius of $\sim 1.5''$.</description>

      <title>A Data-driven Spectral Model of Main Sequence Stars in Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise spectroscopic classification of planet hosts is an important tool of exoplanet research at both the population and individual system level. In the era of large-scale surveys, data-driven methods offer an efficient approach to spectroscopic classification that leverages the fact that a subset of stars in any given survey has stellar properties that are known with high fidelity. Here, we use The Cannon, a data-driven framework for modeling stellar spectra, to train a generative model of spectra from the Gaia Data Release 3 Radial Velocity Spectrometer. Our model derives stellar labels with precisions of 72 K in Teff , 0.09 dex in log g, 0.06 dex in [Fe/H], 0.05 dex in [{\alpha}/Fe] and 1.9 km/s in vbroad for main-sequence stars observed by Gaia DR3 by transferring GALAH labels, and is publicly available at https://github.com/isabelangelo/gaiaspec. We validate our model performance on planet hosts with available Gaia RVS spectra at SNR&gt;50 by showing that our model is able to recover stellar parameters at {\geq}20% improved accuracy over the existing Gaia stellar parameter catalogs, measured by the agreement with high-fidelity labels from the Spectroscopic Observations of Cool Stars (SPOCS) survey. We also provide metrics to test for stellar activity, binarity, and reliability of our model outputs and provide instructions for interpreting these metrics. Finally, we publish updated stellar labels and metrics that flag suspected binaries and active stars for Kepler Input Catalog objects with published Gaia RVS spectra.</description>

The effect of this environment on the planet-formation process, however, is important, especially in the earliest stage. Aims: We investigate the differences in planet populations forming in star-cluster environments through pebble accretion and compare these results with the planet formation around isolated stars. We try to provide potential signatures on the young planetary systems to guide future observation. Methods: We design and present a new planet population synthesis code for clustered environments. The planet formation model is based on pebble accretion and includes migration in the circumstellar disk. The disk's gas and dust are evolved in 1D simulations considering the effects of photo-evaporation of the nearby stars. Results: Planetary systems in a clustered environment are different than those born in isolation; the environmental effects are important for a wide range of observable parameters and the eventual architecture of the planetary systems. Planetary systems born in a clustered environment lack cold Jupiters compared to isolated planetary systems. This effect is more pronounced for low-mass stars ($\lesssim$0.2 $M_\odot$). On the other hand, planetary systems born in clusters show an excess of cold Neptune around these low-mass stars. Conclusions: In future observations, finding an excess of cold Neptunes and a lack of cold Jupiters could be used to constrain the birth environments of these planetary systems. Exploring the dependence of cold Jupiter's intrinsic occurrence rate on stellar mass provides insights into the birth environment of their proto-embryos.</description>

      <title>Destruction of interstellar methyl cyanide (CH3CN) via collisions with He+ ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Methyl cyanide is one of the simplest interstellar complex organic molecules, widely detected in young solar analogues, shocked regions, protoplanetary disks and comets. CH3CN can be considered a key species to explore the chemical connections between planet forming disks and comets. For such comparison to be meaningful kinetics data for the reactions leading to CH3CN formation and destruction must be updated. We focus on the destruction of methyl cyanide through collisions with He+. A combined experimental and theoretical methodology is employed to obtain cross sections (CSs) and branching ratios (BRs) as a function of collision energy, from which reaction rate coefficients $k(T)$ are calculated in the temperature range from 10 to 300 K. CSs and BRs are measured using a guided ion beam set-up. A theoretical treatment based on an analytical formulation of the potential energy surfaces (PESs) for the charge exchange process is developed. The method employs a Landau Zener model to obtain reaction probabilities at crossings between the entrance and exit PESs, and an adiabatic centrifugal sudden approximation to calculate CSs and k(T). Rates and BRs differ from those predicted from widely-used capture models. In particular, the rate coefficient at 10 K is estimated to be almost one order of magnitude smaller than what reported in the KIDA database. As for BRs, the charge exchange is completely dissociative and the most abundant fragments are HCCN+/CCNH+, HCNH+ and CH2+. Our results, combined with a revised chemical network for formation of CH3CN, support the hypothesis that methyl cyanide in protoplanetary disks could be mostly the product of gas-phase processes rather than grain chemistry, as currently proposed. These findings are expected to have implications in the comparison of the abundance ratios of N-bearing molecules observed in disks with cometary abundance ratios</description>

      <title>Secular aberration drift in stellar proper motions: An additional term due to the change in line-of-sight direction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The motion of the barycenter of the Solar System (SSB), the origin of the International Celestial Reference System, causes a directional displacement known as secular aberration. The secular aberration drift caused by the galactocentric acceleration of the SSB has been modeled in the third generation of the International Celestial Reference Frame. We aim to address another secular aberration drift effect due to the change in the line-of-sight direction and study its implications for stellar proper motions. A complete formula of secular aberration drift is derived, and its influence on stellar proper motion is computed based on the astrometric data in \textit{Gaia} Data Release 3. We found that the secular aberration drift due to the change in the line-of-sight direction tends to decrease the observed proper motions for stars with galactic longitudes between $0^{\circ}$ and $180^{\circ}$, and increase the observed proper motion for stars in the remaining region. If this secular aberration drift effect is ignored, it will induce an additional proper motion of $&gt;1\,\mathrm{mas\,yr^{-1}}$ for 84 stars and $&gt;0.02\,\mathrm{mas\,yr^{-1}}$ for 5\,944\,879 stars, which is comparable to or several times greater than the typical formal uncertainty of the \textit{Gaia} proper motion measurements at $G&lt;13$. The secular aberration drift due to the change in the line-of-sight direction and the acceleration of the SSB should be modeled to make the stellar reference frame consistent with the extragalactic reference frame.</description>

      <title>Primeval very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs -- VIII. The first age benchmark L subdwarf, a wide companion to a halo white dwarf</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery of five white dwarf + ultracool dwarf systems identified as common proper motion wide binaries in the Gaia Catalogue of Nearby Stars. The discoveries include a white dwarf + L subdwarf binary, VVV~1256-62AB, a gravitationally-bound system located 75.6(+1.9/-1.8) pc away with a projected separation of 1375(+35/-33) au. The primary is a cool DC white dwarf with a hydrogen dominated atmosphere, and has a total age of 10.5(+3.3/-2.1) Gyr, based on white dwarf model fitting. The secondary is an L subdwarf with a metallicity of [M/H] = -0.72(+0.08/-0.10) (i.e. [Fe/H] = -0.81\pm0.10) and Teff = 2298(+45/-43) K based on atmospheric model fitting of its optical to near infrared spectrum, and likely has a mass just above the stellar/substellar boundary. The subsolar metallicity of the L subdwarf and the system's total space velocity of 406 km/s indicates membership in the Galactic halo, and it has a flat eccentric Galactic orbit passing within 1~kpc of the centre of the Milky Way every ~0.4 Gyr and extending to 15-31 kpc at apogal. VVV 1256-62B is the first L subdwarf to have a well-constrained age, making it an ideal benchmark of metal-poor ultracool dwarf atmospheres and evolution.</description>

      <title>FAUST. XVIII. Evidence for annular substructure in a very young Class 0 disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When the planet formation process begins in the disks surrounding young stars is still an open question. Annular substructures such as rings and gaps in disks are intertwined with planet formation, and thus their presence or absence is commonly used to investigate the onset of this process. Current observations show a limited number of disks surrounding protostars exhibiting annular substructures, all of them in the Class I stage. The lack of observed features in most of these sources may indicate a late emergence of substructures, but it could also be an artifact of these disks being optically thick. To mitigate the problem of optical depth, we investigate substructures within a very young Class 0 disk characterized by a low inclination using observations at longer wavelengths. We use 3 mm ALMA observations tracing dust emission at a resolution of 7 au to search for evidence of annular substructures in the disk around the deeply embedded Class 0 protostar Oph A SM1. The observations reveal a nearly face-on disk (i$\sim$16$^{\circ}$) extending up to 40 au. The radial intensity profile shows a clear deviation from a smooth profile near 30 au, which we interpret as the presence of either a gap at 28 au or a ring at 34 au with Gaussian widths of $\sigma=1.4^{+2.3}_{-1.2}$ au and $\sigma=3.9^{+2.0}_{-1.9}$ au, respectively. The 3 mm emission at the location of the possible gap or ring is determined to be optically thin, precluding the possibility that this feature in the intensity profile is due to the emission being optically thick. Annular substructures resembling those in the more evolved Class I and II disks could indeed be present in the Class 0 stage, earlier than previous observations suggested. Similar observations of embedded disks in which the high optical depth problem can be mitigated are clearly needed to better constrain the onset of substructures in the embedded stages.</description>

      <title>Formation of Galactic Disks II: the Physical Drivers of Disk Spin-up</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using a representative sample of Milky Way (MW)-like galaxies from the TNG50 cosmological simulation, we investigate physical processes driving the formation of galactic disks. A disk forms as a result of the interplay between inflow and outflow carrying angular momentum in and out of the galaxy. Interestingly, the inflow and outflow have remarkably similar distributions of angular momentum, suggesting an exchange of angular momentum and/or outflow recycling, leading to continuous feeding of prealigned material from the corotating circumgalactic medium. We show that the disk formation in TNG50 is correlated with stellar bulge formation, in qualitative agreement with a recent theoretical model of disk formation facilitated by steep gravitational potentials. Disk formation is also correlated with the formation of a hot circumgalactic halo with around half of the inflow occurring at subsonic and transonic velocities corresponding to Mach numbers of $\lesssim2$. In the context of recent theoretical works connecting disk settling and hot halo formation, our results imply that the subsonic part of the inflow may settle into a disk while the remaining supersonic inflow will perturb this disk via the chaotic cold accretion. We find that disks tend to form when the host halos become more massive than $\sim (1-2) \times 10^{11} M_\odot$, consistent with previous theoretical findings and observational estimates of the predisk protogalaxy remnant in the MW. Our results do not prove that either corotating outflow recycling, gravitational potential steepening, or hot halo formation cause disk formation, but they show that all these processes occur concurrently and may play an important role in disk growth.</description>

      <title>Signatures of gas flows-I: Connecting the kinematics of the HI circumgalactic medium to galaxy rotation</title>

Abstract: The CGM hosts many physical processes with different kinematic signatures that affect galaxy evolution. We address the CGM-galaxy kinematic connection by quantifying the fraction of HI that is aligned with galaxy rotation with the equivalent width co-rotation fraction, $f_{\rm EWcorot}$. Using 70 quasar sightlines having HST/COS HI absorption (${12&lt;\log (N(HI)/{\rm cm}^{-2})&lt;20}$) within $5R_{\rm vir}$ of $z&lt;0.6$ galaxies we find that $f_{\rm EWcorot}$ increases with increasing HI column density. $f_{\rm EWcorot}$ is flat at $\sim0.6$ within $R_{\rm vir}$ and decreases beyond $R_{\rm vir}$ to $f_{\rm EWcorot}$$\sim0.35$. $f_{\rm EWcorot}$ also has a flat distribution with azimuthal and inclination angles within $R_{\rm vir}$, but decreases by a factor of two outside of $R_{\rm vir}$ for minor axis gas and by a factor of two for edge-on galaxies. Inside $R_{\rm vir}$, co-rotation dominated HI is located within $\sim 20$ deg of the major and minor axes. We surprisingly find equal amounts of HI absorption consistent with co-rotation along both major and minor axes within $R_{\rm vir}$. However, this co-rotation disappears along the minor axis beyond $R_{\rm vir}$, suggesting that if this gas is from outflows, then it is bound to galaxies. $f_{\rm EWcorot}$ is constant over two decades of halo mass, with no decrease for log(M$_{\rm h}/M_{\odot})&gt;12$ as expected from simulations. Our results suggest that co-rotating gas flows are best found by searching for higher column density gas within $R_{\rm vir}$ and near the major and minor axes.</description>

Abstract: Context. Star clusters constitute a significant part of the stellar population in our Galaxy. The feedback processes they exert on the interstellar medium impact multiple physical processes from the chemical to the dynamical evolution of the Galaxy. In addition, young and massive stellar clusters might act as efficient particle accelerators and contribute to the production of cosmic rays. Aims. We aim at evaluating the wind luminosity driven by the young (&lt; 30 Myr) Galactic open stellar clusters observed by the Gaia space mission. This is crucial for determining the energy channeled into accelerated particles. Methods. To do this, we developed a method relying on the number, magnitude, and line-of-sight extinction of the stars observed per cluster. Assuming that the stellar mass function follows a Kroupa mass distribution and accounting for the maximum stellar mass allowed by the age and mass of the parent cluster, we conservatively estimated the mass and wind luminosity of 387 local clusters within the second data release of Gaia. Results. We compared the results of our computation with recent estimates of young cluster masses. With respect to these, our sample is three times more abundant, particularly above a few thousand solar masses. This is of the utmost relevance for predicting the gamma-ray emission resulting from the interaction of accelerated particles. The cluster wind luminosity distribution we obtained extends up to 3x10^38 erg/s. This is a promising feature in terms of potential particle acceleration scenarios.</description>

Abstract: We present results from our deep Far-ultraviolet (FUV) survey using {\em AstroSat}/UVIT of a filamentary structure at $z$ $\sim$ $0.072$. A total of four filaments comprising 58 galaxies were probed in our study. We detect 18 filament galaxies in our FUV observation. All filament galaxies are further classified based on their photometric color, nuclear activity, and morphology. The filaments contain galaxies with mixed stellar population types and structures. We do not detect galaxies in our UVIT survey up to a distance of 0.4~Mpc $h^{-1}$ from the filament axis, implying a lack of recent star formation in the inner region of filaments. The FUV star formation rate (SFR) for star-forming galaxies agrees well with the SFR$_{\rm 144 MHz}$ calculated using Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) radio-continuum observations. We witness an increase in FUV specific-SFR (sSFR) of filament galaxies with increasing distance from the filament spine (D$_{\rm fil}$). The intermediate-to-high stellar mass filament galaxies were more star-forming than cluster galaxies in a fixed stellar mass bin. The FUV morphology of some filament galaxies detected in the filament outskirts (D$_{\rm fil}$ $\gtrsim$ 0.7~Mpc $h^{-1}$) is comparable to or slightly extended than their optical counterpart. The mass assembly of galaxies examined by estimating $(FUV-r)$ color gradients show that more `red-cored' galaxies reside in the outer region of the filaments. Our results prove that the likelihood of merger interaction and gas starvation increases when approaching the filament spine. We report a definitive and in-homogeneous impact of filaments on the galaxies residing inside them.</description>

      <title>Timing the Milky Way bar formation and the accompanying radial migration episode</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the metallicity profile of the Milky Way low-$\alpha$ disc population from 2 to 20 kpc from the Galactic centre in 1 Gyr age bins using the astroNN catalogue, and show that it is highly structured, with a plateau between 4 and 7 kpc and a break at 10-12 kpc. We argue that these features result from the two main bar resonances, the corotation and the Outer Lindblad Resonance (OLR), respectively. We show that the break in the metallicity profile is most visible in stars having 7-8 Gyr, reaching an amplitude of about 0.4 dex, and is the signpost of the position of the bar OLR. The bar formation was accompanied by an episode of radial migration triggered by its slowing down and is responsible for spreading old metal-rich stars up to the OLR. The data show that the slowdown of the bar ended 6-7 Gyr ago. Based on numerical simulations that reproduce well the break observed in the metallicity profile, we argue that this implies that the bar formed in our Galaxy 8-10 Gyr ago. Analysis of the metallicity distribution as a function of radius shows no evidence of significant systematic outward radial migration after this first episode. We argue that the variation of the metallicity dispersion as a function of the guiding radius is dominated by the migration triggered by the bar, but also that the libration of orbits around the bar resonances induces a mixing that may have a significant impact on the observed metallicity dispersion. In contrast, the absence of a break in the metallicity profile of populations younger than about $\sim$6 Gyr and the flattening of the gradient at younger ages is interpreted as evidence that the strength of the bar has decreased, loosening its barrier effect and allowing the gas and metals on both sides of the OLR to mix, erasing the break. Beyond the OLR, stars younger than 7 Gyr show very small metallicity dispersion, suggesting no or limited migration.</description>

      <title>Modelling the star-formation activity and ionizing properties of high-redshift galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02879v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Early results from the JWST observations have reported a surprisingly high number of UV-bright galaxies at $z \geq 10$, which appears to challenge the theoretical predictions from standard galaxy formation models in the $\Lambda$CDM framework at these redshifts. To alleviate this tension, several cosmological and astrophysical interpretations have been advanced. However, all of these proposed scenarios carry noteworthy consequences for other large-scale processes in the early Universe, particularly cosmic reionization, since high-redshift galaxies are believed to be the primary ionizing sources during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). To investigate this, we introduce a semi-analytical model of galaxy formation and evolution that explains the evolving galaxy UV luminosity function (UVLF) over $6 \lesssim z \lesssim 15$, and also jointly tracks the time evolution of the globally averaged neutral hydrogen fraction in the intergalactic medium. The model self-consistently accounts for the suppression of star formation in low-mass galaxies due to reionization feedback and is constrained by comparing the model predictions with various observational probes like the UVLF data from HST and JWST, recent measurements of the neutral hydrogen fraction, and the CMB scattering optical depth. Our analysis confirms that a rapid enhancement in the star-formation rate efficiency and/or UV luminosity per stellar mass formed is necessary for consistency with the JWST UVLF estimates at $z \geq 10$. We further find that it is possible to jointly satisfy the current reionization constraints when the escape fraction is assumed to be halo-mass dependent, requiring higher Lyman-continuum leakage from low-mass galaxies. We also examine the relative contribution of galaxies with different UV luminosities towards the ionizing photon budget for the EoR and investigate the large-scale bias of high-$z$ galaxies.</description>

Abstract: $\omega$ Centauri, the most massive globular cluster in the Milky Way, has long been suspected to be the stripped nucleus of a dwarf galaxy that fell into the Galaxy a long time ago. There is considerable evidence for this scenario including a large spread in metallicity and an unusually large number of distinct sub-populations seen in photometric studies. In this work, we use new MUSE spectroscopic and HST photometric catalogs to investigate the underlying metallicity distributions as well as the spatial variations of the populations within the cluster up to its half-light radius. Based on 11,050 member stars, the [M/H] distribution has a median of $ (-1.614 \pm 0.003)$ dex and a large spread of $\sim$ 1.37 dex reaching from $ -0.67$ dex to $ -2.04$ dex for 99.7 % of the stars. In addition, we show the chromosome map of the cluster, which separates the red giant branch stars into different sub-populations, and analyze the sub-populations of the metal-poorest component. Finally, we do not find any metallicity gradient within the half-light radius, and the different sub-populations are well mixed.</description>

      <title>Wide-binary eccentricity distribution in young star clusters: dependence on the binary separation and mass</title>

Abstract: We study the wide-binary eccentricity ($e$) distribution in young star clusters and the role of turbulence in setting the form of the $e$ distribution using magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations of star cluster formation. The simulations incorporate gravity, turbulence, magnetic fields, protostellar heating, and jets/outflows. We find that (1) simulations that employ purely compressive turbulence driving produce binaries with a superthermal $e$ distribution ($\alpha&gt;1$ in $p(e) \propto e^\alpha$), while simulations with purely solenoidal driving or natural mixture of driving modes produce subthermal/thermal distributions ($\alpha \leq$ 1), (2) the $e$ distribution over the full range of binary separations in our simulations is set at the early stages of the star cluster formation process, (3) while binaries (separation of $r_{\mathrm{pair}} \leq 1000\, \mathrm{AU}$) have subthermal to thermal $e$ distributions ($\alpha \sim 0.8$), wide binaries ($r_{\mathrm{pair}} &gt; 1000\, \mathrm{AU}$) have a superthermal distribution ($\alpha \sim 1.8$), and (4) low-mass binary systems (system masses of $M_{\mathrm{sys}} \leq 0.8\, \mathrm{M_\odot}$) have a highly superthermal distribution ($\alpha \sim 2.4$), whereas high-mass systems ($M_{\mathrm{sys}} &gt; 0.8\, \mathrm{M_\odot}$) exhibit a subthermal/thermal distribution ($\alpha \sim 0.8$). The binary eccentricity distribution is often modelled as a thermal distribution. However, our results suggest that the $e$ distribution depends on the range of separation of the sampled binaries, which agrees with the findings from recent Gaia observations. We conclude that the dependence of the $e$ distribution on the binary separation and mass is linked to the binary formation mechanism governed by the turbulent properties of the parent cloud.</description>

      <title>AstroSat/UVIT Study of the Diffuse Ultraviolet Radiation in the Dwarf Galaxy Holmberg II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present measurements of diffuse ultraviolet emission in the dwarf irregular galaxy Holmberg II obtained with the UltraViolet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) onboard AstroSat. With a spatial resolution of 1.2 to 1.6 arcsec, these are the highest resolution UV observations of the galaxy to date. We find that diffuse emission accounts for 70.6 % (58.1 %) of the total FUV(NUV) emission, respectively. We perform a UV-IR correlation study of the diffuse emission in this galaxy using infrared observations from Spitzer Space Telescope and Herschel Space Observatory for selected locations, free of detectable bright point sources. The strongest positive correlation between FUV and IR is observed at 70 micron for high HI density locations, indicating that warm dust grains dominate the IR emission, in agreement with earlier studies, while NUV is better correlated with 160 micron emission associated with cold dust grains. Low HI density regions or cavities, do not show any significant UV-IR correlation except at 160 micron, implying either the presence of colder dust grains in cavities, being irradiated by the general radiation field, or insufficient amount of dust. The dust scattering contribution in high HI density regions, estimated using a single scattering model with foreground dust clouds with LMC reddening, gives best-fit albedo and asymmetry factor values of 0.2 and 0.5, respectively, in reasonable agreement with the theoretical predictions for LMC dust. Our model derived scattering optical depths in the FUV range from 0.02 to 0.12, implying the medium is optically thin. Therefore, in high HI density regions, dust scattering can be one the sources of the observed diffuse UV emission, apart from possible contributions from molecular hydrogen fluorescence, However, the diffuse UV component in HI cavities can only be explained via other mechanisms, such as two photon emission.</description>

      <title>Galactic Halos and rotating bosonic dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rotating bosonic dark matter halos are considered as potential candidates for modeling dark matter in galactic halos. These bosonic dark matter halos can be viewed as a dilute and very extended version of bosonic stars, and the methods used for the calculation and analysis of the latter objects can be directly applied. Bosonic stars, a hypothetical type of astrophysical objects, are categorized into two primary families, based on the nature of the particles composing them: Einstein-Klein-Gordon stars and Proca stars. We examine various models from both families and the rotation curves which their contribution induces in different galaxies, to identify the most plausible candidates that explain the flattening of orbital velocities observed in galactic halos. By exploring different combinations of our dark matter models with observable galactic features, we propose an interesting source to compensate for the apparent lack of matter in dwarf and spiral galaxies, providing a possible explanation for this longstanding astronomical puzzle.</description>

      <title>Surveying the onset and evolution of supermassive black holes at high-z with AXIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07669v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nature and origin of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) remain an open matter of debate within the scientific community. While various theoretical scenarios have been proposed, each with specific observational signatures, the lack of sufficiently sensitive X-ray observations hinders the progress of observational tests. In this white paper, we present how AXIS will contribute to solving this issue. With an angular resolution of 1.5$^{\prime\prime}$ on-axis and minimal off-axis degradation, we have designed a deep survey capable of reaching flux limits in the [0.5-2] keV range of approximately 2$\times$10$^{-18}$ \fcgs~ over an area of 0.13 deg$^2$ in approximately 7 million seconds (7 Ms). Furthermore, we have planned an intermediate depth survey covering approximately 2 deg$^2$ and reaching flux limits of about 2$\times$10$^{-17}$ \fcgs ~ in order to detect a significant number of SMBHs with X-ray luminosities (L$_X$) of approximately 10$^{42}$ \lx up to z$\sim$10. These observations will enable AXIS to detect SMBHs with masses smaller than 10$^5$ \ms, assuming Eddington-limited accretion and a typical bolometric correction for Type II AGN. AXIS will provide valuable information on the seeding and population synthesis models of SMBH, allowing for more accurate constraints on their initial mass function (IMF) and accretion history from z$\sim$0-10. To accomplish this, AXIS will leverage the unique synergy of survey telescopes such as JWST, Roman, Euclid, LSST, and the new generation of 30m class telescopes. These instruments will provide optical identification and redshift measurements, while AXIS will discover the smoking gun of nuclear activity, particularly in the case of highly obscured AGN or peculiar UV spectra as predicted and recently observed in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Cosmology from one galaxy in a void?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding galaxy properties may be the key to unlocking some of the most intriguing mysteries of modern cosmology. Recent work relied on machine learning to extract cosmological constraints on $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ using only one galaxy. But if this is true, how should we select the galaxy to use for cosmology inference? In this paper, we consider selecting a galaxy that lies in cosmic voids, the underdense regions of the cosmic web, and compare the constraints obtained with the ones obtained when randomly selecting a galaxy in the whole sample. We use the IllustrisTNG galaxy catalog from the CAMELS project and the VIDE void finder to identify galaxies inside voids. We show that void galaxies provide stronger constraints on $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ compared to randomly selected galaxies. This result suggests that the distinctive characteristics of void galaxies may provide a cleaner and more effective environment for extracting cosmological information.</description>

      <title>The unluckiest star: A spectroscopically confirmed repeated partial tidal disruption event AT 2022dbl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10895v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The unluckiest star orbits a supermassive black hole elliptically. Every time it reaches the pericenter, it shallowly enters the tidal radius and gets partially tidal disrupted, producing a series of flares. Confirmation of a repeated partial tidal disruption event (pTDE) requires not only evidence to rule out other types of transients, but also proof that only one star is involved, as TDEs from multiple stars can also produce similar flares. In this letter, we report the discovery of a repeated pTDE, AT 2022dbl. In a quiescent galaxy at $z=0.0284$, two separate optical/UV flares have been observed in 2022 and 2024, with no bright X-ray, radio or mid-infrared counterparts. Compared to the first flare, the second flare has a similar blackbody temperature of ~26,000 K, slightly lower peak luminosity, and slower rise and fall phases. Compared to the ZTF TDEs, their blackbody parameters and light curve shapes are all similar. The spectra taken during the second flare show a steeper continuum than the late-time spectra of the previous flare, consistent with a newly risen flare. More importantly, the possibility of two independent TDEs can be largely ruled out because the optical spectra taken around the peak of the two flares exhibit highly similar broad Balmer, N III and possible He II emission lines, especially the extreme ~4100{\AA} emission lines. This represents the first robust spectroscopic evidence for a repeated pTDE, which can soon be verified by observing the third flare, given its short orbital period.</description>

      <title>Diamond phase in space and the possibility of its spectroscopic detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17584v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The eventual presence of the diamond carbon allotrope in space is discussed in numerous theoretical and experimental studies. The review summarizes the principal mechanisms of nanodiamond formation and experimental results of spectroscopic and structural investigations of nano- and microdiamonds from meteorites. The size dependence of diamond spectroscopic properties is discussed. Infrared spectroscopy allows detection of C-H bonds on surfaces of hot nanodiamond grains. Spectroscopic observation of nitrogen-related point defects in nanodiamonds is very challenging; moreover, such defects have never been observed in nanodiamonds from meteorites. At the same time, photoluminescence and, eventually, absorption of some impurity-related defects, in particular, of the silicon-vacancy (SiV) center, observed in real meteoritic nanodiamonds opens the possibility of diamond detection in astronomical observations.</description>

      <title>Constraining Wind-Driven Accretion Onto Gaia BH3 With Chandra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaia BH3 is the most massive known stellar-origin black hole in the Milky Way, with a mass $M_\bullet \approx 33 \, \rm M_\odot$. Detected from Gaia's astrometry, this black hole is in the mass range of those observed via gravitational waves, whose nature is still highly debated. Hosted in a binary system with a companion giant star that is too far away for Roche-lobe mass transfer, this black hole could nonetheless accrete at low levels due to wind-driven mass-loss from its companion star, thus accreting in advection-dominated accretion flow, or ADAF, mode. Using stellar wind models, we constrain its Eddington ratio in the range $10^{-9} &lt; f_{\rm Edd} &lt; 10^{-7}$, corresponding to radiative efficiencies $5\times10^{-5} &lt; \epsilon &lt; 10^{-3}$, compatible with radiatively inefficient accretion modes. Chandra ACIS-S observed this object and obtained the most sensitive upper bound of its [2-10] keV flux: $F_X &lt; 3.25 \times 10^{-15} \, \rm erg \, s^{-1} \, cm^{-2}$ at $90\%$ confidence level corresponding to $L_{[2-10]}&lt; 2.10 \times 10^{29} \, \rm erg \, s^{-1}$. Using ADAF emission models, we constrained its accretion rate to $f_{\rm Edd}&lt; 4.91 \times 10^{-7}$ at the apastron, in agreement with our theoretical estimate. At the periastron, we expect fluxes $\sim 50$ times larger. Because of the inferred low rates, accretion did not significantly contribute to black hole growth over the system's lifetime. Detecting the electromagnetic emission from Gaia BH3 will be fundamental to informing stellar wind and accretion disk models.</description>
