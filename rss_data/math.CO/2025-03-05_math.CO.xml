      <title>Planar lattices and equilateral odd-gons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a planar integral lattice $L$, let $\nu(L)$ denote the square-free part of the integer $D(L)^2$, where $D(L)$ stands for the area of a fundamental parallelogram of $L$. For each odd integer $n$ with $3 \leq n&lt;29$, a planar lattice $L$ contains an equilateral $n$-gon if and only if $L$ is similar to an integral lattice $L'$ such that $\nu(L')\equiv 3 \pmod 4$ and the largest prime factor $p$ of $\nu(L')$ satisfies $p \leq n$. Moreover, such $L$ contains a convex equilateral $n$-gon, which answers a problem posed by Maehara.</description>

      <title>Arithmetical Structures On Fan Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the arithmetical structures on Fan Graphs Fn. Let G be a finite and connected graph. An arithmetical structure on G is a pair (d, r) of positive integer vectors such that r is primitive (the greatest common divisor of its coefficients is 1) and (diag(d)-A)r = 0, where A represents the adjacency matrix of G. This work explores the combinatorial properties of the arithmetical structures associated with Fn. Further, we discuss the arrow-star graph, a structure derived from the fan graph, along with its properties. Additionally, we investigate the critical group linked to each such structure on Fn.</description>

      <title>The structures of simple Hurwitz numbers and monotone Hurwitz numbers with varying genus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the structures of ordinary simple Hurwitz numbers and monotone Hurwitz numbers with varying genus. More precisely, we prove that when the ramification type is fixed and the genus is treated as a variable, the connected monotone Hurwitz number is a linear combination of products of exponentials and polynomials, and the ordinary simple Hurwitz number is a linear combination of exponentials. Using these structural properties, we also derive the large genus asymptotics of these two kinds of Hurwitz numbers. As a result, we prove one conjecture, and disprove another, both proposed by Do, He and Robertson.</description>

      <title>A formula for the number of alternating words</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A word $w_1w_2\cdots w_n$ is said to be alternating if either $w_1 &gt;w_2 &lt;w_3 \cdots$ or $w_1 &lt;w_2 &gt;w_3 \cdots$. In this work we find the generating function of the number of alternating words over an alphabet of size $k$ and deduce a closed-form formula for them.</description>

      <title>A remark on the independence number of sparse random Cayley sum graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cayley sum graph $\Gamma_S$ of a set $S \subseteq \mathbb{Z}_n$ is defined on the vertex set $\mathbb{Z}_n$, with an edge between distinct $x, y \in \mathbb{Z}_n$ if $x + y \in S$. Campos, Dahia, and Marciano have recently shown that if $S$ is formed by taking each element in $\mathbb{Z}_n$ independently with probability $p$, for $p &gt; (\log n)^{-1/80}$, then with high probability the largest independent set in $\Gamma_S$ is of size $$
  (2 + o(1)) \log_{1/(1-p)}(n). $$ This extends a result of Green and Morris, who considered the case $p = 1/2$, and asymptotically matches the independence number of the binomial random graph $G(n,p)$. We improve the range of $p$ for which this holds to $p &gt; (\log n)^{-1/3 + o(1)}$. The heavy lifting has been done by Campos, Dahia, and Marciano, and we show that their key lemma can be used a bit more efficiently.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of the q-deformed real projective line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize in two steps the quantized action of the modular group on $q$-deformed real numbers introduced by Morier-Genoud and Ovsienko. First, we let the projective general linear group $PGL_2(\mathbb{Z})$ act on $q$-real numbers via a $q$-deformed action. The quantized matrices we get have combinatorial interpretations. Then we consider an extension of the group $PGL_2(\mathbb{Z})$ by the $2$-elements cyclic group, and define a quantized action of this extension on $q$-real numbers. We deduce from these actions some underlying relations between $q$-real numbers, and between left and right versions of $q$-deformed rational numbers. In particular we investigate the case of some algebraic numbers of degree $4$ and $6$. We also prove that the way of quantizing real numbers defined by Morier-Genoud and Ovsienko is an injective process.</description>

Abstract: This paper characterises the structure of every maximal weak or strong Gallai-Schur partition.
  The results confirm the exact values of Gallai-Schur numbers provided by Budden (2020) in the strong case, and provide corresponding values for weak Gallai-Schur numbers. The proofs are elementary and standalone.</description>

      <title>On graphs coverable by chubby shortest paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dumas, Foucaud, Perez, and Todinca [SIAM J. Disc. Math., 2024] proved that if the vertex set of a graph $G$ can be covered by $k$ shortest paths, then the pathwidth of $G$ is bounded by $\mathcal{O}(k \cdot 3^k)$.
  We prove a coarse variant of this theorem: if in a graph $G$ one can find~$k$ shortest paths such that every vertex is at distance at most $\rho$ from one of them, then $G$ is $(3,12\rho)$-quasi-isometric to a graph of pathwidth $k^{\mathcal{O}(k)}$ and maximum degree $\mathcal{O}(k)$, and $G$ admits a path-partition-decomposition whose bags are coverable by $k^{\mathcal{O}(k)}$ balls of radius at most $2\rho$ and vertices from non-adjacent bags are at distance larger than $2\rho$.
  We also discuss applications of such decompositions in the context of algorithms for finding maximum distance independent sets and minimum distance dominating sets in graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: M. Kapranov and V. Schechtman introduced the contingency metamatrix for a finite Coxeter group and conjectured that the contingency metamatrix is totally positive. For the Coxeter groups of type $A$, this conjecture has been proved by P. Etingof. In this article, we prove this conjecture for the Coxeter groups of type $B$ and exceptional types.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a program for enumerating all pseudoline arrangements with a small number of pseudolines and abstract order types of small point sets. This program supports computer experiments with these structures, and it complements the order-type database of Aichholzer, Aurenhammer, and Krasser. This system makes it practical to explore the abstract order types for 12 points, and the pseudoline arrangements of 11 pseudolines.</description>

      <title>On the $Q$-polynomial property of bipartite graphs admitting a uniform structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ denote a finite, connected graph with vertex set $X$. Fix $x \in X$ and let $\varepsilon \ge 3$ denote the eccentricity of $x$. For mutually distinct scalars $\{\theta^*_i\}_{i=0}^\varepsilon$ define a diagonal matrix $A^*=A^*(\theta^*_0, \theta^*_1, \ldots, \theta^*_{\varepsilon}) \in M_X(\mathbb{R})$ as follows: for $y \in X$ we let $(A^*)_{yy} = \theta^*_{\partial(x,y)}$, where $\partial$ denotes the shortest path length distance function of $\Gamma$. We say that $A^*$ is a dual adjacency matrix candidate of $\Gamma$ with respect to $x$ if the adjacency matrix $A \in M_X(\mathbb{R})$ of $\Gamma$ and $A^*$ satisfy
  $$
  A^3 A^* - A^* A^3+(\beta+1)( A A^* A^2 - A^2 A^* A)= \gamma(A^2A^*-A^*A^2)+\rho( A A^* - A^* A)
  $$
  for some scalars $\beta, \gamma, \rho\in \mathbb{R}$.
  Assume now that $\Gamma$ is uniform with respect to $x$ in the sense of Terwilliger [Coding theory and design theory, Part I, IMA Vol. Math. Appl., 20, 193-212 (1990)]. In this paper, we give sufficient conditions on the uniform structure of $\Gamma$, such that $\Gamma$ admits a dual adjacency matrix candidate with respect to $x$. As an application of our results, we show that the full bipartite graphs of dual polar graphs are $Q$-polynomial.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue bounds for the quantum chromatic number of graph powers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum chromatic number, a generalization of the chromatic number, was first defined in relation to the non-local quantum coloring game. We generalize the former by defining the quantum $k$-distance chromatic number $\chi_{kq}(G)$ of a graph $G$, which can be seen as the quantum chromatic number of the $k$-th power graph, $G^k$, and as generalization of the classical $k$-distance chromatic number $\chi_k(G)$ of a graph. It can easily be shown that $\chi_{kq}(G) \leq \chi_k(G)$. In this paper, we strengthen three classical eigenvalue bounds for the $k$-distance chromatic number by showing they also hold for the quantum counterpart of this parameter. This shows that several bounds by Elphick et al. [J. Combinatorial Theory Ser. A 168, 2019, Electron. J. Comb. 27(4), 2020] hold in the more general setting of distance-$k$ colorings. As a consequence we obtain several graph classes for which $\chi_{kq}(G)=\chi_{k}(G)$, thus increasing the number of graphs for which the quantum parameter is known.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Objective Portfolio of Portfolios Problem with Qualitative Performance Assessments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a multi-objective portfolio decision model that involves selecting both a portfolio of projects and a set of elements to allocate to each project. Our model includes a defined set of objectives to optimize, with projects contributing to these objectives in various ways. The elements included in the portfolios are assessed based on both qualitative and quantitative criteria. Projects can only be selected for the portfolio if they meet specific requirements defined by threshold values on the criteria. The model is adaptable to include temporal considerations and stochastic, making it suitable for a wide range of real-life applications. To manage the decision-making process, we employ an interactive multi-objective method that integrates the selection of both portfolios and elements. After making initial selections, we ask the decision-maker to evaluate the portfolios, from which we derive a series of rules to be incorporated into the multiobjective model until the decision-maker is satisfied. We illustrate the functionality of our model through an illustrative case study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An $\mathbb{F}_q$-linear code of minimum distance $d$ is called complete if it is not contained in a larger $\mathbb{F}_q$-linear code of minimum distance $d$. In this paper, we classify $\mathbb{F}_q$-linear complete symmetric rank-distance (CSRD) codes in $M_{3\times 3}(\mathbb{F}_q)$ up to equivalence. This includes the classification of $\mathbb{F}_q$-linear maximum symmetric rank-distance (MSRD) codes in $M_{3\times 3}(\mathbb{F}_q)$. Our approach is mainly geometric, and our results contribute towards the classification of nets of conics in $\mathrm{PG}(2, q)$.</description>

      <title>Equivalence Classes Induced by Binary Tree Isomorphism -- Generating Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Working with generating functions, the combinatorics of a recurrence relation can be expressed in a way that allows for more efficient calculation of the quantity. This is true of the Catalan numbers for an ordered binary tree \cite{abboud2018subtree}. Binary tree isomorphism is an important problem in computer science. The enumeration of the number of non-isomorphic rooted binary trees is therefore well known. The paper reiterates the known results for ordered binary trees and presents previous results for the enumeration of non-isomorphic rooted binary trees. Then, new enumeration results are put forward for two-colour binary tree isomorphism parametrized by the number of nodes, the number of specific colours and the number of non-isomorphic sibling subtrees. Multi-variate generating function equations are presented that enumerate these tree structures. The generating functions with these parametrizations separate multiplicatively into simplified generating function equations.</description>

      <title>The subpath number of cactus graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The subpath number of a graph G is defined as the total number of subpaths in G, and it is closely related to the number of subtrees, a well-studied topic in graph theory. This paper is a continuation of our previous paper [5], where we investigated the subpath number and identified extremal graphs within the classes of trees, unicyclic graphs, bipartite graphs, and cycle chains. Here, we focus on the subpath number of cactus graphs and characterize all maximal and minimal cacti with n vertices and k cycles. We prove that maximal cacti are cycle chains in which all interior cycles are triangles, while the two end-cycles differ in length by at most one. In contrast, minimal cacti consist of k triangles, all sharing a common vertex, with the remaining vertices forming a tree attached to this joint vertex. By comparing extremal cacti with respect to the subpath number to those that are extremal for the subtree number and the Wiener index, we demonstrate that the subpath number does not correlate with either of these quantities, as their corresponding extremal graphs differ.</description>

Abstract: The Terwilliger algebras of association schemes over an arbitrary field $\mathbb{F}$ were briefly called the Terwilliger $\mathbb{F}$-algebras of association schemes in [9]. In this paper, the Terwilliger $\mathbb{F}$-algebras of direct products of group divisible association schemes are studied. The centers, the semisimplicity, the Jacobson radicals and their nilpotent indices, the Wedderburn-Artin decompositions of the Terwilliger $\mathbb{F}$-algebras of direct products of group divisible association schemes are obtained.</description>

      <title>New centrality measure: ksi-centrality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce new centrality measures called ksi-centrality and normalized ksi-centrality which defined the importance of vertex up to importance of its neighbors. First, we show that normalized ksi-centrality can be rewritten in terms of Laplacian matrix such that its expression will be similar to local clustering coefficient. After that we introduce average normalized ksi-coefficient and show that for random Erdos-Renyi graph it is almost the same as average clustering coefficient. Also, it shows similar behavior to clustering coefficient for Windmill and Wheel graphs. In the end, we show that distributions of ksi-centrality and normalized ksi-centrality differentiate networks based on real data from the artificial networks including small-world networks Watts-Strogatz and Barabasi-Albert. In addition we show the connection between normalized ksi-centrality and average normalized ksi-coefficient and algebraic connectivity of a graph.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces and studies the Ehrhart spectrum of a set $E \subseteq \mathbb{Z}^r$, defined as the set of all Ehrhart polynomials of simplices with vertices in $E$, generalizing the notion of volume spectrum. We show that for any $E \subseteq \mathbb{Z}^r$ with positive upper Banach density, there is some $n \in \mathbb{Z}^r$ such that the Ehrhart spectrum of $n \mathbb{Z}^r$ is contained in the Ehrhart spectrum of $E$, generalizing an earlier result by the first and third author for the volume spectrum of $E$.</description>

Abstract: An arrangement of hypersurfaces in projective space is SNC if and only if its Euler discriminant is nonzero. We study the critical loci of all Laurent monomials in the equations of the smooth hypersurfaces. These loci form an irreducible variety in the product of two projective spaces, known in algebraic statistics as the likelihood correspondence and in particle physics as the scattering correspondence. We establish an explicit determinantal representation for the bihomogeneous prime ideal of this variety.</description>

      <title>Random sampling of partitions and contingency tables: Two practical examples of the Burnside process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Burnside process is a general algorithm for sampling a uniformly chosen orbit of a finite group $G$ acting on a finite set $\mathcal{X}$. For example, if $\mathcal{X} = G$ and $G$ acts on itself by conjugation ($s^t = t^{-1}st$), then the orbits are conjugacy classes. When $G$ is the symmetric group $S_n$, the conjugacy classes are indexed by partitions of $n$, so the Burnside process gives a way to sample partitions. If $\mathcal{X}=S_n$ and $G$ is a product of symmetric groups, then the orbits are labeled by contingency tables: non-negative integer arrays with given row and column sums. Actually carrying out the Burnside process requires new combinatorics and group theory. This is worked out and illustrated for these two examples. For partitions, we also developed a new Markov chain called the reflected Burnside process which greatly improves the mixing of the Burnside process.</description>

      <title>Statistics for random representations of Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate how a typical, large-dimensional representation looks for a complex Lie algebra. In particular, we study the family $\mathfrak{sl}_{r+1}(\mathbb{C})$ of Lie algebras for $r \geq 2$ and derive asymptotic probability distributions for the multiplicity of small irreducible representations, as well as the largest dimension, the largest height, and the total number of irreducible representations appearing in the decomposition of a representation sampled uniformly from all representations with the same dimension. This provides a natural generalization to the similar statistical studies of integer partitions, which forms the case $r=1$ of our considerations and where one has a rich toolkit ranging from combinatorial methods to approaches utilizing the theory of modular forms. We perform our analysis by extending the statistical mechanics inspired approaches in the case of partitions to the infinite family here.</description>

Abstract: A $2$-distance $k$-coloring of a graph is a proper vertex $k$-coloring where vertices at distance at most 2 cannot share the same color. We prove the existence of a $2$-distance $4$-coloring for planar subcubic graphs with girth at least 21. We also show a construction of a planar subcubic graph of girth 11 that is not $2$-distance $4$-colorable.</description>

Abstract: We present a generalization of Descartes' theorem for the family of polytopal sphere packings arising from uniform polytopes. The corresponding quadratic equation is expressed in terms of geometric invariants of uniform polytopes which are closely connected to canonical realizations of edge-scribable polytopes. We use our generalization to construct integral Apollonian packings based on the Platonic solids. Additionally, we also introduce and discuss a new spectral invariant for edge-scribable polytopes.</description>

      <title>The cycle double cover conjecture from the perspective of percolation theory on iterated line graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06649v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cycle double cover conjecture is a long standing problem in graph theory, which links local properties, the valency of a vertex and no bridges, and a global property of the graph, being covered by a particular set of cycles. We prove the conjecture using a lift of walks and cycles in $G$ to sets of open and closed edges on $\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{L}(G))$, the line graph of the line graph of $G$. We exploit that triangles are preserved by the line graph operator to obtain a one-to-one mapping from walks in the underlying graph $G$ to walks on $\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{L}(G))$. We prove that each set of "double walk covers" in $G$ induces a certain set of $\lbrace 0,1\rbrace$ labels on a subgraph covering of $\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{L}(G))$, minus a set of triangles, and conversely, that there is such a set of labels such that its projection back to $G$ implies a double cycle cover, if $G$ is an simple bridgeless triangle-free cubic graph. The techniques applied are inspired by percolation theory, flipping the $\lbrace 0,1\rbrace$ labels to obtain the desired structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.01482v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider classes of graphs, which we call thick graphs, that have the vertices of a corresponding thin graph replaced by cliques and the edges replaced by cobipartite graphs In particular, we consider the case of thick forests, which we show to be the largest class of perfect thick graphs.
  Recognising membership of a class of thick graphs is NP-complete unless the class of thin graphs is triangle-free, so we focus on this case. Even then membership can be NP-complete. However, we show that the class of thick forests can be recognised in polynomial time. We consider two well-studied combinatorial problems on thick graphs, independent sets and proper colourings. Since determining the independence or chromatic number of a perfect graph is known to be tractable, we examine the complexity of counting all independent sets and colourings in thick forests.
  Finally, we consider two parametric extensions to larger classes of thick graphs: where the parameter is the size of the thin graph, and where the parameter is its treewidth.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08832v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The {\em breadth} of a tangle $\mathcal{T}$ in a matroid is the size of the largest spanning uniform submatroid of the tangle matroid of $\mathcal{T}$. A matroid $M$ is {\em weakly $4$-connected} if it is 3-connected and whenever $(X,Y)$ is a partition of $E(M)$ with $|X|,|Y|&gt;4$, then $\lambda(X)\geq 3$. We prove that if $\mathcal{T}$ is a tangle of order $k\geq 4$ and breadth $l$ in a matroid $M$, then $M$ has a weakly 4-connected minor $N$ with a tangle $\mathcal{T}$ of order $k$, breadth $l$ and has the property that $\mathcal{T}$ is the tangle in $M$ induced by $\mathcal{T}_N$. A set $Z$ of elements of a matroid $M$ is $4$-{\em connected} if $\lambda(A)\geq\min\{|A\cap Z|,|Z-A|,3\}$ for all $A\subseteq E(M)$. As a corollary of our theorems on tangles we prove that if $M$ contains an $n$-element $4$-connected set where $n\geq 7$, then $M$ has a weakly $4$-connected minor that contains an $n$-element $4$-connected set.</description>

      <title>On maximum graphs in Tutte polynomial posets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Boesch, Li, and Suffel were the first to identify the existence of uniformly optimally reliable graphs (UOR graphs), graphs which maximize all-terminal reliability over all graphs with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. The all-terminal reliability of a graph, and more generally a graph's all-terminal reliability polynomial $R(G;p)$, may both be obtained via the Tutte polynomial $T(G;x,y)$ of the graph $G$. Here we show that the UOR graphs found earlier are in fact maximum graphs for the Tutte polynomial itself, in the sense that they are maximum not just for all-terminal reliability but for a vast array of other parameters and polynomials that may be obtained from $T(G;x,y)$ as well. These parameters include, but are not limited to, enumerations of a wide variety of well-known orientations, partial orientations, and fourientations of $G$; the magnitudes of the coefficients of the chromatic and flow polynomials of $G$; and a wide variety of generating functions, such as generating functions enumerating spanning forests and spanning connected subgraphs of $G$. The maximality of all of these parameters is done in a unified way through the use of $(n,m)$ Tutte polynomial posets.</description>

      <title>Proof of a conjecture on the minimal $p$-energy of connected graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16604v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a given simple graph $ G $, the $ p $-energy of $ G $, denoted by $\mathcal{E}_p(G)$, is defined as the sum of the $ p $th power of the absolute values of the eigenvalues of its adjacency matrix. Let $ S_n $ be the star graph with one internal node and $ n-1 $ leaves. Nikiforov conjectured that for $ 1 &lt; p &lt; 2 $, the connected graph of order $ n $ with the smallest $ p $-energy is $ S_n $. Recently, this conjecture was proved for bipartite graphs. In this paper, by employing a CoulsonJacobstype formula and certain spectral radius results for connected graphs, we completely solve this conjecture. Furthermore, we establish the equality condition for the inequality $\mathcal{E}_p(G) \geq \mathcal{E}_p(S_n),$ which holds with equality if and only if $ G $ is the star graph $ S_n $.</description>

      <title>Monophonic position sets of Cartesian and lexicographic products of graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The general position problem in graph theory asks for the number of vertices in a largest set $S$ of vertices of a graph $G$ such that no shortest path of $G$ contains more than two vertices of $S$. The analogous monophonic position problem is obtained from the general position problem by replacing ``shortest path" by ``induced path." This paper studies monophonic position sets in the Cartesian and lexicographic products of graphs. Sharp lower and upper bounds for the monophonic position number of Cartesian products are established, along with several exact values. For the lexicographic product, the monophonic position number is determined for arbitrary graphs.</description>

Abstract: Spherical $t$-designs are finite point sets on the unit sphere that enable exact integration of polynomials of degree at most $t$ via equal-weight quadrature. This concept has recently been extended to spherical $t$-design curves by the use of normalized path integrals. However, explicit examples of such curves are rare.
  We construct new spherical $t$-design curves for small $t$ based on the edges of a distinct subclass of convex polytopes. We then introduce hybrid $t$-designs that combine points and curves for exact polynomial integration of higher degree. Our constructions are based on the vertices and edges of dual pairs of convex polytopes and polynomial invariants of their symmetry group. A notable result is a hybrid $t$-design for $t=19$.</description>

      <title>Real and complex $B_h$-sets are open and dense</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $K = \mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$. Associated to every $n$-element $B_h$ set $A = \{a_1,\ldots, a_n\}$ in $K$ is the $B_h$-vector $\mathbf{a} = (a_1,\ldots, a_n)$ in $K^n$. This paper proves that ``almost all'' $n$-element subsets of $K$ are $B_h$-sets in the sense that the set of all $B_h$-vectors is an open and dense subset of $K^n$.</description>

      <title>The distance to the border of a random tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.10645v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a Galton-Watson process conditioned to have total progeny equal to $n$, we study the asymptotic probability that this conditioned Galton-Watson process has distance to the border bigger or equal than $k$, as the number of nodes $n \rightarrow \infty$.
  A problem which is akin to this one was solved by R\'enyi and Szekeres for Cayley trees, de Bruijn, Knuth, and Rice for plane trees and Flajolet, Gao, Odlyzko, and Richmond for binary trees. The distance to the border is dual, in a certain sense, to the height. The first of these distances is the minimum of the distances from the root to the leaves. The second is the maximum of the distances from the root to the leaves. These are two extreme complementary cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish lower tail bounds for the height, and upper tail bounds for the width, of critical size-conditioned Bienaym\'e trees. Our bounds are optimal at this level of generality. We also obtain precise asymptotics for offspring distributions within the domain of attraction of a Cauchy distribution, under a local regularity assumption. Finally, we pose some questions on the possible asymptotic behaviours of the height and width of critical size-conditioned Bienaym\'e trees.</description>

      <title>Output-sensitive Complexity of Multi-Objective Integer Network Flow Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01786v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the output-sensitive complexity for linear multi-objective integer minimum cost flow (MOIMCF) problems and provides insights about the time complexity for enumerating all supported nondominated vectors. The paper shows that there can not exist an output-polynomial time algorithm for the enumeration of all supported nondominated vectors that determine the vectors in an ordered way in the outcome space unless NP = P. Moreover, novel methods for identifying supported nondominated vectors in bi-objective minimum cost flow (BOIMCF) problems are proposed, accompanied by a numerical comparison between decision- and objective-space methods. A novel, equivalent and more compact formulation of the minimum cost flow ILP formulation used in the e-constrained-scalarization approach is introduced, demonstrating enhanced efficiency in the numerical tests</description>

      <title>Deep sections of the hypercube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider a non-negative number $t$ and a hyperplane $H$ of $\mathbb{R}^d$ whose distance to the center of the hypercube $[0,1]^d$ is $t$. If $t$ is equal to $0$ and $H$ is orthogonal to a diagonal of $[0,1]^d$, it is known that the $(d-1)$-dimensional volume of $H\cap[0,1]^d$ is a strictly increasing function of $d$ when $d$ is at least $3$. The study of the monotonicity of this volume is extended for $t$ up to above $1/2$ and, when $d$ is large enough, for every non-negative $t$. In particular, a range for $t$ is identified such that this volume is a strictly decreasing function of $d$ over the positive integers. The local extremality of the $(d-1)$-dimensional volume of $H\cap[0,1]^d$ when $H$ is orthogonal to a diagonal of either $[0,1]^d$ or a lower dimensional face is also determined for the same values of $t$. It is shown for instance that when $t$ is above an explicit constant and $d$ is large enough, this volume is always strictly locally maximal when $H$ is orthogonal to a diagonal of $[0,1]^d$. A precise estimate for the convergence rate of the Eulerian numbers to their limit Gaussian behavior is provided along the way.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Reductions Using Graph Neural Networks and a New Concurrent Local Search for the Maximum Weight Independent Set Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Maximum Weight Independent Set problem is a fundamental NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization with several real-world applications. Given an undirected vertex-weighted graph, the problem is to find a subset of the vertices with the highest possible weight under the constraint that no two vertices in the set can share an edge. An important part of solving this problem in both theory and practice is data reduction rules, which several state-of-the-art algorithms rely on. However, the most complicated rules are often not used in applications since the time needed to check them exhaustively becomes infeasible. In this work, we introduce three main results. First, we introduce several new data reduction rules and evaluate their effectiveness on real-world data. Second, we use a machine learning screening algorithm to speed up the reduction phase, thereby enabling more complicated rules to be applied. Our screening algorithm consults a Graph Neural Network oracle to decide if the probability of successfully reducing the graph is sufficiently large. For this task, we provide a dataset of labeled vertices for use in supervised learning. We also present the first results for this dataset using established Graph Neural Network architectures. Third, we present a new concurrent metaheuristic called Concurrent Difference-Core Heuristic. On the reduced instances, we use our new metaheuristic combined with iterated local search, called CHILS (Concurrent Hybrid Iterated Local Search). For this iterated local search, we provide a new implementation specifically designed to handle large graphs of varying densities. CHILS outperforms the current state-of-the-art on all commonly used benchmark instances, especially the largest ones.</description>
