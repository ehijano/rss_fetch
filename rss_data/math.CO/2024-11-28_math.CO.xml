      <title>Undecidability of the elementary theory of Young--Fibonacci lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a poset $(P,\leqslant)$ we consider the first-order theory, that is defined by set $P$ and relation $\leqslant$. The problem of undecidability of combinatorial theories attracts significant attention. Recently A. Wires proved the undecidability of the elementary theory of Young lattice and also established the maximal definability property of this theory. The purpose of this article is to obtain the same results for another graded lattice, which has much in common with Young lattice: Young--Fibonacci lattice. As Wires does for Young lattice, for the proof of undecidability we define Arithmetic into this theory.</description>

      <title>BiSC: An algorithm for discovering generalized permutation patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theorems relating permutations with objects in other fields of mathematics are often stated in terms of avoided patterns. Examples include various classes of Schubert varieties from algebraic geometry (Billey and Abe 2013), commuting functions in analysis (Baxter 1964), beta-shifts in dynamical systems (Elizalde 2011) and homology of representations (Sundaram 1994). We present a new algorithm, BiSC, that, given any set of permutations, outputs a conjecture for describing the set in terms of avoided patterns. The algorithm automatically conjectures the statements of known theorems such as the descriptions of smooth (Lakshmibai and Sandhya 1990) and forest-like permutations (Bousquet-M{\'e}lou and Butler 2007), Baxter permutations (Chung et al. 1978), stack-sortable (Knuth 1975) and West-2-stack-sortable permutations (West 1990). The algorithm has also been used to discover new theorems and conjectures related to the dihedral and alternating subgroups of the symmetric group, Young tableaux, Wilf-equivalences, and sorting devices.</description>

      <title>On Hamilton paths in vertex-transitive graphs of order $10p$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was shown by Kutnar, Maru\v si\v c and Zhang in 2012 that every connected vertex-transitive graph of order $10p$, where $p$ is a prime and $p\ne 7$, contains a Hamilton path, except for graphs $X$ arising from the action of PSL$(2, s^m)$ on cosets of $\mathbb{Z}_s^m\rtimes \mathbb{Z}_{\frac{s^m-1}{10}}$, where $s$ is a prime. In this paper, Hamilton cycles of these exceptions $X$ will be found.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a new class of polyominoes, called $p$-Fibonacci polyominoes, defined using $p$-Fibonacci words. We enumerate these polyominoes by applying generating functions to capture geometric parameters such as area, semi-perimeter, and the number of inner points. Additionally, we establish bijections between Fibonacci polyominoes, binary Fibonacci words, and integer compositions with certain restrictions.</description>

      <title>Extremal Problems on Forest Cuts and Acyclic Neighborhoods in Sparse Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chernyshev, Rauch, and Rautenbach proved that every connected graph on $n$ vertices with less than $\frac{11}{5}n-\frac{18}{5}$ edges has a vertex cut that induces a forest, and conjectured that the same remains true if the graph has less than $3n-6$ edges. We improve their result by proving that every connected graph on $n$ vertices with less than $\frac{9}{4}n$ edges has a vertex cut that induces a forest. We also study weaker versions of the problem that might lead to an improvement on the bound obtained.</description>

      <title>$d$-Degree Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado theorem for finite vector spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $V$ be an $n$-dimensional vector space over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_{q}$ and let $\left[V\atop k\right]_q$ denote the family of all $k$-dimensional subspaces of $V$. A family $\mathcal{F}\subseteq \left[V\atop k\right]_q$ is called intersecting if for all $F$, $F'\in\mathcal{F}$, we have ${\rm dim}$$(F\cap F')\geq 1$. Let $\delta_{d}(\mathcal{F})$ denote the minimum degree in $\mathcal{F}$ of all $d$-dimensional subspaces. In this paper we show that $\delta_{d}(\mathcal{F})\leq \left[n-d-1\atop k-d-1\right]$ in any intersecting family $\mathcal{F}\subseteq \left[V\atop k\right]_q$, where $k&gt;d\geq 2$ and $n\geq 2k+1$.</description>

      <title>Ramsey--Dirac theory for bounded degree hypertrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ramsey--Tur\'an theory considers Tur\'an type questions in Ramsey-context, asking for the existence of a small subgraph in a graph $G$ where the complement $\overline{G}$ lacks an appropriate subgraph $F$, such as a clique of linear size. Similarly, one can consider Dirac-type questions in Ramsey context, asking for the existence of a spanning subgraph $H$ in a graph $G$ where the complement $\overline{G}$ lacks an appropriate subgraph $F$, which we call a Ramsey--Dirac theory question.
  When $H$ is a connected spanning subgraph, the disjoint union $K_{n/2}\cup K_{n/2}$ of two large cliques shows that it is natural to consider complete bipartite graphs $F$. Indeed, Han, Hu, Ping, Wang, Wang and Yang in 2024 proved that if $G$ is an $n$-vertex graph with $\delta(G)=\Omega(n)$ where the complement $\overline{G}$ does not contain any complete bipartite graph $K_{m,m}$ with $m=\Omega(n)$, then $G$ contains every $n$-vertex bounded degree tree $T$ as a subgraph.
  Extending this result to the Ramsey--Dirac theory for hypertrees, we prove that if $G$ is an $n$-vertex $r$-uniform hypergraph with $\delta(G)=\Omega(n^{r-1})$ where the complement $\overline{G}$ does not contain any complete $r$-partite hypergraph $K_{m,m,\dots, m}$ with $m=\Omega(n)$, then $G$ contains every $n$-vertex bounded degree hypertree $T$ as a subgraph. We also prove the existence of matchings and loose Hamilton cycles in the same setting, which extends the result of Mcdiarmid and Yolov into hypergraphs.
  This result generalizes the universality result on randomly perturbed graphs by B\"ottcher, Han, Kohayakawa, Montgomery, Parczyk and Person in 2019 into hypergraphs and also strengthen the results on quasirandom hypergraphs by Lenz, Mubayi and Mycroft in 2016 and Lenz and Mubayi in 2016 into hypergraphs satisfying a much weaker pseudorandomness condition.</description>

      <title>Distributions of mesh patterns of short lengths on king permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Br\"{a}nd\'{e}n and Claesson introduced the concept of mesh patterns in 2011, and since then, these patterns have attracted significant attention in the literature. Subsequently, in 2015, Hilmarsson \emph{et al.} initiated the first systematic study of avoidance of mesh patterns, while Kitaev and Zhang conducted the first systematic study of the distribution of mesh patterns in 2019. A permutation $\sigma = \sigma_1 \sigma_2 \cdots \sigma_n$ in the symmetric group $S_n$ is called a king permutation if $\left| \sigma_{i+1}-\sigma_i \right| &gt; 1$ for each $1 \leq i \leq n-1$. Riordan derived a recurrence relation for the number of such permutations in 1965. The generating function for king permutations was obtained by Flajolet and Sedgewick in 2009. In this paper, we initiate a systematic study of the distribution of mesh patterns on king permutations by finding distributions for 22 mesh patterns of short length.</description>

      <title>On norming systems of linear equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A system of linear equations $L$ is said to be norming if a natural functional $t_L(\cdot)$ giving a weighted count for the set of solutions to the system can be used to define a norm on the space of real-valued functions on $\mathbb{F}_q^n$ for every $n&gt;0$. For example, Gowers uniformity norms arise in this way. In this paper, we initiate the systematic study of norming linear systems by proving a range of necessary and sufficient conditions for a system to be norming. Some highlights include an isomorphism theorem for the functional $t_L(\cdot)$, a proof that any norming system must be variable-transitive and the classification of all norming systems of rank at most two.</description>

      <title>Non-uniform Cross-intersecting Families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $m\geq 2$, $n$ be positive integers, and $R_i=\{k_{i,1} &gt;k_{i,2} &gt;\cdots&gt; k_{i,t_i}\}$ be subsets of $[n]$ for $i=1,2,\ldots,m$. The families $\mathcal{F}_1\subseteq \binom{[n]}{R_1},\mathcal{F}_2\subseteq \binom{[n]}{R_2},\ldots,\mathcal{F}_m\subseteq \binom{[n]}{R_m}$ are said to be non-empty cross-intersecting if for each $i\in [m]$, $\mathcal{F}_i\neq\emptyset$ and for any $A\in \mathcal{F}_i,B\in\mathcal{F}_j$, $1\leq i&lt;j\leq m$, $|A\bigcap B|\geq1$. In this paper, we determine the maximum value of $\sum_{j=1}^{m}|\mathcal{F}_j|$ for non-empty cross-intersecting family $\mathcal{F}_1, \mathcal{F}_2,\ldots,\mathcal{F}_m$ when $n\geq k_1+k_2$, where $k_1$ (respectively, $k_2$) is the largest (respectively, second largest) value in $\{k_{1,1},k_{2,1},\ldots,k_{m,1}\}$. This result is a generalization of the results by Shi, Frankl and Qian \cite{shi2022non} on non-empty cross-intersecting families. Moreover, the extremal families are completely characterized.</description>

      <title>Planar Tur\'an number of two adjacent cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The planar Tur\'an number of $H$, denoted by $ex_{\mathcal{P}}(n,H)$, is the maximum number of edges in an $n$-vertex $H$-free planar graph. The planar Tur\'an number of $k(k\geq 3)$ vertex-disjoint union of cycles is the trivial value $3n-6$. Lan, Shi and Song determined the exact value of $ex_{\mathcal{P}}(n,2C_3)$. In this paper, we further research the existence of two disjoint cycles under distance restriction and get the planar Tur\'an number for $C_3\text{-}C_3$, where $C_{k}\text{-}C_{\ell}$ denotes the graph consisting of two disjoint cycles $C_k$ with an edge connecting them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Demazure product, also called the 0-Hecke product, is an associative operation on Coxeter groups with interesting properties and applications. In (Li et al 2024) it was shown that the Demazure product of two permutations can be described purely combinatorially: using only their one-line notation and not relying on reduced words. In this paper, we extend this to type D Coxeter groups.</description>

      <title>On the thresholds of degenerate hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An $n$-vertex $k$-uniform hypergraph $G$ is $(d,\alpha)$-degenerate if $m_1(G)\le{d}$ and there exists a constant $\varepsilon &gt;0$ such that for every subset $U\subseteq{V(G)}$ with size $2\le|U|\le{\varepsilon n}$, we have $e\left(G[U]\right)\le{d\left(|U|-1\right)-\alpha}$. These hypergraphs include many natural graph classes, such as the degenerate hypergraphs, the planar graphs, and the power of cycles. In this paper, we consider the threshold of the emergence of a $(d,\alpha)$-degenerate hypergraph with bounded maximum degree in the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi model. We show that its threshold is at most $n^{-1/d}$, improving previous results of Riordan and Kelly-M\"uyesser-Pokrovskiy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we give an explicit formula for the rank of the $Q$-walk matrix of the Dynkin graph $A_n$. Moreover, we prove that its Smith normal form is $$ \mathrm{diag}\left( \underset{r=\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil}{\underbrace{1,2,2,...,2}},0,...,0 \right), $$ where $r$ is the rank of the $Q$-walk matrix $W_Q\left( A_n \right) $ of the Dynkin graph $A_n$.</description>

      <title>A Faster Deterministic Algorithm for Mader's $\mathcal{S}$-Path Packing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given an undirected graph $G = (V,E)$ with a set of terminals $T\subseteq V$ partitioned into a family $\mathcal{S}$ of disjoint blocks, find the maximum number of vertex-disjoint paths whose endpoints belong to two distinct blocks while no other internal vertex is a terminal. This problem is called Mader's $\mathcal{S}$-path packing. It has been of remarkable interest as a common generalization of the non-bipartite matching and vertex-disjoint $s\text{-}t$ paths problem.
  This paper presents a new deterministic algorithm for this problem via known reduction to linear matroid parity. The algorithm utilizes the augmenting-path algorithm of Gabow and Stallmann (1986), while replacing costly matrix operations between augmentation steps with a faster algorithm that exploits the original $\mathcal{S}$-path packing instance. The proposed algorithm runs in $O(mnk)$ time, where $n = |V|$, $m = |E|$, and $k = |T|\le n$. This improves on the previous best bound $O(mn^{\omega})$ for deterministic algorithms, where $\omega\ge2$ denotes the matrix multiplication exponent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish new explicit connections between classical (scalar) and matrix Gegenbauer polynomials, which result in new symmetries of the latter and further give access to several properties that have been out of reach before: generating functions, distribution of zeros for individual entries of the matrices and new type of differential-difference structure. We further speculate about other potentials of the connection formulas found. Part of our proofs makes use of creative telescoping in a matrix setting$-$the strategy which is not yet developed algorithmically.</description>

      <title>Linear Extensions of Rotor-Routing in Directed Graphs: Reachability Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a linear extension of the rotor-routing model in directed graphs, akin to the sandpile model and vector addition systems, together with new rotor mechanisms that extend standard cyclic rotors. In this framework, rotor-routing is interpreted as the simultaneous movement of particles accross two coupled graphs, involving both vertex and arc-based particles. The standard, combinatorial rotor-routing of positive particles (legal routing) based on rotor-configurations, then becomes a special case of a linear equivalence. We give comprehensive reachability results characterizing legal routings among linear equivalences, expanding on previous results, and settle the algorithmic complexities associated with these problems.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a permutation group on the finite set $\Omega$. We study partitions of $\Omega$ whose stabilizers have bounded derived length, proving the following three theorems. In every solvable permutation group, there is a subset whose setwise stabilizer has derived length at most $3$, which is best possible. Every solvable maximal subgroup of any almost simple group has derived length bounded by an absolute constant. In every primitive group with solvable stabilizer, there are two points whose pointwise stabilizer has derived length bounded by an absolute constant.</description>

      <title>Lower tails for triangles inside the critical window</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the probability that the random graph $G(n,p)$ is triangle-free. When $p =o(n^{-1/2})$ or $p = \omega(n^{-1/2})$ the asymptotics of the logarithm of this probability are known via Janson's inequality in the former case and via regularity or hypergraph container methods in the latter case. We prove for the first time an asymptotic formula for the logarithm of this probability when $p = c n^{-1/2}$ for $c$ a sufficiently small constant.
  More generally, we study lower-tail large deviations for triangles in random graphs: the probability that $G(n,p)$ has at most $\eta$ times its expected number of triangles, when $p = c n^{-1/2}$ for $c$ and $\eta \in [0,1)$ constant. Our results apply for all $c$ if $\eta \ge .4993$ and for $c$ small enough otherwise.
  For $\eta$ small (including the case of triangle-freeness), we prove that a phase transition occurs as $c$ varies, in the sense of a non-analyticity of the rate function, while for $\eta \ge .4993$ we prove that no phase transition occurs.
  On the other hand for the random graph $G(n,m)$, with $m = b n^{3/2}$, we show that a phase transition occurs in the lower-tail problem for triangles as $b$ varies for \emph{every} $\eta \in [0,1)$.
  Our method involves ingredients from algorithms and statistical physics including the cluster expansion and concentration inequalities for contractive Markov chains.</description>

Abstract: We prove the existence conjecture for combinatorial designs, answering a question of Steiner from 1853. More generally, we show that the natural divisibility conditions are sufficient for clique decompositions of simplicial complexes that satisfy a certain pseudorandomness condition. As a further generalisation, we obtain the same conclusion only assuming an extendability property and the existence of a robust fractional clique decomposition.</description>

      <title>On Manin-Schechtman orders related to directed graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.06919v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a generalization of weak Bruhat orders on permutations, in 1989 Manin and Schechtman introduced the notion of a higher Bruhat order on the $d$-element subsets of a set $[n]=\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$. Among other results in this field, they proved that the set of such orders for $n,d$ fixed, endowed with natural local transformations, constitutes a poset with one minimal and one maximal elements. In this paper we consider a wider model, involving the so-called convex order on certain path systems in an acyclic directed graph, introduce local transformations, or flips, on such orders and prove that the resulting structure gives a poset with one minimal and one maximal elements as well, yielding a generalization of the above-mentioned classical result.</description>

      <title>Induced subgraphs and tree decompositions XIII. Basic obstructions in $\mathcal{H}$-free graphs for finite $\mathcal{H}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05066v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unlike minors, the induced subgraph obstructions to bounded treewidth come in a large variety, including, for every $t\geq 1$, the $t$-basic obstructions: the graphs $K_{t+1}$ and $K_{t,t}$, along with the subdivisions of the $t$-by-$t$ wall and their line graphs. But this list is far from complete. The simplest example of a ''non-basic'' obstruction is due to Pohoata and Davies (independently). For every $n \geq 1$, they construct certain graphs of treewidth $n$ and with no $3$-basic obstruction as an induced subgraph, which we call $n$-arrays.
  Let us say a graph class $\mathcal{G}$ is clean if the only obstructions to bounded treewidth in $\mathcal{G}$ are in fact the basic ones. It follows that a full description of the induced subgraph obstructions to bounded treewidth is equivalent to a characterization of all families $\mathcal{H}$ of graphs for which the class of all $\mathcal{H}$-free graphs is clean (a graph $G$ is $\mathcal{H}$-free if no induced subgraph of $G$ is isomorphic to any graph in $\mathcal{H}$).
  This remains elusive, but there is an immediate necessary condition: if $\mathcal{H}$-free graphs are clean, then there are only finitely many integers $n\geq 1$ such that there is an $n$-array which is $\mathcal{H}$-free. The above necessary condition is not sufficient in general. However, the situation turns out to be different if $\mathcal{H}$ is finite: we prove that for every finite set $\mathcal{H}$ of graphs, the class of all $\mathcal{H}$-free graphs is clean if and only if there is no $\mathcal{H}$-free $n$-array except possibly for finitely many values of $n$.</description>

Abstract: We show that any minimal Cayley graph of a (finitely generated) generalized dihedral or nilpotent group has chromatic number at most 3, while 4 colors are sometimes necessary for soluble groups. On the other hand we construct graphs of unbounded chromatic number that admit a proper edge coloring such that each cycle has some color at least twice. The latter disproves a conjecture of Babai'78 that would have implied that all minimal Cayley graphs have bounded chromatic number -- a problem that remains open.</description>

      <title>Tournament transitivity of graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17191v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G=(V, E)$ be a graph where $V$ and $E$ are the vertex and edge sets, respectively. For two disjoint subsets $A$ and $B$ of $V$, we say $A$ \textit{dominates} $B$ if every vertex of $B$ is adjacent to at least one vertex of $A$ in $G$. A vertex partition $\pi = \{V_1, V_2, \ldots, V_k\}$ of $G$ is called a \emph{transitive partition} of size $k$ if $V_i$ dominates $V_j$ for all $1\leq i&lt;j\leq k$. A vertex partition $\pi = \{V_1, V_2, \ldots, V_k\}$ of $G$ is called a \emph{tournament transitive partition} of size $k$ if $V_i$ dominates $V_j$ for all $1\leq i&lt;j\leq k$ and $V_j$ does not dominate $V_i$ for $i&lt;j$. The maximum integer $k$ for which the above partition exists is called \emph{tournament transitivity} of $G$, and it is denoted by $TTr(G)$. The \textsc{Maximum Tournament Transitivity Problem} is to find a tournament transitive partition of a given graph with the maximum number of parts. In this article, we study this variation of transitive partition from a structure and algorithmic point of view. We show that the decision version of this problem is NP-complete for chordal graphs (connected), perfect elimination bipartite graphs (disconnected) and doubly chordal graphs (disconnected). On the positive side, we prove that this problem can be solved in polynomial time for trees. Furthermore, we characterize \textup{Type-I BCG} with equal transitivity and tournament transitivity and find some sufficient conditions under which the above two parameters are equal for a \textup{Type-II BCG}. Finally, we show that for \textup{Type-III BCG}, these two parameters are never equal.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies the stability of tensor ranks under field extensions. Our main contributions are fourfold: (1) We prove that the analytic rank is stable under field extensions. (2) We establish the equivalence between the partition rank vs. analytic rank conjecture and the stability conjecture for partition rank. We also prove that they are equivalent to other two important conjectures. (3) We resolve the Adiprasito-Kazhdan-Ziegler conjecture on the stability of the slice rank of linear subspaces under field extensions. (4) As an application of (1), we show that the geometric rank is equal to the analytic rank up to a constant factor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the existence of periodic colorings and orientations in locally finite graphs. A coloring or orientation of a graph $G$ is periodic if the resulting colored or oriented graph is quasi-transitive, meaning that $V(G)$ has finitely many orbits under the action of the group of automorphisms of $G$ preserving the coloring or the orientation. When such a periodic coloring or orientation of $G$ exists, $G$ itself must be quasi-transitive and it is natural to investigate when quasi-transitive graphs have such periodic colorings or orientations. We provide examples of Cayley graphs with no periodic orientation or non-trivial coloring, and examples of quasi-transitive graphs of treewidth 2 without periodic orientation or proper coloring. On the other hand we show that every quasi-transitive graph $G$ of bounded pathwidth has a periodic proper coloring with $\chi(G)$ colors and a periodic orientation. We relate these problems with techniques and questions from symbolic dynamics and distributed computing and conclude with a number of open problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04267v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Ramsey number $R(s,t)$ is the smallest integer $n$ such that all graphs of size $n$ contain a clique of size $s$ or an independent set of size $t$. $\mathcal{R}(s,t,n)$ is the set of all counterexample graphs without this property for a given $n$. We prove that if a graph $G_{n+1}$ of size $n+1$ has $\max\{s,t\}+1$ subgraphs in $\mathcal{R}(s,t,n)$, then $G_{n+1}$ is in $\mathcal{R}(s,t,n+1)$. Based on this, we introduce algorithms for one-vertex extension and counterexample checking with runtime linearly bound by $s$ and $t$. We prove the utility of these algorithms by verifying $\mathcal{R}(4,6,36)$ and $\mathcal{R}(5,5,43)$ are empty given current sets $\mathcal{R}(4,6,35)$ and $\mathcal{R}(5,5,42)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a new proof of a theorem of Bender, Coley, Robbins and Rumsey on counting subspaces with a given profile with respect to a simple operator. Counting such subspaces is equivalent to the problem of determining the $q$-Whittaker coefficients in the expansion of the power sum symmetric function. As a consequence we obtain a result of Chen and Tseng which answers a problem of Niederreiter on splitting subspaces.</description>

      <title>Floer Homology: From Generalized Morse-Smale Dynamical Systems to Forman's Combinatorial Vector Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.02567v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a Floer type boundary operator for generalised Morse-Smale dynamical systems on compact smooth manifolds by counting the number of suitable flow lines between closed (both homoclinic and periodic) orbits and isolated critical points. The same principle works for the discrete situation of general combinatorial vector fields, defined by Forman, on CW complexes. We can thus recover the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ homology of both smooth and discrete structures directly from the flow lines (V-paths) of our vector field.</description>

      <title>First Order Logic and Twin-Width in Tournaments and Dense Oriented Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.07683v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterise the classes of tournaments with tractable first-order model checking. For every hereditary class of tournaments $\mathcal T$, first-order model checking is either fixed parameter tractable or $\textrm{AW}[*]$-hard. This dichotomy coincides with the fact that $\mathcal T$ has either bounded or unbounded twin-width, and that the growth of $\mathcal T$ is either at most exponential or at least factorial. From the model-theoretic point of view, we show that NIP classes of tournaments coincide with bounded twin-width. Twin-width is also characterised by three infinite families of obstructions: $\mathcal T$ has bounded twin-width if and only if it excludes at least one tournament from each family. This generalises results of Bonnet et al. on ordered graphs. The key for these results is a polynomial time algorithm which takes as input a tournament $T$ and computes a linear order $&lt;$ on $V(T)$ such that the twin-width of the birelation $(T,&lt;)$ is at most some function of the twin-width of $T$. Since approximating twin-width can be done in polynomial time for an ordered structure $(T,&lt;)$, this provides a polynomial time approximation of twin-width for tournaments. Our results extend to oriented graphs with stable sets of bounded size, which may also be augmented by arbitrary binary relations.</description>

      <title>Frobenius nonclassical hypersurfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.11981v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A smooth hypersurface over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ is called Frobenius nonclassical if the image of every geometric point under the $q$-th Frobenius endomorphism remains in the unique hyperplane tangent to the point. In this paper, we establish sharp lower and upper bounds for the degrees of such hypersurfaces, give characterizations for those achieving the maximal degrees, and prove in the surface case that they are Hermitian when their degrees attain the minimum. We also prove that the set of $\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points on a Frobenius nonclassical hypersurface form a blocking set with respect to lines, which indicates the existence of many $\mathbb{F}_q$-points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.16902v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a direct proof of Seidel representation in the quantum K-theory QK(Gr(k, n)) by studying projected Gromov-Witten varieties concretely. As applications, we give an alternative proof of the K-theoretic quantum Pieri rule by Buch and Mihalcea, reduce certain quantum Schubert structure constants of higher degree to classical Littlewood-Richardson coefficients for K(Gr(k, n)), and provide a quantum Littlewood-Richardson rule for QK(Gr(3, n)).</description>

      <title>Spectral influence in networks: An application to Input-Output analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.02371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the concepts of spectral influence and spectral cyclicality, both derived from the largest eigenvalue of a graph's adjacency matrix. These two novel centrality measures capture both diffusion and interdependence from a local and global perspective respectively. We propose a new clustering algorithm that identifies communities with high cyclicality and interdependence, allowing for overlaps. To illustrate our method, we apply it to input-output analysis within the context of the Moroccan economy.</description>

      <title>Classification of higher grade $\ell$ graphs for $\mathrm{U}(N)^2\times \mathrm{O}(D)$ multi-matrix models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The authors studied in [Ann. Inst. Henri Poincar\'e D 9, 367-433, (2022)], a complex multi-matrix model with $\mathrm{U}(N)^2 \times \mathrm{O}(D)$ symmetry, and whose double scaling limit where simultaneously the large-$N$ and large-$D$ limits were taken while keeping the ratio $N/\sqrt{D}=M$ finite and fixed. In this double scaling limit, the complete recursive characterization of the Feynman graphs of arbitrary genus for the leading order grade $\ell=0$ was achieved. In this current study, we classify the higher order graphs in $\ell$. More specifically, $\ell=1$ and $\ell=2$ with arbitrary genus, in addition to a specific class of two-particle-irreducible (2PI) graphs for higher $\ell \geqslant 3$ but with genus zero. Furthermore, we demonstrate that each 2PI graph with a single $\mathrm{O}(D)$-loop with an arbitrary $\ell$ corresponds to a reduced alternating knot diagram with $\ell$ crossings as listed in the Rolfsen knot table, or a resulting alternating knot diagram obtained after performing the Tait flyping moves. We generalize to 2PR by considering the connected sum and the Reidemeister move I.</description>

      <title>Local limits of random spanning trees in random environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16836v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the edge overlap and local limit of the random spanning tree in random environment (RSTRE) on the complete graph with $n$ vertices and weights given by $\exp(-\beta \omega_e)$ for $\omega_e$ uniformly distributed on $[0,1]$. We show that for $\beta$ growing with $\beta = o(n/\log n)$, the edge overlap is $(1+o(1)) \beta$, while for $\beta$ much larger than $n \log^2 n$, the edge overlap is $(1-o(1))n$. Furthermore, there is a transition of the local limit around $\beta = n$. When $\beta = o(n/ \log n)$ the RSTRE locally converges to the same limit as the uniform spanning tree, whereas for $\beta$ larger than $n \log^\lambda n$, where $\lambda = \lambda(n) \rightarrow \infty$ arbitrarily slowly, the local limit of the RSTRE is the same as that of the minimum spanning tree.</description>

      <title>The diameter of random spanning trees interpolating between the UST and the MST of the complete graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce $\mathsf{WST}^{\beta_n}(K_n)$ as the weighted spanning tree of the complete graph $K_n$ w.r.t. the random electric network of conductances $\{\exp(-\beta_nU_{e})\}_{e\in E(K_n)}$ with $\mathrm{Unif}[0,1]$ i.i.d. $U_e$'s.
  Moving from $\beta_n\equiv 0$ to faster and faster growing $\beta_n$'s, the model interpolates between the \emph{uniform} and the \emph{minimum} spanning trees: $\mathsf{WST}^0(K_n)=\mathsf{UST}(K_n)$, and there are phase transitions for $\mathsf{WST}^{\beta_n}(K_n)$ behaving more and more like $\mathsf{MST}(K_n)$:
  - around $\beta_n=n^{3+o(1)}$ regarding the agreement of the two standard algorithms generating these models : Aldous-Broder and Prim's invasion algorithms,
  - around $\beta_n=n^{2+o(1)}$ regarding the models consisting of exactly the same edges, and
  - around $\beta_n=n^{1+o(1)}$ regarding the expected total length $\mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{e\in \mathsf{WST}^{\beta_n}(K_n)}U_e\right]$.
  But most importantly, we study the global geometry of the model: we prove that the typical diameter of $\mathsf{WST}^{\beta_n}(K_n)$ grows like $\Theta(n^{1/3})$ for $\beta_n\ge n^{4/3+o(1)}$ likewise the $\mathsf{MST}(K_n)$ case, and it grows like $\Theta(n^{1/2})$ for $\beta_n\le n^{1+o(1)}$ similarly to the $\mathsf{UST}(K_n)$ case. For $\beta_n=n^{\alpha}$ with $1&lt;\alpha&lt;4/3$, the behavior of the typical diameter is a more delicate open question, but we conjecture that its exponent strictly between 1/2 and 1/3.</description>
