      <title>On perturbations of the spectrum of one-dimensional PT-symmetric periodic Schrodinger operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For PT-symmetric periodic Schrodinger operator, which is a small perturbation of the zero potential, we calculate the spectrum and the divisor of zeroes of the Bloch function in the leading order of the perturbation theory. In particular, we show that the analogs of lacunae of the Bloch spectrum are ellipses, and their focal points coincide with the branch points of the spectral curve.</description>

      <title>Geometric Criteria for Essential Self-Adjointness of Discrete Hodge Laplacians on Weighted Simplicial Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we define the structure of $n$-simplicial complex, we consider generalizations of the Laplacians to simplicial complexes of higher dimension and we develop the notion of $\chi$-completeness for simplicial complexes. Otherwise, we study essential self-adjointness from the $\chi$-completeness geometric hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Overparametrization bends the landscape: BBP transitions at initialization in simple Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional non-convex loss landscapes play a central role in the theory of Machine Learning. Gaining insight into how these landscapes interact with gradient-based optimization methods, even in relatively simple models, can shed light on this enigmatic feature of neural networks. In this work, we will focus on a prototypical simple learning problem, which generalizes the Phase Retrieval inference problem by allowing the exploration of overparametrized settings. Using techniques from field theory, we analyze the spectrum of the Hessian at initialization and identify a Baik-Ben Arous-P\'ech\'e (BBP) transition in the amount of data that separates regimes where the initialization is informative or uninformative about a planted signal of a teacher-student setup. Crucially, we demonstrate how overparameterization can bend the loss landscape, shifting the transition point, even reaching the information-theoretic weak-recovery threshold in the large overparameterization limit, while also altering its qualitative nature. We distinguish between continuous and discontinuous BBP transitions and support our analytical predictions with simulations, examining how they compare to the finite-N behavior. In the case of discontinuous BBP transitions strong finite-N corrections allow the retrieval of information at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) smaller than the predicted BBP transition. In these cases we provide estimates for a new lower SNR threshold that marks the point at which initialization becomes entirely uninformative.</description>

      <title>Fair and Tolerant (FAT) Graph Colorings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study Fair and Tolerant colorings (FAT colorings), where each vertex tolerates a given fraction of same-colored neighbors while fairness is preserved across the other coloring classes. Moreover, we define the FAT chromatic number $\chi^{\mathrm{FAT}}(G)$ as the largest integer $k$ for which $G$ admits a FAT $k$-coloring. We establish general bounds on $\chi^{\mathrm{FAT}}$, relate it to structural and spectral properties of graphs, and characterize it completely for several families of graphs. We conclude with a list of open questions that suggest future directions.</description>

      <title>On the spectral radius of the ratio of Girko matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Girko matrices have independent and identically distributed entries of mean zero and unit variance. In this note, we consider the random matrix model formed by the ratio of two independent Girko matrices, its entries are dependent and heavy-tailed. Our main message is that divided by the square root of the dimension, the spectral radius of the ratio converges in distribution, when the dimension tends to infinity, to a universal heavy-tailed distribution. We provide a mathematical proof of this high-dimensional phenomenon, under a fourth moment matching with a Gaussian case known as the complex Ginibre ensemble. In this Gaussian case, the model is known as the spherical ensemble, and its spectrum is a determinantal planar Coulomb gas. Its image by the inverse stereographic projection is a rotationally invariant gas on the two-sphere. A crucial observation is the invariance in law of the model under inversion, related to its spherical symmetry, and that makes, in a sense, edge and bulk equivalent. Our approach involves Girko Hermitization, local law estimates for Wigner matrices, lower bound estimates on the smallest singular value, and convergence of kernels of determinantal point processes. The universality of the high-dimensional fluctuation of the spectral radius of the ratio of Girko matrices turns out to be remarkably more accessible mathematically than for a single Girko matrix!</description>

      <title>Hodge Laplacians on Weighted Simplicial Complexes: Forms, Closures, and Essential Self-Adjointness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish explicit operator norm bounds and essential self-adjointness criteria for discrete Hodge Laplacians on weighted graphs and simplicial complexes. For unweighted $d$-regular graphs we prove the universal estimate $\|\widetilde{\Delta}_{1,*}\|\le 4(d-1)$, and we provide weighted extensions with a sharp comparability constant. These bounds apply without geometric completeness or curvature assumptions and ensure essential self-adjointness on natural cores. The approach extends to higher degrees via dual up/down degrees, and we show a unitary equivalence between skew and symmetric models on colorable complexes. For periodic lattices we complement the universal bounds with exact Floquet--Bloch constants, typically of order $2d$, illustrating both the sharpness in growth and the generality of our method.</description>

      <title>Spherical harmonics and point configurations on the sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.03403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a systematic framework for constructing spherical harmonics on the two-dimensional unit sphere as superpositions of Gaussian beams whose poles form well-separated point configurations. The distributional and analytic properties of the resulting spherical harmonics are determined by the geometry of these poles: when the configuration is equidistributed, the sequence of harmonics exhibits quantum ergodicity, while their $L^\infty$ norms are quantitatively controlled by the maximal clustering of poles within small neighborhoods of great circles.</description>
