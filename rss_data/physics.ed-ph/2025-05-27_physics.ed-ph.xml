      <title>On the Normalization and Density of 1D Scattering States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.09108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.09108v6 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The normalization of scattering states is more than a rote step necessary to calculate expectation values. This normalization actually contains important information regarding the density of the scattering spectrum (along with useful details on the bound states). For many applications, this information is more useful than the wavefunctions themselves. In this paper we show that this correspondence between scattering state normalization and the density of states is a consequence of the completeness relation, and we present formulas for calculating the density of states which are applicable to certain potentials. We then apply these formulas to the delta function potential and the square well. We then illustrate how the density of states can be used to calculate the partition function for a system of two particles with a point-like (delta potential) interaction.</description>

      <title>Project For Advancement of Software Usability in Materials Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Institute for Solid State Physics (ISSP) at The University of Tokyo has been carrying out a software development project named ``the Project for Advancement of Software Usability in Materials Science (PASUMS)". Since the launch of PASUMS, various open-source software programs have been developed/advanced, including ab initio calculations, effective model solvers, and software for machine learning. We also focus on activities that make the software easier to use, such as developing comprehensive computing tools that enable efficient use of supercomputers and interoperability between different software programs. We hope to contribute broadly to developing the computational materials science community through these activities.</description>

      <title>Detecting gravitational waves with light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The strong evidence for low-frequency gravitational waves from pulsar timing arrays (PTAs), published in 2023, has widened the scope for teaching about gravitational wave astronomy. This article provides a simple, unified overview of the detection of gravitational waves using light waves that encompasses the recent PTA detections, the by-now classic interferometric detections using LIGO and similar detectors, and the yet-to-be-accomplished detections using long-arm detectors like the spaceborne LISA. The presentation is at a level accessible for undergraduate students. The influence of gravitational waves on light is derived in a way that makes use only of basic gravitational wave properties and Einstein's equivalence principle.</description>

      <title>Simple and exact nonlinear pendulum motion for all possible initial conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16816v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simple and formally exact solutions of energy-conserving nonlinear pendulum motion are derived for all three classes: swinging, stopping, and spinning. Although with seemingly very different characteristic motions, the three classes can now be treated on the same footing using the frequency domain. The solutions are the first exact and complete description of energy-conserving pendulum in the frequency domain reported in the literature. The key insight is the importance of angular velocity frequency analysis, rather than that of angular displacement. The emphasis on velocity frequency domain should benefit other studies of nonlinear motion as well. Brief theoretical derivations are given. The solutions are validated by exact numerical values and frequency analysis of dynamical simulations using velocity verlet integration. Their unique simplicity should be useful in a theoretical development that requires a tractable mathematical framework or in an introductory physics course that aims to discuss nonlinear pendulum.</description>
