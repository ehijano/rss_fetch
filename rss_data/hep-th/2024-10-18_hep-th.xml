      <title>Gibbons-Hawking action for electrically charged black holes in the canonical ensemble and Davies' thermodynamic theory of black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the connection between the Gibbons-Hawking Euclidean path integral approach applied to the canonical ensemble of a Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole and the thermodynamic theory of black holes of Davies. We build the ensemble, characterized by a reservoir at infinity at temperature $T$ and electric charge $Q$, in $d$ dimensions. The Euclidean path integral yields the action and partition function. In zero loop, we uncover two solutions, one with horizon radius $r_{+1}$ the least massive, the other with $r_{+2}$. We find a saddle point separating the solutions at $T_s$ and $Q_s$ with radius $r_{+s}$. For $T &gt; T_s$ there is only hot flat space with charge at infinity. We derive the thermodynamics. The heat capacity gives that $T_s$ and $Q_s$ separate stable, $r_{+1}$, from unstable, $r_{+2}$ , solutions, the phase transition being second order. The free energy of the stable solution is positive, so if the system is a black hole it makes a first order transition to hot space. An interpretation of the results as energy wavelengths is attempted. For $d = 4$, the thermodynamics from the path integral applied to the canonical ensemble is precisely the Davies thermodynamics theory of black holes, with $T_s$ being the Davies point. We sketch the case $d = 5$.</description>

      <title>Wreathing, Discrete Gauging, and Non-invertible Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 't Hooft anomalies of discrete global symmetries and gaugings thereof have rich mathematical structures and far-reaching physical consequences. We examine each subgroup $G$, up to automorphisms, of the permutation group $S_4$ that acts on the four legs of the affine $D_4$ quiver diagram, which is mirror dual to the 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ gauge theory with four flavours. These actions are studied in terms of how each permutation cycle acts on the superconformal index of the theory in question. We present a prescription for refining the index with respect to the fugacities associated with the Abelian discrete symmetries that are subgroups of $G$. This allows us to study sequential gauging of various subgroups of $G$ and construct symmetry webs. We study the effects of 't Hooft anomalies and non-invertible symmetries that arise from discrete gauging on the index. When the whole symmetry $G$ is gauged, our results are in perfect agreement with a type of discrete operations on the quiver, known as wreathing, discussed in the literature. We provide a general prescription for computing the index for any wreathed quivers that contain unitary or special unitary gauge groups. We demonstrate this in an example of the 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ $\mathrm{U}(N)$ gauge theory with $n$ flavours and compare the results with gauging the charge conjugation symmetry associated with the flavour symmetry of such a theory.</description>

      <title>Poincare field theory for massless particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our main proposition is that field equations for all spins can be obtained from Casimir eigenvalue equations for Poincare group. We have already confirm that statement for massive scalar, spinor and vector fields in Ref.[1]. In the present article we are going to confirm this statement for massless vector, second and fourth rang tensor fields. In particular we will obtain Maxwell equations and Einstein equation in weak field approximation.
  As is well known, Wigner define a particles as irreducible representation of Poincare group [2,3]. But, as Weinberg noted in [4] irreducible representations for massless vector field with helicities $\pm 1$ do not exist. In the present article we will conform this statement for a wide class of massless fields. They are not Lorentz invariant since their Lorentz transformations have additional term in the form of gauge transformations. Such fields can appear in the theory only in the form which do not depend on corresponding gauge parameters. These forms are our equations of motion and they are by definition gauge invariant. So, the massless case is significantly different from massive one.</description>

      <title>The semi-chiral ring of supersymmetric $\phi^4$ theory as a representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short note, we study the infinite-dimensional symmetry algebras which appear in holomorphic twists of 4d $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric quantum field theories. In particular, we investigate whether their representation theory helps us understand the semi-chiral ring of $\frac{1}{4}$-BPS operators. We focus on the supersymmetric analogue of $\phi^4$ theory. Upon twist, this becomes a 4d $\beta \gamma$ system deformed by a cubic superpotential. We compute the semi-chiral ring in this example and organize it into modules for the algebra generated by the stress tensor. We find an intricate module structure and falsify the hypothesis that this could be a 4d analogue of the 2d Ising Virasoro minimal model.</description>

      <title>The $\mathfrak{su}(2)_{-1}$ WZW model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some WZW models on affine Lie superalgebras at critical level describe string theory on AdS backgrounds at critical values of the string tension. This is the case of $\mathfrak{psu}(1,1|2)_1$ for ${\rm AdS}_3 \times {\rm S}^3$ and potentially of $\mathfrak{u}(2|2)_1$ (or related algebras) for ${\rm AdS}_5 \times {\rm S}^5$. Many interesting features of these superalgebra models are already captured by their affine subalgebra $\mathfrak{su}(2)_{-1}$. In this paper we study the WZW model on $\mathfrak{su}(2)_{-1}$: we classify the representations, introduce a free field realisation, and decompose the free field modules in terms of $\mathfrak{su}(2)_{-1}$. We find continuous and discrete modular invariants and see that the latter naturally leads to considering superalgebra extensions of $\mathfrak{su}(2)_{-1}$. Lastly, we find an invariant for the free field theory of four symplectic bosons.</description>

      <title>Massive bigravity as a presymplectic BV-AKSZ sigma-model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a presymplectic BV-AKSZ sigma model encoding the ghost free massive bigravity theory action as well as its Batalin-Vilkovisky extension in terms of the finite-dimensional graded geometry of the target space. A characteristic feature of the construction is that the target space is realised as a quasi-regular submanifold of a linear graded manifold which, in turn, is a direct product of two copies of the shifted Poincar\'e Lie algebra. This graded manifold comes equipped with a natural presymplectcic structure and the compatible pre-$Q$ structure which is a sum of the Chevalley-Eilenberg differentials of each copy of the Poincare algebra and the interaction term. The constraints determining the submanifold are the supergeometrical realization of the known Deser-Van Nieuwenhuizen condition and its descendant.</description>

      <title>Phase diagrams of a nonlinear magnetic charged rotating AdS black hole with a quintessence field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the phase transitions and critical behavior of a nonlinear magnetically charged rotating AdS black hole, with a particular emphasis on the influence of a quintessence field. Our comprehensive thermodynamic analysis explores the impact of thermal fluctuations on the black hole's properties. We observe that for larger black holes, the corrected entropy remains positive, similar to the uncorrected case, which highlights the significant role of thermal fluctuations in modifying the entropy of smaller black holes. Through a meticulous analysis of various thermodynamic properties, we derive explicit analytical expressions for the critical points. Our findings demonstrate that the quintessence field significantly affects phase transitions, resulting in distinct critical phenomena. Notably, the black hole's phase transitions exhibit striking similarities to those observed in van der Waals fluids, offering deeper insights into the complex thermodynamic behavior of these systems across different scales.</description>

      <title>Truncating Dyson-Schwinger Equations Based on Lefschetz Thimble Decomposition and Borel Resummation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Truncating the Dyson-Schwinger (DS) equations in quantum field theory presents a practical challenge. In this paper, we consider the zero-dimensional prototype of the path integrals in quantum mechanics and quantum field theory. Using the Lefschetz thimble decomposition and the saddle point expansion, we derive multiple asymptotic formal series of the correlation function, which are associated with the (non-)perturbative saddle points. Furthermore, we reconstruct the exact correlation function employing the Borel resummation. Based on these exact correlation functions, we propose a truncation method of the DS equations using the large $n$ asymptotic behavior.</description>

      <title>Regularization of matrices in the covariant derivative interpretation of matrix models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study regularization of matrices in the covariant derivative interpretation of matrix models, a typical example of which is the type IIB matrix model. The covariant derivative interpretation provides a possible way in which curved spacetimes are described by matrices, which are viewed as differential operators. One needs to regularize the operators as matrices with finite size in order to apply the interpretation to nonperturbative calculations such as numerical simulations. We develop a regularization of the covariant derivatives in two dimensions by using the Berezin-Toeplitz quantization. As examples, we examine the cases of $S^2$ and $T^2$ in details.</description>

      <title>Holographic Non-Hermitian Lattices and Junctions with PT-Restoring RG Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct and study inhomogenoeus non-Hermitian strongly coupled holographic field theories. We consider two models: a lattice where in each site there is some inflow/outflow of matter and a Hermitian/non-Hermitian/Hermitian junction. Depending on whether we turn on a complex external gauge field, we find solutions that spontaneously break PT (thus hinting at a lack of unitary evolution) and solutions that do not. The former present an imaginary current responsible for the spontaneous breaking of PT. We also study the IR geometry of these solutions finding that they flow to a PT-unbroken fixed point. This leads us to claim that there is a PT-symmetry restoration in the IR, similar to the one observed in the perturbative setup of arXiv:2110.05289.</description>

      <title>Higher Time Derivative Theories From Integrable Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher Time Derivative Theories are generated by considering space-time rotated KdV and mKdV systems. These systems are then studied to see if/how instabilities, usually associated with higher time derivative theories, manifest on the classical level by presenting both analytic and numerical solutions. For a linearised version of these space-time rotated systems we present a detailed quantisation of the theory that highlights the known dilemma on higher time derivative theories, that we have either negative norm states or the Hamiltonian being unbounded from below.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue systems for integer orthogonal bases of multi-matrix invariants at finite N</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-matrix invariants, and in particular the scalar multi-trace operators of $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM with $U(N)$ gauge symmetry, can be described using permutation centraliser algebras (PCA), which are generalisations of the symmetric group algebras and independent of $N$. Free-field two-point functions define an $N$-dependent inner product on the PCA, and bases of operators have been constructed which are orthogonal at finite $N$. Two such bases are well-known, the restricted Schur and covariant bases, and both definitions involve representation-theoretic quantities such as Young diagram labels, multiplicity labels, branching and Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for symmetric groups. The explicit computation of these coefficients grows rapidly in complexity as the operator length increases. We develop a new method for explicitly constructing all the operators with specified Young diagram labels, based on an $N$-independent integer eigensystem formulated in the PCA. The eigensystem construction naturally leads to orthogonal basis elements which are integer linear combinations of the multi-trace operators, and the $N$-dependence of their norms are simple known dimension factors. We provide examples and give computer codes in SageMath which efficiently implement the construction for operators of classical dimension up to 14. While the restricted Schur basis relies on the Artin-Wedderburn decomposition of symmetric group algebras, the covariant basis relies on a variant which we refer to as the Kronecker decomposition. Analogous decompositions exist for any finite group algebra and the eigenvalue construction of integer orthogonal bases extends to the group algebra of any finite group with rational characters.</description>

      <title>On-Shell Approach to Black Hole Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an on-shell approach to study black hole mergers. Since, asymptotically, the initial and final states can be described by point-like spinning particles, we propose a massive three-point amplitude for the merger of two Schwarzschild black holes into a Kerr black hole. This three-point amplitude and the spectral function of the final state are fully determined by kinematics and the model-independent input about the black hole merger which is described by a complete absorption process. Using the Kosower-Maybee-O'Connell (KMOC) formalism, we then reproduce the classical conservation laws for momentum and angular momentum after the merger. As an application, we use the proposed three-point to compute the graviton emission amplitude, from which we extract the merger waveform to all orders in spin but leading in gravitational coupling. Up to sub-subleading order in spin, this matches the classical soft graviton theorem. We conclude with a comparison to black hole perturbation theory, which gives complementary amplitudes which are non-perturbative in the gravitational coupling but to leading order in the extreme mass ratio limit. This also highlights how boundary conditions on a Schwarzschild background can be used to rederive the proposed on-shell amplitudes for merger processes.</description>

      <title>Path integral of free fields and the determinant of Laplacian in warped space-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of computing the determinant of Klein-Gordon operator $\Delta = -\nabla^2 + M^2$ on Euclideanized $AdS_3$ with the Euclideanized time coordinate compactified with period $\beta$, $H_3/Z$, by explicitly computing its eigenvalues and computing their product. Upon assuming that eigenfunctions are normalizable on $H_3/Z$, we found that there are no such eigenfunctions. Upon closer examination, we discover that the intuition that $H_3/Z$ is like a box with normalizable eigenfunctions was false, and that there is, instead, a set of eigenfunctions which forms a continuum. Somewhat to our surprise, we find that there is a different operator $\tilde \Delta = r^2 \Delta$, which has the property that (1) the determinant of $\Delta$ and the determinant of $r^2 \Delta$ have the same dependence on $\beta$, and that (2) the Green's function of $\Delta$ can be spectrally decomposed into eigenfunctions of $\tilde \Delta$. We identify the $\tilde \Delta$ operator as the ``weighted Laplacian'' in the context of warped compactifications, and comment on possible applications.</description>

      <title>Particle creation from non-geodesic trajectories in multifield inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle production in de Sitter spacetime arises from the exponential expansion of space, rendering the Bunch-Davies vacuum perceived as a particle-containing state by late-time observers. For states defined as eigenstates of both momentum and the Hamiltonian, the Bunch-Davies vacuum exhibits a constant particle density per physical momentum. We explore particle production beyond this baseline, focusing on deviations from exact de Sitter conditions and non-gravitational interactions, such as slow-roll inflation or interactions arising from the coupling of inflation to other fields. Using Bogoliubov transformations, we calculate the number density of energy/momentum eigenstates. In single-field inflation, this density captures the observed spectral index of the primordial power spectrum, while in two-field models, it reflects the non-gravitational coupling driving background trajectory turning. We present analytical results applicable to various scenarios involving particle production from non-adiabatic processes during inflation.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from quasielliptic compact binaries in scalar-tensor theory to one-and-a-half post-Newtonian order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The orbit-averaged fluxes of energy and angular momentum generated by a compact binary system of nonspinning particles are obtained in a popular class of massless scalar-tensor theories with first-and-a-half post-Newtonian (1.5PN) accuracy, i.e., 2.5PN accuracy beyond the leading -1PN dipolar radiation. The secular evolution of the orbital elements (frequency and eccentricity) are then also obtained with 1.5PN accuracy. Three technical advances were necessary to obtain these results: (i) the decomposition of the scalar dipole moment as a Fourier series at 1PN order, along with the other moments at Newtonian order, (ii) the derivation of the formula for the passage to the center-of-mass frame at 2.5PN, including a novel hereditary term arising from the contribution of the radiation, and (iii) the complete treatment of the memory-like term appearing in the angular momentum flux. Moreover, as a byproduct of this work, I revisit in the Appendix the treatment in general relativity of the memory integral appearing at 2.5PN order in the angular momentum flux [arXiv:0908.3854], and find that the spurious divergence in the initial eccentricity $e_1$ found there is cured by a careful split between AC and DC terms.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the ring of Weyl invariant $E_8$ weak Jacobi forms is isomorphic to that of joint covariants of a binary sextic and a binary quartic form. The ring is therefore finitely generated. A minimal basis of generators is obtained from that already known for the ring of covariants.</description>

      <title>Probe of spatial geometry from scalar induced gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a novel probe of spatial geometry of the Universe through the observation of gravitational waves (GWs) induced by first order curvature perturbations. The existence of spatial curvature leaves imprints on the gravitational wave spectrum and formation of primordial black holes. Given the peaked scalar spectrum, the induced spectrum deviates from the flat space power spectrum and the deviation is dependent on the spatial curvature K and reheating temperature $T_{rh}$. For prolonged reheating and negative spatial curvature the spectrum is amplified enough and exhibits an additional peak solely due to K indicating a possible detection by future gravitational wave experiments including LISA and DECIGO. We also observe that the presence of negative spatial curvature improves the constraints on PBH formation, increasing the mass of black holes which are viable dark matter candidates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a scalar counterpart of the Schwarzschild-Melvin Universe was reported [arXiv:2410.02851]. We show this solution is a special case of a Schwarzschild black hole/mass in a scalar multipolar Universe, that can be constructed algebraically combining known vacuum solutions. This builds on the generalized Weyl construction for scalar-vacuum, that admits two, fully decoupled, independent harmonic functions: one for the gravitational sector and another for the scalar sector. Harmonic solutions with growing multipoles lead to naked singularities (at spatial infinity), including for the scalar counterpart of the Schwarzschild-Melvin; harmonic solutions with decaying (scalar) multipoles are asymptotically flat, but have a singular horizon, in accordance with no-scalar-hair theorems. The scalar-vacuum model can be mapped to a five dimensional pure gravity construction via Kaluza-Klein oxidization and, in this way, to the corresponding $D=5$ generalized Weyl construction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous normalizing flows are known to be highly expressive and flexible, which allows for easier incorporation of large symmetries and makes them a powerful tool for sampling in lattice field theories. Building on previous work, we present a general continuous normalizing flow architecture for matrix Lie groups that is equivariant under group transformations. We apply this to lattice gauge theories in two dimensions as a proof-of-principle and demonstrate competitive performance, showing its potential as a tool for future lattice sampling tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In these lecture notes, we provide an introduction to the moduli space of Riemann surfaces, a fundamental concept in the theories of 2D quantum gravity, topological string theory, and matrix models. We begin by reviewing some basic results concerning the recursive boundary structure of the moduli space and the associated cohomology theory. We then present Witten's celebrated conjecture and its generalisation, framing it as a recursive computation of cohomological field theory correlators via topological recursion. We conclude with a discussion of JT gravity in relation to hyperbolic geometry and topological strings. These lecture notes accompanied a series of lectures at the Les Houches school "Quantum Geometry (Mathematical Methods for Gravity, Gauge Theories and Non-Perturbative Physics)" in Summer 2024.</description>

      <title>Confined but chirally and chiral spin symmetric hot matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate properties of the quark--antiquark mesons at zero and finite temperature in the framework of a solvable chirally symmetric quark model with linear confining potential. The interquark interaction in the model is reminiscent of that derived in Coulomb gauge QCD, with the string tension being the only model parameter. We demonstrate that while the confining interaction induces spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry at T=0, chiral symmetry gets restored at a temperature Tch ~ 90 MeV for the string tension fixed to provide the phenomenological value of the quark condensate. This temperature is similar to Tch ~ 130 MeV observed on the lattice in the chiral limit for N_c=3. The physical mechanism responsible for the chiral symmetry restoration in the confining regime is Pauli blocking of the quark levels, required for the existence of a nonvanishing quark condensate, by the thermal excitations of the quarks and antiquarks. Thus, above the chiral restoration temperature, the meson-like states are chirally symmetric and approximately chiral spin symmetric. A crucial property of the confined meson-like light-light states above Tch is their size that exceeds drastically that in the chirally broken phase below Tch, in contrast to the heavy-heavy mesons that nearly preserve their size irrespective of the temperature. This property is a result of Pauli blocking of the quark and antiquark levels with small momenta. Furthermore, the root-mean-square radius of the states with J=0,1 diverges in the chiral limit. This unexpected property must be a key to understanding unusual features of the hot QCD matter as observed at RHIC and LHC. Consequently, the confining but chirally symmetric matter above Tch can be considered as a dense system of very large and strongly overlapping meson-like states (``strings'').</description>

      <title>Emergent spacetime supersymmetry in an interacting Kitaev chain with explicit supersymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of spacetime supersymmetry (SUSY) in an interacting Kitaev chain model with explicit microscopic $\mathcal{N}=1$ quantum mechanical SUSY. As the interaction strength is varied, the model transitions from a weak-coupling gapless phase with spontaneously broken SUSY to a strong-coupling phase with restored SUSY. In this paper, we numerically determine the transition point and investigate the phase structure around it. The weak-coupling phase is governed by the Ising conformal field theory (CFT) with central charge $c=1/2$ which agrees with the prediction made in our previous work and that the SUSY restoration transition which borders the strong-coupling gapped phase belongs to the $c=7/10$ tricritical Ising universality with emergent superconformal invariance. Crucially, the phase structure around the transition closely aligns with the scenario proposed by Zamolodchikov and others based on the integrable deformation of CFTs. These findings provide a concrete example of a lattice model where explicit microscopic supersymmetry at criticality, enriches the understanding of phase transitions governed by supersymmetric conformal field theories.</description>

      <title>Bumpified Haar Wavelets and Tsirelson's Bound: Some Mathematical Properties and Insights from Block Toeplitz Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a recent construction using bumpified Haar wavelets to demonstrate explicit violations of the Bell-Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality within the vacuum state in quantum field theory. The construction was tested for massless spinor fields in $(1+1)$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime and is claimed to achieve violations arbitrarily close to an upper bound known as Tsirelson's bound. We show that this claim can be reduced to a mathematical conjecture involving the maximal eigenvalue of a sequence of symmetric matrices composed of integrals of Haar wavelet products. More precisely, the asymptotic eigenvalue of this sequence should approach $\pi$. We present a formal argument using a subclass of wavelets, allowing us to reach $3.11052$. Although a complete proof remains elusive, we present further compelling numerical evidence to support it.</description>

      <title>Kernels and integration cycles in complex Langevin simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The method of complex Langevin simulations is a tool that can be used to tackle the complex-action problem encountered, for instance, in finite-density lattice quantum chromodynamics or real-time lattice field theories. The method is based on a stochastic evolution of the dynamical degrees of freedom via (complex) Langevin equations, which, however, sometimes converge to the wrong equilibrium distributions. While the convergence properties of the evolution can to some extent be assessed by studying so-called boundary terms, we demonstrate in this contribution that boundary terms on their own are not sufficient as a correctness criterion. Indeed, in their absence complex Langevin simulation results might still be spoiled by unwanted so-called integration cycles. In particular, we elaborate on how the introduction of a kernel into the complex Langevin equation can - in principle - be used to control which integration cycles are sampled in a simulation such that correct convergence is restored.</description>

      <title>Is the $w_0w_a$CDM cosmological parameterization evidence for dark energy dynamics partially caused by the excess smoothing of Planck CMB anisotropy data?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the performance of the spatially-flat dynamical dark energy (DE) $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization, with redshift-dependent DE fluid equation of state parameter $w(z) = w_0 + w_a z/(1+z)$, with and without a varying CMB lensing consistency parameter $A_L$, against Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) data (P18 and lensing) and a combination of non-CMB data composed of baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements that do not include DESI BAO data, Pantheon+ type Ia supernovae (SNIa) observations, Hubble parameter [$H(z)$] measurements, and growth factor ($f\sigma_8$) data points. From our most restrictive data set, P18+lensing+non-CMB, for the $w_0w_a$CDM+$A_L$ parameterization, we obtain $w_0=-0.879\pm 0.060$, $w_a=-0.39^{+0.26}_{-0.22}$, the asymptotic limit $w(z\to\infty) = w_0+w_a=-1.27^{+0.20}_{-0.17}$, and $A_L=1.078^{+0.036}_{-0.040}$ (all $1\sigma$ errors). This joint analysis of CMB and non-CMB data favors DE dynamics over a cosmological constant at $\sim 1\sigma$ and $A_L&gt;1$ at $\sim 2\sigma$, i.e. more smoothing of the Planck CMB anisotropy data than is predicted by the best-fit model. For the $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization with $A_L=1$ the evidence in favor of DE dynamics is larger, $\sim 2\sigma$, suggesting that at least part of the evidence for DE dynamics comes from the excess smoothing of the Planck CMB anisotropy data. For the $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization with $A_L=1$, there is a difference of $2.8\sigma$ between P18 and non-CMB cosmological parameter constraints and $2.7\sigma$ between P18+lensing and non-CMB constraints. When $A_L$ is allowed to vary these tensions reduced to $1.9\sigma$ and $2.1\sigma$ respectively. Our P18+lensing+non-CMB data compilation positively favors the $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization without and with a varying $A_L$ parameter over the flat $\Lambda$CDM model, and $w_0w_a$CDM+$A_L$ is also positively favored over $w_0w_a$CDM.</description>

Abstract: We investigate geometric aspects of co-equational parametric resurgence, by studying physical problems whose formal asymptotic solutions give rise to Borel transforms lying on an algebraic curve. This perspective allows us to elucidate concepts unique to parametric resurgence such as singularity structures, (virtual) turning points and the higher-order Stokes phenomenon. We construct examples as solutions to Borel plane partial differential equations using an algebraic curve ansatz before turning to the general analytic structure of co-equational resurgence problems, where we provide a systematic description of analytic continuation and Stokes constants through a Borel plane inner-outer matching procedure.</description>

      <title>Reverse stealth construction and its thermodynamic imprints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a class of solutions within the context of modified gravity theories, characterized by a non-trivial field that does not generate any back-reaction on the metric. These stealth configurations are effectively defined by the stealth conditions, which correspond to a vanishing stress-energy tensor. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to constructing this class of solutions. In contrast to the standard procedure, the starting point requires satisfying the stealth conditions for a given ansatz independently of the gravitational dynamics. This approach simultaneously determines the non-trivial field and the geometries capable of supporting it as a stealth configuration. Consequently, a gravity model can accommodate a stealth field only if its vacuum solution falls within the geometries permissible under stealth conditions. By applying this reverse procedure in the non-minimal $R\phi^2$ coupling, we recover all previously known stealth configurations and present new solutions. Although it seems intuitive to assume that this ``gravitationally undetectable'' scalar field leaves no physical traces, it remarkably reveals thermodynamic imprints, as its presence screens the black hole mass and modifies the entropy according to the first law.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2109.11207v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the interaction between magnetic monopoles and massless fermions. In the low energy limit, the monopole's magnetic field polarizes the fermions into purely in-going and out-going modes. Unitarity requires that the UV fermion-monopole interaction leads to non-trivial IR boundary conditions that relate the in-going to out-going modes. These non-trivial boundary conditions lead to what is known as the Callan-Rubakov effect. Here we derive the effective boundary condition by explicitly integrating out the UV degrees of freedom for the general class of spherically symmetric $SU(N)$ monopoles coupled to massless fermions of arbitrary representation. We then show that the boundary conditions preserve continuous symmetries without ABJ-type anomalies. As an application we explicitly derive the boundary conditions for the stable, spherically symmetric monopoles associated to the $SU(5)$ Georgi-Glashow model and comment on the relation to baryon number violation.</description>

      <title>The classical dynamics of gauge theories in the deep infrared</title>

Abstract: Gauge and gravitational theories in asymptotically flat settings possess infinitely many conserved charges associated with large gauge transformations or diffeomorphisms that are nontrivial at infinity. To what extent do these charges constrain the scattering in these theories? It has been claimed in the literature that the constraints are trivial, due to a decoupling of hard and soft sectors for which the conserved charges constrain only the dynamics in the soft sector. We show that the argument for this decoupling fails due to the failure in infinite dimensions of a property of symplectic geometry which holds in finite dimensions. Specializing to electromagnetism coupled to a massless charged scalar field in four dimensional Minkowski spacetime, we show explicitly that the two sectors are always coupled using a perturbative classical computation of the scattering map. Specifically, while the two sectors are uncoupled at low orders, they are coupled at quartic order via the electromagnetic memory effect. This coupling cannot be removed by adjusting the definitions of the hard and soft sectors (which includes the classical analog of dressing the hard degrees of freedom). We conclude that the conserved charges yield nontrivial constraints on the scattering of hard degrees of freedom. This conclusion should also apply to gravitational scattering and to black hole formation and evaporation.
  In developing the classical scattering theory, we show that generic Lorenz gauge solutions fail to satisfy the matching condition on the vector potential at spatial infinity proposed by Strominger to define the field configuration space, and we suggest a way to remedy this. We also show that when soft degrees of freedom are present, the order at which nonlinearities first arise in the scattering map is second order in Lorenz gauge, but can be third order in other gauges.</description>

Abstract: We study and extend the duality web unifying different decoupling limits of type II superstring theories and M-theory. We systematically build connections to different corners, such as Matrix theories, nonrelativistic string and M-theory, tensionless (and ambitwistor) string theory, Carrollian string theory, and Spin Matrix limits of AdS/CFT. We discuss target space, worldsheet, and worldvolume aspects of these limits in arbitrary curved backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Worldsheet Formalism for Decoupling Limits in String Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10565v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the bosonic sector of a decoupling limit of type IIA superstring theory, where a background Ramond-Ramond one-form is fined tuned to its critical value, such that it cancels the associated background D0-brane tension. The light excitations in this critical limit are D0-branes, whose dynamics is described by the Banks-Fischler-Shenker-Susskind (BFSS) Matrix theory that corresponds to M-theory in the Discrete Light-Cone Quantization (DLCQ). We develop the worldsheet formalism for the fundamental string in the same critical limit of type IIA superstring theory. We show that the fundamental string develops singularities on its worldsheet, whose topology is described by nodal Riemann spheres as in ambitwistor string theory. We study the T-duality transformations of this string sigma model and provide a worldsheet derivation for the recently revived and expanded duality web that unifies a zoo of decoupling limits in type II superstring theories. By matching the string worldsheet actions, we demonstrate how some of these decoupling limits are related to tensionless (and ambitwistor) string theory, Carrollian string theory, the Spin Matrix limits of the AdS/CFT correspondence, and more.</description>

      <title>Vacuum energy, temperature corrections and heat kernel coefficients in $(D + 1)$-dimensional spacetimes with nontrivial topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we make use of the generalized zeta function technique to investigate the vacuum energy, temperature corrections and heat kernel coefficients associated with a scalar field under a quasiperiodic condition in a $(D+1)$-dimensional conical spacetime. In this scenario we find that the renormalized vacuum energy, as well as the temperature corrections, are both zero. The nonzero heat kernel coefficients are the ones related to the usual Euclidean divergence, and also to the nontrivial aspects of the quaisperiodically identified conical spacetime topology. An interesting result that arises in this configuration is that for some values of the quasiperiodic parameter, the heat kernel coefficient associated with the nontrivial topology vanishes. In addition, we also consider the scalar field in a $(D+1)$-dimensional spacetime formed by the combination of a conical and screw dislocation topological defects. In this case, we obtain a nonzero renormalized vacuum energy density and its corresponding temperature corrections. Again, the nonzero heat kernel coefficients found are the ones related to the Euclidean and nontrivial topology divergences. For $D=3$ we explicitly show, in the massless scalar field case, the limits of low and high temperatures for the free energy. In the latter, we show that the free energy presents a classical contribution.</description>

      <title>Self-resonance during preheating: The case of $\alpha$-attractor models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, for the first time, we obtain a new class of solutions for the Hill-type differential equations, which emerge in the preheating self-resonance phase of the expanding Universe. We study, in particular, the class of symmetric and asymmetric scalar field potentials coming from the so-called $\alpha$-attractor models of the early Universe cosmology. By making a series expansion of the potential and employing perturbative techniques we reformulate the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation, which captures the dynamics of the curvature perturbation in these models, into a Hill equation. This last includes higher-order terms that were never solved in the literature. Namely, those coming from the cubic and quartic contributions of the scalar field potential. Then, we derive the expressions for the Floquet exponents of the Mukhanov-Sasaki variable. Our analytical results are then compared with numerical computations, showing a good agreement and thus making this method valuable for obtaining theoretical predictions with new observational applications in the contexts of Primordial Black Holes and Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves.</description>

Abstract: We calculate the general planar dual-conformally invariant double-pentagon and pentabox integrals in four dimensions. Concretely, we derive one-fold integral representations for these elliptic integrals over polylogarithms of weight three. These integral representations allow us to determine the respective symbols using consistency conditions alone. Together with the previously calculated double-box integral, these integrals suffice to express all two-loop planar scattering amplitudes in maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions -- which we thus calculate for any number of particles and any helicity configuration!</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The 4D-5D connection allows us to view the same near horizon geometry as part of a 4D black hole or a 5D black hole. A much studied example of this phenomenon is the BMPV black hole uplifted to 6D with flat base space versus Taub-NUT base space. These black holes have identical near horizon AdS_3 x S^3 geometry. In this paper, we study modes in AdS_3 x S^3 and identify those that correspond to supersymmetric hair modes in the full black hole spacetimes. We show that these modes satisfy non-normalisable boundary conditions in AdS_3. The non-normalisable boundary conditions are different for different hair modes and for different asymptotic completion. We also discuss how the supersymmetric hair modes on BMPV black holes fit into the classification of supersymmetric solutions of 6D supergravity.</description>

Abstract: This note study the soft behavior of Yang-Mills (YM) and bi-adjoint scalar (BAS) amplitudes at tree level, by using transmutation operators proposed by Cheung, Shen and Wen. By acting such transmutation operators to gravity amplitudes in the soft limit, we reproduce universal soft factors of YM amplitudes at the leading and sub-leading orders, and explain that the analogous universal soft behavior does not exist at the sub-sub-leading order. Subsequently, by acting the same operators on YM amplitudes, we obtain the universal soft factor of BAS amplitudes at the leading order. Furthermore, we find that a "weaker" version of universal soft behavior of BAS amplitudes holds at the sub-leading order, if we exclude the special $4$-point case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14990v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we focus on the backreaction effects due to the chiral anomaly. The chiral anomaly modifies conserved currents, introducing new contributions. For Maxwell gauge fields, this leads to a contribution to the electric current proportional to the background magnetic field, a phenomenon known as the chiral magnetic effect, which is widely discussed in the literature. In the case of gravitational fields, as we demonstrate, the anomaly induces a new contribution to the stress-energy tensor. We analyze the potential manifestations of these modifications in the gravitational field and hydrodynamics in chiral media, and we also comment on backreaction effects in electrodynamics. In each case, we observe the systematic appearance of Beltrami-type fields. In electrodynamics and hydrodynamics, a Beltrami field (e.g., magnetic field or fluid velocity) is a vector parallel to its own curl. We propose a generalization of Beltrami fields for tensorial gravitational perturbations, calling the respective solutions to the gravitational equations gravitational spheromaks by analogy with a similar phenomenon in electrodynamics. In the modified hydrodynamics of chiral media, vorticity asymptotically forms a Beltrami vector field in a generalized Gromeka-Beltrami flow.</description>

Abstract: Zero-point fluctuations in the background of a cosmic string provide an opportunity to study the effects of topology in quantum field theory. We use a scattering theory approach to compute quantum corrections to the energy density of a cosmic string, using the "ballpoint pen" and "flowerpot" models to allow for a nonzero string radius. For computational efficiency, we consider a massless field in $2+1$ dimensions. We show how to implement precise and unambiguous renormalization conditions in the presence of a deficit angle, and make use of Kontorovich-Lebedev techniques to rewrite the sum over angular momentum channels as an integral on the imaginary axis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study 2d $SU(N)$ QCD with an adjoint Dirac fermion. Assuming that the IR limit of the massless theory is captured by a WZW coset CFT, we show that this CFT can be decomposed into a sum of distinct CFTs, each representing a superselection sector (universe) of the gauge theory corresponding to different flux tube sectors. The CFTs describing each universe are related by non-invertible topological lines that exhibit a mixed anomaly with the $\mathbb{Z}^{(1)}_N$ 1-form symmetry. These symmetries exist along the entire RG flow thereby implying deconfinement of the massless theory. We begin by outlining the general features of the model for arbitrary $N$ and then provide a detailed analysis for $N=2$ and $N=3$. In these specific cases, we explicitly determine the IR partition function, identify the symmetries, and explore relevant deformations. Based on these findings and in alignment with various previous studies, we propose a phase diagram for the massive $SU(2)$ gauge theory and calculate its confining string tension.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we discuss a connection between Dirac operators on configuration spaces and Yang-Mills quantum field theory. We first show that the Hamilton operators of the self-dual and anti-self-dual sectors of a Yang-Mills quantum field theory emerge from unitary transformations of a Dirac equation formulated on a configuration space of gauge connections. Secondly, we formulate a Bott-Dirac operator on the configuration space and demonstrate how the Hamilton operator of a Yang-Mills quantum field theory coupled to a fermionic sector emerges from its square. Finally, we discuss a spectral invariant that emerges in this framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03097v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a comprehensive study of asymptotically flat spacetime in even dimensions $d\geq 4$. We analyze the most general boundary condition and asymptotic symmetry compatible with Penrose's definition of asymptotic null infinity $\mathscr{I}$ through conformal compactification. Following Penrose's prescription and using a minimal version of the Bondi-Sachs gauge, we show that $\mathscr{I}$ is naturally equipped with a Carrollian stress tensor whose radial derivative defines the asymptotic Weyl tensor. This analysis describes asymptotic infinity as a stretched horizon in the conformally compactified spacetime. We establish that charge aspects conservation can be written as Carrollian Bianchi identities for the asymptotic Weyl tensor. We then provide a covariant renormalization for the asymptotic symplectic potential, which results in a finite symplectic flux and asymptotic charges. The renormalization scheme works even in the presence of logarithmic anomalies.</description>

Abstract: We study the thermodynamics of the antiperiodic XXZ chain with anisotropy parameter {\eta}=i{\pi}/3 by means of the t-W method. We parameterize the eigenvalues of both the transfer matrix and the corresponding fused transfer matrix by their zero points instead of Bethe roots. Based on the patterns of the zero points distribution and the reconstructed entropy, we obtain the nonlinear integral equations (NLIEs) describing the thermodynamics of the model and compute its free energy at a finite temperature.</description>

      <title>Towards quantum gravity with neural networks: Solving the quantum Hamilton constraint of U(1) BF theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the canonical approach of loop quantum gravity, arguably the most important outstanding problem is finding and interpreting solutions to the Hamiltonian constraint. In this work, we demonstrate that methods of machine learning are in principle applicable to this problem. We consider $U(1)$ BF theory in 3 dimensions, quantized with loop quantum gravity methods. In particular, we formulate a master constraint corresponding to Hamilton and Gauss constraints using loop quantum gravity methods. To make the problem amenable for numerical simulation we fix a graph and introduce a cutoff on the kinematical degrees of freedom, effectively considering $U_q(1)$ BF theory at a root of unity. We show that the Neural Network Quantum State (NNQS) ansatz can be used to numerically solve the constraints efficiently and accurately. We compute expectation values and fluctuations of certain observables and compare them with exact results or exact numerical methods where possible.

      <title>Revisiting Buchdahl transformations: New static and rotating black holes in vacuum, double copy, and hairy extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates Buchdahl transformations within the framework of Einstein and Einstein-Scalar theories. Specifically, we establish that the recently proposed Schwarzschild-Levi-Civita spacetime can be obtained by means of a Buchdahl transformation of the Schwarschild metric along the spacelike Killing vector. The study extends Buchdahl's original theorem by combining it with the Kerr-Schild representation. In doing so, we construct new vacuum-rotating black holes in higher dimensions which can be viewed as the Levi-Civita extensions of the Myers-Perry geometries. Furthermore, it demonstrates that the double copy scheme within these new generated geometries still holds, providing an example of an algebraically general double copy framework. In the context of the Einstein-Scalar system, the paper extends the corresponding Buchdahl theorem to scenarios where a static vacuum seed configuration, transformed with respect to a spacelike Killing vector, generates a hairy black hole spacetime. We analyze the geometrical features of these spacetimes and investigate how a change of frame, via conformal transformations, leads to a new family of black hole spacetimes within the Einstein-Conformal-Scalar system.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent Aharonov-Bohm type topological effects on dipoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exploring the time-dependent characteristics of AB-type effects holds significant importance in contemporary physics and its practical applications. Here, we delve into the investigation of time-dependent topological effects emerging in AB-type experimental setups. We first analyze the topological effects on magnetic dipoles moving in closed trajectories around the time-varying magnetic field source solenoid, then on electrical dipoles around a time-varying electric field source in 2+1 dimensions without any approximation. Last, we discuss the characteristics of the topological effects by considering the identity and dualities between phases from an integrated perspective.</description>

      <title>Reflection and Transmission Amplitudes in a Digital Quantum Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01669v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we show how to measure in the setting of digital quantum simulations the reflection and transmission amplitudes of the one-dimensional scattering of a particle with a short-ranged potential. The main feature of the protocol is the coupling between the particle and an ancillary spin-1/2 degree of freedom. This allows us to reconstruct tomographically the scattering amplitudes, which are in general complex numbers, from the readout of one qubit. Applications of our results are discussed.</description>

      <title>Pseudoentanglement from tensor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pseudoentangled states are defined by their ability to hide their entanglement structure: they are indistinguishable from random states to any observer with polynomial resources, yet can have much less entanglement than random states. Existing constructions of pseudoentanglement based on phase- and/or subset-states are limited in the entanglement structures they can hide: e.g., the states may have low entanglement on a single cut, on all cuts at once, or on local cuts in one dimension. Here we introduce new constructions of pseudoentangled states based on (pseudo)random tensor networks that affords much more flexibility in the achievable entanglement structures. We illustrate our construction with the simplest example of a matrix product state, realizable as a staircase circuit of pseudorandom unitary gates, which exhibits pseudo-area-law scaling of entanglement in one dimension. We then generalize our construction to arbitrary tensor network structures that admit an isometric realization. A notable application of this result is the construction of pseudoentangled `holographic' states whose entanglement entropy obeys a Ryu-Takayanagi `minimum-cut' formula, answering a question posed in [Aaronson et al., arXiv:2211.00747].</description>

      <title>Unitarity and strong graded locality of holomorphic vertex operator superalgebras with central charge at most 24</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that all nice holomorphic vertex operator superalgebras (VOSAs) with central charge at most 24 and with non-trivial odd part are unitary, apart from the hypothetical ones arising as fake copies of the shorter moonshine VOSA or of the latter tensorized with a real free fermion VOSA. Furthermore, excluding the ones with central charge 24 of glueing type III and with no real free fermion, we show that they are all strongly graded-local. In particular, they naturally give rise to holomorphic graded-local conformal nets. In total, we are able to prove that 910 of the 969 nice holomorphic VOSAs with central charge 24 and with non-trivial odd part are strongly graded-local, without counting hypothetical fake copies of the shorter moonshine VOSA tensorized with a real free fermion VOSA.</description>

      <title>Dirac Operators on Configuration Spaces: Fermions with Half-integer Spin, Real Structure, and Yang-Mills Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07290v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we continue the development of a spectral triple-like construction on a configuration space of gauge connections. We have previously shown that key elements of bosonic and fermionic quantum field theory emerge from such a geometrical framework. In this paper we solve a central problem concerning the inclusion of fermions with half-integer spin into this framework. We map the tangent space of the configuration space into a similar space based on spinors and use this map to construct a Dirac operator on the configuration space. We also construct a real structure acting in a Hilbert space over the configuration space. Finally, we show that the self-dual and anti-self-dual sectors of the Hamiltonian of a non-perturbative quantum Yang-Mills theory emerge from a unitary transformation of a Dirac equation on a configuration space of gauge fields. The dual and anti-dual sectors emerge in a two-by-two matrix structure.</description>
