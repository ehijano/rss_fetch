      <title>Microwave-Induced Cooling in Double Quantum Dots: Achieving Millikelvin Temperatures to Reduce Thermal Noise around Spin Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin qubits in gate-defined quantum dots are emerging as a leading technology due to their scalability and long coherence times. However, maintaining these qubits at ultra-low temperatures typically requires complex cryogenic systems. This paper proposes a novel gate-defined double quantum dot (DQD) cooling system using microwave-induced state depopulation and phonon filtering to achieve local temperatures below 10 mK at a bath temperature of 1 K. The system utilizes microwave-induced state depopulation and phonon filtering, combined with fast cyclic detuning of the quantum dot on-site energies and Rabi oscillations, to efficiently transfer thermal populations to the ground state, thereby surpassing natural thermal transition rates. The cooling cycle involves adjusting gate potentials to drive the system through adiabatic and diabatic transitions, complemented by microwave pulses resonant with specific energy level differences. This mechanism continuously pumps the population from excited states into the ground state, effectively reducing the system's temperature. Numerical calculations demonstrate the feasibility of achieving these low local temperatures, with detailed analysis showing the sensitivity of cooling performance to detuning energy, magnetic field strength, and diabatic return time.</description>

      <title>Perpendicular-anisotropy artificial spin ice with spontaneous ordering: a platform for neuromorphic computing with flexible timescales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arrays of coupled nanomagnets have wide-ranging fundamental and practical applications in artificial spin ices, neuromorphic computing and spintronics. However, lacking in these fields are nanomagnets with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy with sufficient magnetostatic interaction. This would not only open up new possibilities for artificial spin ice geometries but also enable novel coupling methods for applications. Here we demonstrate a method to engineer the energy landscape of artificial spin lattices with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. With this, we are able to realize for the first time magnetostatically-coupled 2D lattices of out-of-plane Ising spins that spontaneously order at room temperature on timescales that can be precisely engineered. We show how this property, together with straightforward electrical interfacing, make this system a promising platform for reservoir computing. Our results open the way to investigate the thermodynamics of out-of-plane magnetostatically coupled nanomagnet arrays with novel spin ice geometries, as well as to exploit such nanomagnet arrays in unconventional computing, taking advantage of the adjustable temporal dynamics and strong coupling between nanomagnets.</description>

      <title>A framework for extracting the rates of photophysical processes from biexponentially decaying photon emission data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is strong interest in designing and realizing optically-active semiconductor nanostructures of greater complexity for applications in fields ranging from biomedical engineering to quantum computing. While these increasingly complex nanostructures can implement progressively sophisticated optical functions, the presence of more material constituents and interfaces also leads to increasingly complex exciton dynamics. In particular, the rates of carrier trapping and detrapping in complex heterostructures are critically important for advanced optical functionality, but they can rarely be directly measured. In this work, we develop a model that includes trapping and release of carriers by optically inactive states. The model explains the widely observed biexponential decay of the photoluminescence signal from neutral excitons in low dimensional semiconductor emitters. The model also allows determination of likelihood intervals for all the transition rates involved in the emission dynamics, without the use of approximations. Furthermore, in cases for which the high temperature limit is suitable, the model leads to specific values of such rates, outperforming reduced models previously used to estimate those quantities. We demonstrate the value of this model by applying it to time resolved photoluminescence measurements of CdSeTe/CdS heterostructures. We obtain values not only for the radiative and nonradiative lifetimes, but also for the delayed photoluminescence originating in trapping and release.</description>

      <title>Single-molecule junctions map the interplay between electrons and chirality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay of electrons with a chiral medium has a diverse impact across science and technology, influencing drug separation, chemical reactions, and electronic transport. In particular, such electronchirality interactions can significantly affect charge and spin transport in chiral conductors, ranging from bulk semiconductors down to individual molecules. Consequentially, these interactions are appealing for spintronic manipulations. However, an atomistic mapping of the different electron chirality interactions and their potential for spintronics has yet to be reached. Here, we find that single molecule junctions based on helicene molecules behave as a combined magnetic diode and spin valve device. This dual functionality is used to identify the coexistence of different electron chirality interactions at the atomic scale. Specifically, we find that the magnetic diode behavior arises from an interaction between the angular momentum of electrons in a chiral medium and magnetic fields, whereas the spin valve functionality stems from an interaction between the electron spin and a chiral medium. The coexistence of these two interactions in the same atomic scale system is then used to identify the distinct properties of each interaction. This work uncovers the different electron chirality interactions available at the atomic level. The found concurrent existence of such interactions can broaden the available methods for spintronics by combining their peculiar functionalities.</description>

      <title>Tunneling photo-thermoelectric effect in monolayer graphene/bilayer hexagonal boron nitride/bilayer graphene asymmetric van der Waals tunnel junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene is known to exhibit a pronounced photo-thermoelectric effect (PTE) in its in-plane carrier transport and attracting attention toward various optoelectronic applications. In this study, we demonstrate an out-of-plane PTE by utilizing electron tunneling across a barrier, namely, the tunneling photo-thermoelectric effect (TPTE). This was achieved in a monolayer graphene (MLG)/bilayer hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN)/bilayer graphene (BLG) asymmetric tunnel junction. MLG and BLG exhibit different cyclotron resonance (CR) optical absorption energies when their energies are Landau quantized under an out-of-plane magnetic field. We tuned the magnetic field under mid-infrared (MIR) irradiation to bring MLG into CR conditions, whereas BLG was not in CR. The CR absorption in the MLG generates an electron temperature difference between the MLG and BLG, and induces an out-of-plane TPTE voltage across the h-BN tunnel barrier. The TPTE exhibited a unique dependence on the Fermi energy of the MLG, which differed from that of the in-plane PTE of the MLG. The TPTE signal was large when the Fermi energy of the MLG was tuned near the phase transition between the quantum Hall state (QHS) and non-QHS, that is, the transition between carrier localization and delocalization. The TPTE provides another degree of freedom for probing the electronic and optoelectronic properties of two-dimensional material heterostructures.</description>

      <title>All-Electrical Layer-Spintronics in Altermagnetic Bilayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrical manipulation of spin-polarized current is highly desirable yet tremendously challenging in developing ultracompact spintronic device technology. Here we propose a scheme to realize the all-electrical manipulation of spin-polarized current in an altermagnetic bilayer. Such a bilayer system can host layer-spin locking, in which one layer hosts a spin-polarized current while the other layer hosts a current with opposite spin polarization. An out-of-plane electric field breaks the layer degeneracy, leading to a gate-tunable spin-polarized current whose polarization can be fully reversed upon flipping the polarity of the electric field. Using first-principles calculations, we show that CrS bilayer with C-type antiferromagnetic exchange interaction exhibits a hidden layer-spin locking mechanism that enables the spin polarization of the transport current to be electrically manipulated via the layer degree of freedom. We demonstrate that sign-reversible spin polarization as high as 87% can be achieved at room temperature. This work presents the pioneering concept of layer-spintronics which synergizes altermagnetism and bilayer stacking to achieve efficient electrical control of spin.</description>

      <title>Commensurate and Incommensurate Chern Insulators in Magic-angle Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between strong electron-electron interaction and symmetry breaking can have profound influence on the topological properties of materials. In magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG), the flat band with a single SU(4) flavor associated with the spin and valley degrees of freedom gains non-zero Chern number when C2z symmetry or C2zT symmetry is broken. Electron-electron interaction can further lift the SU(4) degeneracy, leading to the Chern insulator states. Here we report a complete sequence of zero-field Chern insulators at all odd integer fillings (v = +-1, +-3) with different chirality (C = 1 or -1) in hBN aligned MATBG which structurally breaks C2z symmetry. The Chern states at hole fillings (v = -1, -3), which are firstly observed in this work, host an opposite chirality compared with the electron filling scenario. By slightly doping the v = +-3 states, we have observed new correlated insulating states at incommensurate moir\'e fillings which is highly suggested to be intrinsic Wigner crystals according to our theoretical calculations. Remarkably, we have observed prominent Streda-formula violation around v = -3 state. By doping the Chern gap at v = -3 with notable number of electrons at finite magnetic field, the Hall resistance Ryx robustly quantizes to ~ h/e2 whereas longitudinal resistance Rxx vanishes, indicating that the chemical potential is pinned within a Chern gap, forming an incommensurate Chern insulator. By providing the first experimental observation of zero-field Chern insulators in the flat valence band, our work fills up the overall topological framework of MATBG with broken C2z symmetry. Our findings also demonstrate that doped topological flat band is an ideal platform to investigate exotic incommensurate correlated topological states.</description>

      <title>Ideal topological flat bands in chiral symmetric moir\'e systems from non-holomorphic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies on topological flat bands and their fractional states have revealed increasing similarities between moir\'e flat bands and Landau levels (LLs). For instance, like the lowest LL, topological exact flat bands with ideal quantum geometry can be constructed using the same holomorphic function structure, $\psi_{\mathbf{k}} = f_{\mathbf{k}-\mathbf{k}_0}(z) \psi_{\mathbf{k}_0}$, where $f_{\mathbf{k}}(z)$ is a holomorphic function. This holomorphic structure has been the foundation of existing knowledge on constructing ideal topological flat bands. In this Letter, we report a new family of ideal topological flat bands where the $f$ function does not need to be holomorphic. We provide both model examples and universal principles, as well as an analytic method to construct the wavefunctions of these flat bands, revealing their universal properties, including ideal quantum geometry and a Chern number of $C = \pm 2$ or higher.</description>

      <title>Strain-driven domain wall network with chiral junctions in an antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials with antiferromagnetic order have recently emerged as promising candidates in spintronics based on their beneficial characteristics such as vanishing stray fields and ultra-fast dynamics. At the same time more complex localized non-coplanar magnetic states as for instance skyrmions are in the focus of applications due to their intriguing properties such as the topological Hall effect. Recently a conceptual shift has occurred to envision the use of such magnetic defects not only in one-dimensional race track devices but to exploit their unique properties in two-dimensional networks. Here we use local strain in a collinear antiferromagnet to induce non-coplanar domain wall junctions, which connect in a very specific way to form extended networks. We combine spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy with density functional theory to characterize the different building blocks of the network, and unravel the origin of the handedness of triple-junctions and the size of the arising topological orbital moments.</description>

      <title>Electric field control of superconductivity and quantized anomalous Hall effects in rhombohedral tetralayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inducing superconducting correlations in chiral edge states is predicted to generate topologically protected zero energy modes with exotic quantum statistics. Experimental efforts to date have focused on engineering interfaces between superconducting materials, typically amorphous metals, and semiconducting quantum Hall or quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) systems. However, the strong interfacial disorder inherent can prevent the formation of isolated topological modes. An appealing alternative is to use low-density flat band materials where the ground state can be tuned between intrinsic superconducting and quantum anomalous Hall states using only the electric field effect. However, quantized transport and superconductivity have not been simultaneously achieved. Here, we show that rhombohedral tetralayer graphene aligned to a hexagonal boron nitride substrate hosts a quantized anomalous Hall state at superlattice filling $\nu = -1$ as well as a superconducting state at $\nu \approx -3.1$ at zero magnetic field. Remarkably, gate voltage can also be used to actuate nonvolatile switching of the chirality in the quantum anomalous Hall state, allowing arbitrarily reconfigurable networks of topological edge modes in locally gated devices. Thermodynamic compressibility measurements further reveal a topologically ordered fractional Chern insulator at $\nu = 2/3$, also stable at zero magnetic field, enabling proximity coupling between superconductivity and fractionally charged edge modes. Finally, we show that integrating an additional transition metal dichalcogenide layer to the heterostructure enhances the maximum superconducting critical temperature and nucleates new superconducting pockets, while leaving the topology of $\nu = -1$ the quantum anomalous Hall state intact. Our results pave the way for hybrid interfaces between superconductors and topological edge states in the low-disorder limit.</description>

      <title>Neel proximity effect in superconductor/antiferromagnet heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that the cornerstone of the proximity effect in superconductor/ferromagnet heterostructures is a generation of triplet Cooper pairs from singlet Cooper pairs inherent in a conventional superconductor. This proximity effect brought a lot of new exciting physics and gave a powerful impulse to development of superconducting spintronics. Nowadays a new direction of spintronics is actively developing, which is based on antiferromagnets and their heterostructures. It is called antiferromagnetic spintronics. By analogy with an important role played by triplet Cooper pairs in conventional superconducting spintronics based on ferromagnets the question arises: does the triplet proximity effect exist in superconductor/antiferromagnet heterostructures and, if so, what are the properties of the induced triplet correlations and the prospects for use in superconducting spintronics? Recent theoretical findings predict that despite the absence of a net magnetization, the Neel magnetic order of the antiferromagnet does give rise to specific spin-triplet correlations at superconductor/antiferromagnet interfaces. They were called Neel triplet correlations. The goal of this review is to discuss the current understanding of the fundamental physics of these Neel triplet correlations and their physical manifestations.</description>

      <title>Abelian Anyons on Flux-Quantized M5-Branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While fractional quantum Hall systems provide the best experimental evidence yet of (abelian) anyons plausibly necessary for future fault-tolerant quantum computation, like all strongly-coupled quantum systems their physics is not deeply understood. However, generally a promising approach is to (holographically) realize such systems on branes in string/M-theory; and specifically an old argument by Hellerman &amp; Susskind gives a sketch of fractional quantum Hall states arising via discrete light cone quantization of M5/M9-brane intersections.
  Here we present a rigorous derivation of abelian anyon quantum states on M5$\perp$MO9-branes ("open M5-branes") on the discrete light cone, after globally completing the traditional local field content on the M5-worldvolume via a flux-quantization law compatible with the ambient 11d supergravity, specifically taken to be in the unstable co-Homotopy cohomology ("Hypothesis H").
  The main step in the proof uses a theorem of Okuyama to identify co-Homotopy moduli spaces with configuration spaces of strings with charged endpoints, and identifies their loop spaces with cobordism of framed links that, under topological light cone quantization, turn out to be identified with the regularized Wilson loops of abelian Chern-Simons theory.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional non-volatile valley spin valve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A spin valve represents a well-established device concept in magnetic memory technologies, whose functionality is determined by electron transmission being controlled by the relative alignment of magnetic moments of the two ferromagnetic layers. Recently, the advent of valleytronics has conceptualized a valley spin valve (VSV) - a device that utilizes the valley degree of freedom and spin-valley locking to achieve a similar valve effect without relying on magnetism. In this study, we propose a non-volatile VSV (n-VSV) based on a two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectric semiconductor where the resistance of the n-VSV is controlled by the ferroelectric domain wall between the two uniformly polarized domains. Focusing on the 1T'' phase of MoS2, which is known to be ferroelectric down to a monolayer and using density functional theory (DFT) combined with the quantum-transport calculations, we demonstrate that switching between the uniformly polarized state and the state with oppositely polarized domains separated by a domain wall results in resistance change of as high as 10^7. This giant VSV effect occurs due to transmission being strongly dependent on matching (mismatching) the valley-dependent spin polarizations in the two domains with the same (opposite) ferroelectric polarization orientations, when the chemical potential of 1T''-MoS2 lies within the spin-split valleys. Our work paves a new route for realizing high-performance nonvolatile valleytronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A tight-binding model for $e_g$ orbitals on a simple cubic lattice with finite thickness is investigated. The hopping integrals for nearest-neighboring sites are considered. We examine the electronic band structures for systems with (001), (110), and (111) surfaces. Electronic states well localized around the surfaces are found for the (110) and (111) surfaces. In particular, the surface state is flat and extends in the entire Brillouin zone for the (111) surface, provided the bulk band projected onto the surface Brillouin zone is gapped. We also find that these surface states possess octupole moments in both the (110) and (111) surface cases.</description>

      <title>Spin relaxation in graphite due to spin-orbital-phonon interaction from first-principles density-matrix approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We predict "intrinsic" spin relaxation times ($T_{1}$) of graphite due to spin-orbit-phonon interaction, i.e., the combination of spin-orbit coupling and electron-phonon interaction, using our developed first-principles density-matrix approach. We obtain ultralong $T_{1}$, e.g., $\sim$600 ns at 300 K, which leads to ultralong in-plane spin diffusion length $\sim$110 $\mu$m within the drift-diffusion model. Our prediction sets the upper bound of $T_{1}$ of graphite at each given temperature and Fermi level. The anisotropy ratios of $T_{1}$ or values of $T_{1z}/T_{1x}$ are found small and around 0.6. We examine the applicability of the well-known Elliot-Yafet (EY) relation, which declares that spin relaxation rate $T_{1\alpha}^{-1}$ ($\alpha=x,y,z$) is proportional to the product of the ensemble average of spin mixing parameter $\left\langle b_{\alpha}^{2}\right\rangle $ and carrier relaxation rate $\tau_{p}^{-1}$. Our numerical tests suggest that the EY relation works qualitatively if the degeneracy threshold $t^{\mathrm{deg}}$ for evaluating $b_{\alpha}^{2}$ is elatively large (not much smaller than or comparable to $k_{B}T$), e.g., $10^{-3}$ eV or larger, but fails if $t^{\mathrm{deg}}$ is too tiny (much smaller than $k_{B}T$), e.g., $10^{-6}$ eV or smaller.</description>

      <title>Machine learning-based determination of magnetic parameters from magnetic images with different imaging scales</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The determination of material parameters is significantly important in material science, which is often a challenging task. Recently, advancements have shown that magnetic parameters, such as the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), can be estimated from a magnetic domain image using machine learning (ML). This development suggests a potential shift in how magnetic parameters are determined, moving away from traditional measurement techniques to more innovative methods involving image-based inputs processed by ML. In previous studies, the test images used for estimation always matched the training images in size. However, since image size is contingent on the microscopy technique used, the ability to accurately estimate parameters from images of varying sizes is essential. Here, we investigated the feasibility of estimating the DMI constant and saturation magnetization from magnetic domain images of different sizes using ML. We successfully demonstrated that it is possible to estimate these parameters even when the imaging sizes differ between training and test datasets. Additionally, our comparison of the estimation accuracy for the DMI constant and saturation magnetization revealed that the tolerance for differences in image size varies depending on the specific parameter being estimated. These findings could have a significant impact on the future methods of determining magnetic parameters.</description>

      <title>Electron States Emerging at Magnetic Domain Wall of magnetic semiconductors with strong Rashba effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present article, we explore the electron properties of magnetic semiconductors with strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling taking into account the presence of domain walls at the sample surface. We consider antiphase domain walls separating domains with both in-plane and out-of-plane magnetization as well as noncollinear domain walls. First, we propose the model and unveil general physical picture of phenomenon supported by analytical arguments. Further, we perform a comprehensive tight-binding numerical calculations to provide a profound understanding of our findings. A domain wall separating domains with any polarization directions is demonstrated to host a bound state. What is more interesting is that we predict that either of these domain walls also induces one-dimensional resonant state. The surface energy spectrum and spin polarization of the states are highly sensitive to the magnetization orientation in the adjacent domains. The spectral broadening and the spatial localization of the resonant state depend significantly on a relation between the Rashba splitting and the exchange one. Our estimation shows that chiral conducting channels associated with the long-lived resonant states can emerge along the magnetic domain walls and can be accessed experimentally at the surface of BiTeI doped with transition metal atoms.</description>

      <title>Exploring van der Waals cuprate superconductors using a hybrid microwave circuit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of two-dimensional van der Waals materials is a frontier of condensed matter physics and quantum devices. However, characterizing such materials remains challenging due to the limitations of bulk material techniques, necessitating the development of specialized methods. In this study, we investigate the superconducting properties of Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x flakes by integrating them with a hybrid superconducting microwave resonator. The hybrid resonator is significantly modified by the interaction with the flake while maintaining a high quality factor. We also observe a significant upshift of the resonator frequency with increasing temperature, as well as a positive nonlinearity. These effects originate from a presently unknown microscopic mechanism within the flake, and can be modeled as a two-level system bath interacting with resonant mode. Our findings open a path for high quality hybrid circuits with van der Waals flakes for exploring novel materials and developing new devices for quantum technology.</description>

      <title>Dissipation and Interaction-Controlled Non-Hermitian Skin Effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian skin effects (NHSEs) have recently been investigated extensively at the single-particle level. When many-body interactions become dominant, novel non-Hermitian physical phenomena can emerge. In this work, we theoretically study NHSEs controlled by dissipation and interaction. We consider a 1D zigzag Bose-Hubbard lattice, subject to magnetic flux, staggered onsite single-particle loss, and uniform onsite two-particle loss. When the two-particle loss is small, two-body bound eigenstates (i.e., doublons) are all localized at the same boundary due to the interplay of the magnetic flux and staggered single-particle loss. While, for strong two-particle loss, the localization direction of doublons is unexpectedly reversed. This is attributed to the effective strong nonreciprocal hopping of doublons induced by the virtual second-order and third-order hopping processes of particle pairs with the combination of the magnetic flux, staggered single-particle loss, and strong two-particle loss. Moreover, a two-particle gain can induce the same skin-localization and reversal features of doublons, which can be utilized to dynamically observe the NHSE and its reversal of doublons controlled by interactions. Our results open up a new avenue for exploring novel non-Hermitian phenomena in many-body systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study double quantum dots coupled to a quasistatic cavity mode with high mode-volume compression allowing for strong light-matter coupling. Besides the cavity-mediated interaction, electrons in different double quantum dots interact with each other via dipole-dipole (Coulomb) interaction. For attractive dipolar interaction, a cavity-induced ferroelectric quantum phase transition emerges leading to ordered dipole moments. Surprisingly, we find that the phase transition can be either continuous or discontinuous, depending on the ratio between the strengths of cavity-mediated and Coulomb interactions. We show that, in the strong coupling regime, both the ground and the first excited states of an array of double quantum dots are squeezed Schr\"{o}dinger cat states. Such states are actively discussed as high-fidelity qubits for quantum computing, and thus our proposal provides a platform for semiconductor implementation of such qubits. We also calculate gauge-invariant observables such as the net dipole moment, the optical conductivity, and the absorption spectrum beyond the semiclassical approximation.</description>

      <title>Edge-dependent anomalous topology in synthetic photonic lattices subject to discrete step walks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anomalous topological phases, where edge states coexist with topologically trivial Chern bands, can only appear in periodically driven lattices. When the driving is smooth and continuous, the bulk-edge correspondence is guaranteed by the existence of a bulk invariant known as the winding number. However, in lattices subject to periodic discrete-step walks the existence of edge states does not only depend on bulk invariants but also on the boundary. This is a consequence of the absence of an intrinsic time-dependence or micromotion in discrete-step walks. We report the observation of edge states and a simultaneous measurement of the bulk invariants in anomalous topological phases in a two-dimensional synthetic photonic lattice subject to discrete-step walks. The lattice is implemented using time multiplexing of light pulses in two coupled fibre rings, in which one of the dimensions displays real space dynamics and the other one is parametric. The presence of edge states is inherent to the periodic driving and depends on the properties of the boundary in the implemented two-band model with zero Chern number. We provide a suitable expression for the topological invariants whose calculation does not rely on micromotion dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10409v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The density-density correlation functions (most singular parts) of chiral Luttinger liquids forming the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) edge are systematically derived in presence of a point-contact junction acting as a localised scalar impurity and are shown to be expressible as compact analytical functions with second order poles and involving the bare scale-independent reflection and transmission coefficients. The results are validated on comparison with standard fermionic perturbation theory. The linear response Hall conductance in the absence of a point-contact is recovered from the obtained density-density correlation functions (DDCF). The system under consideration is inhomogeneous with broken translational invariance and for such systems in one dimension, the connected moments of the density fluctuation operator beyond second order need not be included in order to retrieve the most singular parts of the correlations. The reason being that all odd moments of the density are zero and all higher order even moments are less singular than the quadratic moment. The implications of these results when used in conjunction with bosonization methods in presence of impurity backscattering is briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Irregular Bloch Zener oscillations in two-dimensional flat-band Dirac materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When a static electrical field is applied to a two-dimensional (2D) Dirac material, Landau-Zener transition (LZT) and Bloch-Zener oscillations can occur. Employing alpha-T3 lattices as a paradigm for a broad class of 2D Dirac materials, we uncover two phenomena. First, due to the arbitrarily small energy gaps near a Dirac point that make it more likely for LZTs to occur than in other regions of the Brillouin zone, the distribution of differential LZT probability in the momentum space can form a complicated morphological pattern. Second, a change in the LZT morphology as induced by a mutual switching of the two distinct Dirac points can lead to irregular Bloch-Zener oscillations characterized by a non-smooth behavior in the time evolution of the electrical current density associated with the oscillation. These phenomena are due to mixed interference of quantum states in multiple bands modulated by the geometric and dynamic phases. We demonstrate that the adiabatic-impulse model describing Landau-Zener-Stuckelberg interferometry can be exploited to calculate the phases, due to the equivalence between the alpha-T3 lattice subject to a constant electrical field and strongly periodically driven two- or three-level systems. The degree of irregularity of Bloch-Zener oscillations can be harnessed by selecting the morphology pattern, which is potentially experimentally realizable.</description>

Abstract: The phenomenon of spin-dependent quantum scattering in two-dimensional (2D) pseudospin-1/2 Dirac materials leading to a relativistic quantum chimera was recently uncovered. We investigate spin-dependent Dirac electron optics in 2D pseudospin-1 Dirac materials, where the energy-band structure consists of a pair of Dirac cones and a flat band. In particular, with a suitable combination of external electric fields and a magnetic exchange field, electrons with a specific spin orientation (e.g., spin-down) can be trapped in a class of long-lived edge modes, generating resonant scattering. The spin-dependent edge states are a unique feature of flat-band Dirac materials and have no classical correspondence. However, electrons with the opposite spin (i.e., spin up) undergo conventional quantum scattering with a classical correspondence, which can be understood in the framework of Dirac electron optics. A consequence is that the spin-down electrons produce a large scattering probability with broad scattering angle distribution in both near- and far-field regions, while the spin-up electrons display the opposite behavior. Such characteristically different behaviors of the electrons with opposite spins lead to spin polarization that can be as high as nearly 100%.</description>

      <title>An experimental scheme for determining the Berry phase in two-dimensional quantum materials with a flat band</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Experimentally feasible methods to determine the Berry phase, a fundamental quantity characterizing a quantum material, are often needed in applications. We develop an approach to detecting the Berry phase by using a class of two-dimensional (2D) Dirac materials with a flat band, the $\alpha$-$\mathcal{T}_3$ lattices. The properties of this class of quantum materials are controlled by a single parameter $0 \le \alpha \le 1$, where the left and right endpoints correspond to graphene with pseudospin-1/2 and the dice lattice with pseudospin-1 Dirac-Weyl quasiparticles, respectively, and each specific value of $\alpha$ represents a material with a unique Berry phase. Applying a constant electric field to the $\alpha$-$\mathcal{T}_3$ lattice, we calculate the resulting electric current and find a one-to-one correspondence between the current and the Berry phase in both the linear and nonlinear response regimes. In the linear (Kubo) regime, the main physics is the Zitterbewegung effect. In the nonlinear regime, the Schwinger mechanism dominates. Beyond the nonlinear regime, Bloch-Zener oscillations can arise. Measuring the current thus provides an effective and experimentally feasible way to determine the Berry phase for this spectrum of 2D quantum materials.</description>

Abstract: Quantum spin Hall insulators have attracted significant attention in recent years. Understanding the optical properties and spin Hall effect in these materials is crucial for technological advancements. In this study, we present theoretical analyses to explore the optical properties, Berry curvature and spin Hall conductivity of pristine and perturbed PbBiI using the linear combination of atomic orbitals and the Kubo formula. The system is not centrosymmetric and it is hosting at the same time Rashba spin-splitting and quantized spin Hall conductivity. Our calculations reveal that the electronic structure can be modified using staggered exchange fields and electric fields, leading to changes in the optical properties. Additionally, the spin Berry curvature and spin Hall conductivity are investigated as a function of the energy and temperature. The results indicate that due to the small dynamical spin Hall conductivity, generating an ac spin current in PbBiI requires the use of external magnetic fields or magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Mean-chiral displacement in coherently driven photonic lattices and its application to synthetic frequency dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16101v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Characterizing topologically nontrivial photonic lattices by measuring their topological invariants is crucial in topological photonics. In conservative one-dimensional systems, a widely used observable to extract the winding number is the mean-chiral displacement. In many realistic photonic systems, however, losses can hardly be avoided, and little is known on how one can extend the mean-chiral displacement to a driven-dissipative context. Here we theoretically propose an experimentally viable method to directly detect the topological winding number of one-dimensional chiral photonic lattices. The method we propose is a generalization of the mean-chiral displacement to a driven-dissipative context with coherent illumination. By integrating the mean-chiral displacement of the steady state over the pump light frequency, one can obtain the winding number with a correction of the order of the loss rate squared. We demonstrate that this method can be successfully applied to lattices along synthetic frequency dimensions.</description>

Abstract: Entanglement in quantum many-body systems can exhibit universal phenomena governed by long-distance properties. We study universality and phase transitions of the entanglement inherent to open many-body systems, namely, the entanglement between a system of interest and its environment. Specifically, we consider the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) under a local measurement and analyze its unconditioned nonunitary evolution, where the measurement outcomes are averaged over. We quantify the system-environment entanglement by the R\'enyi entropy of the post-measurement density matrix, whose size-independent term encodes the universal low-energy physics. We develop a field-theoretical description to relate the universal term to the effective ground-state degeneracy known as the $g$ function in a boundary conformal field theory, and use the renormalization group method to determine its value. We show that the universal contribution is determined by the TLL parameter $K$ and can exhibit singularity signifying an entanglement phase transition. Surprisingly, in certain cases the size-independent contribution can increase as a function of the measurement strength in contrast to what is na\"ively expected from the $g$-theorem. We argue that this unconventional behavior could be attributed to the dangerously irrelevant term which has been found in studies of the resistively shunted Josephson junction. We also check these results by numerical calculations in the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ XXZ chain subject to a site-resolved measurement. Possible experimental realization in ultracold gases, which requires no postselections, is discussed.</description>

Abstract: Problems in the field of open quantum systems often involve an environment that strongly influences the dynamics of excited states. Here we present a numerical method to model optical spectra of non-Markovian open quantum systems. The method employs a process tensor framework to efficiently compute multi-time correlations in a numerically exact way. To demonstrate the efficacy of our method, we compare 2D electronic spectroscopy simulations produced through our method to Markovian master equation simulations in three different system-bath coupling regimes.</description>

      <title>Magnetic anisotropy of L1$_0$ FeNi (001), (010), and (111) ultrathin films: A first-principles study</title>

Abstract: In previous experiments, thin films of L1$\mathrm{_0}$ FeNi with different surfaces, including (001), (110) and (111), were produced and studied. Each surface defines a different alignment of the crystallographic tetragonal axis with respect to the film's plane, resulting in different magnetic anisotropies. In this study, we use density functional theory calculations to examine three series of L1$\mathrm{_0}$ FeNi films with surfaces (001), (010), and (111), and with thicknesses ranging from 0.5 to 3 nm (from 4 to 16 atomic monolayers). Our results show that films (001) have perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, while (010) favor in-plane magnetization, with a clear preference for the tetragonal axis [001]. We propose calling this type of in-plane anisotropy fixed in plane. A film with surface (111) and a thickness of four atomic monolayers has the magnetization easy axis almost perpendicular to the plane of the film. As the thickness of the (111) film increases, the direction of magnetization rotates towards a tetragonal axis [001], positioned at an angle of about 45$^{o}$ to the plane of the film. Furthermore, the magnetic moment of ultrathin films increases by a maximum of 5%, and the most significant changes in spin and orbital magnetic moments occur at a depth of about three near-surface atomic monolayers. The presented results could be useful for experimental efforts to synthesize ultrathin L1$\mathrm{_0}$ FeNi films with different surfaces. Ultrathin L1$\mathrm{_0}$ FeNi films with varying magnetic anisotropies may find applications in spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Exfoliation and Optical Properties of S=1 Triangular Lattice Antiferromagnet NiGa$_2$S$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) materials have been an exciting area of research ever since scientists first isolated a single layer of graphene. Single layer magnetic materials can provide a pathway for vdW heterostructures with magnetic properties. While most of the magnetic vdW materials exhibit ordering transitions in the bulk, here we report a successful exfoliation of a triangular lattice S=1 antiferromagnet NiGa$_2$S$_4$, which already demonstrates exotic magnetism in the bulk material. We establish the number of layers of the material by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and detail a careful characterization using Raman and optical spectroscopy to demonstrate how the optical, electronic, and structural properties of NiGa$_2$S$_4$ change as a function of sample thickness. Optical measurements and electronic structure calculations of bulk versus monolayer NiGa$_2$S$_4$ confirm the material to be a Mott insulator with an electronic gap of about 1.5 eV, which slightly increases for layers below 10 L. We conclude with a theoretical analysis of the possibility of doping monolayer NiGa$_2$S$_4$ by proximity to a metal.</description>

      <title>Local ergotropy and its fluctuations across a dissipative quantum phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02655v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a two-qubit open Rabi model, focusing on local ergotropy--the maximum extractable work by acting solely on the two qubits--within a parameter regime where a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless dissipative phase transition occurs. First, we aim to define a protocol for charging, storing, and discharging the two-qubit system, interpreted as the working principle of an open quantum battery. Second, we examine the impact of the phase transition on ergotropy and identify potential markers. To achieve these goals, we construct an ad-hoc charging unitary operator, leveraging our knowledge of the ground state near the transition to bring it into a decoherence-free state during storage. Using state-of-the-art numerics based on matrix product state representation, we reveal that high couplings to an external bath approximately double the local ergotropy immediately post-charging. Over time we observe oscillatory behaviors in ergotropy and its fluctuations, which undergo significant changes near the transition, signaling its occurrence. Furthermore, we optimize local ergotropy over time using a physically inspired ansatz, enabling work extraction at a generic time (local ergotropy never reaches zero). Our work proposes a tunable, experimentally realizable protocol for work extraction, leveraging decoherence-free states and phase transitions. Additionally, it sheds light on the complex interaction between local ergotropy and quantum phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Deceleration of electrons by an oscillating field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum corrections to electron dynamics under an oscillating electromagnetic field are found within the Floquet theory of periodically driven quantum systems. It is demonstrated that emission of photons by an electron oscillating under the field is asymmetric with respect to the direction of its forward movement. Since emission of each photon is accompanied by momentum transfer to the electron, such a skew emission leads to the quantum recoil force decelerating the electron. Possible manifestations of this phenomenon are discussed for various electronic systems driven by laser irradiation.</description>

      <title>Harnessing coupled nanolasers near exceptional points for directional emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tailoring the losses of optical systems within the frame of non-Hermitian physics has appeared very fruitful in the last few years. In particular, the description of exceptional points (EPs) with coupled resonators have become widespread. The on-chip realization of these functionalities is highly significant for integrated nanophotonics, but requires fine control techniques of the nanodevice properties. Here, we demonstrate pump-controlled directional emission of two coupled nanolasers that distantly interact via an integrated waveguide. This coupling scheme unusually enables both frequency- and loss-couplings between two cavities, which can be advantageously exploited to reach EPs by either detuning the cavities or controlling the gain of nanolasers. The system can be readily reconfigured from bidirectional to unidirectional emission by adjusting the pump power.</description>

      <title>Scalable parallel measurement of individual nitrogen-vacancy centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is a solid-state spin defect that has been widely adopted for quantum sensing and quantum information processing applications. Typically, experiments are performed either with a single isolated NV center or with an unresolved ensemble of many NV centers, resulting in a trade-off between measurement speed and spatial resolution or control over individual defects. In this work, we introduce an experimental platform that bypasses this trade-off by addressing multiple optically resolved NV centers in parallel. We perform charge- and spin-state manipulations selectively on multiple NV centers from within a larger set, and we manipulate and measure the electronic spin states of 10 NV centers in parallel. Further, we show that the high signal-to-noise ratio of the measurements enables the detection of shot-to-shot pairwise correlations between the spin states of 10 NV centers, corresponding to the simultaneous measurement of 45 unique correlation coefficients. We conclude by discussing how our platform can be scaled to parallel experiments with thousands of individually resolved NV centers. These results enable high-throughput experiments with individual spin defects, and provide a natural platform for the application of recently developed correlated sensing techniques.</description>
