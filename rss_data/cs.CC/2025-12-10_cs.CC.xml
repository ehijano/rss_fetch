      <title>Direct Product Theorems for Randomized Query Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish two new direct product theorems for the randomized query complexity of Boolean functions.
  The first shows that computing $n$ copies of a function $f$, even with a small success probability of $\gamma^n$, requires $\Theta(n)$ times the "maximum distributional" query complexity of $f$ with success parameter $\gamma$. This result holds for all success parameters $\gamma$, even when $\gamma$ is very close to $1/2$ or to $1$. As a result, it unifies and generalizes Drucker's direct product theorem (2012) for $\gamma$ bounded away from $\frac12$ and $1$ as well as the strong direct sum theorem of Blais and Brody (2019) for $\gamma\approx 1-1/n$.
  The second establishes a general "list decoding" direct product theorem that captures many different variants of partial computation tasks related to the function $f^n$ consisting of $n$ copies of $f$. Notably, our list decoding direct product theorem yields a new threshold direct product theorem and other new variants such as the labelled-threshold direct product theorem.
  Both of these direct product theorems are obtained by taking a new approach. Instead of directly analyzing the query complexity of algorithms, we introduce a new measure of complexity of functions that we call "discounted score". We show that this measure satisfies a number of useful structural properties, including tensorization, that make it particularly suitable for the study of direct product questions.</description>

      <title>Structure Theorems (and Fast Algorithms) for List Recovery of Subspace-Design Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: List recovery of error-correcting codes has emerged as a fundamental notion with broad applications across coding theory and theoretical computer science. Folded Reed-Solomon (FRS) and univariate multiplicity codes are explicit constructions which can be efficiently list-recovered up to capacity, namely a fraction of errors approaching $1-R$ where $R$ is the code rate.
  Chen and Zhang and related works showed that folded Reed-Solomon codes and linear codes must have list sizes exponential in $1/\epsilon$ for list-recovering from an error-fraction $1-R-\epsilon$. These results suggest that one cannot list-recover FRS codes in time that is also polynomial in $1/\epsilon$. In contrast to such limitations, we show, extending algorithmic advances of Ashvinkumar, Habib, and Srivastava for list decoding, that even if the lists in the case of list-recovery are large, they are highly structured. In particular, we can output a compact description of a set of size only $\ell^{O((\log \ell)/\epsilon)}$ which contains the relevant list, while running in time only polynomial in $1/\epsilon$ (the previously known compact description due to Guruswami and Wang had size $\approx n^{\ell/\epsilon}$). We also improve on the state-of-the-art algorithmic results for the task of list-recovery.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Barrier in Uniform Class Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08149v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify a strong structural obstruction to Uniform Separation in constructive arithmetic. The mechanism is independent of semantic content; it emerges whenever two distinct evaluator predicates are sustained in parallel and inference remains uniformly representable in an extension of HA. Under these conditions, any putative Uniform Class Separation principle becomes a distinguished instance of a fixed point construction. The resulting limitation is stricter in scope than classical separation barriers (Baker; Rudich; Aaronson et al.) insofar as it constrains the logical form of uniform separation within HA, rather than limiting particular relativizing, naturalizing, or algebrizing techniques.</description>

      <title>Optimal Trickle-Down Theorems for Path Complexes via C-Lorentzian Polynomials with Applications to Sampling and Log-Concave Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01005v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a $d$-partite $d$-dimensional simplicial complex with parts $T_1,\dots,T_d$ and let $\mu$ be a distribution on the facets of $X$. Informally, we say $(X,\mu)$ is a path complex if for any $i&lt;j&lt;k$ and $F \in T_i,G \in T_j, K\in T_k$, we have $\mathbb{P}_\mu[F,K | G]=\mathbb{P}_\mu[F|G]\cdot\mathbb{P}_\mu[K|G].$ We develop a new machinery with $\mathcal{C}$-Lorentzian polynomials to show that if all links of $X$ of co-dimension 2 have spectral expansion at most $1/2$, then $X$ is a $1/2$-local spectral expander. We then prove that one can derive fast-mixing results and log-concavity statements for top-link spectral expanders.
  We use our machinery to prove fast mixing results for sampling maximal flags of flats of distributive lattices (a.k.a. linear extensions of posets) subject to external fields, and to sample maximal flags of flats of "typical" modular lattices. We also use it to re-prove the Heron-Rota-Welsh conjecture and to prove a conjecture of Chan and Pak which gives a generalization of Stanley's log-concavity theorem. Lastly, we use it to prove near optimal trickle-down theorems for "sparse complexes" such as constructions by Lubotzky-Samuels-Vishne, Kaufman-Oppenheim, and O'Donnell-Pratt.</description>

      <title>Fourier Spectrum of Noisy Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing promises exponential speedups for certain problems, yet fully universal quantum computers remain out of reach and near-term devices are inherently noisy. Motivated by this, we study noisy quantum algorithms and the landscape between $\mathsf{BQP}$ and $\mathsf{BPP}$. We build on a powerful technique to differentiate quantum and classical algorithms called the level-$\ell$ Fourier growth (the sum of absolute values of Fourier coefficients of sets of size $\ell$) and show that it can also be used to differentiate quantum algorithms based on the types of resources used. We show that noise acting on a quantum algorithm dampens its Fourier growth in ways intricately linked to the type of noise.
  Concretely, we study noisy models of quantum computation where highly mixed states are prevalent, namely: $\mathsf{DQC}_k$ algorithms, where $k$ qubits are clean and the rest are maximally mixed, and $\frac{1}{2}\mathsf {BQP}$ algorithms, where the initial state is maximally mixed, but the algorithm is given knowledge of the initial state at the end of the computation. We establish upper bounds on the Fourier growth of $\mathsf{DQC}_k$, $\frac{1}{2}\mathsf{BQP}$ and $\mathsf{BQP}$ algorithms and leverage the differences between these bounds to derive oracle separations between these models. In particular, we show that 2-Forrelation and 3-Forrelation require $N^{\Omega(1)}$ queries in the $\mathsf{DQC}_1$ and $\frac{1}{2}\mathsf{BQP}$ models respectively. Our results are proved using a new matrix decomposition lemma that might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Trickle-down Theorems via C-Lorentzian Polynomials II: Pairwise Spectral Influence and Improved Dobrushin's Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mu$ be a probability distribution on a multi-state spin system on a set $V$ of sites. Equivalently, we can think of this as a $d$-partite simplical complex with distribution $\mu$ on maximal faces. For any pair of vertices $u,v\in V$, define the pairwise spectral influence $\mathcal{I}_{u,v}$ as follows. Let $\sigma$ be a choice of spins $s_w\in S_w$ for every $w\in V \setminus \{u,v\}$, and construct a matrix in $\mathbb{R}^{(S_u\cup S_v)\times (S_u\cup S_v)}$ where for any $s_u\in S_u, s_v\in S_v$, the $(us_u,vs_v)$-entry is the probability that $s_v$ is the spin of $v$ conditioned on $s_u$ being the spin of $u$ and on $\sigma$. Then $\mathcal{I}_{u,v}$ is the maximal second eigenvalue of this matrix, over all choices of spins for all $w \in V \setminus \{u,v\}$. Equivalently, $\mathcal{I}_{u,v}$ is the maximum local spectral expansion of links of codimension $2$ that include a spin for every $w \in V \setminus \{u,v\}$.
  We show that if the largest eigenvalue of the pairwise spectral influence matrix with entries $\mathcal{I}_{u,v}$ is bounded away from 1, i.e. $\lambda_{\max}(\mathcal{I})\leq 1-\epsilon$ (and $X$ is connected), then the Glauber dynamics mixes rapidly and generate samples from $\mu$. This improves/generalizes the classical Dobrushin's influence matrix as the $\mathcal{I}_{u,v}$ lower-bounds the classical influence of $u\to v$. As a by-product, we also prove improved/almost optimal trickle-down theorems for partite simplicial complexes. The proof builds on the trickle-down theorems via $\mathcal{C}$-Lorentzian polynomials machinery recently developed by the authors and Lindberg.</description>

      <title>Tensor rank and dimension expanders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a lower bound on the rank of tensors constructed from families of linear maps that `expand' the dimension of every subspace. Such families, called {\em dimension expanders} have been studied for many years with several known explicit constructions. Using these constructions we show that one can construct an explicit $[D]\times [n] \times [n]$-tensor with rank at least $(2 - \epsilon)n$, with $D$ a constant depending on $\epsilon$. Our results extend to border rank over the real or complex numbers.</description>
