      <title>Impact of Proton Irradiation on 4H-SiC Low Gain Avalanche Detectors (LGADs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon carbide (SiC) particle detectors have the potential to provide time resolutions and robust performance in extreme environments which exceed that of silicon detectors. In this work 4H-SiC low gain avalanche detectors (LGADs) and complementary PiN diodes were irradiated with 2.5 GeV protons at fluences up to 3.33$\times$10$^{14}$ p/cm$^2$. The electrostatic performance of both irradiated and non-irradiated devices was evaluated using current-voltage (I-V) and capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurements. Moreover, charge collection measurements using $\alpha$ particles were also conducted. SiC LGADs displayed a loss in rectification and gain with increasing proton fluence. Additionally, the reduction in capacitance and OFF-state current pointed to compensation of the gain layer as a gain reducing mechanism. The introduction of radiation induced defects also hinders carrier acceleration reducing impact ionization, leading to further gain reduction. However, despite the reduction in device performance, the demonstration of a measurable signal and gain after irradiation points to the potential of SiC LGAD detectors for future high energy physics applications.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Limitations of Absolute Ranging via Deep Frequency Modulation Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-precision absolute length metrology using laser interferometry faces inherent challenges from interferometric ambiguity. Deep Frequency Modulation Interferometry (DFMI) addresses this by simultaneously extracting two distinct length-encoding parameters: the precise, ambiguous interferometric phase ($\Phi$) and the coarser, unambiguous effective modulation depth ($m$). This paper establishes the fundamental statistical and systematic limitations governing the absolute accuracy of DFMI. We detail two primary readout algorithms: a frequency-domain Non-Linear Least Squares (NLS) fit and a time-domain Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). We derive the Cram\'er-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for the estimation of $m$ and $\Phi$, identifying intrinsic ``dead zones'' where precision degrades, and asymptotic limits as a function of signal quality and integration time, achievable by both NLS and EKF. Critically, we develop analytical models for dominant systematic biases, revealing previously uncharted ``valleys of robustness'' -- specific operating points where errors from modulation non-linearity and residual amplitude modulation are strongly suppressed. This analysis clarifies critical trade-offs between different design parameters, integration time, and total error, informing instrument design and underscoring the necessity of advanced compensation techniques for high-accuracy applications.</description>

      <title>Simulation-based inference for Precision Neutrino Physics through Neural Monte Carlo tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise modeling of detector energy response is crucial for next-generation neutrino experiments which present computational challenges due to lack of analytical likelihoods. We propose a solution using neural likelihood estimation within the simulation-based inference framework. We develop two complementary neural density estimators that model likelihoods of calibration data: conditional normalizing flows and a transformer-based regressor. We adopt JUNO - a large neutrino experiment - as a case study. The energy response of JUNO depends on several parameters, all of which should be tuned, given their non-linear behavior and strong correlations in the calibration data. To this end, we integrate the modeled likelihoods with Bayesian nested sampling for parameter inference, achieving uncertainties limited only by statistics with near-zero systematic biases. The normalizing flows model enables unbinned likelihood analysis, while the transformer provides an efficient binned alternative. By providing both options, our framework offers flexibility to choose the most appropriate method for specific needs. Finally, our approach establishes a template for similar applications across experimental neutrino and broader particle physics.</description>

      <title>Scintillation characteristics of an undoped CsI crystal at low-temperature for dark matter search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07957v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The scintillation characteristics of 1 g undoped CsI crystal were studied by directly coupling two silicon photomultipliers(SiPMs) over a temperature range from room temperature to 86 K. The scintillation decay time and light output were measured using x-ray and gamma-ray peaks from a 109Cd radioactive source. An increase in decay time was observed as the temperature decreased from room temperature to 86 K, ranging from 76 ns to 605 ns. The light output also increased, reaching 26.2 +/- 1.3 photoelectrons per keV electron-equivalent at 86 K. Leveraging the significantly enhanced scintillation light output of the undoped CsI crystal at low temperatures, coupling it with SiPMs results in a promising detector for rare event searches. Both cesium and iodine have an odd number of protons, making them suitable targets for probing dark matter-proton spin-dependent interactions. This study evaluates the sensitivity of the proposed detector to such interactions, incorporating the Migdal effect and assuming 200 kg of undoped CsI crystals for dark matter searches. The results indicate that undoped CsI coupled with SiPM can achieve world-competitive sensitivity for low-mass dark matter detection, particularly in the context of dark matter-proton spin-dependent interactions.</description>

      <title>Monitoring the tagging efficiency of the Low-Energy Muon beamline through background analysis: Insights into the long-term performance of ultrathin carbon foils</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17280v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The efficient tagging of individual muons, along with the stability of the involved ultrathin carbon foil, is critical for ensuring fast, reliable and reproducible low-energy muon spin rotation (LE-$\mathrm{\mu}$SR) measurements. At the Paul Scherrer Institute's Low-Energy Muon (LEM) beamline, we developed a method to monitor the tagging efficiency of the beamline using routinely collected muon decay histograms. This method leverages background comparison before and after the arrival time of the muons at the sample to extract the tagging efficiency, eliminating the need for additional detectors or measurements. By analyzing data collected between 2018 and 2024, we confirm the method's reliability and validate its results using independent reference measurements. Furthermore, we establish a correlation between the tagging efficiency and foil thickness by investigating the impact of contamination and outgassing on the carbon foil, as well as the restoration effects of laser cleaning. The findings underscore the importance of monitoring the carbon foil's condition to maintain consistent beamline performance and reproducibility. This method offers a practical approach for detector efficiency monitoring, applicable to other beamlines employing similar setups.</description>
