      <title>Integrating Coarse-Grained Simulations and Deep Learning to Unveil Entropy-Driven dsRNA Unwinding by DDX3X</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DEAD-box RNA helicases (DDXs) are essential RNA metabolism regulators that typically unwind dsRNA in an ATP-dependent manner. However, recent studies show some DDXs can also unwind dsRNA without ATP, a phenomenon that remains poorly understood. Here, we developed HelixTriad coarse-grained RNA model, incorporating Watson-Crick base pairing, base stacking, and electrostatics within a three-bead-per-nucleotide scheme to accurately reproduce experimental RNA melting curves. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that weak, specific DDX3X-dsRNA interactions drive stochastic strand separation without ATP. Free energy analysis revealed that successful unwinding via high-entropy, stand-displacing intermediates. Furthermore, we introduced Entropy-Unet, a deep learning framework for entropy prediction, which corroborated theoretical estimates and uncovered a hierarchical pattern of entropy contributions. Together, our findings suggest that ATP-independent dsRNA unwinding by DDXs is predominantly entropy-driven, offering new mechanistic insights into RNA helicases versatility.</description>

      <title>Fused Gromov-Wasserstein Contrastive Learning for Effective Enzyme-Reaction Screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enzymes are crucial catalysts that enable a wide range of biochemical reactions. Efficiently identifying specific enzymes from vast protein libraries is essential for advancing biocatalysis. Traditional computational methods for enzyme screening and retrieval are time-consuming and resource-intensive. Recently, deep learning approaches have shown promise. However, these methods focus solely on the interaction between enzymes and reactions, overlooking the inherent hierarchical relationships within each domain. To address these limitations, we introduce FGW-CLIP, a novel contrastive learning framework based on optimizing the fused Gromov-Wasserstein distance. FGW-CLIP incorporates multiple alignments, including inter-domain alignment between reactions and enzymes and intra-domain alignment within enzymes and reactions. By introducing a tailored regularization term, our method minimizes the Gromov-Wasserstein distance between enzyme and reaction spaces, which enhances information integration across these domains. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the superiority of FGW-CLIP in challenging enzyme-reaction tasks. On the widely-used EnzymeMap benchmark, FGW-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance in enzyme virtual screening, as measured by BEDROC and EF metrics. Moreover, FGW-CLIP consistently outperforms across all three splits of ReactZyme, the largest enzyme-reaction benchmark, demonstrating robust generalization to novel enzymes and reactions. These results position FGW-CLIP as a promising framework for enzyme discovery in complex biochemical settings, with strong adaptability across diverse screening scenarios.</description>

      <title>Mapping Still Matters: Coarse-Graining with Machine Learning Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coarse-grained (CG) modeling enables molecular simulations to reach time and length scales inaccessible to fully atomistic methods. For classical CG models, the choice of mapping, that is, how atoms are grouped into CG sites, is a major determinant of accuracy and transferability. At the same time, the emergence of machine learning potentials (MLPs) offers new opportunities to build CG models that can in principle learn the true potential of the mean force for any mapping. In this work, we systematically investigate how the choice of mapping influences the representations learned by equivariant MLPs by studying liquid hexane, amino acids, and polyalanine. We find that when the length scales of bonded and nonbonded interactions overlap, unphysical bond permutations can occur. We also demonstrate that correctly encoding species and maintaining stereochemistry are crucial, as neglecting either introduces unphysical symmetries. Our findings provide practical guidance for selecting CG mappings compatible with modern architectures and guide the development of transferable CG models.</description>
