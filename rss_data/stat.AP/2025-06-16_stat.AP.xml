      <title>Probabilistic Assessment of Engineered Timber Reusability after Moisture Exposure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Engineered timber is pivotal to low-carbon construction, but moisture uptake during its service life can compromise structural reliability and impede reuse within a circular economy model. Despite growing interest, quantitative standards for classifying the reusability of moisture-exposed timber are still lacking. This study develops a probabilistic framework to determine the post-exposure reusability of engineered timber. Laminated specimens were soaked to full saturation, dried to 25% moisture content, and subjected to destructive three-point flexural testing. Structural integrity was quantified by a residual-performance metric that assigns 80% weight to the retained flexural modulus and 20% to the retained maximum load, benchmarked against unexposed controls. A hierarchical Bayesian multinomial logistic model with horseshoe priors, calibrated through Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo sampling, jointly infers the decision threshold separating three Modern Methods of Construction (MMC) reuse levels and predicts those levels from five field-measurable features: density, moisture content, specimen size, grain orientation, and surface hardness. Results indicate that a single wet-dry cycle preserves 70% of specimens above the 0.90 residual-performance threshold (Level 1), whereas repeated cycling lowers the mean residual to 0.78 and reallocates many specimens to Levels 2-3. The proposed framework yields quantified decision boundaries and a streamlined on-site testing protocol, providing a foundation for robust quality assurance standards.</description>

      <title>Time-Varying Home Field Advantage in Football: Learning from a Non-Stationary Causal Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In sports analytics, home field advantage is a robust phenomenon where the home team wins more games than the away team. However, discovering the causal factors behind home field advantage presents unique challenges due to the non-stationary, time-varying environment of sports matches. In response, we propose a novel causal discovery method, DYnamic Non-stAtionary local M-estimatOrs (DYNAMO), to learn the time-varying causal structures of home field advantage. DYNAMO offers flexibility by integrating various loss functions, making it practical for learning linear and non-linear causal structures from a general class of non-stationary causal processes. By leveraging local information, we provide theoretical guarantees for the identifiability and estimation consistency of non-stationary causal structures without imposing additional assumptions. Simulation studies validate the efficacy of DYNAMO in recovering time-varying causal structures. We apply our method to high-resolution event data from the 2020-2021 and 2021-2022 English Premier League seasons, during which the former season had no audience presence. Our results reveal intriguing, time-varying, team-specific field advantages influenced by referee bias, which differ significantly with and without crowd support. Furthermore, the time-varying causal structures learned by our method improve goal prediction accuracy compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>On Devon Allen's Disqualification at the 2022 World Track and Field Championships</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Devon Allen's disqualification at the men's 110-meter hurdle final at the 2022 World Track and Field Championships, due to a reaction time (RT) of 0.099 seconds-just 0.001 seconds below the allowable threshold-sparked widespread debate over the fairness and validity of RT rules. This study investigates two key issues: variations in timing systems and the justification for the 0.1-second disqualification threshold. We pooled RT data from men's 110-meter hurdles and 100-meter dash, as well as women's 100-meter hurdles and 100-meter dash, spanning national and international competitions. Using a rank-sum test for clustered data, we compared RTs across multiple competitions, while a generalized Gamma model with random effects for venue and heat was applied to evaluate the threshold. Our analyses reveal significant differences in RTs between the 2022 World Championships and other competitions, pointing to systematic variations in timing systems. Additionally, the model shows that RTs be low 0.1 seconds, though rare, are physiologically plausible. These findings highlight the need for standardized timing protocols and a re-evaluation of the 0.1-second disqualification threshold to promote fairness in elite competition.</description>

      <title>A Robust Local Fr\'echet Regression Using Unbalanced Neural Optimal Transport with Applications to Dynamic Single-cell Genomics Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies have enabled the profiling of gene expression for a collection of cells across time during a dynamic biological process. Given that each time point provides only a static snapshot, modeling and understanding the underlying cellular dynamics remains a central yet challenging task in modern genomics. To associate biological time with single cell distributions, we develop a robust local Fr\'echet regression for interpolating the high-dimensional cellular distribution at any given time point using data observed over a finite time points. To allow for robustness in cell distributions, we propose to apply the unbalanced optimal transport-based Wasserstein distance in our local Fr\'echet regression analysis. We develop a computationally efficient algorithm to generate the cell distribution for a given time point using generative neural networks. The resulting single cell generated models and the corresponding transport plans can be use to interpolate the single cells at any unobserved time point and to track the cell trajectory during the cell differentiation process. We demonstrate the methods using three single cell differentiation data sets, including differentiation of human embryonic stem cells into embryoids, mouse hematopoietic and progenitor cell differentiation, and reprogramming of mouse embryonic fibroblasts. We show that the proposed methods lead to better single cell interpolations, reveal different cell differential trajectories, and identify early genes that regulate these cell trajectories.</description>

      <title>Can We Trust Machine Learning? The Reliability of Features from Open-Source Speech Analysis Tools for Speech Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning-based behavioral models rely on features extracted from audio-visual recordings. The recordings are processed using open-source tools to extract speech features for classification models. These tools often lack validation to ensure reliability in capturing behaviorally relevant information. This gap raises concerns about reproducibility and fairness across diverse populations and contexts. Speech processing tools, when used outside of their design context, can fail to capture behavioral variations equitably and can then contribute to bias. We evaluate speech features extracted from two widely used speech analysis tools, OpenSMILE and Praat, to assess their reliability when considering adolescents with autism. We observed considerable variation in features across tools, which influenced model performance across context and demographic groups. We encourage domain-relevant verification to enhance the reliability of machine learning models in clinical applications.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous hypothesis testing for comparing many functional means</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data with multiple functional recordings at each observational unit are increasingly common in various fields including medical imaging and environmental sciences. To conduct inference for such observations, we develop a paired two-sample test that allows to simultaneously compare the means of many functional observations while maintaining family-wise error rate control. We explicitly allow the number of functional recordings to increase, potentially much faster than the sample size. Our test is fully functional and does not rely on dimension reduction or functional PCA type approaches or the choice of tuning parameters. To provide a theoretical justification for the proposed procedure, we develop a number of new anti-concentration and Gaussian approximation results for maxima of $L^2$ statistics which might be of independent interest. The methodology is illustrated on the task-related cortical surface functional magnetic resonance imaging data from Human Connectome Project.</description>

      <title>Functional-Coefficient Models for Multivariate Time Series in Designed Experiments: with Applications to Brain Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.00292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.00292v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To study the neurophysiological basis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), clinicians use electroencephalography (EEG) which record neuronal electrical activity on the cortex. Instead of focusing on single-channel spectral power, a novel framework for investigating interactions (dependence) between channels in the entire network is proposed. Although dependence measures such as coherence and partial directed coherence (PDC) are well explored in studying brain connectivity, these measures only capture linear dependence. Moreover, in designed clinical experiments, these dependence measures are observed to vary across subjects even within a homogeneous group. To address these limitations, we propose the mixed-effects functional-coefficient autoregressive (MXFAR) model which captures between-subject variation by incorporating subject-specific random effects. The advantages of the MXFAR model are the following: (i) it captures potential non-linear dependence between channels; (ii) it is nonparametric and hence flexible and robust to model mis-specification; (iii) it can capture differences between groups when they exist; (iv) it accounts for variation across subjects; (v) the framework easily incorporates well-known inference methods from mixed-effects models; (vi) it can be generalized to accommodate various covariates and factors. Then, we formulate a novel non-linear spectral measure, the functional partial directed coherence (fPDC), to extract dynamic cross-dependence patterns at different frequency oscillations. Finally, we apply the proposed MXFAR-fPDC framework to analyze multichannel EEG signals and report novel findings on altered brain functional networks in ADHD patients.</description>

      <title>Clinical trials with interim analyses: Standardizing Terminology to increase clarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01478v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interim analyses for group-sequential decision making are prevalent in clinical trials. Methodology is well established and has been routinely implemented over the last decades. Still, confusions and uncertainties on aspects of how to operationalize and interpret interim analyses exist for many stakeholders. In this paper, a team of statisticians from the pharmaceutical industry, academia, and regulatory agencies provide a multi-stakeholder perspective on the key concepts behind interim analyses, with the aim to introduce standard terminology to mitigate misunderstandings and facilitate clearer discussions.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Optimistic Bias in the Natural Inflow Forecasts: A Call for Model Monitoring in Brazil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13763v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hydroelectricity accounted for roughly 61.4% of Brazil's total generation in 2024 and addressed most of the intermittency of wind and solar generation. Thus, inflow forecasting plays a critical role in the operation, planning, and market in this country, as well as in any other hydro-dependent power system. These forecasts influence generation schedules, reservoir management, and market pricing, shaping the dynamics of the entire electricity sector. The objective of this paper is to measure and present empirical evidence of a systematic optimistic bias in the official inflow forecast methodology, which is based on the PAR(p)-A model. Additionally, we discuss possible sources of this bias and recommend ways to mitigate it. By analyzing 14 years of historical data from the Brazilian system through rolling-window multistep (out-of-sample) forecasts, results indicate that the official forecast model exhibits statistically significant biases of 6%, 14%, 20%, and 24% for 1-, 6-, 12-, and 24-step-ahead forecasts in the Southeast subsystem, and 19%, 57%, 81%, and 109% in the Northeast subsystem. These findings uncover the limitations of current inflow forecasting methodologies used in Brazil and call for new governance and monitoring policies.</description>
