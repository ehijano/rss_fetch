      <title>Nano-electronvolt Fourier-limited transition of a single surface-adsorbed molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution spectroscopy allows one to probe weak interactions and to detect subtle phenomena. While such measurements are routinely performed on atoms and molecules in the gas phase, spectroscopy of adsorbed species on surfaces is faced with challenges. As a result, previous studies of surface-adsorbed molecules have fallen short of the ultimate resolution, where the transition linewidth is determined by the lifetime of the excited state. In this work, we conceive a new approach to surface deposition and report on Fourier-limited electronic transitions in single dibenzoterrylenes adsorbed onto the surface of an anthracene crystal. By performing spectroscopy and super-resolution microscopy at liquid helium temperature, we shed light on various properties of the adsorbed molecules. Our experimental results pave the way for a new class of experiments in surface science, where high spatial and spectral resolution can be combined.</description>

      <title>Helical orbitals in electrical uni-directional molecular motors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation of unidirectional motion has been a long-standing challenge in engineering of molecular motors. Here, a mechanism driving the rotation is presented based on electron current through helical orbitals on a $\pi$-bonded carbon chain. Such electron current through helical orbitals has been shown to be circulating around the carbon chain. It is natural to expect that the associated electronic angular momentum drives a rotation when the current is turned on. As intuitive as this relation might seem, it is also incomplete because a formal definition of helicality in terms of a physical observable has not yet been given. Such a definition is proposed here. Based on this definition, we show how helicality determines the motor's sense of rotation. We exemplify the relation between helicality and angular momentum in H\"uckel models of linear carbon chains (cumulenes and oligoynes). We attribute the previously reported opposite helicality sense of frontier orbitals (HOMO and LUMO) to the approximate sub-lattice symmetry. For oligoynes, this symmetry is hidden in the sense that it does not reduce to a mere labeling of atoms. Sub-lattice symmetry, combined with time-reversal invariance, allows us to derive Onsager-type reciprocal relations of various linear response coefficients, dictating e.g. an odd energy dependence of angular momentum response to voltage bias. We propose an observable consequence of the approximate sub-lattice symmetry: If the carbon chain is employed as an axle of a molecular rotor, the sense of rotation is independent on the direction of the current.</description>

      <title>Numerical Integration of Slater Basis Functions Over Prolate Spheroidal Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Slater basis functions have desirable properties that can improve electronic structure simulations, but improved numerical integration methods are needed. This work builds upon the SlaterGPU library for evaluation of Hamiltonian matrix elements in the resolution-of-the-identity approximation. In particular, a Prolate Spheroidal grid will provide sufficient integral accuracy to employ larger basis sets (quadruple-zeta and greater) in practical computations involving polyatomics. To integrate 3-center Coulomb and nuclear attraction terms, an improved grid representation around the 3rd center is introduced. The RMSEs of the integral quantities are evaluated and compared to the previous numerical integration method used in SlaterGPU (Becke Partitioning), resulting in a ~3 order of magnitude reduction in the error for 2-center integral quantities. The procedure is generally applicable to polyatomic systems, GPU accelerated for high performance computing, and tested on self-consistent field and full configuration interaction wavefunctions. Results for a number of 3-atom models as well as propanediyl (C3H6) demonstrate the reliability of the new integration scheme.</description>

      <title>High-entropy perovskites as new photocatalysts for cocatalyst-free water splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The photocatalytic water-splitting process is thermodynamically challenging and requires catalysts with suitable band structures, as well as the presence of supporting cocatalysts. By considering the unique charge carrier mobility in perovskites, this study introduces three new ABO3-type high-entropy perovskites (Ba1/2Sr1/2)(Ti1/3Zr1/3Hf1/3)O3, (Ba1/2Sr1/2)(Ga1/3In1/3Sn1/3)O3 and (Ba1/2Sr1/2)(Ti1/3Zr1/3Sn1/3)O3 for cocatalyst-free photocatalysis. The three catalysts, having a single-phase cubic structure, are designed by considering configurational entropy, tolerance factor, octahedral factor, ionic radius deviation and valence deviation of &gt;1.5R (R: gas constant), 0.9-1.0, 0.4-0.8, &gt;0.3 and &gt;0.3, respectively. The perovskites exhibit similar valence band tops, while their bandgaps vary slightly depending on the composition at the B-site (slightly lower bandgap by including d10 cations). Additionally, all three materials demonstrate effective hydrogen generation without the need for added cocatalysts. This investigation confirms that high-entropy oxide perovskites can offer significant potential for cocatalyst-free photocatalytic reactions.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamically Consistent Incorporation of the Langmuir Adsorption Model into Compressible Fluctuating Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a gas-solid interfacial system where chemical species undergo reversible adsorption, we develop a mesoscopic stochastic modeling method that simulates both gas-phase hydrodynamics and surface coverage dynamics by coupling the Langmuir adsorption model with compressible fluctuating hydrodynamics. To this end, we derive a thermodynamically consistent mass-energy update scheme that accounts for how the mass and energy variables in the gas and surface subsystems should be updated according to the changes in the number of molecules of each species in each subsystem due to adsorption and desorption events. By performing a stochastic analysis for the ideal Langmuir model and the full hydrodynamic system, we analytically confirm that our mass-energy update scheme captures thermodynamic equilibrium predicted by equilibrium statistical mechanics. We find that an internal energy correction term is needed, which is attributed to the difference in the mean kinetic energy of gas molecules colliding with the surface from that computed from the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. By performing an equilibrium simulation study for an ideal gas mixture of CO and Ar with CO undergoing reversible adsorption, we validate our overall simulation method and implementation.</description>

      <title>Sparing of DNA irradiated with Ultra-High Dose-Rates under Physiological Oxygen and Salt conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cancer treatment with radiotherapy aims to kill tumor cells and spare healthy tissue.Thus,the experimentally observed sparing of healthy tissue by the FLASH effect during irradiations with ultra-high dose rates (UHDR) enables clinicians to extend the therapeutic window.However, the underlying radiobiological and chemical mechanisms are far from being understood.DNA is one of the main molecular targets for radiotherapy.Ionizing radiation damage to DNA in water depends strongly on salt,pH,buffer and oxygen content of the solvent.Here we present a study of plasmid DNA pUC19,irradiated with 18MeV electrons at low dose rates (LDR) and UHDR under tightly controlled ambient and physiological oxygen conditions in PBS at pH 7.4.For the first time a sparing effect of DNA strand-break induction between UHDR(&gt;10MGy/s) and LDR(&lt;0.1Gy/s) irradiated plasmid DNA under physiological oxygen, salt and pH is observed for total doses above 10Gy.Under physiological oxygen (physoxia,5%O2,40mmHg),more single (SSB) and double strand-breaks (DSB) are observed when exposed to LDR, than to UHDR.This behaviour is absent for ambient oxygen (normoxia,21%O2,150-160mmHg).The experiments are accompanied by TOPAS-nBio based particle-scattering and chemical MCS to obtain information about the yields of reactive oxygen species (ROS).Hereby,an extended set of chemical reactions was considered, which improved upon the discrepancy between experiment and simulations of previous works, and allowed to predict DR dependent g-values of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2).To explain the observed DNA sparing effect under FLASH conditions at physoxia,the following model was proposed:The interplay of O2 with OH induced H-abstraction at the phosphate backbone,and the conversion of DNA base-damage to SSB,under consideration of the dose-rate dependent H3O+ yield via beta elimination processes is accounted for, to explain the observed behavior.</description>

      <title>A finite-element Delta-Sternheimer approach for accurate all-electron RPA correlation energies of arbitrary molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The incompleteness of single-particle basis sets has long cast a shadow over correlated electronic-structure methods, making it highly challenging to obtain numerically converged results. In this work, we compute the RPA correlation energies of general molecules using the finite element method, while ingeniously combining atomic orbital basis sets to accelerate the convergence of total energies. We report atomization energies for 50 molecules within the RPA framework, achieving accuracies on the order of meV per atom. The computational strategy that integrates real-space discretization techniques with atomic orbitals is expected to inspire the entire correlated electronic-structure community.</description>

      <title>Operator Commutativity Screening and Progressive Operator Block Reordering toward Many-body Inspired Quantum State Preparation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the field of quantum chemistry, the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) has emerged as a highly promising approach to determine molecular energies and properties within the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. The central challenges of this approach lie in the design of an expressive ansatz capable of representing the exact ground state wavefunction while concurrently being efficient to avoid numerical instabilities during the classical optimization. Owing to the constraints of current quantum hardware, the ansatz must remain sufficiently compact while retaining the flexibility to capture essential correlation effects. To address these challenges, we propose a systematic dynamic ansatz construction strategy in which the dominant operator blocks are initially identified through commutativity screening, combined with an energy sorting criteria. Subsequently, the ansatz is progressively expanded in a stepwise manner via iterative operator block reordering. To minimize the overhead, the higher order correlation terms are incorporated via reduced lower-body tensor factorization in each operator block, while the adaptive construction strategy ensures that the optimization is guided along the optimal trajectory to mitigate potential numerical instabilities due to the presence of local traps. Benchmark applications to various molecular systems demonstrate that this strategy of progressive operator-block addition achieves accurate energetics with significantly fewer parameters while efficiently bypassing local traps. Moreover, in strongly correlated regions, such as bond dissociation, the method successfully reproduces the ground state, where other contemporary approaches often fail.</description>

      <title>Chirality-Induced Magnetization and Its Implications for RNA Homochirality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The single-handedness of biomolecules is a characteristic feature of life on Earth, yet achieving and maintaining a homochiral prebiotic network is a significant challenge. In our previous studies, we reached homochirality in an RNA precursor, ribo-aminooxazoline (RAO), using magnetized magnetite surfaces as chiral reagents, due to the chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect. We further demonstrated that RAO can induce net magnetization on previously demagnetized magnetite, indicating a self-reinforcing feedback between chiral molecules and magnetic surfaces. However, these processes depend on spin interactions that generally weaken at higher temperatures, raising concerns about the robustness of our mechanisms in natural settings. Additionally, the temperature dependence of CISS remains poorly understood and highly debated. To address these questions, we investigated the temperature dependence of chirality-induced magnetization. Contrary to classical expectations, we observed a significant increase in the magnetic coercivity with increasing temperatures, suggesting a phonon-assisted process. Our results support a vibronic contribution to CISS and indicate that spin-controlled processes leading to RNA homochirality can occur reliably and effectively over a range of temperatures likely present in prebiotic environments.</description>

      <title>Migration as a Probe: A Generalizable Benchmark Framework for Specialist vs. Generalist Machine-Learned Force Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine-learned force fields (MLFFs), especially pre-trained foundation models, are transforming computational materials science by enabling ab initio-level accuracy at molecular dynamics scales. Yet their rapid rise raises a key question: should researchers train specialist models from scratch, fine-tune generalist foundation models, or use hybrid approaches? The trade-offs in data efficiency, accuracy, cost, and robustness to out-of-distribution failure remain unclear. We introduce a benchmarking framework using defect migration pathways, evaluated through nudged elastic band trajectories, as diagnostic probes that test both interpolation and extrapolation. Using Cr-doped Sb2Te3 as a representative two-dimensional material, we benchmark multiple training paradigms within the MACE architecture across equilibrium, kinetic (atomic migration), and mechanical (interlayer sliding) tasks. Fine-tuned models substantially outperform from-scratch and zero-shot approaches for kinetic properties but show partial loss of long-range physics. Representational analysis reveals distinct, non-overlapping latent encodings, indicating that different training strategies learn different aspects of system physics. This framework provides practical guidelines for MLFF development and establishes migration-based probes as efficient diagnostics linking performance to learned representations, guiding future uncertainty-aware active learning.</description>

      <title>Quantum Mechanical Analysis of Neutron Wavefunction Overlap and Nuclear Interaction Probability with Carborane Cage ($^{10}$B10) in Boron Neutron Capture Therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) leverages the nuclear reaction between thermal neutrons and boron-10 (B-10) atoms to induce selective tumor cell death. The spatial and quantum mechanical overlap between the neutron wavefunction and B-10 nuclei encapsulated in carborane cages (C2B10H12) is fundamental to optimizing therapeutic efficacy. This study presents a quantum mechanical framework to evaluate the neutron-boron interaction probability by modeling neutron wavefunctions and the spatial distribution of boron atoms within the carborane cages. Using spherical harmonics and density functional theory (DFT)-derived geometries of carborane, the neutron scattering amplitudes and reaction cross sections are quantitatively analyzed. The implications of neutron spin states, nuclear magnetic moments, and external perturbations on the neutron capture probability are discussed. The computed neutron scattering amplitudes and reaction cross sections provide a basis for evaluating neutron-boron interaction probabilities under varied quantum conditions. The proposed model offers theoretical insights into molecular-level design considerations for enhancing the efficiency of BNCT.</description>

      <title>Ab initio density functional theory approach to warm dense hydrogen: from density response to electronic correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the properties of warm dense hydrogen is of key importance for the modeling of compact astrophysical objects and to understand and further optimize inertial confinement fusion (ICF) applications. The work horse of warm dense matter theory is given by thermal density functional theory (DFT), which, however, suffers from two limitations: (i) its accuracy can depend on the utilized exchange--correlation (XC) functional, which has to be approximated and (ii) it is generally limited to single-electron properties such as the density distribution. Here, we present a new ansatz combining time-dependent DFT results for the dynamic structure factor $S_{ee}(\mathbf{q},\omega)$ with static DFT results for the density response. This allows us to estimate the electron--electron static structure factor $S_{ee}(\mathbf{q})$ of warm dense hydrogen with high accuracy over a broad range of densities and temperatures. In addition to its value for the study of warm dense matter, our work opens up new avenues for the future study of electronic correlations exclusively within the framework of DFT for a host of applications.</description>

      <title>Real-space Hubbard-corrected density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an accurate and efficient framework for real-space Hubbard-corrected density functional theory. In particular, we obtain expressions for the energy, atomic forces, and stress tensor suitable for real-space finite-difference discretization, and develop a large-scale parallel implementation. We verify the accuracy of the formalism through comparisons with established planewave results. We demonstrate that the implementation is highly efficient and scalable, outperforming established planewave codes by more than an order of magnitude in minimum time to solution, with increasing advantages as the system size and/or number of processors is increased. We apply this framework to examine the impact of exchange-correlation inconsistency in local atomic orbital generation and introduce a scheme for optimizing the Hubbard parameter based on hybrid functionals, both while studying TiO$_2$ polymorphs.</description>
