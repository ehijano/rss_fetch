      <title>DeepNose: An Equivariant Convolutional Neural Network Predictive Of Human Olfactory Percepts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The olfactory system employs responses of an ensemble of odorant receptors (ORs) to sense molecules and to generate olfactory percepts. Here we hypothesized that ORs can be viewed as 3D spatial filters that extract molecular features relevant to the olfactory system, similarly to the spatio-temporal filters found in other sensory modalities. To build these filters, we trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict human olfactory percepts obtained from several semantic datasets. Our neural network, the DeepNose, produced responses that are approximately invariant to the molecules' orientation, due to its equivariant architecture. Our network offers high-fidelity perceptual predictions for different olfactory datasets. In addition, our approach allows us to identify molecular features that contribute to specific perceptual descriptors. Because the DeepNose network is designed to be aligned with the biological system, our approach predicts distinct perceptual qualities for different stereoisomers. The architecture of the DeepNose relying on the processing of several molecules at the same time permits inferring the perceptual quality of odor mixtures. We propose that the DeepNose network can use 3D molecular shapes to generate high-quality predictions for human olfactory percepts and help identify molecular features responsible for odor quality.</description>

      <title>Lifshitz tail states in non-Hermitian disordered photonic lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In lattices with uncorrelated on-site potential disorder, Anderson localization near the band edges can exhibit anomalously weak localization in the form of Lifshitz tail states. These states correspond to clusters of contiguous sites with nearly identical on-site energies, allowing excitations to extend significantly beyond the characteristic localization length determined by the inverse of Lyapunov exponent. Since Lifshitz tail states are rare events, with an exponentially small density of states, they are typically considered of limited practical importance. In this work, we demonstrate that when Anderson localization is induced by disorder in an imaginary on-site potential, Lifshitz tail states can dominate the system's dynamics and become experimentally observable. This phenomenon is illustrated through the Anderson-Bernoulli model in a non-Hermitian photonic lattice, shedding light on the unique interplay between disorder and non-Hermiticity in such systems</description>

      <title>A Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm for Local Hamiltonian Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Local Hamiltonian Problems (LHPs) are important problems that are computationally QMA-complete and physically relevant for many-body quantum systems. Quantum MaxCut (QMC), which equates to finding ground states of the quantum Heisenberg model, is the canonical LHP for which various algorithms have been proposed, including semidefinite programs and variational quantum algorithms. We propose and analyze a quantum approximation algorithm which we call the Hamiltonian Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (HamQAOA), which builds on the well-known scheme for combinatorial optimization and is suitable for implementations on near-term hardware. We establish rigorous performance guarantees of the HamQAOA for QMC on high-girth regular graphs, and our result provides bounds on the ground energy density for quantum Heisenberg spin glasses in the infinite size limit that improve with depth. Furthermore, we develop heuristic strategies with which to efficiently obtain good HamQAOA parameters. Through numerical simulations, we show that the HamQAOA empirically outperforms prior algorithms on a wide variety of QMC instances. In particular, our results indicate that the linear-depth HamQAOA can deterministically prepare exact ground states of 1-dimensional antiferromagnetic Heisenberg spin chains described by the Bethe ansatz, in contrast to the exponential depths required in previous protocols for preparing Bethe states.</description>

      <title>Partial-immunity of two-photon correlation against wavefront distortion for spatially entangled photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional quantum entanglement in photons offers notable technological advancements over traditional qubit-based systems, including increased information density and enhanced security. However, such high-dimensional states are vulnerable to disruption by complex disordered media, presenting significant challenges in practical applications. Spatially-entangled photons are conventionally generated using a nonlinear crystal via spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC). While the effect of disorder on spatially entangled photons in the near field of the crystal is well understood, the impact of disorder in the far field is more complex. In this work, we present a systematic study of the randomization of two-photon correlations caused by arbitrary phase distortions in the far field by breaking it down into odd and even parity components. First, we theoretically show that the two-photon field is only sensitive to the even-parity part of the phase distortion. In follow-up experiments, we employ a deformable mirror to implement random phase distortions, separating the contributions of odd and even parity phases using Zernike polynomials. The experimental results are in agreements with the theoretical predictions. Subsequently, we perform numerical simulations to show that these results extend to stronger degrees of disorder. Our key finding is that, since two-photon correlations are only affected by the even-parity component of phase modulations, the number of independent adaptive optics elements required for optimizing the correlation can be effectively halved, offering a significant practical advantage in managing disorder in quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Free-Energy Machine for Combinatorial Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding optimal solutions to combinatorial optimization problems is pivotal in both scientific and technological domains, within academic research and industrial applications. A considerable amount of effort has been invested in the development of accelerated methods that leverage sophisticated models and harness the power of advanced computational hardware. Despite the advancements, a critical challenge persists, the dual demand for both high efficiency and broad generality in solving problems. In this work, we propose a general method, Free-Energy Machine (FEM), based on the ideas of free-energy minimization in statistical physics, combined with automatic differentiation and gradient-based optimization in machine learning. The algorithm is flexible, solving various combinatorial optimization problems using a unified framework, and is efficient, naturally utilizing massive parallel computational devices such as graph processing units (GPUs) and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). We benchmark our algorithm on various problems including the maximum cut problems, balanced minimum cut problems, and maximum $k$-satisfiability problems, scaled to millions of variables, across both synthetic, real-world, and competition problem instances. The findings indicate that our algorithm not only exhibits exceptional speed but also surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art algorithms tailored for individual problems. This highlights that the interdisciplinary fusion of statistical physics and machine learning opens the door to delivering cutting-edge methodologies that will have broad implications across various scientific and industrial landscapes.</description>

      <title>Injectivity of ReLU networks: perspectives from statistical physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.14112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When can the input of a ReLU neural network be inferred from its output? In other words, when is the network injective? We consider a single layer, $x \mapsto \mathrm{ReLU}(Wx)$, with a random Gaussian $m \times n$ matrix $W$, in a high-dimensional setting where $n, m \to \infty$. Recent work connects this problem to spherical integral geometry giving rise to a conjectured sharp injectivity threshold for $\alpha = \frac{m}{n}$ by studying the expected Euler characteristic of a certain random set. We adopt a different perspective and show that injectivity is equivalent to a property of the ground state of the spherical perceptron, an important spin glass model in statistical physics. By leveraging the (non-rigorous) replica symmetry-breaking theory, we derive analytical equations for the threshold whose solution is at odds with that from the Euler characteristic. Furthermore, we use Gordon's min--max theorem to prove that a replica-symmetric upper bound refutes the Euler characteristic prediction. Along the way we aim to give a tutorial-style introduction to key ideas from statistical physics in an effort to make the exposition accessible to a broad audience. Our analysis establishes a connection between spin glasses and integral geometry but leaves open the problem of explaining the discrepancies.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric simple exclusion process on the percolation cluster: Waiting time distribution in side-branches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the simplest model of transport of interacting particles in a disordered medium, we consider the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) in which particles with hard-core interactions perform biased random walks, on the supercritical percolation cluster. In this process, the long time trajectory of a marked particle consists of steps on the backbone, punctuated by time spent in side-branches. We study the probability distribution in the steady state of the waiting time $T_w$ of a randomly chosen particle, in a side-branch since its last step along the backbone. Exact numerical evaluation of this on a single side-branch of length $L=$ $1$ to $9$ shows that for large fields, the probability distribution of $\log T_w $ has multiple well separated peaks. We extend this result to a regular comb, and to the ASEP on the percolation cluster. We show that in the steady state, the fractional number of particles that have been in the same side-branch for a time interval greater than $T_w$ varies as $exp( - c \sqrt{\log T_w})$ for large $T_w$, where $c$ depends only on the bias field. However, these long timescales are not reflected in the eigenvalue spectrum of the Markov evolution matrix. The system shows dynamical heterogeneity, with particles segregating into pockets of high and low mobilities.</description>

      <title>Slow measurement-only dynamics of entanglement in Pauli subsystem codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the non-unitary dynamics of a class of quantum circuits based on stochastically measuring check operators of subsystem quantum error-correcting codes, such as the Bacon-Shor code and its various generalizations. Our focus is on how properties of the underlying code are imprinted onto the measurement-only dynamics. We find that in a large class of codes with nonlocal stabilizer generators, at late times there is generically a nonlocal contribution to the subsystem entanglement entropy which scales with the subsystem size. The nonlocal stabilizer generators can also induce slow dynamics, since depending on the rate of competing measurements the associated degrees of freedom can take exponentially long (in system size) to purify (disentangle from the environment when starting from a mixed state) and to scramble (become entangled with the rest of the system when starting from a product state). Concretely, we consider circuits for which the nonlocal stabilizer generators of the underlying subsystem code take the form of subsystem symmetries. We present a systematic study of the phase diagrams and relevant time scales in two and three spatial dimensions for both Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) and non-CSS codes, focusing in particular on the link between slow measurement-only dynamics and the geometry of the subsystem symmetry. A key finding of our work is that slowly purifying or scrambling degrees of freedom appear to emerge only in codes whose subsystem symmetries are nonlocally {\it generated}, a strict subset of those whose symmetries are simply nonlocal. We comment on the link between our results on subsystem codes and the phenomenon of Hilbert-space fragmentation in light of their shared algebraic structure.</description>

      <title>Metastability in networks of nonlinear stochastic integrate-and-fire neurons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07445v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neurons in the brain continuously process the barrage of sensory inputs they receive from the environment. A wide array of experimental work has shown that the collective activity of neural populations encodes and processes this constant bombardment of information. How these collective patterns of activity depend on single-neuron properties is often unclear. Single-neuron recordings have shown that individual neurons' responses to inputs are nonlinear, which prevents a straightforward extrapolation from single neuron features to emergent collective states. Here, we use a field-theoretic formulation of a stochastic leaky integrate-and-fire model to study the impact of single-neuron nonlinearities on macroscopic network activity. In this model, a neuron integrates spiking output from other neurons in its membrane voltage and emits spikes stochastically with an intensity depending on the membrane voltage, after which the voltage resets. We show that the interplay between nonlinear spike intensity functions and membrane potential resets can i) give rise to metastable active firing rate states in recurrent networks, and ii) can enhance or suppress mean firing rates and membrane potentials in the same or paradoxically opposite directions.</description>

      <title>Differential learning kinetics govern the transition from memorization to generalization during in-context learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformers exhibit in-context learning (ICL): the ability to use novel information presented in the context without additional weight updates. Recent work shows that ICL emerges when models are trained on a sufficiently diverse set of tasks and the transition from memorization to generalization is sharp with increasing task diversity. One interpretation is that a network's limited capacity to memorize favors generalization. Here, we examine the mechanistic underpinnings of this transition using a small transformer applied to a synthetic ICL task. Using theory and experiment, we show that the sub-circuits that memorize and generalize can be viewed as largely independent. The relative rates at which these sub-circuits learn explains the transition from memorization to generalization, rather than capacity constraints. We uncover a memorization scaling law, which determines the task diversity threshold at which the network generalizes. The theory quantitatively explains a variety of other ICL-related phenomena, including the long-tailed distribution of when ICL is acquired, the bimodal behavior of solutions close to the task diversity threshold, the influence of contextual and data distributional statistics on ICL, and the transient nature of ICL.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations and the limit of predictability in protein evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Protein evolution involves mutations occurring across a wide range of time scales. In analogy with other disordered systems, this dynamical heterogeneity suggests strong correlations between mutations happening at distinct sites and times. To quantify these correlations, we examine the role of various fluctuation sources in protein evolution, simulated using a data-driven epistatic landscape. By applying spatio-temporal correlation functions inspired by statistical physics, we disentangle fluctuations originating from the ancestral protein sequence from those driven by stochastic mutations along independent evolutionary paths. Our analysis shows that, in diverse protein families, fluctuations from the ancestral sequence predominate at shorter time scales. This allows us to identify a time scale over which ancestral sequence information persists, enabling its reconstruction. We link this persistence to the strength of epistatic interactions: ancestral sequences with stronger epistatic signatures impact evolutionary trajectories over extended periods. At longer time scales, however, ancestral influence fades as epistatically constrained sites evolve collectively. To confirm this idea, we apply a standard ancestral sequence reconstruction algorithm and verify that the time-dependent recovery error is influenced by the properties of the ancestor itself.</description>
