      <title>Implementation of implicit filter for spatial spectra extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scale analysis based on coarse-graining has been proposed recently as an alternative to Fourier analysis. It is now broadly used to analyze energy spectra and energy transfers in eddy-resolving ocean simulations. However, for data from unstructured-mesh models it requires interpolation to a regular grid. We present a high-performance Python implementation of an alternative coarse-graining method which relies on implicit filters using discrete Laplacians. This method can work on arbitrary (structured or unstructured) meshes and is applicable to the direct output of unstructured-mesh ocean circulation atmosphere models. The computation is split into two phases: preparation and solving. The first one is specific only to the mesh. This allows for auxiliary arrays that are then computed to be reused, significantly reducing the computation time. The second part consists of sparse matrix algebra and solving linear system. Our implementation is accelerated by GPUs to achieve unmatched performance and scalability. This results in processing data based on meshes with more than 10M surface vertices in a matter of seconds. As an illustration, the method is applied to compute spatial spectra of ocean currents from high-resolution FESOM2 simulations.</description>

      <title>Using rare event algorithms to understand the statistics and dynamics of extreme heatwave seasons in South Asia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computing the return times of extreme events and assessing the impact of climate change on such return times is fundamental to extreme event attribution studies. However, the rarity of such events in the observational record makes this task a challenging one, even more so for "record-shattering" events that have not been previously observed at all. While climate models could be used to simulate such extremely rare events, such an approach entails a huge computational cost: gathering robust statistics for events with return time of centuries would require a few thousand years of simulation.
  In this study, we use an innovative tool, rare event algorithm, that allows to sample numerous extremely rare events at a much lower cost than direct simulations. We employ the algorithm to sample extreme heatwave seasons, corresponding to large anomalies of the seasonal average temperature, in a heatwave hotspot of South Asia using the global climate model Plasim. We show that the algorithm estimates the return levels of extremely rare events with much greater precision than traditional statistical fits. It also enables the computation of various composite statistics, whose accuracy is demonstrated through comparison with a very long control run. In particular, our results reveal that extreme heatwave seasons are associated with an anticyclonic anomaly embedded within a large-scale hemispheric quasi-stationary wave-pattern. Additionally, the algorithm accurately represents the intensity-duration-frequency statistics of sub-seasonal heatwaves, offering insights into both seasonal and sub-seasonal aspects of extreme heatwave seasons. This innovative approach could be used in extreme event attribution studies to better constrain the changes in event's probability and intensity with global warming, particularly for events with return times spanning centuries or millennia.</description>

      <title>Global versus Local: Evaluating AlexNet Architectures for Tropical Cyclone Intensity Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given the destructive impacts of tropical cyclones, it is critical to have a reliable system for cyclone intensity detection. Various techniques are available for this purpose, each with differing levels of accuracy. In this paper, we introduce two ensemble-based models based on AlexNet architecture to estimate tropical cyclone intensity using visible satellite images. The first model, trained on the entire dataset, is called the global AlexNet model. The second model is a distributed version of AlexNet in which multiple AlexNets are trained separately on subsets of the training data categorized according to the Saffir-Simpson wind speed scale prescribed by the meterologists. We evaluated the performance of both models against a deep learning benchmark model called \textit{Deepti} using a publicly available cyclone image dataset. Results indicate that both the global model (with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 9.03 knots) and the distributed model (with a RMSE of 9.3 knots) outperform the benchmark model (with a RMSE of 13.62 knots). We provide a thorough discussion of our solution approach, including an explanantion of the AlexNet's performance using gradient class activation maps (grad-CAM). Our proposed solution strategy allows future experimentation with various deep learning models in both single and multi-channel settings.</description>

      <title>Topology of shallow-water waves on the rotating sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological properties of the spectrum of shallow-water waves on a rotating spherical body are established. Particular attention is paid to its spectral flow, i.e. the modes whose frequencies transit between the Rossby and inertia-gravity wavebands as the zonal wave number is varied. Organising the modes according to the number of zeros of their meridional velocity, we conclude that the net number of modes transiting between the shallow-water wavebands on the sphere is null, in contrast with the Matsuno spectrum. This difference can be explained by a miscount of zeros under the $\beta$-plane approximation. We corroborate this result with the analysis of Delplace et al (2017) by showing that the curved metric discloses a pair of degeneracy points in the Weyl symbol of the wave operator, non-existent under the $\beta$-plane approximation, each of them bearing a Chern number $-1$.</description>

      <title>Characteristics of temporal variability of long-duration bursts of high-energy radiation associated with thunderclouds on the Tibetan plateau</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From 1998 to 2017, neutron monitors located at an altitude of 4300 m on the Tibetan plateau detected 127 long-duration bursts of high-energy radiation in association with thunderclouds. These bursts typically lasted for 10 to 40 minutes, and 89\% of them occurred between 10:00 and 24:00 local time. They were also found to be more likely to occur at night, especially during 18:00$-$06:00 local time period. The observed diurnal and seasonal variations in burst frequency were consistent with the frequencies of lightning and precipitation on the Tibetan plateau. Based on 19 years of data, the present study suggests that an annual variation in burst frequency has a periodicity of $\sim$16 years and a lag of $\sim$3 years relative to solar activity.</description>

      <title>The impact of decreasing horizontal grid spacing on the simulation of the mountain boundary layer in the hectometric range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The horizontal grid spacing of numerical weather prediction models keeps decreasing towards the hectometric range. We perform limited-area simulations with the ICON model across horizontal grid spacings (1 km, 500 m, 250 m, 125 m) in the Inn Valley, Austria, and evaluate the model with observations from the CROSSINN measurement campaign. This allows us to investigate whether increasing the horizontal resolution automatically improves the representation of the flow structure, surface exchange, and common meteorological variables. Increasing the horizontal resolution results in an improved simulation of the thermally-induced circulation. However, the model still faces challenges with scale interactions and the evening transition of the up-valley flow. Differences between two turbulence schemes (1D TKE and 3D Smagorinsky) emerge due to their different surface transfer formulations, yielding a delayed evening transition in the 3D Smagorinsky scheme. Generally speaking, the correct simulation of the mountain boundary layer depends mostly on the representation of model topography and surface exchange, and the choice of turbulence parameterization is secondary.</description>
