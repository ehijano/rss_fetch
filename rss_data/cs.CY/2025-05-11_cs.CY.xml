      <title>Silicon Sovereigns: Artificial Intelligence, International Law, and the Tech-Industrial Complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence is reshaping science, society, and power. Yet many debates over its likely impact remain fixated on extremes: utopian visions of universal benefit and dystopian fears of existential doom, or an arms race between the U.S. and China, or the Global North and Global South. What's missing is a serious conversation about distribution - who gains, who loses, and who decides. The global AI landscape is increasingly defined not just by geopolitical divides, but by the deepening imbalance between public governance and private control. As governments struggle to keep up, power is consolidating in the hands of a few tech firms whose influence now rivals that of states. If the twentieth century saw the rise of international institutions, the twenty-first may be witnessing their eclipse - replaced not by a new world order, but by a digital oligarchy. This essay explores what that shift means for international law, global equity, and the future of democratic oversight in an age of silicon sovereignty.</description>

      <title>Would You Rely on an Eerie Agent? A Systematic Review of the Impact of the Uncanny Valley Effect on Trust in Human-Agent Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trust is a fundamental component of human-agent interaction. With the increasing presence of artificial agents in daily life, it is essential to understand how people perceive and trust these agents. One of the key challenges affecting this perception is the Uncanny Valley Effect (UVE), where increasingly human-like artificial beings can be perceived as eerie or repelling. Despite growing interest in trust and the UVE, existing research varies widely in terms of how these concepts are defined and operationalized. This inconsistency raises important questions about how and under what conditions the UVE influences trust in agents. A systematic understanding of their relationship is currently lacking. This review aims to examine the impact of the UVE on human trust in agents and to identify methodological patterns, limitations, and gaps in the existing empirical literature. Following PRISMA guidelines, a systematic search identified 53 empirical studies that investigated both UVE-related constructs and trust or trust-related outcomes. Studies were analyzed based on a structured set of categories, including types of agents and interactions, methodological and measurement approaches, and key findings. The results of our systematic review reveal that most studies rely on static images or hypothetical scenarios with limited real-time interaction, and the majority use subjective trust measures. This review offers a novel framework for classifying trust measurement approaches with regard to the best-practice criteria for empirically investigating the UVE. As the first systematic attempt to map the intersection of UVE and trust, this review contributes to a deeper understanding of their interplay and offers a foundation for future research.

      <title>Automating Infrastructure Surveying: A Framework for Geometric Measurements and Compliance Assessment Using Point Cloud Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automation can play a prominent role in improving efficiency, accuracy, and scalability in infrastructure surveying and assessing construction and compliance standards. This paper presents a framework for automation of geometric measurements and compliance assessment using point cloud data. The proposed approach integrates deep learning-based detection and segmentation, in conjunction with geometric and signal processing techniques, to automate surveying tasks. As a proof of concept, we apply this framework to automatically evaluate the compliance of curb ramps with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), demonstrating the utility of point cloud data in survey automation. The method leverages a newly collected, large annotated dataset of curb ramps, made publicly available as part of this work, to facilitate robust model training and evaluation. Experimental results, including comparison with manual field measurements of several ramps, validate the accuracy and reliability of the proposed method, highlighting its potential to significantly reduce manual effort and improve consistency in infrastructure assessment. Beyond ADA compliance, the proposed framework lays the groundwork for broader applications in infrastructure surveying and automated construction evaluation, promoting wider adoption of point cloud data in these domains. The annotated database, manual ramp survey data, and developed algorithms are publicly available on the project's GitHub page: https://github.com/Soltanilara/SurveyAutomation.</description>

      <title>A Day in Their Shoes: Using LLM-Based Perspective-Taking Interactive Fiction to Reduce Stigma Toward Dirty Work</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Occupations referred to as "dirty work" often face entrenched social stigma, which adversely affects the mental health of workers in these fields and impedes occupational equity. In this study, we propose a novel Interactive Fiction (IF) framework powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) to encourage perspective-taking and reduce biases against these stigmatized yet essential roles. Through an experiment with participants (n = 100) across four such occupations, we observed a significant increase in participants' understanding of these occupations, as well as a high level of empathy and a strong sense of connection to individuals in these roles. Additionally, qualitative interviews with participants (n = 15) revealed that the LLM-based perspective-taking IF enhanced immersion, deepened emotional resonance and empathy toward "dirty work," and allowed participants to experience a sense of professional fulfillment in these occupations. However, participants also highlighted ongoing challenges, such as limited contextual details generated by the LLM and the unintentional reinforcement of existing stereotypes. Overall, our findings underscore that an LLM-based perspective-taking IF framework offers a promising and scalable strategy for mitigating stigma and promoting social equity in marginalized professions.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Dynamics of the Coffee Value Chain in Davao del Sur: An Agent-Based Modeling Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study investigates the coffee value chain dynamics in Davao del Sur using an agent-based model. Three main factors driving interactions among key players were identified: trust, risk, and transaction costs. The model was constructed using NetLogo 6.3.0, and data from a survey questionnaire collected three data points from BACOFA members. Five cases were explored, with each scenario simulated 1000 times. Findings suggest that producers often sell to the market rather than the cooperative due to higher prices. However, producers tend to prioritize trust in buyers and their risk attitude, leading to increased sales to the cooperative. The producer's risk attitude significantly influences their decision-making, affecting performance outcomes such as loans, demand, and price changes. All three factors play a role and exert varying impacts on the value chain. So, the stakeholders' decisions on prioritizing factors in improving relationships depend on their priorities. Nonetheless, simulations show that establishing a harmonious system benefiting all parties is possible. However, achieving this requires adjustments to demand, pricing, trust, and risk attitudes of key players, which may not align with the preferences of some parties in reality.</description>

      <title>Can Prompting LLMs Unlock Hate Speech Detection across Languages? A Zero-shot and Few-shot Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite growing interest in automated hate speech detection, most existing approaches overlook the linguistic diversity of online content. Multilingual instruction-tuned large language models such as LLaMA, Aya, Qwen, and BloomZ offer promising capabilities across languages, but their effectiveness in identifying hate speech through zero-shot and few-shot prompting remains underexplored. This work evaluates LLM prompting-based detection across eight non-English languages, utilizing several prompting techniques and comparing them to fine-tuned encoder models. We show that while zero-shot and few-shot prompting lag behind fine-tuned encoder models on most of the real-world evaluation sets, they achieve better generalization on functional tests for hate speech detection. Our study also reveals that prompt design plays a critical role, with each language often requiring customized prompting techniques to maximize performance.</description>

      <title>Utilizing Dynamic Time Warping for Pandemic Surveillance: Understanding the Relationship between Google Trends Network Metrics and COVID-19 Incidences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17146v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The premise of network statistics derived from Google Trends data to foresee COVID-19 disease progression is gaining momentum in infodemiology. This approach was applied in Metro Manila, National Capital Region, Philippines. Through dynamic time warping (DTW), the temporal alignment was quantified between network metrics and COVID-19 case trajectories, and systematically explored 320 parameter configurations including two network metrics (network density and clustering coefficient), two data preprocessing methods (Rescaling Daily Data and MSV), multiple thresholds, two correlation window sizes, and Sakoe-Chiba band constraints. Results from the Kruskal-Wallis tests revealed that five of the six parameters significantly influenced alignment quality, with the disease comparison type (active cases vs. confirmed cases) demonstrating the strongest effect. The optimal configuration, which is using the network density statistic with a Rescaling Daily Data transformation, a threshold of 0.8, a 15-day window, and a 50-day radius constraint, achieved a DTW score of 36.30. This indicated substantial temporal alignment with the COVID-19 confirmed cases data. The discoveries demonstrate that network metrics rooted from online search behavior can serve as complementary indicators for epidemic surveillance in urban locations like Metro Manila. This strategy leverages the Philippines' extensive online usage during the pandemic to provide potentially valuable early signals of disease spread, and offers a supplementary tool for public health monitoring in resource-limited situations.</description>

      <title>The Typing Cure: Experiences with Large Language Model Chatbots for Mental Health Support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14362v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: People experiencing severe distress increasingly use Large Language Model (LLM) chatbots as mental health support tools. Discussions on social media have described how engagements were lifesaving for some, but evidence suggests that general-purpose LLM chatbots also have notable risks that could endanger the welfare of users if not designed responsibly. In this study, we investigate the lived experiences of people who have used LLM chatbots for mental health support. We build on interviews with 21 individuals from globally diverse backgrounds to analyze how users create unique support roles for their chatbots, fill in gaps in everyday care, and navigate associated cultural limitations when seeking support from chatbots. We ground our analysis in psychotherapy literature around effective support, and introduce the concept of therapeutic alignment, or aligning AI with therapeutic values for mental health contexts. Our study offers recommendations for how designers can approach the ethical and effective use of LLM chatbots and other AI mental health support tools in mental health care.</description>

      <title>Crash Severity Risk Modeling Strategies under Data Imbalance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates crash severity risk modeling strategies for work zones involving large vehicles (i.e., trucks, buses, and vans) under crash data imbalance between low-severity (LS) and high-severity (HS) crashes. We utilized crash data involving large vehicles in South Carolina work zones from 2014 to 2018, which included four times more LS crashes than HS crashes. The objective of this study is to evaluate the crash severity prediction performance of various statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models under different feature selection and data balancing techniques. Findings highlight a disparity in LS and HS predictions, with lower accuracy for HS crashes due to class imbalance and feature overlap. Discriminative Mutual Information (DMI) yields the most effective feature set for predicting HS crashes without requiring data balancing, particularly when paired with gradient boosting models and deep neural networks such as CatBoost, NeuralNetTorch, XGBoost, and LightGBM. Data balancing techniques such as NearMiss-1 maximize HS recall when combined with DMI-selected features and certain models such as LightGBM, making them well-suited for HS crash prediction. Conversely, RandomUnderSampler, HS Class Weighting, and RandomOverSampler achieve more balanced performance, which is defined as an equitable trade-off between LS and HS metrics, especially when applied to NeuralNetTorch, NeuralNetFastAI, CatBoost, LightGBM, and Bayesian Mixed Logit (BML) using merged feature sets or models without feature selection. The insights from this study offer safety analysts guidance on selecting models, feature selection, and data balancing techniques aligned with specific safety goals, providing a robust foundation for enhancing work-zone crash severity prediction.</description>

      <title>Reimagining Urban Science: Scaling Causal Inference with Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12345v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Urban causal research is essential for understanding the complex dynamics of cities and informing evidence-based policies. However, it is challenged by the inefficiency and bias of hypothesis generation, barriers to multimodal data complexity, and the methodological fragility of causal experimentation. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) present an opportunity to rethink how urban causal analysis is conducted. This Perspective examines current urban causal research by analyzing taxonomies that categorize research topics, data sources, and methodological approaches to identify structural gaps. We then introduce an LLM-driven conceptual framework, AutoUrbanCI, composed of four distinct modular agents responsible for hypothesis generation, data engineering, experiment design and execution, and results interpretation with policy recommendations. We propose evaluation criteria for rigor and transparency and reflect on implications for human-AI collaboration, equity, and accountability. We call for a new research agenda that embraces AI-augmented workflows not as replacements for human expertise but as tools to broaden participation, improve reproducibility, and unlock more inclusive forms of urban causal reasoning.</description>

      <title>Scaling Laws For Scalable Oversight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scalable oversight, the process by which weaker AI systems supervise stronger ones, has been proposed as a key strategy to control future superintelligent systems. However, it is still unclear how scalable oversight itself scales. To address this gap, we propose a framework that quantifies the probability of successful oversight as a function of the capabilities of the overseer and the system being overseen. Specifically, our framework models oversight as a game between capability-mismatched players; the players have oversight-specific Elo scores that are a piecewise-linear function of their general intelligence, with two plateaus corresponding to task incompetence and task saturation. We validate our framework with a modified version of the game Nim and then apply it to four oversight games: Mafia, Debate, Backdoor Code and Wargames. For each game, we find scaling laws that approximate how domain performance depends on general AI system capability. We then build on our findings in a theoretical study of Nested Scalable Oversight (NSO), a process in which trusted models oversee untrusted stronger models, which then become the trusted models in the next step. We identify conditions under which NSO succeeds and derive numerically (and in some cases analytically) the optimal number of oversight levels to maximize the probability of oversight success. We also apply our theory to our four oversight games, where we find that NSO success rates at a general Elo gap of 400 are 13.5% for Mafia, 51.7% for Debate, 10.0% for Backdoor Code, and 9.4% for Wargames; these rates decline further when overseeing stronger systems.</description>

      <title>Sentient Agent as a Judge: Evaluating Higher-Order Social Cognition in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assessing how well a large language model (LLM) understands human, rather than merely text, remains an open challenge. To bridge the gap, we introduce Sentient Agent as a Judge (SAGE), an automated evaluation framework that measures an LLM's higher-order social cognition. SAGE instantiates a Sentient Agent that simulates human-like emotional changes and inner thoughts during interaction, providing a more realistic evaluation of the tested model in multi-turn conversations. At every turn, the agent reasons about (i) how its emotion changes, (ii) how it feels, and (iii) how it should reply, yielding a numerical emotion trajectory and interpretable inner thoughts. Experiments on 100 supportive-dialogue scenarios show that the final Sentient emotion score correlates strongly with Barrett-Lennard Relationship Inventory (BLRI) ratings and utterance-level empathy metrics, validating psychological fidelity. We also build a public Sentient Leaderboard covering 18 commercial and open-source models that uncovers substantial gaps (up to 4x) between frontier systems (GPT-4o-Latest, Gemini2.5-Pro) and earlier baselines, gaps not reflected in conventional leaderboards (e.g., Arena). SAGE thus provides a principled, scalable and interpretable tool for tracking progress toward genuinely empathetic and socially adept language agents.</description>
