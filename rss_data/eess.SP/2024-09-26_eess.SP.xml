      <title>A Multi-Agent Multi-Environment Mixed Q-Learning for Partially Decentralized Wireless Network Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Q-learning is a powerful tool for network control and policy optimization in wireless networks, but it struggles with large state spaces. Recent advancements, like multi-environment mixed Q-learning (MEMQ), improves performance and reduces complexity by integrating multiple Q-learning algorithms across multiple related environments so-called digital cousins. However, MEMQ is designed for centralized single-agent networks and is not suitable for decentralized or multi-agent networks. To address this challenge, we propose a novel multi-agent MEMQ algorithm for partially decentralized wireless networks with multiple mobile transmitters (TXs) and base stations (BSs), where TXs do not have access to each other's states and actions. In uncoordinated states, TXs act independently to minimize their individual costs. In coordinated states, TXs use a Bayesian approach to estimate the joint state based on local observations and share limited information with leader TX to minimize joint cost. The cost of information sharing scales linearly with the number of TXs and is independent of the joint state-action space size. The proposed scheme is 50% faster than centralized MEMQ with only a 20% increase in average policy error (APE) and is 25% faster than several advanced decentralized Q-learning algorithms with 40% less APE. The convergence of the algorithm is also demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Distributed Channel Estimation for 6D Movable Antenna: Unveiling Directional Sparsity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA) is an innovative technology to improve wireless network capacity by adjusting 3D positions and 3D rotations of antenna surfaces based on channel spatial distribution. However, the existing works on 6DMA have assumed a central processing unit (CPU) to jointly process the signals of all 6DMA surfaces to execute various tasks. This inevitably incurs prohibitively high processing cost for channel estimation. Therefore, we propose a distributed 6DMA processing architecture to reduce processing complexity of CPU by equipping each 6DMA surface with a local processing unit (LPU). In particular, we unveil for the first time a new \textbf{\textit{directional sparsity}} property of 6DMA channels, where each user has significant channel gains only for a (small) subset of 6DMA position-rotation pairs, which can receive direct/reflected signals from users. In addition, we propose a practical three-stage protocol for the 6DMA-equipped base station (BS) to conduct statistical CSI acquisition for all 6DMA candidate positions/rotations, 6DMA position/rotation optimization, and instantaneous channel estimation for user data transmission with optimized 6DMA positions/rotations. Specifically, the directional sparsity is leveraged to develop distributed algorithms for joint sparsity detection and channel power estimation, as well as for directional sparsity-aided instantaneous channel estimation. Using the estimated channel power, we develop a channel power-based optimization algorithm to maximize the ergodic sum rate of the users by optimizing the antenna positions/rotations. Simulation results show that our channel estimation algorithms are more accurate than benchmarks with lower pilot overhead, and our optimization outperforms fluid/movable antennas optimized only in two dimensions (2D), even when the latter have perfect instantaneous CSI.</description>

      <title>Convolutional Dictionary Learning Based Hybrid-Field Channel Estimation for XL-RIS-Aided Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extremely large reconfigurable intelligent surface (XL-RIS) is emerging as a promising key technology for 6G systems. To exploit XL-RIS's full potential, accurate channel estimation is essential. This paper investigates channel estimation in XL-RIS-aided massive MIMO systems under hybrid-field scenarios where far-field and near-field channels coexist. We formulate this problem using dictionary learning, which allows for joint optimization of the dictionary and estimated channel. To handle the high-dimensional nature of XL-RIS channels, we specifically adopt a convolutional dictionary learning (CDL) formulation. The CDL formulation is cast as a bilevel optimization problem, which we solve using a gradient-based approach. To address the challenge of computing the gradient of the upper-level objective, we introduce an unrolled optimization method based on proximal gradient descent (PGD) and its special case, the iterative soft-thresholding algorithm (ISTA). We propose two neural network architectures, Convolutional ISTA-Net and its enhanced version Convolutional ISTA-Net+, for end-to-end optimization of the CDL. To overcome the limitations of linear convolutional filters in capturing complex hybrid-field channel structures, we propose the CNN-CDL approach, which enhances PGD by replacing linear convolution filters with CNN blocks in its gradient descent step, employing a learnable proximal mapping module in its proximal mapping step, and incorporating cross-layer feature integration. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods for channel estimation in hybrid-field XL-RIS systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Latent representation learning has been an active field of study for decades in numerous applications. Inspired among others by the tokenization from Natural Language Processing and motivated by the research of a simple data representation, recent works have introduced a quantization step into the feature extraction. In this work, we propose a novel strategy to build the neural discrete representation by means of random codebooks. These codebooks are obtained by randomly sampling a large, predefined fixed codebook. We experimentally show the merits and potential of our approach in a task of audio compression and reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Translating Mental Imaginations into Characters with Codebooks and Dynamics-Enhanced Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancements in non-invasive electroencephalogram (EEG)-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) technology have enabled communication through brain activity, offering significant potential for individuals with motor impairments. Existing methods for decoding characters or words from EEG recordings either rely on continuous external stimulation for high decoding accuracy or depend on direct intention imagination, which suffers from reduced discrimination ability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel EEG paradigm based on mental tasks that achieves high discrimination accuracy without external stimulation. Specifically, we propose a codebook in which each letter or number is associated with a unique code that integrates three mental tasks, interleaved with eye-open and eye-closed states. This approach allows individuals to internally reference characters without external stimuli while maintaining reasonable accuracy. For enhanced decoding performance, we apply a Temporal-Spatial-Latent-Dynamics (TSLD) network to capture latent dynamics of spatiotemporal EEG signals. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed EEG paradigm which achieves five times higher accuracy over direct imagination. Additionally, the TSLD network improves baseline methods by approximately 8.5%. Further more, we observe consistent performance improvement throughout the data collection process, suggesting that the proposed paradigm has potential for further optimization with continued use.</description>

      <title>Exploring Brain Network Organization in Alzheimer Disease and Frontotemporal Dementia: A Crossplot Transition Entropy Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dementia poses a growing challenge in our aging society. Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Alzheimer disease (AD) are the leading causes of early-onset dementia. FTD and AD display unique traits in their onset, progression, and treatment responses. In particular, FTD often faces a prolonged diagnostic process and is commonly misdiagnosed with AD due to overlapping symptoms. This study utilizes a complex network model of brain electrical activity using resting-state EEG recordings to address the misdiagnosis. It compares the network organization between AD and FTD, highlighting connectivity differences and examining the significance of EEG signals across frequency bands in distinguishing AD and FTD. The publicly available EEG dataset of 36 AD and 23 FTD patients is utilized for analyses. Cross-plot transition entropy (CPTE) is employed to measure synchronization between EEG signals and construct connection matrices. CPTE offers advantages in parameter setting, computational efficiency, and robustness. The analysis reveals significantly different clustering coefficients (CC), subgraph centrality (SC), and eigenvector centrality (EC) between the two groups. FTD shows higher connectivity, particularly in delta, theta, and gamma bands, owing to lower neurodegeneration. The CPTE-based network parameters effectively classify the two groups with an accuracy of 87.58\%, with the gamma band demonstrating the highest accuracy of 92.87%. Consequently, CPTE-based, complex network analysis of EEG data from AD and FTD patients reveals significant differences in brain network organization. The approach shows potential for identifying unique characteristics and providing insights into the underlying pathophysiological processes of the various forms of dementia, thereby assisting in accurate diagnosis and treatment.</description>

      <title>Secure Enhancement for RIS-Aided UAV with ISAC: Robust Design and Resource Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analyses the security performance of a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication system with integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). We consider a multiple-antenna UAV transmitting ISAC waveforms to simultaneously detect an untrusted target in the surrounding environment and communicate with a ground Internet-of-Things (IoT) device in the presence of an eavesdropper (Eve). Given that the Eve can conceal their channel state information (CSI) in practical scenarios, we assume that the CSI of the eavesdropper channel is imperfect. For this RIS-aided ISAC-UAV system, we aim to maximize the average communication secrecy rate by jointly optimizing UAV trajectory, RIS passive beamforming, transmit beamforming, and receive beamforming. However, this joint optimization problem is non-convex due to multi-variable coupling. As such, we solve the optimization using an efficient and tractable algorithm using a block coordinate descent (BCD) method. Specifically, we develop a successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm based on semidefinite relaxation (SDR) to optimise the joint optimization as four separate non-convex subproblems. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithm can successfully ensure the accuracy of sensing targets and significantly improve the communication secrecy rate of the IoT communication devices.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are key enablers for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems in the 6G communication era. With the capability of dynamically shaping the channel, RISs can enhance communication coverage. Additionally, RISs can serve as additional anchors with high angular resolution to improve localization and sensing services in extreme scenarios. However, knowledge of anchors' states such as position, orientation, and hardware impairments are crucial for localization and sensing applications, requiring dedicated calibration, including geometry and hardware calibration. This paper provides an overview of various types of RIS calibration, their impacts, and the challenges they pose in ISAC systems.</description>

      <title>Sub-Meter Remote Sensing of Soil Moisture Using Portable L-band Microwave Radiometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spaceborne microwave passive soil moisture products are known for their accuracy but are often limited by coarse spatial resolutions. This limits their ability to capture finer soil moisture gradients and hinders their applications. The Portable L band radiometer (PoLRa) offers soil moisture measurements from submeter to tens of meters depending on the altitude of measurement. Given that the assessments of soil moisture derived from this sensor are notably lacking, this study aims to evaluate the performance of submeter soil moisture retrieved from PoLRa mounted on poles at four different locations in central Illinois, USA. The evaluation focuses on the consistency of PoLRa measured brightness temperatures from different directions relative to the same area, and the accuracy of PoLRa derived soil moisture. As PoLRa shares many aspects of the L band radiometer onboard the NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission, two SMAP operational algorithms and the conventional dual channel algorithm were applied to calculate soil moisture from the measured brightness temperatures. The vertically polarized brightness temperatures from the PoLRa are typically more stable than their horizontally polarized counterparts. In each test period, the standard deviations of observed dual polarization brightness temperatures are generally less than 5 K. By comparing PoLRa based soil moisture retrievals against the moisture values obtained by handheld time domain reflectometry, the unbiased root mean square error and the Pearson correlation coefficient are mostly below 0.04 and above 0.75, confirming the high accuracy of PoLRa derived soil moisture retrievals and the feasibility of utilizing SMAP algorithms for PoLRa data. These findings highlight the significant potential of ground or drone based PoLRa measurements as a standalone reference for future spaceborne L band sensors.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Multipath MIMO Channel Model for Imperfect Surface Reflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-field (NF) communications is receiving renewed attention in the context of passive reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) due to their potentially extremely large dimensions. Although line-of-sight (LOS) links are expected to be dominant in NF scenarios, it is not a priori obvious whether or not the impact of non-LOS components can be neglected. Furthermore, despite being weaker than the LOS link, non-LOS links may be required to achieve multiplexing gains in multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) scenarios. In this paper, we develop a generalized statistical NF model for RIS-assisted MIMO systems that extends the widely adopted point-scattering model to account for imperfect reflections at large surfaces like walls, ceilings, and the ground. Our simulation results confirm the accuracy of the proposed model and reveal that in various practical scenarios, the impact of non-LOS components is indeed non-negligible, and thus, needs to be carefully taken into consideration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decoding neurophysiological signals into language is of great research interest within brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. Electroencephalography (EEG), known for its non-invasiveness, ease of use, and cost-effectiveness, has been a popular method in this field. However, current EEG-to-Text decoding approaches face challenges due to the huge domain gap between EEG recordings and raw texts, inherent data bias, and small closed vocabularies. In this paper, we propose SEE: Semantically Aligned EEG-to-Text Translation, a novel method aimed at improving EEG-to-Text decoding by seamlessly integrating two modules into a pre-trained BART language model. These two modules include (1) a Cross-Modal Codebook that learns cross-modal representations to enhance feature consolidation and mitigate domain gap, and (2) a Semantic Matching Module that fully utilizes pre-trained text representations to align multi-modal features extracted from EEG-Text pairs while considering noise caused by false negatives, i.e., data from different EEG-Text pairs that have similar semantic meanings. Experimental results on the Zurich Cognitive Language Processing Corpus (ZuCo) demonstrate the effectiveness of SEE, which enhances the feasibility of accurate EEG-to-Text decoding.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Model-Based Channel Estimation for THz Band Massive MIMO with RF Impairments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: THz band enabled large scale massive MIMO (M-MIMO) is considered as a key enabler for the 6G technology, given its enormous bandwidth and for its low latency connectivity. In the large-scale M-MIMO configuration, enlarged array aperture and small wavelengths of THz results in an amalgamation of both far field and near field paths, which makes tasks such as channel estimation for THz M-MIMO highly challenging. Moreover, at the THz transceiver, radio frequency (RF) impairments such as phase noise (PN) of the analog devices also leads to degradation in channel estimation performance. Classical estimators as well as traditional deep learning (DL) based algorithms struggle to maintain their robustness when performing for large scale antenna arrays i.e., M-MIMO, and when RF impairments are considered for practical usage. To effectively address this issue, it is crucial to utilize a neural network (NN) that has the ability to study the behaviors of the channel and RF impairment correlations, such as a recurrent neural network (RNN). The RF impairments act as sequential noise data which is subsequently incorporated with the channel data, leading to choose a specific type of RNN known as bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) which is followed by gated recurrent units (GRU) to process the sequential data. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms other benchmark approaches at various signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels.</description>

      <title>Sub-Nyquist USF Spectral Estimation: $K$ Frequencies with $6K + 4$ Modulo Samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital acquisition of high bandwidth signals is particularly challenging when Nyquist rate sampling is impractical. This has led to extensive research in sub-Nyquist sampling methods, primarily for spectral and sinusoidal frequency estimation. However, these methods struggle with high-dynamic-range (HDR) signals that can saturate analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). Addressing this, we introduce a novel sub-Nyquist spectral estimation method, driven by the Unlimited Sensing Framework (USF), utilizing a multi-channel system. The sub-Nyquist USF method aliases samples in both amplitude and frequency domains, rendering the inverse problem particularly challenging. Towards this goal, our exact recovery theorem establishes that $K$ sinusoids of arbitrary amplitudes and frequencies can be recovered from $6K + 4$ modulo samples, remarkably, independent of the sampling rate or folding threshold. In the true spirit of sub-Nyquist sampling, via modulo ADC hardware experiments, we demonstrate successful spectrum estimation of HDR signals in the kHz range using Hz range sampling rates (0.078\% Nyquist rate). Our experiments also reveal up to a 33-fold improvement in frequency estimation accuracy using one less bit compared to conventional ADCs. These findings open new avenues in spectral estimation applications, e.g., radars, direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation, and cognitive radio, showcasing the potential of USF.</description>

Abstract: The main result of this thesis is an efficient protocol to determine the frequencies of a signal $C(t)= \sum_k |a_k|^2 e^{i \omega_k t}$, which is given for a finite time, to a high degree of precision. Specifically, we develop a theorem that provides a fundamental precision guarantee. Additionally, we establish an approximation theory for spectral analysis through low-dimensional subspaces that can be applied to a wide range of problems. The signal processing routine relies on a symmetry between harmonic analysis and quantum mechanics. In this context, prolate spheroidal wave functions (PSWF) are identified as the optimal information processing basis. To establish rigorous precision guarantees, we extend the concentration properties of PSWFs to a supremum bound and an $\ell_2$ bound on their derivatives. The new bounds allow us to refine the truncation estimates for the prolate sampling formula. We also provide a new geometrical insight into the commutation relation between an integral operator and a differential operator, both of which have PSWFs as eigenfunctions.</description>

      <title>Is speckle noise more challenging to mitigate than additive noise?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of estimating a function in the presence of both speckle and additive noises. Although additive noise has been thoroughly explored in nonparametric estimation, speckle noise, prevalent in applications such as synthetic aperture radar, ultrasound imaging, and digital holography, has not received as much attention. Consequently, there is a lack of theoretical investigations into the fundamental limits of mitigating the speckle noise.
  This paper is the first step in filling this gap. Our focus is on investigating the minimax estimation error for estimating a $\beta$-H\"older continuous function and determining the rate of the minimax risk. Specifically, if $n$ represents the number of data points, $f$ denotes the underlying function to be estimated, and $\hat{\nu}_n$ is an estimate of $f$, then $\inf_{\hat{\nu}_n} \sup_f \mathbb{E}_f\| \hat{\nu}_n - f \|^2_2$ decays at the rate $n^{-\frac{2\beta}{2\beta+1}}$. Interestingly, this rate is identical to the one achieved for mitigating additive noise when the noise's variance is $\Theta(1)$.
  To validate the accuracy of our minimax upper bounds, we implement the minimax optimal algorithms on simulated data and employ Monte Carlo simulations to characterize their exact risk. Our simulations closely mirror the expected behaviors in decay rate as per our theory.</description>

      <title>ECG-Image-Database: A Dataset of ECG Images with Real-World Imaging and Scanning Artifacts; A Foundation for Computerized ECG Image Digitization and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the ECG-Image-Database, a large and diverse collection of electrocardiogram (ECG) images generated from ECG time-series data, with real-world scanning, imaging, and physical artifacts. We used ECG-Image-Kit, an open-source Python toolkit, to generate realistic images of 12-lead ECG printouts from raw ECG time-series. The images include realistic distortions such as noise, wrinkles, stains, and perspective shifts, generated both digitally and physically. The toolkit was applied to 977 12-lead ECG records from the PTB-XL database and 1,000 from Emory Healthcare to create high-fidelity synthetic ECG images. These unique images were subjected to both programmatic distortions using ECG-Image-Kit and physical effects like soaking, staining, and mold growth, followed by scanning and photography under various lighting conditions to create real-world artifacts.
  The resulting dataset includes 35,595 software-labeled ECG images with a wide range of imaging artifacts and distortions. The dataset provides ground truth time-series data alongside the images, offering a reference for developing machine and deep learning models for ECG digitization and classification. The images vary in quality, from clear scans of clean papers to noisy photographs of degraded papers, enabling the development of more generalizable digitization algorithms.
  ECG-Image-Database addresses a critical need for digitizing paper-based and non-digital ECGs for computerized analysis, providing a foundation for developing robust machine and deep learning models capable of converting ECG images into time-series. The dataset aims to serve as a reference for ECG digitization and computerized annotation efforts. ECG-Image-Database was used in the PhysioNet Challenge 2024 on ECG image digitization and classification.</description>

      <title>Bridge to Real Environment with Hardware-in-the-loop for Wireless Artificial Intelligence Paradigms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nowadays, many machine learning (ML) solutions to improve the wireless standard IEEE802.11p for Vehicular Adhoc Network (VANET) are commonly evaluated in the simulated world. At the same time, this approach could be cost-effective compared to real-world testing due to the high cost of vehicles. There is a risk of unexpected outcomes when these solutions are implemented in the real world, potentially leading to wasted resources. To mitigate this challenge, the hardware-in-the-loop is the way to move forward as it enables the opportunity to test in the real world and simulated worlds together. Therefore, we have developed what we believe is the pioneering hardware-in-the-loop for testing artificial intelligence, multiple services, and HD map data (LiDAR), in both simulated and real-world settings.</description>

      <title>Predictive Covert Communication Against Multi-UAV Surveillance Using Graph Koopman Autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low Probability of Detection (LPD) communication aims to obscure the presence of radio frequency (RF) signals to evade surveillance. In the context of mobile surveillance utilizing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), achieving LPD communication presents significant challenges due to the UAVs' rapid and continuous movements, which are characterized by unknown nonlinear dynamics. Therefore, accurately predicting future locations of UAVs is essential for enabling real-time LPD communication. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework termed predictive covert communication, aimed at minimizing detectability in terrestrial ad-hoc networks under multi-UAV surveillance. Our data-driven method synergistically integrates graph neural networks (GNN) with Koopman theory to model the complex interactions within a multi-UAV network and facilitating long-term predictions by linearizing the dynamics, even with limited historical data. Extensive simulation results substantiate that the predicted trajectories using our method result in at least 63%-75% lower probability of detection when compared to well-known state-of-the-art baseline approaches, showing promise in enabling low-latency covert operations in practical scenarios.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel application of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) to time series forecasting, leveraging their adaptive activation functions for enhanced predictive modeling. Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, KANs replace traditional linear weights with spline-parametrized univariate functions, allowing them to learn activation patterns dynamically. We demonstrate that KANs outperforms conventional Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) in a real-world satellite traffic forecasting task, providing more accurate results with considerably fewer number of learnable parameters. We also provide an ablation study of KAN-specific parameters impact on performance. The proposed approach opens new avenues for adaptive forecasting models, emphasizing the potential of KANs as a powerful tool in predictive analytics.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based Intermittent CSI Estimation with Adaptive Intervals in Integrated Sensing and Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to the distinct objectives and multipath utilization mechanisms between the communication module and radar module, the system design of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) necessitates two types of channel state information (CSI), i.e., communication CSI representing the whole channel gain and phase shifts, and radar CSI exclusively focused on target mobility and position information. However, current ISAC systems apply an identical mechanism to estimate both types of CSI at the same predetermined estimation interval, leading to significant overhead and compromised performances. Therefore, this paper proposes an intermittent communication and radar CSI estimation scheme with adaptive intervals for individual users/targets, where both types of CSI can be predicted using channel temporal correlations for cost reduction or re-estimated via training signal transmission for improved estimation accuracy. Specifically, we jointly optimize the binary CSI re-estimation/prediction decisions and transmit beamforming matrices for individual users/targets to maximize communication transmission rates and minimize radar tracking errors and costs in a multiple-input single-output (MISO) ISAC system. Unfortunately, this problem has causality issues because it requires comparing system performances under re-estimated CSI and predicted CSI during the optimization. Additionally, the binary decision makes the joint design a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, resulting in high complexity when using conventional optimization algorithms. Therefore, we propose a deep reinforcement online learning (DROL) framework that first implements an online deep neural network (DNN) to learn the binary CSI updating decisions from the experiences. Given the learned decisions, we propose an efficient algorithm to solve the remaining beamforming design problem efficiently.</description>

      <title>Damage identification for bridges using machine learning: Development and application to KW51 bridge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The available tools for damage identification in civil engineering structures are known to be computationally expensive and data-demanding. This paper proposes a comprehensive machine learning based damage identification (CMLDI) method that integrates modal analysis and dynamic analysis strategies. The proposed approach is applied to a real structure - KW51 railway bridge in Leuven. CMLDI diligently combines signal processing, machine learning (ML), and structural analysis techniques to achieve a fast damage identification solver that relies on minimal monitoring data. CMLDI considers modal analysis inputs and extracted features from acceleration responses to inform the damage identification based on the long-term and short-term monitoring data. Results of operational modal analysis, through the analysis of long-term monitoring data, are analyzed using pre-trained k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classifiers to identify damage existence, location, and magnitude. A well-crafted assembly of signal processing and ML methods is used to analyze acceleration time histories. Stacked gated recurrent unit (Stacked GRU) networks are used to identify damage existence, kNN classifiers are used to identify damage magnitude, and convolutions neural networks (CNN) are used to identify damage location. The damage identification results for the KW51 bridge demonstrate this approach's high accuracy, efficiency, and robustness. In this work, the training data is retrieved from the sensor of the KW51 bridge as well as the numerical finite element model (FEM). The proposed approach presents a systematic path to the generation of training data using a validated FEM. The data generation relies on modeling combinations of damage locations and magnitudes along the bridge.</description>

      <title>Identification of fault frequency variation in the envelope spectrum in the vibration-based local damage detection in possible changing load/speed conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of local damage diagnosis (based on the detection of impulsive and periodic signals) is discussed. Both features should be checked, as fault frequency must be linked to the true value calculated for a given machine and speed. The precise estimation of the fault frequency is hard due to several factors. If a speed fluctuation exists, it is solved by order analysis. A wider perspective is proposed here, namely, an automatic statistical approach to analyze the distribution of estimated fault frequencies. We propose a procedure to evaluate whether the fault frequency is constant or not. The algorithm uses frequency estimation based on peak detection in the envelope spectrum and statistical testing. We present simulation studies and industrial examples. We have found that if the fault frequency is not constant and its distribution does not follow Gaussian shape with minor variance, then one should use more advanced techniques, e.g. order analysis.</description>

      <title>TFT-multi: simultaneous forecasting of vital sign trajectories in the ICU</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Trajectory forecasting in healthcare data has been an important area of research in precision care and clinical integration for computational methods. In recent years, generative AI models have demonstrated promising results in capturing short and long range dependencies in time series data. While these models have also been applied in healthcare, most of them only predict one value at a time, which is unrealistic in a clinical setting where multiple measures are taken at once. In this work, we extend the framework temporal fusion transformer (TFT), a multi-horizon time series prediction tool, and propose TFT-multi, an end-to-end framework that can predict multiple vital trajectories simultaneously. We apply TFT-multi to forecast 5 vital signs recorded in the intensive care unit: blood pressure, pulse, SpO2, temperature and respiratory rate. We hypothesize that by jointly predicting these measures, which are often correlated with one another, we can make more accurate predictions, especially in variables with large missingness. We validate our model on the public MIMIC dataset and an independent institutional dataset, and demonstrate that this approach outperforms state-of-the-art univariate prediction tools including the original TFT and Prophet, as well as vector regression modeling for multivariate prediction. Furthermore, we perform a study case analysis by applying our pipeline to forecast blood pressure changes in response to actual and hypothetical pressor administration.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Benders Decomposition Approach for Optimal Large-Scale Network Slicing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.15247v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the network slicing (NS) problem which attempts to map multiple customized virtual network requests to a common shared network infrastructure and allocate network resources to meet diverse service requirements. This paper proposes an efficient customized Benders decomposition algorithm for globally solving the large-scale NP-hard NS problem. The proposed algorithm decomposes the hard NS problem into two relatively easy function placement (FP) and traffic routing (TR) subproblems and iteratively solves them enabling the information feedback between each other, which makes it particularly suitable to solve large-scale problems. Specifically, the FP subproblem is to place service functions into cloud nodes in the network, and solving it can return a function placement strategy based on which the TR subproblem is defined; and the TR subproblem is to find paths connecting two nodes hosting two adjacent functions in the network, and solving it can either verify that the solution of the FP subproblem is an optimal solution of the original problem, or return a valid inequality to the FP subproblem that cuts off the current infeasible solution. The proposed algorithm is guaranteed to find the globally optimal solution of the NS problem. By taking the special structure of the NS problem into consideration, we successfully develop two families of valid inequalities that render the proposed algorithm converge much more quickly and thus much more efficient. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed valid inequalities effectively accelerate the convergence of the decomposition algorithm, and the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the existing algorithms in terms of both solution efficiency and quality.</description>

      <title>Optimal vintage factor analysis with deflation varimax</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vintage factor analysis is one important type of factor analysis that aims to first find a low-dimensional representation of the original data, and then to seek a rotation such that the rotated low-dimensional representation is scientifically meaningful. The most widely used vintage factor analysis is the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) followed by the varimax rotation. Despite its popularity, little theoretical guarantee can be provided to date mainly because varimax rotation requires to solve a non-convex optimization over the set of orthogonal matrices.
  In this paper, we propose a deflation varimax procedure that solves each row of an orthogonal matrix sequentially. In addition to its net computational gain and flexibility, we are able to fully establish theoretical guarantees for the proposed procedure in a broader context. Adopting this new deflation varimax as the second step after PCA, we further analyze this two step procedure under a general class of factor models. Our results show that it estimates the factor loading matrix in the minimax optimal rate when the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) is moderate or large. In the low SNR regime, we offer possible improvement over using PCA and the deflation varimax when the additive noise under the factor model is structured. The modified procedure is shown to be minimax optimal in all SNR regimes. Our theory is valid for finite sample and allows the number of the latent factors to grow with the sample size as well as the ambient dimension to grow with, or even exceed, the sample size. Extensive simulation and real data analysis further corroborate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Learnable Wireless Digital Twins: Reconstructing Electromagnetic Field with Neural Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fully harvesting the gain of multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) requires accurate channel information. However, conventional channel acquisition methods mainly rely on pilot training signals, resulting in significant training overheads (time, energy, spectrum). Digital twin-aided communications have been proposed in [1] to reduce or eliminate this overhead by approximating the real world with a digital replica. However, how to implement a digital twin-aided communication system brings new challenges. In particular, how to model the 3D environment and the associated EM properties, as well as how to update the environment dynamics in a coherent manner. To address these challenges, motivated by the latest advancements in computer vision, 3D reconstruction and neural radiance field, we propose an end-to-end deep learning framework for future generation wireless systems that can reconstruct the 3D EM field covered by a wireless access point, based on widely available crowd-sourced world-locked wireless samples between the access point and the devices. This visionary framework is grounded in classical EM theory and employs deep learning models to learn the EM properties and interaction behaviors of the objects in the environment. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed learnable digital twin can implicitly learn the EM properties of the objects, accurately predict wireless channels, and generalize to changes in the environment, highlighting the prospect of this novel direction for future generation wireless platforms.</description>
