      <title>On the orientation of historic Christian churches of Fuerteventura: conciliating tradition, winds and topography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of an analysis of the precise spatial orientation of colonial Christian churches located in the Canary Island of Fuerteventura (Spain). Our sample consists of 48 churches, most built during the period between the Castilian conquest led by the Norman Jean de B\'ethencourt in the 15th century and the end of the 19th century. We examine whether the standard tradition was followed regarding the orientation of the apses of historic churches eastwards. While most of the religious constructions in the sample have their main axes oriented within the solar range, the statistical analysis also reveals the presence of two different groups of churches with different possible interpretations. For the first group, mainly composed of churches located in the central part of the island, an anomalous tendency to orientate them towards a declination of c. -14 degrees is detected. We provide some possible explanations for this, which include the date of a traditional Canarian celebration, an eventual imprint of topography, and the possibility of sunset orientations. Also, this particular value of declination is close to -16.3 degrees, the declination of Sirius during the 17th century. Therefore, we provide ethnographic data that might support an eventually controversial 'bright star' orientation. For the second group, meanwhile, we find a pattern of orientation where the apse of the churches points slightly to the north of due east. We propose this might signal constructions that were oriented to the rising Sun on dates close to Easter, one of the most important festivities of Christianity.</description>

      <title>Legacy of Avicenna in Astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper reassesses the largely neglected contribution of Avicenna (Ibn Sina, 980-1037) to medieval Tajik-Persian astronomy. Drawing on published primary and secondary sources, it reconstructs the main directions of his scientific activity - the construction of an observatory at Isfahan, the design of a high-precision angular instrument that anticipates the modern vernier principle, the formulation of an original method for determining terrestrial longitude from lunar culmination, a systematic refutation of predictive astrology, an optical explanation for the daytime invisibility of the fixed stars, and the earliest extant descriptions of both the transit of Venus on 24 May 1032 and the supernova SN 1006. These achievements not only anticipated comparable European advances by several centuries but also shaped subsequent developments within the Islamic and Latin astronomical traditions. The paper further notes Avicenna's modern scientific commemoration in the naming of asteroid (2755) Avicenna and the lunar crater Avicenna.</description>

      <title>How One Quiet Man Became Everyone's Sage: The Spiritual Recasting of Einstein</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper critically examines the central thesis of Kieran Fox's "I Am a Part of Infinity: The Spiritual Journey of Albert Einstein"-namely, that Einstein's intellectual development constitutes a coherent spiritual path culminating in a form of pantheistic mysticism shaped by both Western and Eastern traditions. Fox presents Einstein as the modern heir to a long-suppressed lineage of rational spirituality, extending from Pythagoras and Spinoza to Vedanta and Buddhism, unified by wonder, reverence for nature, and a vision of cosmic unity. While Fox's account is imaginatively rich and philosophically syncretic, it risks conflating distinct conceptual registers -- scientific, metaphysical, and spiritual -- thereby oversimplifying Einstein's intellectual complexity. Drawing on Einstein's scientific writings and personal reflections, this study reconstructs a historically grounded portrait of his thought, emphasizing its tensions, ambiguities, and resistance to spiritual closure. The paper argues that, though rhetorically compelling, Fox's interpretation substitutes a harmonizing spiritual mythology for the conceptual rigor and epistemic humility that defined Einstein's actual worldview.</description>

      <title>On the Arrow of Time and Organized Complexity in the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.07123v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is a widespread assumption that the universe in general, and the biosphere on Earth in particular, is becoming more complex over time. This study formulates this assumption as a macroscopic law, the law of increasing complexity. It hypothesizes that this macroscopic law emerges in certain open systems, such as the observable universe and the biosphere on Earth. There are two types of complexity: disorganized and organized. The complexity associated with this assumption is organized complexity. To formulate this law, we utilized a quantitative definition of the complexity of organized matters, termed organized complexity (OC), which is defined for probability distributions. We represent any object of complexity as the source of its observed value, which is a probability distribution, allowing us to treat various objects in a unified manner. We need observation systems to represent objects for this formulation. We introduce an order relation between observation systems to demonstrate that the complexity of an object possesses a generic property, one that does not depend on any specific observation system. This study develops a methodology to formulate the arrow of time in terms of increasing organized complexity for open systems; in contrast, the second law of thermodynamics formulated the arrow of time in terms of increasing disorganized complexity for isolated systems. We then apply this hypothesis to the fine-tuning problem of the universe, where the fundamental physical constants appear to be fine-tuned for life on Earth. Our new explanation of the fine-tuning problem, based on this hypothesis, posits that the fundamental physical constants are fine-tuned for the emergence of the law of increasing complexity in the universe. This explanation is considered more plausible than those based on the thoughts of their fine-tuning for life on Earth or the anthropic principle.</description>

      <title>What Price Fiber Bundle Substantivalism? On How to Avoid Holes in Fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On a mathematically foundational level, our most successful physical theories (gauge field theories and general-relativistic theories) are formulated in a framework based on the differential geometry of connections on principal bundles. After reviewing the essentials of this framework, we articulate the generalized hole and point-coincidence arguments, examining how they weight on a substantivalist position towards bundle spaces. This question, then, is considered in light of the Dressing Field Method, which allows a manifestly invariant reformulation of gauge field theories and general-relativistic theories, making their conceptual structure more transparent: it formally implements the point-coincidence argument and thus allows to define (dressed) fields and (dressed) bundle spaces immune to hole-type arguments.</description>

      <title>The physics and metaphysics of the conceptuality interpretation of quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics has maintained over the years the reputation of being "the most obscure theory." It works perfectly well, but nobody seems to know why. It has been argued that the difficulty in understanding quantum theory is our failed attempt to force onto it a wrong conceptual scheme, wanting at all costs to think about the objects of the theory as, precisely, objects, i.e., entities having continuously actual spatiotemporal properties. This too restrictive spatiotemporal scheme is most probably at the heart of the problem, as also underlined by the Einsteinian revolution, but then what could be an alternative? Many thinkers have suggested that we must surrender to the fact that our physical world is one of immanent powers and potencies. Aristotle did so ante quantum litteram, followed by scholars like Heisenberg, Primas, Shimony, Piron, Kastner, Kauffman, de Ronde, just to name a few, including the authors, who were both students of Piron in Geneva. However, if on the one hand a potentiality ontology puts the accent on the processes of change, responsible for the incessant shifts between actual and potential properties, on the other hand it does not tell what these changes are all about. In other words, the metaphysical question remains of identifying the nature of the bearer of these potencies, or potentialities, and of the entities that can actualize them. It is the purpose of the present article to emphasize that the above question has found a possible answer in the recent Conceptuality Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics, which we believe offers the missing ontology and metaphysics that can make the theory fully intelligible, and even intuitive.</description>
