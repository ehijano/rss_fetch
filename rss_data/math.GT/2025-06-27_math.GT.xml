      <title>On nonorientable $4$--manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present several structural results on closed, nonorientable, smooth $4$--manifolds, extending analogous results and machinery for the orientable case. We prove the existence of simplified broken Lefschetz fibrations and simplified trisections on nonorientable $4$--manifolds, yielding descriptions of them via factorizations in mapping class groups of nonorientable surfaces. With these tools in hand, we classify low genera simplified broken Lefschetz fibrations on nonorientable $4$--manifolds. We also establish that every closed, smooth $4$--manifold is obtained by surgery along a link of tori in a connected sum of copies of $\mathbb{CP}^2$, $S^1 \times S^3$ and $S^1\widetilde{\times} S^3$. Our proofs make use of topological modifications of singularities, handlebody decompositions, and mapping classes of surfaces.</description>

      <title>On regularity of profinite isomorphisms between cusped hyperbolic 3-manifolds and the $A$-polynomial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that any isomorphism between the profinite completions of the fundamental groups of two cusped finite-volume hyperbolic 3-manifolds is regular and peripheral regular. As an application, we show that the $A$-polynomial of prime knots in $S^3$ is a profinite invariant, up to possible mirror image.</description>

      <title>An Invariant for Triple-Point-Free Immersed Spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define an invariant of triple-point-free immersions of $2$-spheres into Euclidean $3$-space, taking values in $l^1(\mathbb{Z})$. It remains unchanged under regular homotopies through such immersions. An explicit description of its image shows that the space of triple-point-free immersed spheres has infinitely many regular homotopy classes. Consequently, many pairs of immersed spheres can only be connected by regular homotopies that pass through triple points. We represent the double points of a triple-point-free immersed sphere using a directed tree, equipped with a pair relation on the edges and an integer-valued function on the vertices. The invariant depends on this function and on the vertex indegrees.</description>

      <title>Metric weak proper discontinuity for pseudo-Anosov maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a metric version of weak proper discontinuity (WPD) for pseudo-Anosov maps on surfaces. As an application, we show that there are plenty of quasi-morphisms on the homeomorphism group of a torus or a hyperbolic surface that are unbounded on certain homeomorphisms with large fixed set.</description>

      <title>Structural stability and generic transitions of "incompressible" line fields on surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Various line fields naturally arise on surfaces in both physical and biological contexts, and generic singularities frequently appear in the form of 1-prong (thorn-like) and 3-prong (tripod-like) configurations, which can be modeled by partial differential equations with specific parameter values. However, it remains open under which topologies such line fields are structurally stable and form an open dense subset. In this paper, we propose a new topological framework for describing line fields and their evaluations on surfaces that is suitable from both theoretical and applied perspectives. Specifically, we demonstrate that, under a topology defined by a ``cone'' structure, line fields with 1-prong and 3-prong singularities are generic when an ``incompressibility condition'' holds. We also introduce representations of complete invariants for generic line fields and their generic transitions. These representations enable the evolution of ``incompressible'' line fields -- such as those observed in active nematics -- to be encoded as walks on transition graphs, providing a combinatorial framework for their analysis.</description>

      <title>Faithful Burau-like representations of some rank two Garside groups and torus knot groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a method to produce faithful representations of the groups $G(n,m)=\langle X, Y \ \vert \ X^m = Y^n \rangle$ in $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{C}[t^{\pm 1}, q^{\pm 1}])$. These groups are Garside groups and the Garside normal forms of elements of the corresponding monoid can be explicitly recovered from the matrices, in the spirit of Krammer's proof of the linearity of Artin's braid groups. We use this method to construct several explicit faithful representations of the above groups, among which a representation which generalizes the reduced Burau representation of $B_3 \cong G(2,3)$ to a large family of groups of the form $G(n,m)$ with $n$, $m$ coprime (which are torus knot groups). Like the Burau representation, this representation specializes to a representation of a reflection-like quotient that we previously introduced, called \textit{$2$-toric reflection group}. As a byproduct we get a "Burau representation" for some exceptional complex braid groups, which also shows that the latter embed into their Hecke algebra.</description>

      <title>Hardness of computation of quantum invariants on 3-manifolds with restricted topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02814v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum invariants in low dimensional topology offer a wide variety of valuable invariants of knots and 3-manifolds, presented by explicit formulas that are readily computable. Their computational complexity has been actively studied and is tightly connected to topological quantum computing. In this article, we prove that for any 3-manifold quantum invariant in the Reshetikhin-Turaev model, there is a deterministic polynomial time algorithm that, given as input an arbitrary closed 3-manifold $M$, outputs a closed 3-manifold $M'$ with same quantum invariant, such that $M'$ is hyperbolic, contains no low genus embedded incompressible surface, and is presented by a strongly irreducible Heegaard diagram. Our construction relies on properties of Heegaard splittings and the Hempel distance. At the level of computational complexity, this proves that the hardness of computing a given quantum invariant of 3-manifolds is preserved even when severely restricting the topology and the combinatorics of the input. This positively answers a question raised by Samperton.</description>
