      <title>Estimating the epidemic threshold under individual vaccination behaviour and adaptive social connections: A game-theoretic complex network model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information dissemination intricately intertwines with the dynamics of infectious diseases in the contemporary interconnected world. Recognizing the critical role of public awareness, individual vaccination choices appear to be an essential factor in collective efforts against emerging health threats. This study aims to characterize disease transmission dynamics under evolving social connections, information sharing, and individual vaccination decisions. To address this important problem, we present an integrated behaviour-prevalence model on an adaptive multiplex network. While the physical layer (layer-II) focuses on disease transmission under vaccination, the virtual layer (layer-I), representing individuals' social contacts, is adaptive and deals with information dissemination, resulting in the dynamics of vaccination choice in a socially influenced environment. Utilizing the microscopic Markov Chain Method (MMCM), we derive analytical expressions of the epidemic threshold for populations with different levels of perceived vaccine risk. It indicates that the adaptive nature of social contacts contributes to the higher epidemic threshold compared to non-adaptive scenarios, and numerical simulations also support that. The network topology, such as the power-law exponent of a scale-free network, also significantly influences the spreading of infections in the network population. We also observe that vaccine uptake increases proportionately with the number of individuals with a higher perceived infection risk or a higher sensitivity of an individual to their non-vaccinated neighbours. As a result, our findings provide insights for public health officials in developing vaccination programs in light of the evolution of social connections, information dissemination, and vaccination choice in the digital era.</description>

      <title>City-Scale Assessment of Pedestrian Exposure to Air Pollution: A Case Study in Barcelona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Air pollution is a pressing environmental risk to public health, particularly in cities where population density and pollution levels are high. Traditional methods for exposure analysis often rely on census data, but recent studies highlight the impact of daily mobility on individuals' exposure. Here, we develop a methodology to determine unprecedented pedestrian exposure estimates at the city scale by combining sidewalk pedestrian flows with high-resolution (25 m x 25 m) NO2 data from bias-corrected predictions of the air quality system CALIOPE-Urban. Applied to Barcelona (Spain) for the year 2019, we show that pedestrian flow and NO2 levels exhibit negligible temporal correlation. While short-term (hourly) exposure is driven by pedestrian mobility, long-term (monthly) exposure is dominated by NO2 patterns. We identify strong spatial gradients of exposure, highlighting the importance for high-resolution solutions at the sidewalks scale. Finally, we determine that exposure mitigation strategies should consider different citizen subgroups based on their mobility and preferred routes, as significant differences were found between residential and pedestrian exposure. Our results provide exposure indicators designed for city planners and policymakers, helping to prioritize mitigation measures where and when they are most needed.</description>

      <title>Competition between simple and complex contagion on temporal networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Behavioral adoptions are influenced by peers in different ways. While some individuals may change after a single incoming influence, others need multiple cumulated attempts. These two mechanism, known as the simple and the complex contagions, often occur together in social phenomena alongside personal factors determining individual adoptions. Here we aim to identify, which of these contagion mechanism dominate a spreading process propagated by time-varying interactions. We consider three types of spreading scenarios: ones pre-dominated by simple or complex contagion, and mixed dynamics where the dominant mechanism changes during the unfolding of the spreading process. We propose different methods to analytically identify the transitions between these three scenarios and compare them with numerical simulations. This work offers new insights into social contagion dynamics on temporal networks, without assuming prior knowledge about individual's contagion mechanism driving their adoption decisions.</description>

      <title>The Impact of the Virtualization of Scholarly Conferences on the Gender Structure of Conference Contributors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates whether the virtualization of academic conferences in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic changed the gender structure of conference participants. We explored this question utilizing authorship data from the Web of Science Conference Proceedings Citation Index for 180 conferences in 30 conference series held between 2017 and 2023. At least one edition of each analyzed conference series was launched in a virtual or hybrid form. This sample enables a comparison of differences in the gender participation of conference authors while controlling for heterogeneity among conference series. Using linear and logistic regression models, we identified a positive difference in women's involvement in virtual and hybrid conferences compared to onsite events. However, this effect was due less to the increased participation of women in virtual and hybrid conferences than to the decreased participation of women in the onsite editions of the analyzed conference series.</description>

      <title>A cross-platform analysis of polarization and echo chambers in climate change discussions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the intensification of climate change discussion, social media has become prominent in disseminating reliable and unreliable content. In this study, we present a cross-platform analysis on Youtube and Twitter, and examine the polarization and echo chambers in social media discussions in four datasets related to climate change: COP27, IPCC, Climate Refugees, and Do\~{n}ana. We have identified communities of users spreading misinformation on Twitter, although they remain relatively isolated from the rest of the network. The analysis by interaction type reveals that climate change sceptics use mentions to draw the attention of other communities. The YouTube posts referenced on Twitter reveal a strong correlation in the community organisation of social media, suggesting a platform alignment. Moreover, we report the presence of echo chambers in YouTube post-sharing related to mainstream and sceptical content.</description>

      <title>Het-node2vec: second order random walk sampling for heterogeneous multigraphs embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.01425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.01425v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many real-world problems are naturally modeled as heterogeneous graphs, where nodes and edges represent multiple types of entities and relations. Existing learning models for heterogeneous graph representation usually depend on the computation of specific and user-defined heterogeneous paths, or in the application of large and often not scalable deep neural network architectures. We propose Het-node2vec, an extension of the node2vec algorithm, designed for embedding heterogeneous graphs. Het-node2vec addresses the challenge of capturing the topological and structural characteristics of graphs and the semantic information underlying the different types of nodes and edges of heterogeneous graphs, by introducing a simple stochastic node and edge type switching strategy in second order random walk processes. The proposed approach also introduces an ''attention mechanism'' to focus the random walks on specific node and edge types, thus allowing more accurate embeddings and more focused predictions on specific node and edge types of interest. Empirical results on benchmark datasets show that Hetnode2vec achieves comparable or superior performance with respect to state-of-the-art methods for heterogeneous graphs in node label and edge prediction tasks.</description>
