      <title>Lagrangian versus Eulerian Methods for Toroidally-Magnetized Isothermal Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A number of simulations have seen the emergence of strongly-toroidally-magnetized accretion disks from interstellar medium inflows. Recently, Guo et al. 2025 (G25) studied an idealized test problem of toroidally-magnetized disks in isothermal ideal MHD with an Eulerian static-mesh method, and argued the midplane behavior changes qualitatively (with a significant loss of toroidal magnetic flux) when the the thermal scale-length is resolved ($\Delta x &lt; H_{\rm thermal}$). We rerun the G25 test problem with two Lagrangian methods: meshless finite-mass, and meshless finite-volume. We show that Lagrangian methods reproduce the high-resolution ($\Delta x \ll H_{\rm thermal}$) Eulerian G25 results. At low resolution ($\Delta x \gg H_{\rm thermal}$), behaviors differ: Lagrangian methods still lose flux and evolve 'as close as possible' to the converged solution, while Eulerian methods show no evolution. We argue this difference in convergence behavior is related to the ability of Lagrangian codes to follow flows to an arbitrarily thin midplane layer, analogous to the well-studied difference in Jeans fragmentation problems. This and results from other higher-resolution simulations and different codes suggest that the sustained midplane toroidal fields seen in recent Lagrangian multi-scale, multi-physics simulations cannot be a numerical resolution effect, and some physical difference between those simulations and the G25 test problem explains their different behaviors.</description>

      <title>Two Step Localization Method for Electromagnetic Followup of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Gravitational-Wave Triggers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid detection and follow-up of electromagnetic (EM) counterparts to gravitational wave (GW) signals from binary neutron star (BNS) mergers are essential for constraining source properties and probing the physics of relativistic transients. Observational strategies for these early EM searches are therefore critical, yet current practice remains suboptimal, motivating improved, coordination-aware approaches. We propose and evaluate the Two-Step Localization strategy, a coordinated observational protocol in which one wide-field auxiliary telescope and one narrow-field main telescope monitor the evolving GW sky localization in real time. The auxiliary telescope, by virtue of its large field of view, has a higher probability of detecting early EM emission. Upon registering a candidate signal, it triggers the main telescope to slew to the inferred location for prompt, high-resolution follow-up. We assess the performance of Two-Step Localization using large-scale simulations that incorporate dynamic sky-map updates, realistic telescope parameters, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)-weighted localization contours. For context, we compare Two-Step Localization to two benchmark strategies lacking coordination. Our results demonstrate that Two-Step Localization significantly reduces the median detection latency, highlighting the effectiveness of targeted cooperation in the early-time discovery of EM counterparts. Our results point to the most impactful next step: next-generation faster telescopes that deliver drastically higher slew rates and shorter scan times, reducing the number of required tiles; a deeper, truly wide-field auxiliary improves coverage more than simply adding more telescopes.</description>

      <title>Multiple outflows and delayed ejections revealed by early imaging of novae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Novae are thermonuclear eruptions on accreting white dwarfs in interacting binaries. Although most of the accreted envelope is expelled, the mechanism -- impulsive ejection, multiple outflows or prolonged winds, or a common-envelope interaction -- remains uncertain. GeV $\gamma$-ray detections from $&gt;20$ Galactic novae establish these eruptions as nearby laboratories for shock physics and particle acceleration, underscoring the need to determine how novae eject their envelopes. Here we report on near-infrared interferometry, supported with multiwavelength observations, of two $\gamma$-ray detected novae. The images of the very fast 2021 nova V1674~Her, taken just 2--3 days after discovery, reveal the presence of two perpendicular outflows. The interaction between these outflows likely drives the observed $\gamma$-ray emission. Conversely, the images of the very slow 2021 nova V1405~Cas suggest a delay in the ejection of the bulk of the accreted envelope of more than 50 days after the start of eruption, as the nova slowly rises to visible peak and during which the envelope engulfed the system in a common envelope phase. These unprecedented images offer direct observational evidence that the mechanisms driving mass ejection from the surfaces of accreting white dwarfs are not as simple as previously thought, revealing multiple outflows and delayed ejections.</description>

      <title>Absorption of strong electromagnetic waves in magnetized pair plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss synchrotron absorption of a short electromagnetic pulse that propagates in a cold magnetized pair plasma. We show that the pulse can be absorbed when $\omega_{\rm B}/a_0&lt; \omega&lt; a_0\omega_{\rm B}$, where $a_0&gt;1$ is the strength parameter of the pulse, and $\omega$ and $\omega_{\rm B}$ respectively are the frequency of the wave and the cyclotron frequency in the background magnetic field (all quantities are defined in the reference frame where the particles are at rest before being illuminated by the pulse). The condition $\omega_{\rm B}/a_0&lt; \omega&lt; a_0\omega_{\rm B}$ is essentially a generalization of the cyclotron resonance to strong electromagnetic pulses with $a_0&gt;1$. When $\omega_{\rm B}/a_0&lt; \omega&lt; a_0\omega_{\rm B}$, the propagation of electromagnetic waves in a plasma can be very different with respect to the propagation in vacuum because the wave equation is strongly non-linear. Then it is unclear whether the particles are heated stochastically due to synchrotron absorption, as found by studying the motion of a test particle in the field of a vacuum electromagnetic wave. We discuss implications of our results for constraining emission models of fast radio bursts.</description>

      <title>Nuclear parameter inference with semi-agnostic priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio pulsar timing, X-ray pulse profile modeling or gravitational-wave detections of binary mergers involving at least one neutron star offer the opportunity to elucidate the properties of dense and neutron rich matter in thermodynamic regimes inaccessible to nuclear laboratories. Such inference relies on building appropriate equation-of-state priors, such as the recently introduced semi-agnostic constructions that incorporate nuclear theory and experimental information available in low to intermediate density regimes, while offering the necessary flexibility at high density. In this paper, we assess how detections of mass, radius, and tidal deformability for low-mass ($\sim 1$M$_{\odot}$) or high-mass ($\sim 1.9$M$_{\odot}$) neutron stars would contribute to constraining nuclear empirical parameters in an inference based on semi-agnostic equation-of-state priors. We first assessed the correlation factors between nuclear empirical parameters and the zero-temperature and $\beta$-equilibrated pressure in different regimes of density. We then simulate observations for three nucleonic equations of state to test the recovery of the corresponding nuclear empirical parameters. We show that not all nuclear empirical parameters significantly correlate with the pressure and find a competition between them in the high-density regime that challenges their inference. We also find that using semi-agnostic constructions instead of assuming a nucleonic content up to the highest densities in the neutron-star core can help recover more accurately the true nuclear empirical parameters. Parameterizing the high-density regime of the equation of state with the nucleonic meta-model can pollute the inference of nuclear empirical parameters; semi-agnostic constructions are a solution to that. However, many nuclear matter empirical parameters contribute in a similar way to the building of baryonic pressure.</description>

      <title>A Persistently Active Fast Radio Burst source Embedded in an Expanding Supernova Remnant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) remain one of the most puzzling astrophysical phenomena. While most FRBs are detected only once or sporadically, we present the identification of FRB 20190520B as the first persistently active source over a continuous span of ~ four years. This rare long-term activity enabled a detailed investigation of its dispersion measure (DM) evolution. We also report that FRB 20190520B exhibits a substantial decrease in DM at a global rate of minus 12.4 plus or minus 0.3 pc cm^-3 yr^-1, exceeding previous FRB DM variation measurements by a factor of three and surpassing those observed in pulsars by orders of magnitude. The magnitude and consistency of the DM evolution, along with a high host DM contribution, strongly indicate that the source resides in a dense, expanding ionized medium, likely a young supernova remnant (SNR).</description>

      <title>Search for UHE gamma photons in cosmic rays by studying the geomagnetic influence on air-shower muons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major challenge in ground-based ultra-high-energy gamma-ray observations remains in discriminating sporadic gamma-ray signals from a huge background of cosmic-ray events. To achieve good discrimination power of gamma rays against protons, an unconventional approach is presented that exploits the geomagnetic influence on air shower muons in Monte Carlo shower events. A recognizable polar asymmetry in the positive and negative muon distributions is noticed after transforming the impact coordinates of each muon from the observer plane onto the shower front plane, plus a judicious ignoring of the minimal attenuation of muons in the space between the two planes. A couple of observables, $d_{\text{max}}$ and $N_{\mu; \text{IQS}}^{\text{tr.}}$, can be extracted from the formation of two densely populated positive and negative muon zones in each shower. Both observables demonstrate excellent gamma/proton discrimination power, with efficiencies of $93.2\%$ and $98.6\%$. This analysis permitted the usage of muon detectors just covering a small area of $\simeq{1.4}\%$ of a square-km array for ultra-high-energy gamma-ray observations. It is expected that the present and future gamma-ray observatories will implement the current approach.</description>

      <title>Evolution of the Inner Accretion Flow in Swift J1727.8$-$1613 across Intermediate States: Insights from Broadband Spectral and Timing Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive broadband spectral and variability study of the newly detected black hole X-ray binary Swift~J1727.8--1613 in the intermediate states during its 2023 outburst, using multi-mission observations from NICER, NuSTAR, AstroSat, and Insight-HXMT. The spectral data up to $78$ keV in the hard-intermediate state (HIMS) requires models with two Comptonizing regions. In contrast, models with a single Comptonizing region adequately describe the soft-intermediate states (SIMS), implying a significant evolution in the disk-corona geometry between the states. The hard X-ray tail above $100$ keV in the HIMS, detected with both AstroSat/CZTI and Insight-HXMT/HE, indicates that the electron population in the corona is not purely thermal but rather hybrid, with a power-law distribution above the thermal cutoff. While both the reflection modeling and disk continuum fitting favor a truncated disk geometry in the HIMS, the disk substantially moves close to the innermost stable circular orbit in the SIMS, accompanied by a significant rise in the disk temperature. This interpretation is further supported by the increase in the QPO frequency from $\sim1.3$ to $\sim6.6$ Hz. From joint modeling of the disk continuum and reflection component, we estimate a black hole mass of $10.5^{+7.7}_{-3.0}$, spin of $0.79^{+0.03}_{-0.13}$, and disk inclination angle of $42^\circ$-$50^\circ$, which match well with the previously reported spectro-polarimetric measurements. The inferred source distance of $\sim3.5$ kpc is consistent with the recent estimate based on optical spectroscopy. We find a weakly variable or stable disk and a highly variable Comptonized component.</description>

      <title>CTAO LST-1 observations of magnetar SGR 1935+2154: Deep limits on sub-second bursts and persistent tera-electronvolt emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154 has exhibited prolific high-energy (HE) bursting activity in recent years. Investigating its potential tera-electronvolt counterpart could provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of magnetar emission and very high-energy (VHE) processes in extreme astrophysical environments. We aim to search for a possible tera-electronvolt counterpart to both its persistent and sub-second-scale burst emission. We analysed over 25 h of observations from the Large-Sized Telescope prototype (LST-1) of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) during periods of HE activity from SGR 1935+2154 in 2021 and 2022 to search for persistent emission. For bursting emission, we selected and analysed nine 0.1 s time windows centred around known short X-ray bursts, targeting potential sub-second-scale tera-electronvolt counterparts in a low-photon-statistics regime. While no persistent or bursting emission was detected in our search, we establish upper limits for the tera-electronvolt emission of a short magnetar burst simultaneous to its soft gamma-ray flux. Specifically, for the brightest burst in our sample, the ratio between tera-electronvolt and X-ray flux is less than $10^{-3}$. The non-detection of either persistent or bursting tera-electronvolt emission from SGR 1935+2154 suggests that if such components exist, they may occur under specific conditions not covered by our observations. This aligns with theoretical predictions of VHE components in magnetar-powered fast radio bursts and the detection of MeV - GeV emission in giant magnetar flares. These findings underscore the potential of magnetars, fast radio bursts, and other fast transients as promising candidates for future observations in the low-photon-statistics regime with Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes, particularly with the CTAO.</description>

      <title>The X-ray/UV Connection in NGC 5548: A Rapidly Varying Corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent intensive monitoring campaigns of active galactic nuclei (AGN) have provided simultaneous X-ray, UV, and optical data of unprecedented quality. The observations reveal a strong correlation between the UV and optical variability, but a weaker correlation between the X-ray and UV bands, challenging the standard X-ray reprocessing scenario. We revisit the X-ray/UV connection in NGC 5548 by fitting archival 2014 HST and Swift/XRT light curves assuming X-ray reverberation from a dynamically evolving X-ray corona. Our results show that, as long as the corona height, photon index and power vary over time, X-ray reverberation can explain the observed UV and optical variability within 2% and 5%, respectively (on average). The evolution of the best-fit parameters suggests that fast changes in coronal geometry and energetics on a time scale of days are required to explain the observed variability.</description>

      <title>SRG/eROSITA-SDSS view on the relation between X-ray and UV emission for quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the idea of using quasars as standardizable candles for cosmology, we examine the relation between X-ray (at 2 keV, $L_{\rm 2keV}$) and ultraviolet (at 2500 Angstrom, $L_{\rm 2500}$) monochromatic luminosities of quasars using a sample of 2414 X-ray sources from the SRG/eROSITA all-sky survey cross-matched with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data release 16 quasar catalogue (SDSS DR16Q), at redshifts between 0.5 and 2.5. These objects are bright both in X-rays and in the optical, so that the sample is characterized by nearly 100% statistical completeness. We have developed a new method for determining the $L_{\rm 2keV}-L_{\rm 2500}$ relation, which consistently takes into account (i) X-ray and UV flux limited object selection, (ii) X-ray and UV variability of quasars, and (iii) the decreasing space density of quasars with increasing luminosity. Assuming a linear relation between $l_{\rm X}\equiv\log(L_{\rm 2keV}/[{\rm erg\,s^{-1}\,Hz^{-1}}])$ and $l_{\rm UV}\equiv\log(L_{\rm 2500}/[{\rm erg\,s^{-1}\,Hz^{-1}}])$, we find the slope, $\gamma=0.69\pm0.02$ (hereafter all uncertainties are quoted at the 68% confidence level), and normalization, $l_{\rm X}=26.45\pm0.02$ at $l_{\rm UV}=30.5$, of the $L_{\rm 2keV}$ ($L_{\rm 2500}$) dependence. These values are not substantially different from the results of previous studies. A key novel aspect of our work is allowance for intrinsic scatter (which adds to the dispersion induced by quasar variability and flux measurement uncertainties) of the $L_{\rm 2keV}-L_{\rm 2500}$ relation in both variables, i.e. in X-ray and UV luminosity. The intrinsic X-ray scatter ($\sigma^2_{\rm intX}=0.066\pm0.005$) strongly dominates over the UV one ($\sigma^2_{\rm intUV}=0.001^{+0.003}_{-0.001}$). Further studies should seek to explain this behaviour in terms of accretion onto supermassive black holes and orientation of quasars with respect to the observer.</description>

      <title>Hadronic Emissions from the Microquasar V4641 Sgr, SS433, and its implications in the Diffuse Galactic Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microquasars (MQs) are Galactic binary systems, consisting of a star and a compact object, a neutron star or a stellar mass black hole, which accretes matter from its companion star and gives rise to relativistic jets. Recent detection of very-high-energy (VHE; $E \gtrsim 100,\text{GeV}$) and ultra-high-energy (UHE; $E \gtrsim 100,\text{TeV}$) gamma-rays by LHAASO, HAWC and HESS from the MQ V4641 Sgr and SS 433 suggests them as Galactic PeVatrons. In this work, we studied a hadronic origin of the observed TeV-PeV gamma-ray emission from these MQs. We considered the hadronic scenario where the gamma-rays are produced by the interaction of relativistic protons in the MQ jet with the stellar wind. We fitted our model with observed data and constrained physical parameters like the hadronic jet power fraction, the proton spectral index, the maximum proton energy and the jet bulk Lorentz factor. Our best-fit model shows hard proton spectra ($1.84-2.44$) and maximum proton energies between 1 and 5 PeV. We also estimated the all-flavor neutrino fluxes corresponding to the gamma-ray fluxes from the hadronic model and found that V4641 sgr can be detected by next-generation neutrino telescopes like KM3NeT-ARCA and TRIDENT. Furthermore, we modeled a synthetic population of Galactic MQs and estimated their contribution to the diffuse TeV-PeV gamma-ray flux. For the inner Galaxy PSR contribution dominates in the range 10-100 TeV, and above 100 TeV diffused cosmic ray interactions with the molecular clouds is most dominant. We find that a population $\sim 14$ MQs is required to explain the LHAASO data above 100 TeV. For the outer Galaxy, we show that MQs are the dominant class of sources, and we constrain their population $\sim$14. Our findings strongly suggest that MQs are efficient particle accelerators, contributing to Galactic PeVatrons and potential multimessenger sources in our Galaxy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter is expected to accumulate inside neutron stars, modifying the structure of isolated stars and influencing both the dynamics of binary mergers and the evolution of the resulting hypermassive remnants. Since differential rotation is the primary mechanism delaying the collapse of these remnants, understanding its behavior is crucial when assessing the impact of an embedded dark component. In this work, we extend the numerical code RNS to describe two gravitationally coupled fluids in differential rotation, with baryonic matter modeled by a realistic nuclear equation of state and dark matter represented as a self-interacting bosonic condensate. Within this framework, we construct equilibrium sequences for a representative differential rotation law, providing a basis to explore how dark matter may influence the global properties and rotational dynamics of binary neutron star remnants.</description>

      <title>Black-hole ringdown with templates capturing spin precession: a critical re-analysis of GW190521</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ringdown phase of a binary black-hole merger provides a clean probe of strong-field gravity, as it can be modeled with minimal assumptions. The quasi-normal-mode frequencies encode the mass and spin of the Kerr black-hole remnant, while the mode excitation depends on the progenitor binary. In this paper, we implement a recently developed amplitude model that captures spin precession in a simulation-based inference pipeline that specifically targets ringdown signals. We present a critical re-analysis of GW190521 -- a short-duration, merger-dominated event with conflicting interpretations. Spin-aligned and precessing analyses at two ringdown start times show that precession induces modest but systematic shifts in inferred parameters and subdominant mode amplitudes, although such ringdown-only analyses provide no strong evidence for precession. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of physics-informed precessing ringdown modelling, paving the way for the identification of spin precession in gravitational-wave events using solely their ringdown stages, where waveform systematics are expected to be substantially less prominent.</description>

      <title>The Glow of Axion Quark Nugget Dark Matter: (IV) CMB Spectral and Anisotropy Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axion quark nuggets (AQNs) are macroscopic dark-matter candidates, with masses of the order of a few grams to a kilogram and sub-micron radius, thought to form at the Quantum Chromo Dynamic era through axion-induced charge separation. This framework naturally links the dark and visible matter abundances ($\Omega_{\rm DM} \sim \Omega_{\rm visible}$) and provides a mechanism for generating the baryon-antibaryon asymmetry where dark matter is composed of matter AQNs and antimatter AQNs. Although behaving as cold dark matter on cosmological scales, baryons annihilate with antimatter AQNs, producing ionizing high-energy photons. The resulting energy injection may imprint spectral distortions on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and modify the reionization history. Using a modified version of the \texttt{CLASS} Boltzmann code we compute the impact of this energy injection on the $\mu$ and $y$ spectral distortion parameters as well as on the optical depth. We find that (1) the CMB anisotropies remain essentially unaffected by baryon annihilation, and (2) the associated spectral distortion signatures lie within the sensitivity reach of proposed CMB spectral distortion missions. Finally, we discuss the similarities and differences between the AQN scenario and annihilating or decaying dark matter models.</description>

      <title>Machine and Deep Learning Regression for Compact Object Equations of State</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central open problem in nuclear physics is the determination of a physically robust equation of state (EoS) for dense nuclear matter, which directly informs our understanding of the internal composition and macroscopic properties of compact objects such as neutron stars and quark stars. Traditional efforts have relied primarily on theoretical modeling grounded in nuclear and particle physics, with subsequent validation against empirical constraints from heavy ion collisions and, increasingly, multimessenger astrophysical observations. Recent developments, however, have introduced complementary analytical strategies that merge theoretical modeling with advanced data driven methodologies. In particular, Bayesian inference, machine learning, and deep learning have emerged as powerful tools for constraining the EoS and extracting physical insight from complex observational datasets. In this work, we employ state of the art machine learning and deep learning techniques to analyze mass radius relations of compact objects with the aim of reconstructing or inferring their underlying equations of state. The analysis is based on an extensive library of physically consistent, multimodal EoSs for neutron stars and a corresponding set for quark stars, each constructed to satisfy established theoretical and observational constraints. By leveraging the predictive capacity of these computational frameworks, we demonstrate the potential of data-driven approaches to provide refined insights into the behavior of matter at supranuclear densities and to contribute to a more unified understanding of the dense matter EoS.</description>

      <title>Inelastic Majorana Dark Matter and Its Self-Interactions in a Gauged $U(1)_{L_\mu - L_\tau}$ Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an inelastic Majorana dark matter model gauged by $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ symmetry, featuring a complex scalar and fermions with a small Dirac mass. The model exhibits strong interactions between the dark fermion-antifermion pair and the scalar, with a large coupling generating a Majorana mass after symmetry breaking. The dark fermion splits into two nearly degenerate Majorana eigenstates, with the $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ gauge boson $Z^\prime$ interacting via inelastic axial vector currents. The lighter Majorana serves as dark matter (DM), while the heavier may also contribute. The model predicts DM masses ranging from about 10 GeV to hundreds of GeV, with the scalar favored below 100 MeV. Strong coupling causes DM particles to mainly annihilate into two scalars, which determines the relic abundance, while thermal equilibrium with the bath occurs through $Z^\prime$ interactions. Self-interacting DM particles scatter via ladder exchange of strongly coupled light scalars, helping resolve small-scale issues. The $Z^\prime$ interacts with the muon, affecting its magnetic moment and explaining the $(g-2)_\mu$ discrepancy. Effects on experiments, $N_{\text{eff}}$, and the Hubble tension from kinetic mixing between $Z^\prime$ and the photon, originating from high-energy scales, are discussed. The model details and parameter constraints used in experiments are also covered.</description>

Abstract: Fast magnetosonic waves are one of the two low-frequency plasma modes that can exist in a neutron star magnetosphere. It was recently realized that these waves may become nonlinear within the magnetosphere and steepen into some of the strongest shocks in the universe. These shocks, when in the appropriate parameter regime, may emit GHz radiation in the form of precursor waves. We present the first global Particle-in-Cell simulations of the nonlinear steepening of fast magnetosonic waves in a dipolar magnetosphere, and quantitatively demonstrate the strong plasma acceleration in the upstream of these shocks. In these simulations, we observe the production of precursor waves in a finite angular range. Using analytic scaling relations, we predict the expected frequency, power, and duration of this emission. Within a reasonable range of progenitor wave parameters, these precursor waves can reproduce many aspects of FRB observations.</description>

Abstract: The origin of Galactic cosmic rays (CRs), particularly around the knee region ($\sim$3 PeV), remains a major unsolved question. Recent observations by LHAAASO suggest that the knee is shaped mainly by protons, with a transition to heavier elements at higher energies. Microquasars -- compact jet-emitting sources -- have emerged as possible PeV CR accelerators, especially after detections of ultrahigh-energy gamma rays from these systems. We propose that the observed proton spectrum (hard below a few PeV, steep beyond) arises from the reacceleration of sub-TeV Galactic CRs via shear acceleration in large-scale microquasar jet-cocoon structures. Our model also naturally explains the observed spectrum of energies around a few tens of PeV by summing up heavier nuclei contributions. Additionally, similar reacceleration processes in radio galaxies can contribute to ultrahigh-energy CRs, bridging Galactic and extragalactic origins. Combined with low-energy CRs from supernova remnants and galaxy clusters around the second knee region, this scenario could provide a unified explanation for CRs across the entire energy spectrum.</description>

      <title>From Wide Triples to UCXBs: Multimessenger Signatures of Dynamically-formed Black Hole-White Dwarf Systems in the LISA Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultracompact X-ray binaries (UCXBs) are a subclass of low-mass X-ray binaries characterized by tight orbits and degenerate donors, which pose significant challenges to our understanding of their formation. Recent discoveries of black hole (BH) candidates with main-sequence (MS) or red giant (RG) companions suggest that BH-white dwarf (BH-WD) binaries are common in the Galactic field. Motivated by these observations and the fact that most massive stars are born in triples, we show that wide BH-WD systems can naturally form UCXBs through the eccentric Kozai-Lidov (EKL) mechanism. Notably, EKL-driven eccentricity excitations combined with gravitational wave (GW) emission and WD dynamical tides can effectively shrink and circularize the orbit, leading to mass-transferring BH-WD binaries. These systems represent promising multimessenger sources in both X-ray and GW observations. Specifically, we predict that the wide triple channel can produce $\sim3-27$ ($\sim1-5$) detectable UCXBs in the Milky Way (Andromeda galaxy), including $\sim1$ system observable by the mHz GW detection of LISA. If the final WD mass can reach sufficiently small values, this channel could contribute up to $\sim 10^3$ UCXBs in the Galaxy. Furthermore, the identification of tertiary companions in observed UCXBs would provide direct evidence for this formation pathway and yield unique insights into their dynamical origins.</description>

      <title>Turbulence and Magnetic Reconnection in Relativistic Multispecies Plasmas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulations of relativistic plasmas traditionally focus on the dynamics of two-species mixtures of charged particles under the influence of external magnetic fields and those generated by particle currents. However, the extreme conditions of astrophysical plasmas near compact objects such as black holes and neutron stars are often characterized by mixtures of electrons, protons, and positrons, whose dynamics can differ significantly because of the considerable mass contrast. We present the first two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations of relativistic turbulence and magnetic reconnection in a three-species plasma, varying the relative abundance of electrons, protons, and positrons while employing realistic mass ratios to achieve unprecedented accuracy. We find that turbulence leads to the formation of magnetic islands, current sheets, and plasmoids. Reconnection occurs between these structures, with plasma composition playing a key role in determining the number of reconnection sites and their energy-conversion efficiency. In particular, as the proton fraction increases, very small-scale features of the turbulence are washed out, while global dissipative effects are amplified. Finally, using a novel generalization of Ohm's law for a relativistic multi-species plasma, we find that the reconnection rate is primarily governed by the electric fields associated to the divergence of the positron and electron pressure tensors. These results provide new insights into dissipation and particle acceleration in turbulent relativistic plasmas, such as those near black holes and neutron stars, and can be used to interpret their high-energy emission and phenomenology.</description>

Abstract: The observational properties of core-collapse supernovae (CC-SNe) are shaped by the envelopes of their progenitors. In massive binary systems, mass-transfer alters the pre-SN structures compared to single stars, leading to a diversity in SN explosions. Aims. We compute the distribution of CC-SN properties based on comprehensive detailed grids of single and binary stellar evolution models. We conduct a grid-based population synthesis to produce a synthetic population of CC-SNe, and compare it to observed SN samples. We also apply various explodability and merger criteria to our models. In line with earlier results, we identify interacting SN progenitors as those stars that undergo CC during or shortly after a Roche-lobe overflow phase. With an interacting binary fraction of 68%, our models predict two-thirds of all CC-SNe to be of Type IIP/L, and one third of Type Ibc, in agreement with recent volume-limited SN surveys. We find that 76% of the Type Ibc SN progenitors took part in a previous binary mass transfer (mostly as mass donor), but also 63% of the Type IIP/L SN progenitors (mostly as mass gainers), yielding a much broader envelope mass distribution than expected from single stars. We find that mass-transfer induced interacting SNe make up ~5% of all CC-SNe, which is close to the observed fractions of Type IIn and Type Ibn SNe. When assuming a disk or toroidal CSM geometry for Type IIn SNe, our models predict a bimodal distribution of the radiated energies, similar to that deduced from observations. While we find the effect of binary evolution on the relative number of Type Ibc and Type IIP/L SNe to be moderate, it leads to lower average ejecta masses in Type Ibc and Type IIb SNe, and can lead to higher pre-SN masses in Type IIP/L SNe than single stars. Binary models are also able to reproduce the number and properties of interacting SNe.</description>

Abstract: Radio-loud high-redshift quasars (RHRQs) provide crucial insights into the evolution of relativistic jets and their connection to the growth of supermassive black holes. Beyond the extensively studied population at $z \ge 5$, the cosmic morning epoch ($3 \lesssim z \lesssim 5$) marks the peak of active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity and black hole accretion, yet remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we compiled the radio high-redshift quasar catalog (RHzQCat) by cross-matching the SDSS DR16Q catalog with four major radio surveys -- FIRST,NVSS, RACS, and GLEAM. Our tier-based cross-matching framework and visual validation ensured reliable source identification across surveys with diverse beam sizes. The catalog included 1629 reliable and 315 candidate RHRQs, with radio luminosities uniformly spanning $10^{25.5}$ -- $10^{29.3}$ W Hz$^{-1}$. About 95\% of the confirmed sources exhibited compact morphologies, consistent with Doppler-boosted or young AGN populations at high redshifts. Our catalog increases the number of known RHRQs at $z\ge3$ by an order of magnitude, representing the largest and most homogeneous catalog of radio quasars at cosmic morning, filling the observational gap between the early ($z&gt;6$) and local Universe. It provides a robust reference for future statistical studies of jet evolution, AGN feedback, and cosmic magnetism with next-generation facilities such as the Square Kilometer Array (SKA).</description>
