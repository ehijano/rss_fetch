      <title>The Fault in Our Recommendations: On the Perils of Optimizing the Measurable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommendation systems are widespread, and through customized recommendations, promise to match users with options they will like. To that end, data on engagement is collected and used. Most recommendation systems are ranking-based, where they rank and recommend items based on their predicted engagement. However, the engagement signals are often only a crude proxy for utility, as data on the latter is rarely collected or available. This paper explores the following question: By optimizing for measurable proxies, are recommendation systems at risk of significantly under-delivering on utility? If so, how can one improve utility which is seldom measured? To study these questions, we introduce a model of repeated user consumption in which, at each interaction, users select between an outside option and the best option from a recommendation set. Our model accounts for user heterogeneity, with the majority preferring ``popular'' content, and a minority favoring ``niche'' content. The system initially lacks knowledge of individual user preferences but can learn them through observations of users' choices over time. Our theoretical and numerical analysis demonstrate that optimizing for engagement can lead to significant utility losses. Instead, we propose a utility-aware policy that initially recommends a mix of popular and niche content. As the platform becomes more forward-looking, our utility-aware policy achieves the best of both worlds: near-optimal utility and near-optimal engagement simultaneously. Our study elucidates an important feature of recommendation systems; given the ability to suggest multiple items, one can perform significant exploration without incurring significant reductions in engagement. By recommending high-risk, high-reward items alongside popular items, systems can enhance discovery of high utility items without significantly affecting engagement.</description>

      <title>Contextualization with SPLADE for High Recall Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High Recall Retrieval (HRR), such as eDiscovery and medical systematic review, is a search problem that optimizes the cost of retrieving most relevant documents in a given collection. Iterative approaches, such as iterative relevance feedback and uncertainty sampling, are shown to be effective under various operational scenarios. Despite neural models demonstrating success in other text-related tasks, linear models such as logistic regression, in general, are still more effective and efficient in HRR since the model is trained and retrieves documents from the same fixed collection. In this work, we leverage SPLADE, an efficient retrieval model that transforms documents into contextualized sparse vectors, for HRR. Our approach combines the best of both worlds, leveraging both the contextualization from pretrained language models and the efficiency of linear models. It reduces 10% and 18% of the review cost in two HRR evaluation collections under a one-phase review workflow with a target recall of 80%. The experiment is implemented with TARexp and is available at https://github.com/eugene-yang/LSR-for-TAR.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Adaptation from Large Language Model to Recommendation for Practical Industrial Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contemporary recommender systems predominantly rely on collaborative filtering techniques, employing ID-embedding to capture latent associations among users and items. However, this approach overlooks the wealth of semantic information embedded within textual descriptions of items, leading to suboptimal performance in cold-start scenarios and long-tail user recommendations. Leveraging the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) pretrained on massive text corpus presents a promising avenue for enhancing recommender systems by integrating open-world domain knowledge. In this paper, we propose an Llm-driven knowlEdge Adaptive RecommeNdation (LEARN) framework that synergizes open-world knowledge with collaborative knowledge. We address computational complexity concerns by utilizing pretrained LLMs as item encoders and freezing LLM parameters to avoid catastrophic forgetting and preserve open-world knowledge. To bridge the gap between the open-world and collaborative domains, we design a twin-tower structure supervised by the recommendation task and tailored for practical industrial application. Through offline experiments on the large-scale industrial dataset and online experiments on A/B tests, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.</description>

      <title>Masked Graph Transformer for Large-Scale Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Transformers have garnered significant attention for learning graph-structured data, thanks to their superb ability to capture long-range dependencies among nodes. However, the quadratic space and time complexity hinders the scalability of Graph Transformers, particularly for large-scale recommendation. Here we propose an efficient Masked Graph Transformer, named MGFormer, capable of capturing all-pair interactions among nodes with a linear complexity. To achieve this, we treat all user/item nodes as independent tokens, enhance them with positional embeddings, and feed them into a kernelized attention module. Additionally, we incorporate learnable relative degree information to appropriately reweigh the attentions. Experimental results show the superior performance of our MGFormer, even with a single attention layer.</description>

      <title>Dataset and Models for Item Recommendation Using Multi-Modal User Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While recommender systems with multi-modal item representations (image, audio, and text), have been widely explored, learning recommendations from multi-modal user interactions (e.g., clicks and speech) remains an open problem. We study the case of multi-modal user interactions in a setting where users engage with a service provider through multiple channels (website and call center). In such cases, incomplete modalities naturally occur, since not all users interact through all the available channels. To address these challenges, we publish a real-world dataset that allows progress in this under-researched area. We further present and benchmark various methods for leveraging multi-modal user interactions for item recommendations, and propose a novel approach that specifically deals with missing modalities by mapping user interactions to a common feature space. Our analysis reveals important interactions between the different modalities and that a frequently occurring modality can enhance learning from a less frequent one.</description>

      <title>GOVERN: Gradient Orientation Vote Ensemble for Multi-Teacher Reinforced Distillation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pre-trained language models have become an integral component of question-answering systems, achieving remarkable performance. For practical deployment, it is critical to carry out knowledge distillation to preserve high performance under computational constraints. In this paper, we address a key question: given the importance of unsupervised distillation for student performance, how does one effectively ensemble knowledge from multiple teachers at this stage without the guidance of ground-truth labels? We propose a novel algorithm, GOVERN, to tackle this issue. GOVERN has demonstrated significant improvements in both offline and online experiments. The proposed algorithm has been successfully deployed in a real-world commercial question-answering system.</description>

      <title>BBK: a simpler, faster algorithm for enumerating maximal bicliques in large sparse bipartite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bipartite graphs are a prevalent modeling tool for real-world networks, capturing interactions between vertices of two different types. Within this framework, bicliques emerge as crucial structures when studying dense subgraphs: they are sets of vertices such that all vertices of the first type interact with all vertices of the second type. Therefore, they allow identifying groups of closely related vertices of the network, such as individuals with similar interests or webpages with similar contents. This article introduces a new algorithm designed for the exhaustive enumeration of maximal bicliques within a bipartite graph. This algorithm, called BBK for Bipartite Bron-Kerbosch, is a new extension to the bipartite case of the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm, which enumerates the maximal cliques in standard (non-bipartite) graphs. It is faster than the state-of-the-art algorithms and allows the enumeration on massive bipartite graphs that are not manageable with existing implementations. We analyze it theoretically to establish two complexity formulas: one as a function of the input and one as a function of the output characteristics of the algorithm. We also provide an open-access implementation of BBK in C++, which we use to experiment and validate its efficiency on massive real-world datasets and show that its execution time is shorter in practice than state-of-the art algorithms. These experiments also show that the order in which the vertices are processed, as well as the choice of one of the two types of vertices on which to initiate the enumeration have an impact on the computation time.</description>

      <title>IA-GCN: Interactive Graph Convolutional Network for Recommendation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.03827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) has become a novel state-of-art for Collaborative Filtering (CF) based Recommender Systems (RS). It is a common practice to learn informative user and item representations by performing embedding propagation on a user-item bipartite graph, and then provide the users with personalized item suggestions based on the representations. Despite effectiveness, existing algorithms neglect precious interactive features between user-item pairs in the embedding process. When predicting a user's preference for different items, they still aggregate the user tree in the same way, without emphasizing target-related information in the user neighborhood. Such a uniform aggregation scheme easily leads to suboptimal user and item representations, limiting the model expressiveness to some extent.
  In this work, we address this problem by building bilateral interactive guidance between each user-item pair and proposing a new model named IA-GCN (short for InterActive GCN). Specifically, when learning the user representation from its neighborhood, we assign higher attention weights to those neighbors similar to the target item. Correspondingly, when learning the item representation, we pay more attention to those neighbors resembling the target user. This leads to interactive and interpretable features, effectively distilling target-specific information through each graph convolutional operation. Our model is built on top of LightGCN, a state-of-the-art GCN model for CF, and can be combined with various GCN-based CF architectures in an end-to-end fashion. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of IA-GCN.</description>

      <title>FLIP: Towards Fine-grained Alignment between ID-based Models and Pretrained Language Models for CTR Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19453v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Click-through rate (CTR) prediction plays as a core function module in various personalized online services. The traditional ID-based models for CTR prediction take as inputs the one-hot encoded ID features of tabular modality, which capture the collaborative signals via feature interaction modeling. But the one-hot encoding discards the semantic information conceived in the original feature texts. Recently, the emergence of Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) has given rise to another paradigm, which takes as inputs the sentences of textual modality obtained by hard prompt templates and adopts PLMs to extract the semantic knowledge. However, PLMs generally tokenize the input text data into subword tokens and ignore field-wise collaborative signals. Therefore, these two lines of research focus on different characteristics of the same input data (i.e., textual and tabular modalities), forming a distinct complementary relationship with each other. In this paper, we propose to conduct Fine-grained feature-level ALignment between ID-based Models and Pretrained Language Models (FLIP) for CTR prediction. We design a novel joint reconstruction pretraining task for both masked language and tabular modeling. Specifically, the masked data of one modality (i.e., tokens or features) has to be recovered with the help of the other modality, which establishes the feature-level interaction and alignment via sufficient mutual information extraction between dual modalities. Moreover, we propose to jointly finetune the ID-based model and PLM for downstream CTR prediction tasks, thus achieving superior performance by combining the advantages of both models. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that FLIP outperforms SOTA baselines, and is highly compatible for various ID-based models and PLMs. The code is at \url{https://github.com/justarter/FLIP}.</description>

      <title>FollowIR: Evaluating and Teaching Information Retrieval Models to Follow Instructions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15246v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern Language Models (LMs) are capable of following long and complex instructions that enable a large and diverse set of user requests. While Information Retrieval (IR) models use these LMs as the backbone of their architectures, virtually none of them allow users to provide detailed instructions alongside queries, thus limiting their ability to satisfy complex information needs. In this work, we study the use of instructions in IR systems. First, we introduce our dataset FollowIR, which contains a rigorous instruction evaluation benchmark as well as a training set for helping IR models learn to better follow real-world instructions. FollowIR repurposes detailed instructions -- also known as narratives -- developed for professional assessors to evaluate retrieval systems. In particular, we build our benchmark from three collections curated for shared tasks at the Text REtrieval Conference (TREC). These collections contains hundreds to thousands of labeled documents per query, making them suitable for our exploration. Through this process, we can measure how well IR models follow instructions, through a new pairwise evaluation framework. Our results indicate that existing retrieval models fail to correctly use instructions, using them for basic keywords and struggling to understand long-form information. However, we show that it is possible for IR models to learn to follow complex instructions: our new FollowIR-7B model has significant improvements after fine-tuning on our training set.</description>

      <title>An Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning Algorithm Customized for Multi-Task Fusion in Large-Scale Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the last critical stage of RSs, Multi-Task Fusion (MTF) is responsible for combining multiple scores outputted by Multi-Task Learning (MTL) into a final score to maximize user satisfaction, which determines the ultimate recommendation results. Recently, to optimize long-term user satisfaction within a recommendation session, Reinforcement Learning (RL) is used for MTF in the industry. However, the off-policy RL algorithms used for MTF so far have the following severe problems: 1) to avoid out-of-distribution (OOD) problem, their constraints are overly strict, which seriously damage their performance; 2) they are unaware of the exploration policy used for producing training data and never interact with real environment, so only suboptimal policy can be learned; 3) the traditional exploration policies are inefficient and hurt user experience. To solve the above problems, we propose a novel method named IntegratedRL-MTF customized for MTF in large-scale RSs. IntegratedRL-MTF integrates off-policy RL model with our online exploration policy to relax overstrict and complicated constraints, which significantly improves its performance. We also design an extremely efficient exploration policy, which eliminates low-value exploration space and focuses on exploring potential high-value state-action pairs. Moreover, we adopt progressive training mode to further enhance our model's performance with the help of our exploration policy. We conduct extensive offline and online experiments in the short video channel of Tencent News. The results demonstrate that our model outperforms other models remarkably. IntegratedRL-MTF has been fully deployed in our RS and other large-scale RSs in Tencent, which have achieved significant improvements.</description>

      <title>M3oE: Multi-Domain Multi-Task Mixture-of Experts Recommendation Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-domain recommendation and multi-task recommendation have demonstrated their effectiveness in leveraging common information from different domains and objectives for comprehensive user modeling. Nonetheless, the practical recommendation usually faces multiple domains and tasks simultaneously, which cannot be well-addressed by current methods. To this end, we introduce M3oE, an adaptive multi-domain multi-task mixture-of-experts recommendation framework. M3oE integrates multi-domain information, maps knowledge across domains and tasks, and optimizes multiple objectives. We leverage three mixture-of-experts modules to learn common, domain-aspect, and task-aspect user preferences respectively to address the complex dependencies among multiple domains and tasks in a disentangled manner. Additionally, we design a two-level fusion mechanism for precise control over feature extraction and fusion across diverse domains and tasks. The framework's adaptability is further enhanced by applying AutoML technique, which allows dynamic structure optimization. To the best of the authors' knowledge, our M3oE is the first effort to solve multi-domain multi-task recommendation self-adaptively. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets against diverse baselines demonstrate M3oE's superior performance. The implementation code is available to ensure reproducibility.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Information Seeking Processes with Multiple Physiological Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Information access systems are getting complex, and our understanding of user behavior during information seeking processes is mainly drawn from qualitative methods, such as observational studies or surveys. Leveraging the advances in sensing technologies, our study aims to characterize user behaviors with physiological signals, particularly in relation to cognitive load, affective arousal, and valence. We conduct a controlled lab study with 26 participants, and collect data including Electrodermal Activities, Photoplethysmogram, Electroencephalogram, and Pupillary Responses. This study examines informational search with four stages: the realization of Information Need (IN), Query Formulation (QF), Query Submission (QS), and Relevance Judgment (RJ). We also include different interaction modalities to represent modern systems, e.g., QS by text-typing or verbalizing, and RJ with text or audio information. We analyze the physiological signals across these stages and report outcomes of pairwise non-parametric repeated-measure statistical tests. The results show that participants experience significantly higher cognitive loads at IN with a subtle increase in alertness, while QF requires higher attention. QS involves demanding cognitive loads than QF. Affective responses are more pronounced at RJ than QS or IN, suggesting greater interest and engagement as knowledge gaps are resolved. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that explores user behaviors in a search process employing a more nuanced quantitative analysis of physiological signals. Our findings offer valuable insights into user behavior and emotional responses in information seeking processes. We believe our proposed methodology can inform the characterization of more complex processes, such as conversational information seeking.</description>

      <title>ID-centric Pre-training for Recommendation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical sequential recommendation models generally adopt ID embeddings to store knowledge learned from user historical behaviors and represent items. However, these unique IDs are challenging to be transferred to new domains. With the thriving of pre-trained language model (PLM), some pioneer works adopt PLM for pre-trained recommendation, where modality information (e.g., text) is considered universal across domains via PLM. Unfortunately, the behavioral information in ID embeddings is still verified to be dominating in PLM-based recommendation models compared to modality information and thus limits these models' performance. In this work, we propose a novel ID-centric recommendation pre-training paradigm (IDP), which directly transfers informative ID embeddings learned in pre-training domains to item representations in new domains. Specifically, in pre-training stage, besides the ID-based sequential model for recommendation, we also build a Cross-domain ID-matcher (CDIM) learned by both behavioral and modality information. In the tuning stage, modality information of new domain items is regarded as a cross-domain bridge built by CDIM. We first leverage the textual information of downstream domain items to retrieve behaviorally and semantically similar items from pre-training domains using CDIM. Next, these retrieved pre-trained ID embeddings, rather than certain textual embeddings, are directly adopted to generate downstream new items' embeddings. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, both in cold and warm settings, we demonstrate that our proposed model significantly outperforms all baselines. Codes will be released upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Link Me Baby One More Time: Social Music Discovery on Spotify</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the social and contextual factors that influence the outcome of person-to-person music recommendations and discovery. Specifically, we use data from Spotify to investigate how a link sent from one user to another results in the receiver engaging with the music of the shared artist. We consider several factors that may influence this process, such as the strength of the sender-receiver relationship, the user's role in the Spotify social network, their music social cohesion, and how similar the new artist is to the receiver's taste. We find that the receiver of a link is more likely to engage with a new artist when (1) they have similar music taste to the sender and the shared track is a good fit for their taste, (2) they have a stronger and more intimate tie with the sender, and (3) the shared artist is popular amongst the receiver's connections. Finally, we use these findings to build a Random Forest classifier to predict whether a shared music track will result in the receiver's engagement with the shared artist. This model elucidates which type of social and contextual features are most predictive, although peak performance is achieved when a diverse set of features are included. These findings provide new insights into the multifaceted mechanisms underpinning the interplay between music discovery and social processes.</description>

      <title>Recommendation Fairness in Social Networks Over Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In social recommender systems, it is crucial that the recommendation models provide equitable visibility for different demographic groups, such as gender or race. Most existing research has addressed this problem by only studying individual static snapshots of networks that typically change over time. To address this gap, we study the evolution of recommendation fairness over time and its relation to dynamic network properties. We examine three real-world dynamic networks by evaluating the fairness of six recommendation algorithms and analyzing the association between fairness and network properties over time. We further study how interventions on network properties influence fairness by examining counterfactual scenarios with alternative evolution outcomes and differing network properties. Our results on empirical datasets suggest that recommendation fairness improves over time, regardless of the recommendation method. We also find that two network properties, minority ratio, and homophily ratio, exhibit stable correlations with fairness over time. Our counterfactual study further suggests that an extreme homophily ratio potentially contributes to unfair recommendations even with a balanced minority ratio. Our work provides insights into the evolution of fairness within dynamic networks in social science. We believe that our findings will help system operators and policymakers to better comprehend the implications of temporal changes and interventions targeting fairness in social networks.</description>

      <title>When to Retrieve: Teaching LLMs to Utilize Information Retrieval Effectively</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate how Large Language Models (LLMs) can effectively learn to use an off-the-shelf information retrieval (IR) system specifically when additional context is required to answer a given question. Given the performance of IR systems, the optimal strategy for question answering does not always entail external information retrieval; rather, it often involves leveraging the parametric memory of the LLM itself. Prior research has identified this phenomenon in the PopQA dataset, wherein the most popular questions are effectively addressed using the LLM's parametric memory, while less popular ones require IR system usage. Following this, we propose a tailored training approach for LLMs, leveraging existing open-domain question answering datasets. Here, LLMs are trained to generate a special token, &lt;RET&gt;, when they do not know the answer to a question. Our evaluation of the Adaptive Retrieval LLM (Adapt-LLM) on the PopQA dataset showcases improvements over the same LLM under three configurations: (i) retrieving information for all the questions, (ii) using always the parametric memory of the LLM, and (iii) using a popularity threshold to decide when to use a retriever. Through our analysis, we demonstrate that Adapt-LLM is able to generate the &lt;RET&gt; token when it determines that it does not know how to answer a question, indicating the need for IR, while it achieves notably high accuracy levels when it chooses to rely only on its parametric memory.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Dilemma of Performance and Index Size in Billion-Scale Vector Search and Breaking It with Second-Tier Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03267v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vector searches on large-scale datasets are critical to modern online services like web search and RAG, which necessity storing the datasets and their index on the secondary storage like SSD. In this paper, we are the first to characterize the trade-off of performance and index size in existing SSD-based graph and cluster indexes: to improve throughput by 5.7$\times$ and 1.7$\times$, these indexes have to pay a 5.8$\times$ storage amplification and 7.7$\times$ with respect to the dataset size, respectively. The root cause is that the coarse-grained access of SSD mismatches the fine-grained random read required by vector indexes with small amplification.
  This paper argues that second-tier memory, such as remote DRAM/NVM connected via RDMA or CXL, is a powerful storage for addressing the problem from a system's perspective, thanks to its fine-grained access granularity. However, putting existing indexes -- primarily designed for SSD -- directly on second-tier memory cannot fully utilize its power. Meanwhile, second-tier memory still behaves more like storage, so using it as DRAM is also inefficient. To this end, we build a graph and cluster index that centers around the performance features of second-tier memory. With careful execution engine and index layout designs, we show that vector indexes can achieve optimal performance with orders of magnitude smaller index amplification, on a variety of second-tier memory devices.
  Based on our improved graph and vector indexes on second-tier memory, we further conduct a systematic study between them to facilitate developers choosing the right index for their workloads. Interestingly, the findings on the second-tier memory contradict the ones on SSDs.</description>
