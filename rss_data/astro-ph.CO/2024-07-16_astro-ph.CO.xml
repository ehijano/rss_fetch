      <title>Corrections to Hawking radiation from asteroid-mass primordial black holes: description of the stochastic charge effect in quantum electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hawking radiation sets stringent constraints on Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) as a dark matter candidate in the $M \sim 10^{16} \ \mathrm{g}$ regime based on the evaporation products such as photons, electrons, and positrons. This motivates the need for rigorous modeling of the Hawking emission spectrum. Using semi-classical arguments, Page [Phys. Rev. D 16, 2402 (1977)] showed that the emission of electrons and positrons is altered due to the black hole acquiring an equal and opposite charge to the emitted particle. The Poisson fluctuations of emitted particles cause the charge $Z|e|$ to random walk, but since acquisition of charge increases the probability of the black hole emitting another charged particle of the same sign, the walk is biased toward $Z=0$, and $P(Z)$ approaches an equilibrium probability distribution with finite variance $\langle Z^2\rangle$. This paper explores how this ``stochastic charge'' phenomenon arises from quantum electrodynamics (QED) on a Schwarzschild spacetime. We prove that (except for a small Fermi blocking term) the semi-classical variance $\langle Z^2 \rangle$ agrees with the variance of a quantum operator $\langle \hat{\cal Z}^2 \rangle$, where $\hat{\cal Z}$ may be thought of as an ``atomic number'' that includes the black hole as well as charge near it (weighted by a factor of $2M/r$). In QED, the fluctuations in $\hat{\cal Z}$ do not arise from the black hole itself (whose charge remains fixed), but rather as a collective effect in the Hawking-emitted particles mediated by the long-range electromagnetic interaction. We find the rms charge $\langle Z^2\rangle^{1/2}$ asymptotes to 3.44 at small PBH masses $M \lesssim 2\times 10^{16}\,$g, declining to 2.42 at $M=5.2\times 10^{17}\,$g.</description>

      <title>Cosmological constraints on dark energy parametrizations after DESI 2024: Persistent deviation from standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a study on cosmological constraints of dark energy parametrizations post-DESI 2024, suggesting potential deviations from the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. This study aims to put observational constraints on EoS parametrizations beyond the standard $\Lambda$CDM model using DESI BAO 2024 data, CMB anisotropy observations 2018, and various Pantheon+, Union 3, and DES 5YR SNIa compilations. Our main goal is to check the result of DESI collaborations \cite{DESI:2024mwx} in the context of some generalizations of CPL approximation known as BA and Pade parametrizations. In general, our research can reveal any potential biases in the CPL parametrization and determine the consistency of observational data with the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology or alternative dark energy models. We find that in the generalizations of CPL parametrization, the deviation from $w_{\Lambda}=-1$ is more pronounced when we utilize the combinations of DESI BAO, CMB and various Pantheon+, Union 3, and DES 5YR SNIa compilations.</description>

      <title>Euclid and KiDS-1000: Quantifying the impact of source-lens clustering on cosmic shear analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic shear is a powerful probe of cosmological models and the transition from current Stage-III surveys like the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS) to the increased area and redshift range of Stage IV-surveys such as \Euclid will significantly increase the precision of weak lensing analyses. However, with increasing precision, the accuracy of model assumptions needs to be evaluated. In this study, we quantify the impact of the correlated clustering of weak lensing source galaxies with the surrounding large-scale structure, the so-called source-lens clustering (SLC), which is commonly neglected. We include the impact of realistic scatter in photometric redshift estimates, which impacts the assignment of galaxies to tomographic bins and increases the SLC. For this, we use simulated cosmological datasets with realistically distributed galaxies and measure shear correlation functions for both clustered and uniformly distributed source galaxies. Cosmological analyses are performed for both scenarios to quantify the impact of SLC on parameter inference for a KiDS-like and a \Euclid-like setting. We find for Stage III surveys like KiDS, SLC has a minor impact when accounting for nuisance parameters for intrinsic alignments and shifts of tomographic bins, as these nuisance parameters absorb the effect of SLC, thus changing their original meaning. For KiDS (\Euclid), the inferred intrinsic alignment amplitude $A_\mathrm{IA}$ changes from $0.11_{-0.46}^{+0.44}$ ($-0.009_{-0.080}^{+0.079}$) for data without SLC to $0.28_{-0.44}^{+0.42}$ ($0.022_{-0.082}^{+0.081}$) with SLC. However, fixed nuisance parameters lead to shifts in $S_8$ and $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$. For \Euclid we find that $S_8$ and $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ are shifted by 0.14 and 0.12 $\sigma$, respectively, when including free nuisance parameters. Consequently, SLC on its own has only a small impact on the inferred parameters.</description>

      <title>AB$\mathbb{C}$MB: Deep Delensing Assisted Likelihood-Free Inference from CMB Polarization Maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of a cosmic background of primordial gravitational waves (PGWB) is a robust prediction of inflationary cosmology, but it has so far evaded discovery. The most promising avenue of its detection is via measurements of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) $B$-polarization. However, this is not straightforward due to (a) the fact that CMB maps are distorted by gravitational lensing and (b) the high-dimensional nature of CMB data, which renders likelihood-based analysis methods computationally extremely expensive. In this paper, we introduce an efficient likelihood-free, end-to-end inference method to directly infer the posterior distribution of the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ from lensed maps of the Stokes $Q$ and $U$ polarization parameters. Our method employs a generative model to delense the maps and utilizes the Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) algorithm to sample $r$. We demonstrate that our method yields unbiased estimates of $r$ with well-calibrated uncertainty quantification.</description>

      <title>Primordial Gravitational Waves of Big Bounce Cosmology in Light of Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial gravitational waves from the very early stages of the universe, such as inflation or bounce processes, are an irreducible cosmological source of the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). The recent detection of SGWB signals around the nano-Hertz frequency by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs), including NANOGrav, EPTA, PPTA, IPTA, and CPTA, opens a new window to explore these very early stages of the universe through these primordial gravitational waves. In this work, we investigate the generation and evolution of primordial gravitational waves in a generic big bounce cosmology by parameterizing its background evolution into four phases, where perturbation modes exit and re-enter the horizon twice. By analytically solving the equation of motion for primordial gravitational waves and matching solutions at the boundaries, we obtain the explicit form of the primordial gravitational wave spectrum in a generic big bounce cosmology. We find that, according to the evolution of primordial gravitational waves, a generic scenario of big bounce cosmology can be categorized into four distinct types. We introduce four toy models for these categories, demonstrating that our analytical results can be straightforwardly applied to various bouncing universe models in which the equation of state of the background is constant in each phase. We also prospect future applications of our results in interpreting SGWB signals searched by PTAs and upcoming advanced gravitational wave detectors such as SKA, Taiji, Tianqin, LISA, DECIGO, and aLIGO/Virgo/KAGRA using Bayesian analysis.</description>

      <title>Dispersion in the Hubble-Lema\^{i}tre constant measurements from gravitational clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurements of the Hubble-Lema\^{i}tre constant ($H_0$) require us to estimate the distance and recession velocity of galaxies independently. Gravitational clustering that leads to the formation of galaxies and the large scale structure leaves its imprints in the form of peculiar velocities of galaxies. In general, it is not possible to disentangle the peculiar velocity component from the recession velocities of galaxies, and this introduces an uncertainty in the determination of $H_0$. Using N-body simulations, we quantify the impact of peculiar velocities on the $H_0$ estimation. We consider observers to be located in dark matter halos and compute the distribution of the estimated value of $H_0$ across all such observers. We find that the dispersion of this distribution is large at small scales, and it diminishes as we go to large separations, reaching the level of the quoted statistical error in Planck and SH0ES measurements well beyond $\sim$135 Mpc/h and $\sim$220 Mpc/h, respectively. Measurements at smaller scales are susceptible to errors arising from peculiar motions, and this error can propagate to measurements at larger scales in the distance ladder. Notably, we observe a negative correlation between the local over-density around an observer and the deviation of the local and the global value of $H_0$. We show that deviations more significant than 5% of the global values can be encountered frequently at scales of up to 40 Mpc/h, and this is considerably larger than the statistical errors on local estimates. We also analyse the cumulative effect of such errors on mock measurements of $H_0$ as measured from Milky Way-sized halos. We find that this error is sensitive to the lowest distance at which we use measurements. The distribution of $H_0$ in mock measurements has a large tail, and deviations of a few percent from the global value cannot be ruled out.</description>

      <title>Search for Dark Matter Annihilation to gamma-rays from SPT-SZ selected Galaxy Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We search for dark matter annihilation from galaxy clusters in the energy range from 1-300 GeV using nearly 16 years of Fermi-LAT data. For this purpose, we use 350 galaxy clusters selected from the 2500 $\rm{deg^2}$ SPT-SZ survey. We model the dark matter distribution using the NFW profile for the main halo along with the Einasto profile for the substructure. The largest signal is seen for the cluster SPT-CL J2021-5257 with a significance of around $3\sigma$. The best-fit dark matter mass and annihilation cross-section for this cluster are equal to $(64.0 \pm 11.8)$ GeV and $\langle \sigma v \rangle= (6.0 \pm 0.6) \times 10^{-25} \rm{cm^3 s^{-1}}$ for the $\bar{b} b$ annihilation channel. However, this central estimate is in conflict with the limits on annihilation cross-section from dwarf spheroidal galaxies and hence cannot be attributed to dark matter annihilation. Three other clusters show significance between $2-2.5\sigma$, whereas all the remaining clusters show null results. The most stringent 95\% c.l. upper limit, which we obtain among the clusters with significance $&gt;2\sigma$ is from SPT-CL J2300-5331, given by $\langle \sigma v \rangle = 9 \times 10^{-26} \text{cm}^3 \text{s}^{-1}$ for a dark matter mass of 10 GeV corresponding to the $b\bar{b}$ annihilation channel.</description>

      <title>Evolution of the DM distribution function in the density spikes around PBHs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At the cosmological stage of radiation dominance, dark matter density spikes should form around primordial black holes. In the case when dark matter particles are able to annihilate, the density in the central regions of the spikes decreases due to the elimination of particles, which gives an upper bound on the central density. In this paper, the modification of the central density profile is investigated, taking into account the distribution of the particle orbits. The orbits in spike around a primordial black hole are very elongated, almost radial, and the angular momentum distribution has an exponential form. For such an initial distribution function, it is obtained that a cusp with the exponent $\approx-0.7$ is formed in the central region, instead of an annihilation plateau. The presence of the cusp provides some correction to the rate of dark matter annihilation around primordial black holes.</description>

      <title>Implications of scattering for CMB foreground emission modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The extreme precision and accuracy of forthcoming observations of CMB temperature and polarization anisotropies, aiming to detect the tiny signatures of primordial gravitational waves or of light relic particles beyond the standard three light neutrinos, requires commensurate precision in the modelling of foreground Galactic emission that contaminates CMB observations.
  Aims. We evaluate the impact of second-order effects in Galactic foreground emission due to Thomson scattering off interstellar free electrons and to Rayleigh scattering off interstellar dust particles.
  Methods. We use existing sky survey data and models of the distribution of free electrons and dust within the Milky Way to estimate the amplitude and power spectra of the emission originating from radiation scattered either by free electrons or by dust grains at CMB frequencies.
  Results. Both processes generate corrections to the total emission that are small compared to direct emission, and are small enough not to pose problems for current-generation observations.
  Conclusions. However, B-modes generated by Thomson scattering of incoming radiation by interstellar free electrons at CMB frequencies are within an order of magnitude of the sensitivity of the most advanced forthcoming CMB telescopes, and might require more precise evaluation in the future.</description>

      <title>Tensor clustering fossils in modified gravity and high-redshift gravitational-wave sound speed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the tensor clustering fossils as a possible probe to constrain the theory of gravity, in particular the deviation of the sound speed of gravitational waves from the speed of light at high redshifts. We develop the formalism of the effective Poisson equation to include the novel phenomenological model of the scalar-tensor tidal interactions that are expected to be induced by the modification of the theory of gravity. We show that the tensor clustering fossils can arise from the propagation of gravitational waves, the growth of the large-scale structures, and the second-order contributions from the effective Poisson equation. We construct the small-scale effective Lagrangian from the Horndeski scalar-tensor theory and derive the formula applicable to the tensor clustering fossils in the language of the effective field theory of dark energy. As a demonstration, we apply the formalism to the constraint on the sound speed of gravitational waves in the futuristic survey.</description>

      <title>Forecast of strongly lensed supernovae rates in the China Space Station Telescope surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong gravitationally lensed supernovae (SNe) are a powerful probe for cosmology and stellar physics. The relative time delays between lensed SN images provide an independent way of measuring a fundamental cosmological parameter -- the Hubble constant -- , the value of which is currently under debate. The time delays also serve as a ``time machine'', offering a unique opportunity to capture the extremely early phase of the SN explosion, which can be used to constrain the SN progenitor and explosion mechanism. Although there are only a handful of strongly lensed SN discoveries so far, which greatly hinders scientific applications, the sample size is expected to grow substantially with next-generation surveys. In this work, we investigate the capability of detecting strongly lensed SNe with the China Space Station Telescope (CSST), a two-meter space telescope to be launched around 2026. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we predict that CSST can detect 1008.53 and 51.78 strongly lensed SNe from its Wide Field Survey (WFS, covering 17,500 deg$^2$) and Deep Field Survey (DFS, covering 400 deg$^2$) over the course of ten years. In both surveys, about 35\% of the events involve Type Ia SNe as the background sources. Our results suggest that the WFS and DFS of CSST, although not designed or optimized for discovering transients, can still make a great contribution to the strongly lensed SNe studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Filaments connected to galaxy clusters are crucial environments to study the building up of cosmic structures as they funnel matter towards the clusters' deep gravitational potentials. Identifying gas in filaments is a challenge, due to their lower density contrast which produces faint signals. The best chance to detect these signals is therefore in the outskirts of galaxy clusters. We revisit the X-ray observation of the cluster Abell 2744 using statistical estimators of anisotropic matter distribution to identify filamentary patterns around it. We report for the first time the blind detection of filaments connected to a galaxy cluster from X-ray emission using a filament-finder technique and a multipole decomposition technique. We compare this result with filaments extracted from the distribution of spectroscopic galaxies, through which we demonstrate the robustness and reliability of our techniques in tracing a filamentary structure of 3 to 5 filaments connected to Abell 2744.</description>

      <title>Efficient hybrid technique for generating sub-grid haloes in reionization simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating the distribution of cosmological neutral hydrogen (HI) during the epoch of reionization requires a high dynamic range and is hence computationally expensive. The size of the simulation is dictated by the largest scales one aims to probe, while the resolution is determined by the smallest dark matter haloes capable of hosting the first stars. We present a hybrid approach where the density and tidal fields of a large-volume, low-resolution simulation are combined with small haloes from a small-volume, high-resolution box. By merging these two boxes of relatively lower dynamic range, we achieve an effective high-dynamic range simulation using only 13% of the computational resources required for a full high-dynamic range simulation. Our method accurately reproduces the one- and two-point statistics of the halo field, its cross-correlation with the dark matter density field, and the two-point statistics of the HI field computed using a semi-numerical code, all within 10% accuracy at large scales and across different redshifts. Our technique, combined with semi-numerical models of reionization, provides a resource-efficient tool for modeling the HI distribution at high redshifts.</description>

      <title>Novel bounds on decaying axion-like-particle dark matter from the cosmic background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cosmic Background (CB) is defined as the isotropic diffuse radiation field with extragalactic origin found across the electromagnetic spectrum. Different astrophysical sources dominate the CB emission at different energies, such as stars in the optical or active galactic nuclei in X-rays. Assuming that dark matter consists of axions or axion-like particles with masses on the order of electron volts or higher, we expect an additional contribution to the CB due to their decay into two photons. Here, we model the CB between the optical and X-ray regimes, and include the contribution of decaying axions. Through a comparison with the most recent direct and indirect CB measurements, we constrain the axion parameter space between masses $0.5\, \mathrm{eV}\, - 10^7\,\mathrm{eV}$ and improve previous limits on axion-photon coupling derived from the CB by roughly an order of magnitude, also reaching the QCD band. We further study the contribution of axions decaying in the Milky Way halo and characterize the axion parameters that would explain the tentative excess CB emission observed with the LORRI instrument on-board the New Horizons probe.</description>

      <title>Reevaluating the cosmological redshift: insights into inhomogeneities and irreversible processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the expansion of the Universe remains a profound challenge in fundamental physics. The complexity of solving General Relativity equations in the presence of intricate, inhomogeneous flows has compelled cosmological models to rely on perturbation theory in a homogeneous FLRW background. This approach accounts for a redshift of light encompassing contributions from both the cosmological background expansion along the photon's trajectory and Doppler effects at emission due to peculiar motions. However, this computation of the redshift is not covariant, as it hinges on specific coordinate choices that may distort physical interpretations of the relativity of motion. In this study, we show that peculiar motions, when tracing the dynamics along time-like geodesics, must contribute to the redshift of light through a local volume expansion factor, in addition to the background expansion. By employing a covariant approach to redshift calculation, we address the central question of whether the cosmological principle alone guarantees that the averaged local volume expansion factor matches the background expansion. We establish that this holds true only in scenarii characterized by a reversible evolution of the Universe, where inhomogeneous expansion and compression modes mutually compensate. In the presence of irreversible processes, such as the dissipation of large-scale compression modes through matter virialization and associated entropy production, the averaged expansion factor becomes dominated by expansion in voids that cannot be compensated anymore by compression in virialized structures. Our approach shows that entropy production due to irreversible processes during the formation of structures plays the same role as an effective, time-dependent cosmological constant, i.e. dynamical dark energy, without the need to invoke new unknown physics.</description>

      <title>Beyond the horizon: Quantifying the full sky foreground wedge in the cylindrical power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the main obstacles preventing the detection of the redshifted 21-cm signal from neutral hydrogen in the early Universe is the astrophysical foreground emission, which is several orders of magnitude brighter than the signal. The foregrounds, due to their smooth spectra, are expected to predominantly occupy a region in the cylindrical power spectrum known as the foreground wedge. However, the conventional equations describing the extent of the foreground wedge are derived under a flat-sky approximation. This assumption breaks down for tracking wide-field instruments, thus rendering these equations inapplicable in these situations. In this paper, we derive equations for the full sky foreground wedge and show that the foregrounds can potentially extend far beyond what the conventional equations suggest. We also derive the equations that describe a specific bright source in the cylindrical power spectrum space. The validity of both sets of equations is tested against numerical simulations. Many current and upcoming interferometers (e.g., LOFAR, NenuFAR, MWA, SKA) are wide-field phase-tracking instruments. These equations give us new insights into the nature of foreground contamination in the cylindrical power spectra estimated using wide-field instruments. Additionally, they allow us to accurately associate features in the power spectrum to foregrounds or instrumental effects. The equations are also important for correctly selecting the "EoR window" for foreground avoidance analyses, and for planning 21-cm observations. In future analyses, it is recommended to use these updated horizon lines to indicate the foreground wedge in the cylindrical power spectrum accurately. The new equations for generating the updated wedge lines are made available in a Python library, pslines.</description>

      <title>Extragalactic 85Rb/87Rb and 6Li/7Li ratios in the Small Magellanic Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The line of sight toward Sk 143 (AzV 456), an O9.5 Ib star in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), shows significant absorption from neutral atoms and molecules. We report a new study of this line of sight by means of high-resolution spectra obtained with the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the VLT of ESO. The absorption from neutral and ionized species is well characterized by a single component at vhel about +132 km/s that was modeled with the ASTROCOOK code. The rubidium Rb I 780.0 nm line is detected for the first time outside the Galaxy, and we derive [Rb/H]= -1.86 +/- 0.09. As a result of the high resolution, the 85Rb and 87Rb isotope lines are also exceptionally well resolved. The 85Rb/87Rb isotope ratio is 0.46, which is opposite of the meteoritic value of 2.43. This implies that Rb is made through a dominant contribution of the r-process, which is dominant for the 87Rb isotope. We also confirm the presence of 7LiI 670.7 nm and set a limit on the isotopic ratio of 6Li/7Li &lt; 0.1.The dominance of the 87Rb isotope implies that Rb is made through a dominant contribution of the r-process. At the low metallicity of the cloud of [Zn/H] = -1.28 +/- 0.09 , neutron rich material may have occurred in rotating metal-poor massive stars. Moreover, the low metallicity of the cloud leads to an absolute Li abundance of A(7Li) about 2.2, which differs from the expectation from big bang nucleosynthesis. Because the gas-phase abundance is not affected by stellar depletion, the burning of Li inside the halo stars is probably not the solution for the cosmological 7Li problem.</description>

      <title>Inferring dark energy properties from the scale factor parametrisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and implement a novel test to assess deviations from well-established concordance $\Lambda$CDM cosmology while inferring dark energy properties. In contrast to the commonly implemented parametric forms of the dark energy equation-of-state (EoS), we test the validity of the cosmological constant on the more fundamental scale factor [$a(t)$] which determines the expansion rate of the Universe. We constrain our extended `general model' for the expansion history using the late-time cosmological observables, namely Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and Supernovae. As a primary inference, we contrast the BAO compilations from the completed SDSS and the more recent DESI. We find that the former deviates from the $\Lambda$CDM scenario at a mild $\sim 2\sigma$ level while the latter is completely consistent with the standard picture when the dark energy properties are inferred. We find that the posterior of the dark energy EoS is mainly constrained to be quintessence-like, however, we demonstrate the rich phenomenology of dark energy behaviour that can be obtained in our general model wrt to the $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>Optimal Neural Summarisation for Full-Field Weak Lensing Cosmological Implicit Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditionally, weak lensing cosmological surveys have been analyzed using summary statistics motivated by their analytically tractable likelihoods, or by their ability to access higher-order information, at the cost of requiring Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) approaches. While informative, these statistics are neither designed nor guaranteed to be statistically sufficient. With the rise of deep learning, it becomes possible to create summary statistics optimized to extract the full data information. We compare different neural summarization strategies proposed in the weak lensing literature, to assess which loss functions lead to theoretically optimal summary statistics to perform full-field inference. In doing so, we aim to provide guidelines and insights to the community to help guide future neural-based inference analyses. We design an experimental setup to isolate the impact of the loss function used to train neural networks. We have developed the sbi_lens JAX package, which implements an automatically differentiable lognormal wCDM LSST-Y10 weak lensing simulator. The explicit full-field posterior obtained using the Hamilotnian-Monte-Carlo sampler gives us a ground truth to which to compare different compression strategies. We provide theoretical insight into the loss functions used in the literature and show that some do not necessarily lead to sufficient statistics (e.g. Mean Square Error (MSE)), while those motivated by information theory (e.g. Variational Mutual Information Maximization (VMIM)) can. Our numerical experiments confirm these insights and show, in our simulated wCDM scenario, that the Figure of Merit (FoM) of an analysis using neural summaries optimized under VMIM achieves 100% of the reference Omega_c - sigma_8 full-field FoM, while an analysis using neural summaries trained under MSE achieves only 81% of the same reference FoM.</description>

      <title>Galaxy cluster matter profiles: I. Self-similarity and mass calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of the weak lensing matter profiles of 698 South Pole Telescope (SPT) thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (tSZE) selected galaxy clusters in the redshift range $0.25 &lt;z&lt; 0.94$ that have associated weak gravitational lensing shear profiles from the Dark Energy Survey (DES). When rescaled to account for the mass dependent size and the redshift dependent density, this SPT cluster sample when averaged within bins of redshift and tSZE detection significance shows a lower dispersion in the matter profiles than the unscaled versions. Galaxy clusters from hydrodynamical simulations also exhibit matter profiles that suggest a high degree of self-similarity, with RMS variation among the rescaled average matter profiles improving by a factor of $\approx$6 with redshift and $\approx$23 with mass in comparison to the unscaled average matter profiles. We employ this regularity in a new Bayesian method for weak lensing mass calibration, simultaneously constraining richness-mass and tSZE detection significance-mass relations using average, rescaled cluster matter profiles. We validate the method using realistic mock datasets and present scaling relation constraints for the SPT$\times$DES sample, where we constrain the amplitude, mass trend, redshift trend, and intrinsic scatter. Our scaling relation results are in agreement with the mass calibration derived from the recent cosmological analysis of the SPT$\times$DES data based on a cluster-by-cluster lensing calibration. Our new mass calibration technique offers higher efficiency when compared to the single cluster calibration technique. In addition, the average rescaled matter profiles offer high signal-to-noise constraints on the shape of real cluster profiles which is in good agreement with the $\Lambda$CDM model.</description>

      <title>Negative neutrino masses as a mirage of dark energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The latest cosmological constraints on the sum of the neutrino masses depend on prior physical assumptions about the mass spectrum. To test the accordance of cosmological and laboratory constraints in the absence of such priors, we introduce an effective neutrino mass parameter that extends consistently to negative values. For the $\Lambda$CDM model, we analyze data from Planck, ACT, and DESI and find a $2.8-3.3\sigma$ tension with the constraints from oscillation experiments. Motivated by recent hints of evolving dark energy, we analyze the $w_0w_a$ and mirage dark energy models, showing that they favour larger masses consistent with laboratory data, respectively $\sum m_{\nu,\mathrm{eff}} = 0.06_{-0.10}^{+0.15}\,\mathrm{eV}$ and $\sum m_{\nu,\mathrm{eff}} = 0.04_{-0.11}^{+0.15}\,\mathrm{eV}$ (both at 68\%).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Teleparallel gravity theories were proposed as alternatives to the dark energy and modified theories of gravity. However, both the metric and symmetric teleparallel gravity theories have been found to have serious pathologies, such as coupling issues and Ostrogradski's instability leading to ghost degrees of freedom. In this article we explore the fact that the theories are at-least free from the issue of `Branched Hamiltonian' though, nonetheless, early inflation as well as a viable radiation era may only be driven by a scalar field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves are oscillations of space-time that are created, for example, in black hole mergers. If these waves travel through another massive astrophysical object, they will undergo an effect called gravitational lensing, that will distort and deflect them. This effect can create multiple images of the gravitational wave signal, and interference between them. In this document, we describe the sonification process of the gravitational lensing effect on gravitational waves. Sonification is the translation of data into sound. The wave nature of sound creates interference between waves in a natural way. This has allowed us to reproduce the interference produced by the superposition of gravitational wave images, characteristic of the gravitational lensing effect.

      <description>arXiv:2407.09589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis theory to accurately predict the primordial abundances of helium and deuterium, as well as the baryon content of the Universe, is considered one of the most significant achievements in modern physics. In the present study, we consider two highly motivated hybrid $f(T)$ models and constrain them using the observations from the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis era. In addition, using late-time observations of Cosmic Chronometers and Gamma-Ray-Bursts, the ranges of the model parameters are confined which are in good agreement with early time bounds. Subsequently, the common ranges obtained from the analysis for early and late time are summarized. Further, we verify the intermediating epochs by investigating the profiles of cosmographic parameters using the model parameter values from the common range. From this study, we find the considered teleparallel models are viable candidates to explain the primordial-intermediating-present epochs.</description>

      <title>Effects of Subhalos on Interpreting Highly Magnified Sources Near Lensing Caustics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large magnification factors near gravitational lensing caustics of galaxy cluster lenses allow the study of individual stars or compact stellar associations at cosmological distances. We study how the presence of sub-galactic subhalos, an inevitable consequence of cold dark matter, can alter the property of caustics and hence change the interpretation of highly magnified sources that lie atop them. First, we consider a galaxy cluster halo populated with subhalos sampled from a realistic subhalo mass function calibrated to $N$-body simulations. Then, we compare a semi-analytical approximation and an adaptive ray-shooting method which we employ to quantify the property of the caustics. As a case study, we investigate Earendel, a $z = 6.2$ candidate of magnified single or multiple star system with a lone lensed image atop the critical curve in the Sunrise Arc. We find that the source size constraint ($\lesssim 0.3\, \mathrm{pc}$) previously derived from macro lens models should be relaxed by a factor of a few to ten when subhalos are accounted for, therefore allowing the possibility of a compact star cluster. The subhalos could introduce an astrometric perturbation that is $\lesssim 0.5''$, which does not contradict observation. These conclusions are largely robust to changes in the subhalo population. Subhalos therefore should be seriously accounted for when interpreting the astrophysical nature of similar highly magnified sources uncovered in recent high-$z$ observations.</description>

      <title>Axion Interactions with Domain and Bubble Walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that interactions between axion-like particles (ALPs) and co-dimension one defects, such as phase-transition bubble walls and solitonic domain walls, can lead to important changes in the evolution of both walls and ALPs. The leading effect arises from the change in the ALP decay constant across the interface, which naturally follows from shift-symmetric interactions with the corresponding order parameter. Specifically, we show that for thin walls moving relativistically, an ALP background -- such as e.g. axion dark matter -- gives rise to a frictional force on the interface that is proportional to $\gamma^2$, with $\gamma$ the Lorentz factor of the wall, and that this effect is present in both the oscillating and frozen axion regimes. We explore the broader consequences of this effect for bubble and domain walls in the early universe, and show that this source of friction can be present even in the absent of a conventional medium such as radiation or matter. Possible implications include modifications to the dynamics of bubble and domain walls and their corresponding gravitational wave signatures, as well as the generation of a dark radiation component of ALPs in the form of ultra-relativistic `axion shells' with Lorentz factor $\gamma_\text{shell} \simeq 2\gamma^2 \gg 1$ that may remain relativistic until the present day.</description>

      <title>Bulk viscous cosmological model in $f(T,\mathcal{T})$ modified gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article explores the impact of bulk viscosity on understanding the universe's accelerated expansion within the context of modified $f(T,\mathcal{T})$ gravity, which is an extension of the $f(T)$ gravitational theory, allowing a broad coupling between the energy-momentum scalar $\mathcal{T}$ and the torsion scalar $T$. We consider two $f(T,\mathcal{T})$ functions, specifically $f(T,\mathcal{T})=\alpha T + \beta \mathcal{T}$ and $f(T,\mathcal{T})=\alpha \sqrt{-T} + \beta \mathcal{T}$, where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are arbitrary constants, along with the fluid part incorporating the coefficient of bulk viscosity $\zeta=\zeta_0 &gt; 0$. We calculate the analytical solutions of the corresponding field equations for a flat FLRW environment, and then we constrain the free parameters of the obtained solution using CC, Pantheon+, and the CC+Pantheon+ samples. We perform the Bayesian statistical analysis to estimate the posterior probability utilizing the likelihood function and the MCMC random sampling technique. Further, to assess the effectiveness of our MCMC analysis, we estimate the corresponding AIC and BIC values, and we find that there is strong evidence supporting the assumed viscous modified gravity models for all three data sets. Also, we find that the linear model precisely mimics the $\Lambda$CDM model. We also investigate the evolutionary behavior of some prominent cosmological parameters. We observe that the effective equation of state parameter for both models predict the accelerating behavior of the cosmic expansion phase. In addition, from the statefinder test, we find that the parameters of the considered MOG models favor the quintessence-type behavior.</description>

      <title>Warm inflation in a Universe with a Weylian boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of boundary terms in the warm inflationary scenario, by considering that in the Einstein-Hilbert action the boundary can be described in terms of a Weyl-type geometry. The gravitational action, as well as the field equations, are thus extended to include new geometrical terms, coming from the non-metric nature of the boundary, and depending on the Weyl vector, and its covariant derivatives. We investigate the effects of these new boundary terms by considering the warm inflationary scenario of the early evolution of the Universe, in the presence of a scalar field. We obtain the generalized Friedmann equations in the Universe with a Weylian boundary by considering the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker metric. We consider the simultaneous decay of the scalar field, and of the creation of radiation, by appropriately splitting the general conservation equation through the introduction of the dissipation coefficient, which can depend on both the scalar field, and the Weyl vector. We consider three distinct warm inflationary models, in which the dissipation coefficients are chosen as different functions of the scalar field and of the Weyl vector. The numerical solutions of the cosmological evolution equations show that the radiation is created during the very early phases of expansion, and, after the radiation reaches its maximum value, the transition from an accelerating inflationary phase to a decelerating one takes place. Moreover, it turns out that the the Weyl vector, describing the boundary effects on the cosmological evolution, plays a significant role during the process of radiation creation.</description>

      <title>Confronting the low-scale seesaw and leptogenesis with neutrinoless double beta decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the impact of heavy neutrinos with masses in the MeV-GeV range on neutrinoless double beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$) in view of updated results for the lifetime of this process. Working in a minimal realistic extension of the Standard Model by two right-handed neutrino flavours, we show that the non-observation of $0\nu\beta\beta$ will impose strong bounds on the heavy neutrino properties that are complementary to the limits obtained from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and collider searches. For an inverted mass hierarchy of the light neutrinos we find that improved limits on $0\nu\beta\beta$ from next-generation experiments will restrict the allowed parameter space for fixed mass splitting to narrow bands in the mass-mixing plane. Further combining this with the requirement to explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe via leptogenesis reduces these bands to windows in parameter space that are constrained in all directions and can be targeted by direct searches at accelerators. For a normal mass hierarchy, only parts of the parameter space can be probed by such experiments.</description>

      <title>On the uncertainty of the White Dwarf Astrophysical Gravitational Wave Background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The astrophysical gravitational wave background (AGWB) is a stochastic GW signal that is emitted by different populations of inspiralling binary systems containing compact objects. In the frequency range between 10^{-4} and 10^{-1} Hz it will be detected by future space-based gravitational wave detectors like the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Recently, Staelens &amp; Nelemans 2024 (SN24) concluded that the white dwarf (WD) contribution to the AGWB dominates over that of black holes (BHs).
  We aim to investigate the uncertainties of the WD AGWB that arise from the use of different stellar metallicities, different star formation rate density (SFRD) models, and different binary evolution models.
  We use the code developed by SN24 to determine the WD component of the AGWB. We use a metallicity dependent SFRD based on Chruslinska et al (2019,2020,2021) to construct five different SFRD models. We use four different population models that use different common-envelope treatment and six different metallicities for each model.
  For all possible combinations, the WD component of the AGWB is dominant over other populations of compact objects. The effects of metallicity and population model are smaller than the effect of a (metallicity dependent) SFRD model. We find a range of about a factor of 5 in the level of the WD AGWB around a mid value of Omega_WD = 4 10^{-12} at 1 mHz and a shape that depends weakly on the model.
  We find an uncertainty for the WD component of the AGWB of about a factor 5. We note that there exist other uncertainties that have an effect on this signal as well. We discuss whether the turnover of the WD AGWB at 10 mHz will be detectable by LISA, and find that this is likely. We confirm the previous finding that the WD component of the AGWB dominates over other populations, in particular BHs.</description>

      <title>LeMMINGs. Multi-wavelength constraints on the co-existence of nuclear star clusters and AGN in nucleated galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: [Abridged] The relation between nuclear star clusters (NSCs) and the growth of the central SMBHs, as well as their connection to the properties of the host galaxies, is crucial for understanding the evolution of galaxies. Recent observations have revealed that about 10 per cent of nucleated galaxies host hybrid nuclei, consisting of both NSCs and accreting SMBHs that power active galactic nuclei (AGN). Motivated by the potential of the recently published multi-wavelength data sets from LeMMINGs survey, here we present the most thorough investigation to date of the incidence of hybrid nuclei in a large sample of 100 nearby nucleated galaxies (10 E, 25 S0, 63 S, and 2 Irr), covering a wide range in stellar mass ($M_{*,\rm gal} \sim 10^{8.7}-10^{12}~\rm M_{sun}$). We identify the nuclei and derive their properties by performing detailed 1D and 2D multi-component decompositions of the optical and near-infrared $HST$ stellar light distributions of the galaxies using S\'ersic and core-S\'ersic models. Our AGN diagnostics are based on homogeneously derived nuclear 1.5 GHz $e$-MERLIN radio, $Chandra$ X-ray (0.3--10 keV) and optical emission-line data. We determine the nucleation fraction ($f_{\rm nuc} $) as the relative incidence of nuclei across the LeMMINGs $HST$ sample and find $f_{\rm nuc} =~ $100/149 (= 67 $\pm$ 7 per cent), confirming previous work, with a peak value of 49/56~(= $88 \pm 13$ per cent) at bulge masses $M_{*,\rm bulge} \sim 10^{9.4}$- $10^{10.8}~\rm M_{sun}$. We identify 30 nucleated LeMMINGs galaxies that are optically active, radio-detected and X-ray luminous ($L_{X} &gt; 10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$). This indicates that our nucleated sample has a lower limit $\sim$ 30 per cent occupancy of hybrid nuclei, which is a function of $M_{*,\rm bulge}$ and $M_{*,\rm gal}$. We find that hybrid nuclei have a number density of $(1.5 \pm 0.4) \times 10^{-5}$ Mpc$^{-3}$.</description>

      <title>Accelerated by Dark Matter: a High-redshift Pathway to Efficient Galaxy-scale Star Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the local Universe, star formation is typically inefficient both globally and when considered as the fraction of gas converted into stars per local free-fall time. An important exception to this inefficiency is regions of high gravitational accelerations $g$, or equivalently surface densities $\Sigma = g/(\pi\,G)$, where stellar feedback is insufficient to overcome the self-gravity of dense gas clouds. In this paper, I explore whether dark matter can play an analogous role in providing the requisite accelerations on the scale of entire galaxies in the early cosmos. The key insight is that characteristic accelerations in dark matter halos scale as $(1+z)^2$ at fixed halo mass. I show this is sufficient to make dark matter the source of intense accelerations that might induce efficient star formation on galactic scales at cosmic dawn in sufficiently massive halos. The mass characterizing this regime scales as $(1+z)^{-6}$ and corresponds to a relatively constant comoving number density of $n(&gt;\!M_{\rm vir}) \approx 10^{-4}\,{\rm Mpc}^{-3}$ at $z \gtrsim 8$. For somewhat rarer halos, this model predicts stellar masses of $M_{\star} \sim 10^{9}\,M_{\odot}$ can form in regions that end up with sizes $\mathcal{O}(100\,{\rm pc})$ over $40\,{\rm Myr}$ time-scales at $z\approx 12-14$; these numbers compare well to measurements for some of the brightest galaxies at that epoch from James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations. Dark matter and standard cosmological evolution may therefore be crucial for explaining the surprisingly high levels of star formation in the early Universe revealed by JWST.</description>

      <title>Lower $H_0$ within The Theoretical Insights of Special Cosmological Model Pertains to Derived from The Infinite Future</title>

Abstract: In the realm of the $\omega$CDM cosmological model with quiescence or quintessence as the dark energy, characterized by $\omega&gt;-1$, there exists a fixed value of $H(z)$ at $z=-1$, devoid of dependency on other cosmological parameters. To constrain the Hubble constant, we amalgamated this theoretical $H(z)$ value with the latest 35 observational $H(z)$ data (OHD) using a Gaussian Process (GP) approach that is unrelated to cosmological models but intertwined with kernel functions. Within such a specialized cosmological paradigm, our scrutiny yields $H_0=64.89\pm4.68\ {\rm km\ s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}}$, markedly inferior to the $H_0$ estimate posited by the Planck Collaboration (2018) (exhibiting a tension of $0.53\sigma$), and substantially less than that of \cite{Riess2016A} (manifesting a tension of $1.67\sigma$). Conversely, when solely utilizing the latest 35 OHD, the inferred $H_0=68.77\pm6.24\ {\rm km\ s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}}$ (with a tension of $0.50\sigma$). Leveraging this derived $H_0$, we subsequently engage in $\chi^2$ statistics via the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique to constrain cosmological parameters. Within the flat $\omega$CDM model, we deduce $\Omega_M=0.32\pm0.02$ and $\omega=-0.80\pm0.05$, whereas in the non-flat $\omega$CDM model, we ascertain $\Omega_M=0.34\pm0.05$, $\Omega_\Lambda=0.76\pm0.12$, and $\omega=-0.78\pm0.07$, magnitudes surpassing those obtained sans the incorporation of theoretical $H(z)$ values.</description>

      <title>Algorithm to Produce a Density Field with Given Two, Three, and Four-Point Correlation Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05383v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here we show how to produce a 3D density field with a given set of higher-order correlation functions. Our algorithm enables producing any desired two-point, three-point, and four-point functions, including odd-parity for the latter. We note that this algorithm produces the desired correlations about a set of ``primary'' points, matched to how the spherical-harmonic-based algorithms ENCORE and CADENZA measure them. These ``primary points'' must be used as those around which the correlation functions are measured. We also generalize the algorithm to i) $N$-point correlations with $N&gt;4$, ii) dimensions other than 3, and iii) beyond scalar quantities. This algorithm should find use in verifying analysis pipelines for higher-order statistics in upcoming galaxy redshift surveys such as DESI, Euclid, Roman, and Spherex, as well as intensity mapping. In particular it may be helpful in searches for parity violation in the 4PCF of these samples, for which producing initial conditions for N-body simulations is both costly and highly model-dependent at present, and so alternative methods such as that developed here are desirable</description>

      <title>21cmEMU: an emulator of 21cmFAST summary observables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed rapid progress in observations of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). These have enabled high-dimensional inference of galaxy and intergalactic medium (IGM) properties during the first billion years of our Universe. However, even using efficient, semi-numerical simulations, traditional inference approaches that compute 3D lightcones on-the-fly can take $10^5$ core hours. Here we present 21cmEMU: an emulator of several summary observables from the popular 21cmFAST simulation code. 21cmEMU takes as input nine parameters characterizing EoR galaxies, and outputs the following summary statistics: (i) the IGM mean neutral fraction; (ii) the 21-cm power spectrum; (iii) the mean 21-cm spin temperature; (iv) the sky-averaged (global) 21-cm signal; (vi) the ultraviolet (UV) luminosity functions (LFs); and (vii) the Thomson scattering optical depth to the cosmic microwave background (CMB). All observables are predicted with sub-percent median accuracy, with a reduction of the computational cost by a factor of over 10$^4$. After validating inference results, we showcase a few applications, including: (i) quantifying the relative constraining power of different observational datasets; (ii) seeing how recent claims of a late EoR impact previous inferences; and (iii) forecasting upcoming constraints from the sixth observing season of the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) telescope. 21cmEMU is publicly-available, and is included as an alternative simulator in the public 21CMMC sampler.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the present state and planned updates of CosmoLattice, a cutting-edge code for lattice simulations of non-linear dynamics of scalar-gauge field theories in an expanding background. We first review current capabilities of the code, including the simulation of interacting singlet scalars and of Abelian and non-Abelian scalar-gauge theories. We also comment on new features recently implemented, such as the simulation of gravitational waves from scalar and gauge fields. Secondly, we discuss new extensions of CosmoLattice that we plan to release publicly. On the one hand, we comment on new physics modules, which include axion-gauge interactions $\phi F \widetilde{F}$, non-minimal gravitational couplings $\phi^2 R$, creation and evolution of cosmic defect networks, and magneto-hydro-dynamics (MHD). On the other hand, we discuss new technical features, including evolvers for non-canonical interactions, arbitrary initial conditions, simulations in 2+1 dimensions, and higher accuracy spatial derivatives.</description>

      <title>Detecting Dark Matter Substructures on Small Scales with Fast Radio Bursts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose measuring the arrival time difference of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) along two adjacent sightlines as a new probe to dark matter substructures on scales down to $\sim 1\,$AU. We discuss two observational scenarios in which it may be possible to place interesting constraints on such models through monitoring repeating FRB sources: 1) By sending radio receivers to space to form a baseline of tens of AU or more and measuring the temporal variation of the arrival time difference between receivers. 2) By measuring the temporal variation of the arrival time difference between two lensed images of one strongly lensed repeater. In both scenarios, obtaining interesting constraints requires correlating the voltage time series to measure the radio-signal arrival time to sub-nanosecond precision. We find that two radio dishes separated by $20\,$AU may be sensitive to the enhancement of small-scale structures at $\sim 10^{-8}M_\odot$ masses in the QCD axion dark matter scenario or from an early epoch of matter-domination with a reheating temperature up to 60 MeV. Other dark matter models such as those composed of $\sim 10^{-13}M_{\odot}$ primordial black holes produced during inflation would also be probed by this method. We further show that a strong lensing situation of multiple images provides an equivalent $\sim 2000\,$AU baseline, which can be much more sensitive but with the uncertainty that intervening ISM decoherence may degrade the timing precision and that spatial variation in the FRB emission spot may result in confounding signals. We show that the lensing magnifications of Type Ia supernovea constrain a similar quantity to such FRB timing, with present limits being equivalent to ruling out the same parameter space that would be probed by a $0.14~$AU baseline.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hubble expansion of the Universe is considered in the classical limit of Big Bang quantum cosmology. Consistency with general relativity obtains in an IR coupling to the bare cosmological constant parameterized by the Hubble horizon. The resulting effective dark energy $\Lambda$ has a simple meaning as a relic of the Big Bang, breaking time-translation invariance on a Hubble time-scale. We identify $\Lambda$ with the trace $J$ of the Schouten tensor, allowing for an analytic solution $H(z)$ beyond $\Lambda$CDM. Subject to the {\em Baryonic Accoustic Oscillations} (BAO), $J$CDM predicts $H_0$ to be $\sqrt{6/5}$ times $H_0$ in $\Lambda$CDM. $J$CDM is consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM fit to the {\em Planck} 2018 power spectrum of the CMB, while alleviating the $H_0$-tension with the Local Distance Ladder.</description>

      <title>Systematic Effects in Galaxy-Galaxy Lensing with DESI</title>

Abstract: The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey will measure spectroscopic redshifts for millions of galaxies across roughly $14,000 \, \mathrm{deg}^2$ of the sky. Cross-correlating targets in the DESI survey with complementary imaging surveys allows us to measure and analyze shear distortions caused by gravitational lensing in unprecedented detail. In this work, we analyze a series of mock catalogs with ray-traced gravitational lensing and increasing sophistication to estimate systematic effects on galaxy-galaxy lensing estimators such as the tangential shear $\gamma_{\mathrm{t}}$ and the excess surface density $\Delta\Sigma$. We employ mock catalogs tailored to the specific imaging surveys overlapping with the DESI survey: the Dark Energy Survey (DES), the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey, and the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS). Among others, we find that fiber incompleteness can have significant effects on galaxy-galaxy lensing estimators but can be corrected effectively by up-weighting DESI targets with fibers by the inverse of the fiber assignment probability. Similarly, we show that intrinsic alignment and lens magnification are expected to be statistically significant given the precision forecasted for the DESI year-1 data set. Our study informs several analysis choices for upcoming cross-correlation studies of DESI with DES, HSC, and KiDS.</description>

      <title>Weak lensing of strong lensing: beyond the tidal regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12091v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The analysis of strong lensing images usually involves an external convergence and shear, which are meant to model the effect of perturbations along the line of sight, on top of the main lens. Such a description of line-of-sight perturbations supposes that the corresponding gravitational fields can be treated in the tidal regime. Going one step further introduces additional effects, known as flexion, which have been hitherto neglected in strong lensing. In this work, we build a minimal model for the line-of-sight flexion, which adds four new complex parameters to the lens model. Contrary to convergence and shear, the line-of-sight flexion cannot be projected onto the main lens plane. For a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, we predict the typical line-of-sight flexion to be on the order of $10^{-3} \mathrm{arcsec}^{-1}$ on galactic scales. Neglecting its effect in lens modelling is found to bias the recovery of other parameters; in particular, the line-of-sight shear can be biased up to $2\sigma$. Accounting for the line-of-sight flexion in our minimal framework restores accuracy, at the the cost of degrading precision. With current imaging capabilities, the line-of-sight flexion is unlikely to be measurable on individual strong lensing images; it must therefore be considered a nuisance parameter rather than an observable in its own right.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the Parity-Odd Power (POP) spectra, a novel set of observables for probing parity violation in cosmological $N$-point statistics. POP spectra are derived from composite fields obtained by applying nonlinear transformations, involving also gradients, curls, and filtering functions, to a scalar field. This compresses the parity-odd trispectrum into a power spectrum. These new statistics offer several advantages: they are computationally fast to construct, estimating their covariance is less demanding compared to estimating that of the full parity-odd trispectrum, and they are simple to model theoretically. We measure the POP spectra on simulations of a scalar field with a specific parity-odd trispectrum shape. We compare these measurements to semi-analytic theoretical calculations and find agreement. We also explore extensions and generalizations of these parity-odd observables.</description>

      <title>Enhancing inflationary model predictions via refined slow-roll dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The inflationary paradigm not only addresses early Universe puzzles but also aligns well with the observational constraints, with slow-roll inflationary models fitting best. Evaluating these model predictions requires considering both slow-roll inflationary dynamics and the subsequent reheating epoch. This involves the quantitative analysis that takes into account the effective equation of state (EoS) and duration of reheating, connecting these with the perturbations generated deep during the inflationary era. Given the complexities involved, many approximations are often used for simplification. However, as future observations are expected to improve the accuracy of these observables significantly, this work takes a different approach. Instead of relying on approximations, we consider the near-accurate solutions of inflationary models and compare our results with the pre-existing ones. It mainly incorporates two improvements: the first is the accurate dynamics of the slow-roll evolution, and, thus, the end of inflation; and the second is the higher-order slow-roll corrections to the perturbed observables. Our findings indicate that, by implementing these corrections, the theoretical predictions improve significantly. It also indicates that seemingly minor corrections can have significant effects on the perturbed observables, and these refined predictions can be compared with future observations to potentially rule out models and help resolve the degeneracy problem of the inflationary paradigm.</description>

      <title>The negative BAO shift in the Ly$\alpha$ forest from cosmological simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first measurement of the Ly$\alpha$ forest BAO shift parameter from cosmological simulations. In particular, we generate a suite of $1000$ accurate effective field-level bias-based Ly$\alpha$ forest simulations of volume $V=(1 \, h^{-1} \, {\rm Gpc})^3$ at $z=2$, both in real and redshift space, calibrated upon two fixed-and-paired cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. To measure the BAO, we stack the three-dimensional power spectra of the $1000$ different realizations, compute the average, and use a model accounting for a proper smooth-peak component decomposition of the power spectrum, to fit it via an efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo scheme estimating the covariance matrices directly from the simulations. We report the BAO shift parameters to be $\alpha=0.9969^{+0.0014}_{-0.0014}$ and $\alpha=0.9905^{+0.0027}_{-0.0027}$ in real and redshift space, respectively. We also measure the bias $b_{\rm lya}$ and the BAO broadening parameter $\Sigma_{\rm nl}$, finding $b_{\rm lya}=-0.1786^{+0.0001}_{-0.0001}$ and $\Sigma_{\rm nl}=3.87^{+0.20}_{-0.20}$ in real space, and $b_{\rm lya}=-0.073^{+0.005}_{-0.004}$ and $\Sigma_{\rm nl}=6.55^{+0.23}_{-0.22}$ in redshift space. Moreover, we measure the linear Kaiser factor $\beta_{\rm lya}=1.39^{+0.24}_{-0.18}$ from the isotropic redshift space fit. Overall, we find evidence for a negative shift of the BAO peak at the $\sim 2.2\sigma$ and $\sim 3.5\sigma$ level in real and redshift space, respectively. This work sets new important theoretical constraints on the Ly$\alpha$ forest BAO scale and offers a potential solution to the tension emerging from previous observational analysis, in light of ongoing and upcoming Ly$\alpha$ forest spectroscopic surveys, such as DESI, PFS, and WEAVE-QSO.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.09711v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark photons have emerged as promising candidates for dark matter, and their search is a top priority in particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology. We report the first use of a tunable niobium superconducting radio-frequency cavity for a scan search of dark photon dark matter with innovative data analysis techniques. We mechanically adjusted the resonant frequency of a cavity submerged in liquid helium at a temperature of $2$ K, and scanned the dark photon mass over a frequency range of $1.37$ MHz centered at $1.3$ GHz. Our study leveraged the superconducting radio-frequency cavity's remarkably high quality factors of approximately $10^{10}$, resulting in the most stringent constraints to date on a substantial portion of the exclusion parameter space on the kinetic mixing coefficient $\epsilon$ between dark photons and electromagnetic photons, yielding a value of $\epsilon &lt; 2.2 \times 10^{-16}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We quantise from first principles field theories living on the background of a bubble wall in the planar limit with particular focus on the case of spontaneous breaking of gauge symmetry. Using these tools, we compute the average momentum transfer from transition radiation: the soft emission of radiation by an energetic particle passing across the wall, with a particular focus on the longitudinal polarisation of vectors. We find these to be comparable to transverse polarisations in symmetry-breaking transitions with mild super-cooling, and dominant in broken to broken transitions with thin wall. Our results have phenomenological applications for the expansion of bubbles during first order phase transitions. Our general framework allows for the robust calculation of any particle processes of interest in such translation breaking backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional thermodynamic structures of the intracluster medium across edges in the X-ray surface brightness of massive, bright, dynamically-active galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15824v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed study of three-dimensional (3D) thermodynamic structures of the intracluster medium (ICM) across edges in the X-ray surface brightness of four massive, bright, dynamically-active galaxy clusters (A3667, A2319, A520, and A2146), with the Chandra X-ray Observatory. Based on a forward modeling approach developed in previous work, we extend this approach with more generalized ICM density and temperature profiles, allowing us to apply uniformly to the observed X-ray surface brightness profiles to detect edges and measure the 3D thermodynamic profiles of the ICM simultaneously and self-consistently. With the forward modeling analysis, we find, in agreement with previous works, that the obtained 3D thermodynamic structures of the ICM across the edges in A3667 and A2319 are consistent with the characteristics of cold fronts, whereas those in A520 and A2146 are consistent with the nature of shock fronts. We find that the azimuthal distribution of the pressure ratio at the cold front in A3667 shows a different trend from that in A2319. For the shock fronts in A520 and A2146, the observed 3D temperature profiles of the ICM indicate that the temperature is highest at the position of the shock front. In the case of the sector exhibiting M = 2.4 in A520, the ICM temperature appears isothermal with a temperature of ~10 keV until ~300 kpc away from the shock front in the post-shock region, being consistent with the hypothesis of the instant-equilibration model for shock-heating.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the decametre sky at subarcminute resolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The largely unexplored decameter radio band (10-30 MHz) provides a unique window for studying a range of astronomical topics, such as auroral emission from exoplanets, inefficient cosmic ray acceleration mechanisms, fossil radio plasma, and free-free absorption. The scarcity of low-frequency studies is mainly due to the severe perturbing effects of the ionosphere. Here we present a calibration strategy that can correct for the ionosphere in the decameter band. We apply this to an observation from the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) between 16 to 30 MHz . The resulting image covers 330 square degrees of sky at a resolution of 45", reaching a sensitivity of 12 mJy/beam. Residual ionospheric effects cause additional blurring ranging between 60 to 100". This represents an order of magnitude improvement in terms of sensitivity and resolution compared to previous decameter band observations. In the region we surveyed, we have identified four fossil plasma sources. These rare sources are believed to contain old, possibly re-energised, radio plasma originating from previous outbursts of active galactic nuclei. At least three of them are situated near the center of low-mass galaxy clusters. Notably, two of these sources display the steepest radio spectral index among all the sources detected at 23 MHz. This indicates that fossil plasma sources constitute the primary population of steep-spectrum sources at these frequencies, emphasising the large discovery potential of ground-based decameter observations.</description>

      <title>Growth of cosmic perturbations in the modified $f(R,T)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11840v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the generalized $f(R,T)$ modified theory of gravity, where the gravitational Lagrangian is a function of Ricci scalar $R$ and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor $T$. We derive modified field equations to the linear order of perturbations in the context of $f(R,T)$ model. We then investigate the growth of perturbations in the context of $f(R,T)$ modified gravity. Primary numerical investigations based on matter power spectra diagrams indicates a structure growth suppression in $f(R,T)$ gravity, which exhibits consistency with local measurements. Also, we notice that matter-geometry interaction in $f(R,T)$ model would results in the specific feature named as "matter acoustic oscillations" appeared in matter power spectra diagrams. Moreover, we put constraints on the cosmological parameters of $f(R,T)$ model, utilizing current observations, chiefly cosmic microwave background, weak lensing, supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, and redshift-space distortions data. Numerical results based on MCMC calculations imply that $f(R,T)$ is a qualified theory of modified gravity in reconciling Planck CMB data with local probes of large scale structures, by reporting lower values for the structure growth parameter $\sigma_8$ compared to the standard model of cosmology.</description>

      <title>To curve, or not to curve: Is curvature-assisted quintessence observationally viable?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09212v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single-field models of accelerated expansion with nearly flat potentials, despite being able to provide observationally viable explanations for the early-time cosmic inflation and the late-time cosmic acceleration, are in strong tension with string theory evidence and the associated de Sitter swampland constraints. It has recently been argued that in an open universe, where the spatial curvature is negative (i.e., with $\Omega_k&gt;0$), a new stable fixed point arises, which may lead to viable single-field-based accelerated expansion with an arbitrarily steep potential. Here we show, through a dynamical systems analysis and a Bayesian statistical inference of cosmological parameters, that the additional cosmological solutions based on the new fixed point do not render steep-potential, single-field, accelerated expansion observationally viable. We mainly focus on quintessence models of dark energy, but we also argue that a similar conclusion can be drawn for cosmic inflation.</description>

      <title>Generalized Entropy Implies Varying-G: Horizon Area Dependent Field Equations and Black Hole-Cosmology Coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is modified, ambiguity often arises concerning whether the Hawking temperature or the thermodynamic mass should be modified. The common practice, however, is to keep the black hole solution the same as that in general relativity. On the other hand, if Jacobson's method of deriving Einstein equations from thermodynamic is valid in the general settings, then given a generalized entropy one should first derive the corresponding modified gravity, and then look for the compatible black hole solution before investigating its thermodynamics. We comment on some properties and subtleties in this approach. In particular, we point out that generically generalized entropy would lead to a varying effective gravitational "constant" theory, where $G_\text{eff}$ depends on the horizon area. We discuss in what ways such theories are discernible from general relativity despite its seemingly jarring differences, and how to make sense of area-dependent field equations. As a consequence we show that in the Jacobson's approach, the standard quantum gravitational logarithmic correction to Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is equivalent to a running gravitational "constant". A horizon area dependent $G_\text{eff}$ could also lead to a coupling between black hole masses and cosmological expansion, a scenario that has been studied recently in the literature, but so far lacks strong theoretical motivation. In the Tsallis case, we show that the thermodynamic mass for a Schwarzschild black hole is just a constant multiple of its ADM mass, which is considerably simpler than the approach not utilizing the Jacobson's method.</description>

      <title>Ultra-high Frequency Gravitational Waves from Scattering, Bremsstrahlung and Decay during Reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate ultra-high frequency gravitational waves (GWs) from gravitons generated during inflationary reheating. Specifically, we study inflaton scattering with its decay product, where the couplings involved in this $2 \to 2$ scattering are the same as those in the $1 \to 3$ graviton Bremsstrahlung process. We compute the graviton production rate via such $2 \to 2$ scattering. Additionally, we compare the resulting GW spectrum with that from Bremsstrahlung as well as that from pure $2 \to 2$ inflaton scatterings. For completeness, the GW spectrum from graviton pair production through one-loop induced $1 \to 2$ inflaton decay is also analyzed. With a systematic comparison among the four sources of GWs, we find that $2 \to 2$ inflaton scattering with its decay product can dominate over Bremsstrahlung if the reheating temperature is larger than the inflaton mass. Pure inflaton $2 \to 2$ scattering is typically subdominant compared to Bremsstrahlung except in the high-frequency tail. The contribution from one-loop induced $1 \to 2$ inflaton decay is shown to be suppressed compared to Bremsstrahlung and pure inflaton $2 \to 2$ scattering.</description>

      <title>Galaxy populations and redshift dependence of the correlation between infrared and radio luminosity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that the difference in infrared-to-radio luminosity ratio between local and high-redshift star-forming galaxies reflects {the alternative physical conditions} -- including magnetic field configurations -- of the dominant population of star-forming galaxies in different redshift ranges. We define three galactic types, based on our reference model, with reference to ages of stellar populations. ``Normal'' late-type galaxies dominate the star formation in the nearby Universe; ``starburst'' galaxies take over at higher redshifts, up to z ~1.5; while ``protospheroidal'' galaxies dominate at high redshift. A reanalysis of data from the COSMOS field combined with literature results shows that, for each population, the data are consistent with an almost redshift-independent mean value of the parameter q_IR, which quantifies the infrared-radio correlation. However, we find a hint of an upturn of the mean q_IR at z&gt;~3.5 consistent with the predicted dimming of synchrotron emission due to cooling of relativistic electrons by inverse Compton scattering off the cosmic microwave background. The typical stellar masses increase from normal, to starburst, and to protospheroidal galaxies, accounting for the reported dependence of the mean q_IR on stellar mass. Higher values of q_IR found for high-z strongly lensed dusty galaxies selected at 500 micron might be explained by differential magnification.</description>

      <title>The ALMA-ALPAKA survey II. Evolution of turbulence in galaxy disks across cosmic time: difference between cold and warm gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gas in the interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies is supersonically turbulent. Measurements of turbulence typically rely on cold gas emission lines for low-z galaxies and warm ionized gas observations for z&gt;0 galaxies. Studies of warm gas kinematics at z&gt;0 conclude that the turbulence strongly evolves as a function of redshift, due to the increasing impact of gas accretion and mergers in the early Universe. However, recent findings suggest potential biases in turbulence measurements derived from ionized gas at high-z, impacting our understanding of turbulence origin, ISM physics and disk formation. We investigate the evolution of turbulence using velocity dispersion ($\sigma$) measurements from cold gas tracers (i.e., CO, [CI], [CII]) derived from a sample of 57 galaxy disks spanning the redshift range z=0-5. This sample consists of main-sequence and starburst galaxies with stellar masses $\gtrsim 10^{10} M_{\odot}$. The comparison with current H$\alpha$ kinematic observations and existing models demonstrates that the velocity dispersion inferred from cold gas tracers differ by a factor of $\approx 3$ from those obtained using emission lines tracing warm gas. We show that stellar feedback is the main driver of turbulence measured from cold gas tracers. This is fundamentally different from the conclusions of studies based on warm gas, which had to consider additional turbulence drivers to explain the high values of $\sigma$. We present a model predicting the redshift evolution of turbulence in galaxy disks, attributing the increase of $\sigma$ with redshift to the higher energy injected by supernovae due to the elevated star-formation rate in high-z galaxies. This supernova-driven model suggests that turbulence is lower in galaxies with lower stellar mass compared to those with higher stellar mass. Additionally, it forecasts the evolution of $\sigma$ in Milky-Way like progenitors.</description>

      <title>New Synoptic Observations of the Cosmic Optical Background with New Horizons</title>

Abstract: We obtained New Horizons LORRI images to measure the cosmic optical background (COB) intensity integrated over $0.4\lesssim\lambda\lesssim0.9{~\rm\mu m}.$ The survey comprises 16 high Galactic-latitude fields selected to minimize scattered diffuse Galactic light (DGL) from the Milky Way galaxy, as well as scattered light from bright stars. This work supersedes an earlier analysis based on observations of one of the present fields. Isolating the COB contribution to the raw total sky levels measured in the fields requires subtracting the remaining scattered light from bright stars and galaxies, intensity from faint stars within the fields fainter than the photometric detection-limit, and the DGL foreground. DGL is estimated from Planck HFI $350 {~\rm\mu m}$ and $550 {~\rm\mu m}$ intensities, using a new self-calibrated indicator based on the 16 fields augmented with eight additional DGL calibration fields obtained as part of the survey. The survey yields a highly significant detection ($6.8\sigma$) of the COB at ${\rm 11.16\pm 1.65~(1.47~sys,~0.75~ran) ~nW ~m^{-2} ~sr^{-1}}$ at the LORRI pivot wavelength of 0.608 $\mu$m. The estimated integrated intensity from background galaxies, ${\rm 8.17\pm 1.18 ~nW ~m^{-2} ~sr^{-1}},$ can account for the great majority of this signal. The rest of the COB signal, ${\rm 2.99\pm2.03~ (1.75~sys,~1.03~ran) ~nW ~m^{-2} ~sr^{-1}},$ is formally classified as anomalous intensity but is not significantly different from zero. The simplest interpretation is that the COB is completely due to galaxies.</description>

Abstract: Consideration of extra spatial dimensions is motivated by the unification of gravity with other interactions, the achievement of the ultimate framework of quantum gravity, and fundamental problems in particle physics and cosmology. Much attention has been focused on the effect of these extra dimensions on the modified theories of gravity. Analytically examining astrophysical phenomena like black hole shadows is one approach to understand how extra dimensions would affect the modified gravitational theories. The purpose of this study is to derive a higher dimensional metric for a dark compact object in STVG theory and then examine the behavior of the shadow shapes for this solution in STVG theory in higher dimensions. We apply the Carter method to formulate the geodesic equations and the Hamilton Jacobi method to find photon orbits around this higher dimensional MOG dark compact object. We investigate the effects of extra dimensions and the STVG parameter alpha on the black hole shadow size. Next, we compare the shadow radius of this higher dimensional MOG dark compact object to the shadow size of the supermassive black hole M87, which has been realized by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaborations, in order to restrict these parameters. We find that extra dimensions in the STVG theory typically lead to a reduction in the shadow size of the higher dimensional MOG dark compact object, whereas the effect of parameter alpha on this black hole shadow is suppressible. Remarkably, given the constraints from EHT observations, we find that the shadow size of the four dimensional MOG dark compact object lies in the confidence levels of the EHT data. Finally, we investigate the issue of acceleration bounds in higher dimensional MOG dark compact object in confrontation with EHT data of M87.</description>

      <title>Exploring a primordial solution for early black holes detected with the JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has unearthed black holes as massive as $10^{6.2-8.1}M_\odot$ at redshifts of $z \sim 8.5-10.6$ with many systems showing unexpectedly high black hole to stellar mass ratios &gt;=30%, posing a crucial challenge for theoretical models. Using analytic calculations, we explore the combination of {\it astrophysical} seeding mechanisms and Eddington accretion rates that can explain the observed objects. We then appeal to {\it cosmological} primordial black hole (PBH) seeds and show how these present an alternative path for "seeding" early structures and their baryonic contents. Assuming seeding (via astrophysical means) at a redshift of $z_{\rm seed}=25$ and continuous accretion, all of the black holes studied here can either be explained through super-Eddington accretion (at an Eddington fraction of $f_{\rm Edd}&lt;= 2.1 $) onto low-mass ($100M_\odot$) seeds or Eddington-limited accretion onto high-mass ($10^5 M_\odot$) seeds. The upper limit, where we assume a primordial origin for all of these black holes, yields a continuous primordial black hole mass function (between $10^{-5.25}$ and $10^{3.75} M_\odot$) and a fractional PBH value $&lt;= 10^{-12}$, in good agreement with observational constraints. Starting at the redshift of matter-radiation equality ($z \sim 3400$), we show how PBH-driven structure formation can reproduce the observed stellar and black hole masses for two of the highest redshift black holes (UHZ1 and GHZ9 at $z \sim 10.3$) with the same parameters governing star formation, black hole accretion and their feedbacks. Exploring a wide swathe of model parameter space for GHZ9, we find black hole-to-stellar mass ratios ranging between $0.1-1.86$ i.e. in some cases (of high supernova feedback), the black hole grows to be more massive than the stellar mass of its host, presenting an attractive alternative to seeding these puzzling early systems.</description>

      <title>Light Dark Matter Constraints from SuperCDMS HVeV Detectors Operated Underground with an Anticoincidence Event Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article presents constraints on dark-matter-electron interactions obtained from the first underground data-taking campaign with multiple SuperCDMS HVeV detectors operated in the same housing. An exposure of 7.63 g-days is used to set upper limits on the dark-matter-electron scattering cross section for dark matter masses between 0.5 and 1000 MeV/$c^2$, as well as upper limits on dark photon kinetic mixing and axion-like particle axioelectric coupling for masses between 1.2 and 23.3 eV/$c^2$. Compared to an earlier HVeV search, sensitivity was improved as a result of an increased overburden of 225 meters of water equivalent, an anticoincidence event selection, and better pile-up rejection. In the case of dark-matter-electron scattering via a heavy mediator, an improvement by up to a factor of 25 in cross-section sensitivity was achieved.</description>
