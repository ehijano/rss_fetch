      <title>On the rectilinear crossing number of complete balanced multipartite graphs and layered graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A rectilinear drawing of a graph is a drawing of the graph in the plane in which the edges are drawn as straight-line segments. The rectilinear crossing number of a graph is the minimum number of pairs of edges that cross over all rectilinear drawings of the graph. Let $n \ge r$ be positive integers. The graph $K_n^r$, is the complete $r$-partite graph on $n$ vertices, in which every set of the partition has at least $\lfloor n/r \rfloor$ vertices. The layered graph, $L_n^r$, is an $r$-partite graph on $n$ vertices, in which for every $1\le i \le r-1$, all the vertices in the $i$-th partition are adjacent to all the vertices in the $(i+1)$-th partition. In this paper, we give upper bounds on the rectilinear crossing numbers of $K_n^r$ and~$L_n^r$.</description>

      <title>On Support Relations Inference and Scene Hierarchy Graph Construction from Point Cloud in Clustered Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the years, scene understanding has attracted a growing interest in computer vision, providing the semantic and physical scene information necessary for robots to complete some particular tasks autonomously. In 3D scenes, rich spatial geometric and topological information are often ignored by RGB-based approaches for scene understanding. In this study, we develop a bottom-up approach for scene understanding that infers support relations between objects from a point cloud. Our approach utilizes the spatial topology information of the plane pairs in the scene, consisting of three major steps. 1) Detection of pairwise spatial configuration: dividing primitive pairs into local support connection and local inner connection; 2) primitive classification: a combinatorial optimization method applied to classify primitives; and 3) support relations inference and hierarchy graph construction: bottom-up support relations inference and scene hierarchy graph construction containing primitive level and object level. Through experiments, we demonstrate that the algorithm achieves excellent performance in primitive classification and support relations inference. Additionally, we show that the scene hierarchy graph contains rich geometric and topological information of objects, and it possesses great scalability for scene understanding.</description>

      <title>A Tight Subexponential-time Algorithm for Two-Page Book Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A book embedding of a graph is a drawing that maps vertices onto a line and edges to simple pairwise non-crossing curves drawn into pages, which are half-planes bounded by that line. Two-page book embeddings, i.e., book embeddings into 2 pages, are of special importance as they are both NP-hard to compute and have specific applications. We obtain a 2^(O(\sqrt{n})) algorithm for computing a book embedding of an n-vertex graph on two pages -- a result which is asymptotically tight under the Exponential Time Hypothesis. As a key tool in our approach, we obtain a single-exponential fixed-parameter algorithm for the same problem when parameterized by the treewidth of the input graph. We conclude by establishing the fixed-parameter tractability of computing minimum-page book embeddings when parameterized by the feedback edge number, settling an open question arising from previous work on the problem.</description>

      <title>Mechanism Design for Automated Market Makers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09357v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Blockchains have popularized automated market makers (AMMs). An AMM exchange is an application running on a blockchain which maintains a pool of crypto-assets and automatically trades assets with users governed by some pricing function that prices the assets based on their relative demand/supply. AMMs have created an important challenge commonly known as the Miner Extractable Value (MEV). In particular, the miners who control the contents and ordering of transactions in a block can extract value by front-running and back-running users' transactions, leading to arbitrage opportunities that guarantee them risk-free returns.
  In this paper, we consider how to design AMM mechanisms that eliminate MEV opportunities. Specifically, we propose a new AMM mechanism that processes all transactions contained within a block in a batch. We show that our new mechanism satisfies two tiers of guarantees. First, for legacy blockchains where each block is proposed by a single (possibly rotating) miner, we prove that our mechanism satisfies arbitrage resilience, i.e., a miner cannot gain risk-free profit. Moreover, we also guarantee fair treatment among all transactions within the same block, such that the miner is unable to sell off favorable positions in the block to users or arbitragers. Second, for blockchains where the block proposal process is decentralized and offers sequencing-fairness, we prove a stronger notion called incentive compatibility -- roughly speaking, we guarantee that any individual user's best response is to follow the honest strategy.</description>
