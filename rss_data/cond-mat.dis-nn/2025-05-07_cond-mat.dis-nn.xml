      <title>Electron Model on Truchet Tiling: Extended-to-Localized Transitions, Mobility Edge, and Asymmetric Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent advances in the realization of Truchet-tiling structures in molecular networks and metal-organic frameworks, we investigate the wave localization issue in this kind of structure. We introduce an electron model based on random Truchet tilings-square lattices with randomly oriented diagonal links-and uncover a rich interplay between spectral and localization phenomena. By varying the strength of diagonal couplings, we demonstrate successive transitions from an extended phase, through a regime with a mobility edge, to a fully localized phase. The energy-resolved fractal dimension analysis captures the emergence and disappearance of mobility edges, while an anomalous shift and asymmetry in the van Hove singularity are identified as key signatures of the underlying disordered Truchet-tiling structure. Our findings position Truchet-tiled electron systems as a versatile platform for engineering disorder-driven localization and interaction effects in amorphous quantum materials and photonic architectures.</description>

      <title>Sound Attenuation in Glasses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Comprehending sound damping is integral to understanding the anomalous low temperature properties of glasses. Despite decades of studies, the underlying mechanism of sound damping in glasses is still debated. In this perspective we review recent work on sound damping in amorphous solids. We focus on the role of defects, heterogeneous elasticity, and damping in model amorphous solids without defects. We review our definition of damping defects and show that they strongly influence sound damping. However, we also find another contribution to sound damping that cannot be attributed to damping defects. We confirm an earlier result of Kapteijns et al. [G. Kapteijns et al., J. Chem. Phys. 154, 081101 (2021)] that heterogeneous elasticity theory predicts relative changes of sound damping in model two-dimensional glasses if the configuration-to-configuration elastic constants fluctuations are used to quantify the heterogeneity. We extend this finding to similar three-dimensional glasses. We end by discussing the Euclidean Random Matrix model, which exhibits Rayleigh scaling of sound damping, but does not have quasi-localized excitations, and thus probably does not have sound damping defects. We propose that the mechanisms behind sound damping can be more fully understood by approaching the problem from two directions, one where the strong influence of defects is studied and another where sound damping is studied in defect free albeit disordered materials.</description>

      <title>Magnetization-resolved density of states and quasi-first order transition in the two-dimensional random bond Ising model: an entropic sampling study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systems with quenched disorder possess complex energy landscapes that are challenging to explore under the conventional Monte Carlo method. In this work, we implement an efficient entropy sampling scheme for accurate computation of the entropy function in low-energy regions. The method is applied to the two-dimensional $\pm J$ random-bond Ising model, where frustration is controlled by the fraction $p$ of ferromagnetic bonds. We investigate the low-temperature paramagnetic--ferromagnetic phase boundary below the multicritical point at $T_N = 0.9530(4)$, $P_N = 0.89078(8)$, as well as the zero-temperature ferromagnetic--spin-glass transition. Finite-size scaling analysis reveals that the phase boundary for $T &lt; T_N$ exhibits reentrant behavior. By analyzing the evolution of the magnetization-resolved density of states $g(E, M)$ and ground-state spin configurations against increasing frustration, we provide strong evidence that the zero-temperature transition is quasi-first order. Finite-size scaling conducted on the spin-glass side supports the validity of $\beta = 0$, with a correlation length exponent $\nu = 1.50(8)$. Our results provide new insights into the nature of the ferromagnetic-to-spin-glass phase transition in an extensively degenerate ground state.</description>

      <title>Large-scale exponential correlations of non-affine elastic response of strongly disordered materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The correlation properties of non-affine elastic response in strongly disordered materials are investigated using the theory of correlated random matrices and molecular dynamics simulations. The random matrix theory shows that the divergence of the non-affine displacement field has large-scale exponentially decaying correlations. The corresponding length scale $\xi$ is determined by the strength of the disorder and can be indefinitely large, significantly exceeding the correlation length of the disorder. The rotor of the non-affine displacement field has the same length scale $\xi$ except the case of the volumetric deformation. The main theoretical dependencies are confirmed by molecular dynamics simulation of a model polystyrene in the amorphous state.</description>

      <title>Emergent oscillations and chaos in non-compliant microfluidic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Incompressible fluids in microfluidic networks with non-rigid channels can exhibit flow rate oscillations analogous to electric current oscillations in RLC circuits. This is due to the elastic deformation of channel walls that can store and release fluid, as electric capacitors can store and release electric charges. This property is quantified through the compliance of the system, defined as the volume change relative to the pressure change. In systems with rigid walls and incompressible fluid, compliance vanishes and no oscillations can occur through this mechanism. Here, we show that not only oscillations but also chaos can emerge in the flow-rate dynamics of non-compliant microfluidic networks with incompressible fluid. Notably, these dynamics emerge spontaneously, even under time-independent driving pressures. The underlying mechanism is governed by the effect of fluid inertia, which becomes relevant at moderate Reynolds numbers observed in microfluidic systems exhibiting complex flow patterns. The results are established using a combination of direct numerical simulations and a reduced model derived from modal analysis. This approach enables us to determine the onset of oscillations, the associated bifurcations, the oscillation frequencies and amplitudes, and their dependence on the driving pressures. These findings can inspire novel studies and applications of previously unexplored oscillatory and chaotic regimes in non-compliant microfluidic systems.</description>

      <title>Study of the Extended Yard Sale model of wealth distribution on Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Excessive wealth concentration can undermine economic and social development. Random Asset Exchange (RAE) models provide valuable tools to investigate this phenomenon. Assuming that economic systems may operate optimally near the critical point of a continuous phase transition, the Extended Yard Sale (EYS) model introduced by Boghosian et al.~[Physica A 476, 15 (2017)] offers a compelling framework. This model captures the interplay between wealth redistribution and accumulation, exhibiting a continuous phase transition marked by a broad wealth distribution at criticality, separating a condensed phase -- where a microscopic fraction of agents holds a macroscopic share of total wealth -- from a distributed phase with a light-tailed wealth distribution. While the original EYS model assumes fully connected interactions, this work introduces and studies a networked variant where agents interact over Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random networks. The analysis combines Monte Carlo simulations with Quenched Mean Field and Mean Field approximations, exploring a variety of interaction and taxation schemes. A scaling analysis shows that, although the networked model also undergoes a continuous phase transition, it leads to local wealth condensation rather than the global condensation found in the fully connected case. These results deepen our understanding of wealth dynamics in structured populations and may help inform the development of more effective economic and social policies.</description>

      <title>Geometric control and memory in networks of hysteretic elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The response of driven frustrated media stems from interacting hysteretic elements. We derive explicit mappings from networks of hysteretic springs to their abstract representation as interacting hysterons. These maps reveal how the physical network controls the signs, magnitudes, symmetries, and pair-wise nature of the hysteron interactions. In addition, strong geometric nonlinearities can produce pathways that require excess hysterons or even break hysteron models. Our results pave the way for metamaterials with geometrically controlled interactions, pathways, and functionalities, and highlight fundamental limitations of abstract hysterons in modeling disordered systems.</description>

      <title>Phase Diagram from Nonlinear Interaction between Superconducting Order and Density: Toward Data-Based Holographic Superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address an inverse problem in modeling holographic superconductors. We focus our research on the critical temperature behavior depicted by experiments. We use a physics-informed neural network method to find a mass function $M(F^2)$, which is necessary to understand phase transition behavior. This mass function describes a nonlinear interaction between superconducting order and charge carrier density. We introduce positional embedding layers to improve the learning process in our algorithm, and the Adam optimization is used to predict the critical temperature data via holographic calculation with appropriate accuracy. Consideration of the positional embedding layers is motivated by the transformer model of natural-language processing in the artificial intelligence (AI) field. We obtain holographic models that reproduce borderlines of the normal and superconducting phases provided by actual data. Our work is the first holographic attempt to match phase transition data quantitatively obtained from experiments. Also, the present work offers a new methodology for data-based holographic models.</description>
