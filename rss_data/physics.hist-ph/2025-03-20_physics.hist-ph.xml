      <title>Key Historical Experiments in Hadron Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The experimental observations that led to the quark structure of matter and the development of hadron physics are reviewed with emphasis on the discoveries of mesons and baryons, starting in the 1940s with the pion and kaon which mediate the strong hadronic force. The evidence for an internal structure of the hadrons consisting of two or three elementary spin 1/2 particles is reviewed. The discoveries of hadrons made of the heavier charm and bottom quarks are described. In 2003 more complex multi-quark hadrons began to emerge. The subsequent developments beyond the early 2000s are covered in the Review of Particle Physics (Phys. Rev. D 110 (2024) 030001). Given the very large number of observed hadrons, the choice of key experiments is somewhat subjective.</description>

      <title>The localization problem: an antinomy between measurability and causal dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The localization problem in relativistic quantum theory has persisted for more than seven decades, yet it is largely unknown and continues to perplex even those well-versed in the subject. At the heart of this problem lies a fundamental conflict between localizability and relativistic causality, which can also be construed as part of the broader dichotomy between measurement and unitary dynamics. This article provides a historical review of the localization problem in one-particle relativistic quantum mechanics, clarifying some persistent misconceptions in the literature, and underscoring the antinomy between causal dynamics and localized observables.</description>

      <title>The Waters We Swim In: Replicability and the Evolution of Scientific Norms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05788v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, a series of high-profile retractions and fraud cases have arisen in physics, sparking a conversation about research integrity and replicability. Here, we discuss how the practice of science is shaped by the social and political context in which it operates. Reflection on our norms and values could provide a route to create community-driven safeguards that respond to the changing demands in which our research occurs. We propose that collaborations between physicists, philosophers, social scientists, and historians of science could facilitate these reflections and provide new ideas for social science and humanities colleagues.</description>
