      <title>Polygons in Polygons with a Twist</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a study of the construction of particular regular sub-n-gons T in regular n-gons P using a special system of chords of P. In particular, some of these sub-n-gons have areas which are integer divisors of the area of the given n-gon P. Initially, the study will concentrate on chords which are from a vertex to special points of one of the opposite sides of P. Several examples are explored. However, it will become apparent that a much more general situation exists. A Dynamic Geometry software, such as Sketchpad, or GeoGebra, is the key to investigating this new relationship.</description>

      <title>Matrices with integer eigenvalues for all permutations of coefficients (thanks to Pythagoras!)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that Pythagorean triples can be used to generate matrices that have integer eigenvalues for all permutations of their coefficients, via simple formulas. For example, each and every permutation of the $2\times2$ matrix coefficients $\{12,6,7,1\}$, generated by the Pythagorean triple $(5,12,13)$, yields a matrix with integer eigenvalues. Further, each and every Pythagorean triple in fact generates a countable infinity of nontrivially related matrices having this property.</description>

      <title>A Concise Course in Galois Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Born from years of teaching undergraduate and graduate algebra courses at Chongqing University, this text is designed to introduce Galois theory while minimizing prerequisites. It seeks to reconnect the abstract machinery of modern algeba: groups, rings, and fields with the historical problem that inspired its creation: determining when a polynomial can be solved by radicals. By anchoring abstract concepts in concrete motivation, we hope to illuminate both the ``how" and the ``why" of algebraic structures.</description>

      <title>A translation of "What is differential geometry: curves and surfaces"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These notes are designed for those who either plan to work in differential geometry, or at least want to have a good reason not to do it. We discuss smooth curves and surfaces -- the main gate to differential geometry. We focus on the techniques that are absolutely essential for further study, keeping it problem-centered, elementary, visual, and virtually rigorous.</description>

      <title>On The Topology of Polygonal Meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11618v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is an introductory and informal exposition on the topology of polygonal meshes. We begin with a broad overview of topological notions and discuss how homeomorphisms, homotopy, and homology can be used to characterise topology. We move on to define polygonal meshes and make a distinction between intrinsic topology and extrinsic topology which depends on the space in which the mesh is immersed. A distinction is also made between quantitative topological properties and qualitative properties. Next, we outline proofs of the Euler and the Euler-Poincar\'e formulas. The Betti numbers are then defined in terms of the Euler-Poincar\'e formula and other mesh statistics rather than as cardinalities of the homology groups which allows us to avoid abstract algebra. Finally, we discuss how it is possible to cut a polygonal mesh such that it becomes a topological disc.</description>

      <title>Mathematics in the liturgical books of the Catholic Church: phases of the ecclesiastical moon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use contemporary mathematical notation to describe the method for determining the age of the ecclesiastical moon as mandated by pope Gregory XIII and elaborated in the book of Christopher Clavius \emph{Romani calendarii explicatio}. The algorithm is first introduced by using the tabular method employed by liturgical books such as the Roman Missal, Breviary and Martyrology. Then we construct the recurrence equation for the epacts, derive its solution, and give a simple expression for the age of the moon on a given day of the year. We also consider the problems which can occur at the transition from December 31 to January 1 of the next year, when there could be a ``jump'' in moon's age ("saltus lunae") in years when epact corrections are applied. We propose a simple solution which fixes these problems. A summary of the formulae and listing of the implementation of relevant functions in Python is provided in the last section.</description>
