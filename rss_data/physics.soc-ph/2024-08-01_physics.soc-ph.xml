      <title>Observing network dynamics through sentinel nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental premise of statistical physics is that the particles in a physical system are interchangeable, and hence the state of each specific component is representative of the system as a whole. This assumption breaks down for complex networks, in which nodes may be extremely diverse, and no single component can truly represent the state of the entire system. It seems, therefore, that to observe the dynamics of social, biological or technological networks, one must extract the dynamic states of a large number of nodes -- a task that is often practically prohibitive. To overcome this challenge, we use machine learning techniques to detect the network's sentinel nodes, a set of network components whose combined states can help approximate the average dynamics of the entire network. The method allows us to assess the state of a large complex system by tracking just a small number of carefully selected nodes. The resulting sentinel node set offers a natural probe by which to practically observe complex network dynamics.</description>

      <title>The iterative persuasion-polarization opinion dynamics and its mean-field analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Iterative Persuasion-Polarization (IPP) model to study the dynamics of opinion formation and change within a population. The IPP model integrates mechanisms of persuasion and repulsion, where individuals influence each other through interactions that can either align opinions incrementally or lead to greater divergence. The probability of each interaction type is governed by a parameter $\alpha$, representing the population's receptiveness to persuasion. We investigate how these interaction dynamics shape the long-term distribution of opinions, examining conditions that promote consensus or polarization. By deriving a system of nonlinear and autonomous ordinary differential equations (ODEs), we provide a rigorous mathematical framework for analyzing the distributional behavior of opinions in large populations. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of social influence dynamics and their implications in complex social systems.</description>

      <title>Future Directions in Human Mobility Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a brief review of human mobility science and present three key areas where we expect to see substantial advancements. We start from the mind and discuss the need to better understand how spatial cognition shapes mobility patterns. We then move to societies and argue the importance of better understanding new forms of transportation. We conclude by discussing how algorithms shape mobility behaviour and provide useful tools for modellers. Finally, we discuss how progress in these research directions may help us address some of the challenges our society faces today.</description>

      <title>Multiway Alignment of Political Attitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The related concepts of partisan belief systems, issue alignment, and partisan sorting are central to our understanding of politics. These phenomena have been studied using measures of alignment between pairs of topics, or how much individuals' attitudes toward a topic reveal about their attitudes toward another topic. We introduce a higher-order measure that extends the assessment of alignment beyond pairs of topics by quantifying the amount of information individuals' opinions on one topic reveal about a set of topics simultaneously. Our multiway alignment measure indicates how much individuals' opinions on multiple topics align into a single ideological divide. Applying this approach to legislative voting behavior reveals that parliamentary systems typically exhibit similar multiway alignment characteristics, but can change in response to shifting intergroup dynamics. In American National Election Studies surveys, our approach reveals a growing significance of party identification together with a consistent rise in multiway alignment over time. Similarly, the growing multiway alignment among topical issues in Finnish online discussions suggests a trend towards a more ideologically driven political landscape. Our case studies demonstrate that the multiway alignment measure is a versatile tool for understanding societal polarization and partisan belief systems across diverse domains.</description>

      <title>A causal intervention framework for synthesizing mobility data and evaluating predictive neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11749v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep neural networks are increasingly utilized in mobility prediction tasks, yet their intricate internal workings pose challenges for interpretability, especially in comprehending how various aspects of mobility behavior affect predictions. This study introduces a causal intervention framework to assess the impact of mobility-related factors on neural networks designed for next location prediction -- a task focusing on predicting the immediate next location of an individual. To achieve this, we employ individual mobility models to synthesize location visit sequences and control behavior dynamics by intervening in their data generation process. We evaluate the interventional location sequences using mobility metrics and input them into well-trained networks to analyze performance variations. The results demonstrate the effectiveness in producing location sequences with distinct mobility behaviors, thereby facilitating the simulation of diverse yet realistic spatial and temporal changes. These changes result in performance fluctuations in next location prediction networks, revealing impacts of critical mobility behavior factors, including sequential patterns in location transitions, proclivity for exploring new locations, and preferences in location choices at population and individual levels. The gained insights hold value for the real-world application of mobility prediction networks, and the framework is expected to promote the use of causal inference to enhance the interpretability and robustness of neural networks in mobility applications.</description>

      <title>Exploring the space of graphs with fixed discrete curvatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18203v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discrete curvatures are quantities associated to the nodes and edges of a graph that reflect the local geometry around them. These curvatures have a rich mathematical theory and they have recently found success as a tool to analyze networks across a wide range of domains. In this work, we consider the problem of constructing graphs with a prescribed set of discrete edge curvatures, and explore the space of such graphs. We address this problem in two ways: first, we develop an evolutionary algorithm to sample graphs with discrete curvatures close to a given set. We use this algorithm to explore how other network statistics vary when constrained by the discrete curvatures in the network. Second, we solve the exact reconstruction problem for the specific case of Forman-Ricci curvature. By leveraging the theory of Markov bases, we obtain a finite set of rewiring moves that connects the space of all graphs with a fixed discrete curvature.</description>

      <title>A Mathematical Model for Co-infection Dynamics of Pneumocystis Pneumonia and HIV/AIDS with Treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.04407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The control of opportunistic infections among HIV infected individuals should be one of the major public health concerns in reducing mortality rate of individuals living with HIV/AIDS. In this study a deterministic co-infection mathematical model is employed to provide a quantification of treatment at each contagious stage against Pneumocystis Pneumonia (PCP) among HIV infected individuals on ART. The disease-free equilibrium for the HIV/AIDS sub model, PCP sub model and the co-infection model are shown to be locally asymptotically stable when their associated disease threshold parameter is less than a unity. By use of suitable Lyapunov functions, the endemic equilibrium corresponding to HIV/AIDS and PCP sub models are globally asymptotically stable whenever $\mathcal{R}_{0H}&gt;1$ and $\mathcal{R}_{0P}&gt;1$ respectively. The sensitivity analysis results implicate that the effective contact rates are the main mechanisms fueling the proliferation of the two diseases and on the other hand treatment efforts play an important role in reducing the incidence. Numerical simulations show that treatment of PCP at all contagious stages reduces its burden on HIV/AIDS patients and dual treatment of the co-infected individuals significantly reduces the burden of the co-infection.</description>
