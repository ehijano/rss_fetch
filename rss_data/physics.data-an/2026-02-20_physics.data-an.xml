      <title>Distillation and Interpretability of Ensemble Forecasts of ENSO Phase using Entropic Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a distillation framework for an ensemble of entropy-optimal Sparse Probabilistic Approximation (eSPA) models, trained exclusively on satellite-era observational and reanalysis data to predict ENSO phase up to 24 months in advance. While eSPA ensembles yield state-of-the-art forecast skill, they are harder to interpret than individual eSPA models. We show how to compress the ensemble into a compact set of "distilled" models by aggregating the structure of only those ensemble members that make correct predictions. This process yields a single, diagnostically tractable model for each forecast lead time that preserves forecast performance while also enabling diagnostics that are impractical to implement on the full ensemble.
  An analysis of the regime persistence of the distilled model "superclusters", as well as cross-lead clustering consistency, shows that the discretised system accurately captures the spatiotemporal dynamics of ENSO. By considering the effective dimension of the feature importance vectors, the complexity of the input space required for correct ENSO phase prediction is shown to peak when forecasts must cross the boreal spring predictability barrier. Spatial importance maps derived from the feature importance vectors are introduced to identify where predictive information resides in each field and are shown to include known physical precursors at certain lead times. Case studies of key events are also presented, showing how fields reconstructed from distilled model centroids trace the evolution from extratropical and inter-basin precursors to the mature ENSO state. Overall, the distillation framework enables a rigorous investigation of long-range ENSO predictability that complements real-time data-driven operational forecasts.</description>

      <title>Data-driven sequential analysis of tipping in high-dimensional complex systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Abrupt transitions ("tipping") in nonlinear dynamical systems are often accompanied by changes in the geometry of the attracting set, but quantifying such changes from partial and noisy observations in high-dimensional systems remains challenging. We address this problem with a sequential diagnostic framework, Data Assimilation-High dimensional Attractor's Structural Complexity (DA-HASC). First, this method reconstructs system's high-dimensional state using data assimilation from limited and noisy observations. Second, we quantify a structural complexity of the high-dimensional system dynamics from the reconstructed state by manifold learning. Third, we capture underlying changes in the system by splitting the reconstructed timeseries into sliding windows and analyzing the changes in the temporally local attractor's structural complexity. The structural information is provided as graph Laplacian and measured by Von Neumann entropy in this framework. We evaluate DA-HASC on both synthetic and real-world datasets and demonstrate that it can detect tipping under high-dimensionality and imperfect system knowledge. We further discuss how this framework behaves across different tipping mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Wide-Surface Furnace for In Situ X-Ray Diffraction of Combinatorial Samples using a High-Throughput Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The combinatorial approach applied to functional oxides has enabled the production of material libraries that formally contain infinite compositions. A complete ternary diagram can be obtained by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) on 100 mm silicon wafers. However, interest in such materials libraries is only meaningful if high-throughput characterization enables the information extraction from the as-deposited library in a reasonable time. While much commercial equipment allows for XY-resolved characterization at room temperature, very few sample holders have been made available to investigate structural, chemical, and functional properties at high temperatures in controlled atmospheres. In the present work, we present a furnace that enables the study of 100 mm wafers as a function of temperature. This furnace has a dome to control the atmosphere, typically varying from nitrogen gas to pure oxygen atmosphere with external control. We present the design of such a furnace and an example of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and fluorescence (XRF) measurements performed at the DiffAbs beamline of the SOLEIL synchrotron. We apply this high-throughput approach to a combinatorial library up to 735 {\textdegree}C in nitrogen and calculate the thermal expansion coefficients (TEC) of the ternary system using custom-made MATLAB codes. The TEC analysis revealed the potential limitations of Vegard's law in predicting lattice variations for high-entropy materials.</description>

      <title>Lepton energy scale and resolution corrections based on the minimization of an analytical likelihood: IJazZ2.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel method to determine lepton energy scale and resolution corrections by means of an analytical likelihood maximization applied to Drell-Yan $Z \to \ell\ell$ events. The approach relies on an exact analytical treatment of the energy smearing, avoiding random-number-based convolution techniques. This formulation results in a fully differentiable likelihood enabling the use of automatic differentiation algorithms, and thus a substantial reduction in computational cost. The method, implemented in the \ijazz software, allows the simultaneous extraction of scale and resolution parameters across multiple lepton categories defined by detector or kinematic variables. We validate the technique using toy Monte Carlo studies and realistic Pythia-based simulations, demonstrating unbiased parameter recovery and accurate uncertainty estimates. Particular attention is given to categorizations involving lepton transverse momentum, for which a relative-$p_T$ strategy is introduced to mitigate biases induced by category migration and kinematic correlations. The method is further adapted to photon-energy scale measurement in $Z \to \mu^-\mu^+\gamma$ decays. Compared to conventional approaches, the analytical method improves numerical stability, robustness of the minimization, and computational performance, making it well suited for large-scale precision calibration tasks at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Detecting nonequilibrium phase transitions via continuous monitoring of space-time trajectories and autoencoder-based clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The characterization of collective behavior and nonequilibrium phase transitions in quantum systems is typically rooted in the analysis of suitable system observables, so-called order parameters. These observables might not be known a priori, but they may in principle be identified through analyzing the quantum state of the system. Experimentally, this can be particularly demanding as estimating quantum states and expectation values of quantum observables requires a large number of projective measurements. However, open quantum systems can be probed in situ by monitoring their output, e.g. via heterodyne-detection or photon-counting experiments, which provide space-time resolved information about their dynamics. Building on this, we present a machine-learning approach to detect nonequilibrium phase transitions from the measurement time-records of continuously-monitored quantum systems. We benchmark our method using the quantum contact process, a model featuring an absorbing-state phase transition, which constitutes a particularly challenging test case for the quantum simulation of nonequilibrium processes.</description>

      <title>GollumFit: An IceCube Open-Source Framework for Binned-Likelihood Neutrino Telescope Analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04491v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present GollumFit, a framework designed for performing binned-likelihood analyses on neutrino telescope data. GollumFit incorporates model parameters common to any neutrino telescope and also model parameters specific to the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. We provide a high-level overview of its key features and how the code is organized. We then discuss the performance of the fitting in a typical analysis scenario, highlighting the ability to fit over tens of nuisance parameters. We present some examples showing how to use the package for likelihood minimization tasks. This framework uniquely incorporates the particular model parameters necessary for neutrino telescopes, and solves an associated likelihood problem in a time-efficient manner.</description>

      <title>Impact of Geant4's Electromagnetic Physics Constructors on Accuracy and Performance of Simulations for Rare Event Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14788v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A primary objective in contemporary low background physics is the search for rare and novel phenomena beyond the Standard Model of particle physics, e.g. the scattering off of a potential Dark Matter particle or the neutrinoless double beta decay. The success of such searches depends on a reliable background prediction via Monte Carlo simulations. A widely used toolkit to construct these simulations is Geant4, which offers the user a wide choice of how to implement the physics of particle interactions. For example, for electromagnetic interactions, Geant4 provides pre-defined sets of implementations: physics constructors. As decay products of radioactive contaminants contribute to the background mainly via electromagnetic interactions, the physics constructor used in a Geant4 simulation may have an impact on the total energy deposition inside the detector target. To facilitate the selection of physics constructors for simulations of experiments that are using CaWO$_4$ and Ge targets, we quantify their impact on the total energy deposition for several test cases. These cases consist of radioactive contaminants commonly encountered, covering energy depositions via $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$ particles, as well as two examples for the target thickness: thin and bulky. We also consider the computing performance of the studied physics constructors.</description>
