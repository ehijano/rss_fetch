      <title>Tail probability of maximal displacement in critical and subcritical branching stable processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study critical and subcritical branching $\alpha$-stable processes, $\alpha \in (0, 2)$. We obtain the exact asymptotic behaviors of the tails of the maximal positions of all subcritical branching $\alpha$-stable processes with positive jumps. In the case of subcritical branching spectrally negative $\alpha$-stable processes, we obtain the exact asymptotic behaviors of the tails of the maximal positions under the assumption that the offspring distributions satisfy the $L\log L$ condition. For critical branching $\alpha$-stable processes, we obtain the exact asymptotic behaviors of the tails under the assumption that the offspring distributions belong to the domain of attraction of a $\gamma$-distribution, $\gamma\in (1, 2]$.</description>

      <title>Improper Poisson integral of the sinc function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A formal sum $\sum_n f(S_n)$ may be seen as the integral $\int f dN$ with respect to random point process $N(A)=|\{n:S_n\in A\}|$. We study its convergence beyond the well known context of Lebesgue integrable functions, admitting nonintegrable functions whose improper Riemann-Lebesgue integrals exist. We focus on the sinc function and some of its relations leaving the general case to conjectures.</description>

      <title>The stochastic Navier-Stokes equations with general $L^{3}$ data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the stochastic Navier-Stokes equations with multiplicative noise with critical initial data. Assuming that the initial data $u_0$ belongs to the critical space $L^{3}$ almost surely, we construct a unique local-in-time probabilistically strong solution. We also prove an analogous result for data in the critical space~$H^\frac{1}{2}$.</description>

      <title>Cutoff for East models at high temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the East model in $\mathbb Z^d$, an example of a kinetically constrained interacting particle system with oriented constraints, together with one of its natural variant. Under any ergodic boundary condition it is known that the mixing time of the chain in a box of side $L$ is $\Theta(L)$ for any $d\ge 1$. Moreover, with minimal boundary conditions and at low temperature, i.e. low equilibrium density of the facilitating vertices, the chain exhibits cutoff around the mixing time of the $d=1$ case. Here we extend this result to high temperature. As in the low temperature case, the key tool is to prove that the speed of infection propagation in the $(1,1,\dots,1)$ direction is larger than $d$ $\times$ the same speed along a coordinate direction. By borrowing a technique from first passage percolation, the proof links the result to the precise value of the critical probability of oriented (bond or site) percolation in $\mathbb Z^d$.</description>

Abstract: We study the $k$:th raw moment of a variable $R$ following the binomial distribution $\text{B}(n, p)$, where $n/k \rightarrow \beta &gt; 0$. It is known that $\mathbb{E}(R^k)$ is bounded both from below and from above by functions of the form $k^k \Psi^k$. We solve the asymptotically optimal value of $\Psi$ as a function of $p$ and $\beta$.</description>

      <title>Singularity and regularity of the critical 2D Stochastic Heat Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Critical 2D Stochastic Heat Flow (SHF) provides a natural candidate solution to the ill-posed 2D Stochastic Heat Equation with multiplicative space-time white noise. In this paper, we initiate the investigation of the spatial properties of the SHF. We prove that, as a random measure on $\mathbb{R}^2$, it is a.s. singular w.r.t. the Lebesgue measure. This is obtained by probing a "quasi-critical" regime and showing the asymptotic log-normality of the mass assigned to vanishing balls, as the disorder strength is sent to zero at a suitable rate, accompanied by similar results for critical 2D directed polymers. We also describe the regularity of the SHF, showing that it is a.s. H\"older $C^{-\epsilon}$ for any $\epsilon&gt;0$, implying the absence of atoms, and we establish local convergence to zero in the long time limit.</description>

      <title>Stochastic numerical approximation for nonlinear Fokker-Planck equations with singular kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the convergence rate of the Euler-Maruyama scheme for systems of interacting particles used to approximate solutions of nonlinear Fokker-Planck equations with singular interaction kernels, such as the Keller-Segel model. We derive explicit error estimates in the large-particle limit for two objects: the empirical measure of the interacting particle system and the density distribution of a single particle. Specifically, under certain assumptions on the interaction kernel and initial conditions, we show that the convergence rate of both objects towards solutions of the corresponding nonlinear FokkerPlanck equation depends polynomially on N (the number of particles) and on h (the discretization step). The analysis shows that the scheme converges despite singularities in the drift term. To the best of our knowledge, there are no existing results in the literature of such kind for the singular kernels considered in this work.</description>

      <title>Functional It\^o-formula and Taylor expansions for non-anticipative maps of c\`adl\`ag rough paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a functional It\^o-formula for non-anticipative maps of rough paths, based on the approximation properties of the signature of c\`adl\`ag rough paths. This result is a functional extension of the It\^o-formula for c\`adl\`ag rough paths (by Friz and Zhang (2018)), which coincides with the change of variable formula formulated by Dupire (2009) whenever the functionals' representations, the notions of regularity, and the integration concepts can be matched. Unlike these previous works, we treat the vertical (jump) pertubation via the Marcus transformation, which allows for incorporating path functionals where the second order vertical derivatives do not commute, as is the case for typical signature functionals. As a byproduct, we show that sufficiently regular non-anticipative maps admit a functional Taylor expansion in terms of the path's signature, leading to an important generalization of the recent results by Dupire and Tissot-Daguette (2022).</description>

      <title>Monotonicity of functionals associated to product measures via their Fourier transform and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mu$ be a probability measure on $\mathbb{R}$. We give conditions on the Fourier transform of its density for functionals of the form $H(a)=\int_{\mathbb{R}^n}h(\langle a,x\rangle)\mu^n(dx)$ to be Schur monotone. As applications, we put certain known and new results under the same umbrella, given by a condition on the Fourier transform of the density. These results include certain moment comparisons for independent and identically distributed random vectors, when the norm is given by intersection bodies, and the corresponding vector Khinchin inequalities. We also extend the discussion to higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Critical Slowing Down in Bifurcating Stochastic Partial Differential Equations with Red Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phenomenon of critical slowing down (CSD) has played a key role in the search for reliable precursors of catastrophic regime shifts. This is caused by its presence in a generic class of bifurcating dynamical systems. Simple time-series statistics such as variance or autocorrelation can be taken as proxies for the phenomenon, making their increase a useful early warning signal (EWS) for catastrophic regime shifts. However, the modelling basis justifying the use of these EWSs is usually a finite-dimensional stochastic ordinary differential equation, where a mathematical proof for the aptness is possible. Only recently has the phenomenon of CSD been proven to exist in infinite-dimensional stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs), which are more appropriate to model real-world spatial systems. In this context, we provide an essential extension of the results for SPDEs under a specific noise forcing, often referred to as red noise. This type of time-correlated noise is omnipresent in many physical systems, such as climate and ecology. We approach the question with a mathematical proof and a numerical analysis for the linearised problem. We find that also under red noise forcing, the aptness of EWSs persists, supporting their employment in a wide range of applications. However, we also find that false or muted warnings are possible if the noise correlations are non-stationary. We thereby extend a previously known complication with respect to red noise and EWSs from finite-dimensional dynamics to the more complex and realistic setting of SPDEs.</description>

      <title>Up-to-constants estimates on four-arm events for simple conformal loop ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove up-to-constants estimates for a general class of four-arm events in simple conformal loop ensembles, i.e. CLE$_\kappa$ for $\kappa\in (8/3,4]$. The four-arm events that we consider can be created by either one or two loops, with no constraint on the topology of the crossings. Our result is a key input in our series of works arxiv:2409.16230 and arxiv:2409.16273 on percolation of the two-sided level sets in the discrete Gaussian free field (and level sets in the occupation field of the random walk loop soup).
  In order to get rid of all constraints on the topology of the crossings, we rely on the Brownian loop-soup representation of simple CLE [Ann. Math. 176 (2012) 1827-1917], and a "cluster version" of a separation lemma for the Brownian loop soup. As a corollary, we also obtain up-to-constants estimates for a general version of four-arm events for SLE$_\kappa$ for $\kappa\in (8/3,4]$. This fixes (in the case of four arms and $\kappa\in(8/3,4]$) an essential gap in [Ann. Probab. 46 (2018) 2863-2907] and improves some estimates therein.</description>

      <title>Infinite Boundary Friction Limit for Weak Solutions of the Stochastic Navier-Stokes Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address convergence of the unique weak solutions of the 2D stochastic Navier-Stokes equations with Navier boundary conditions, as the boundary friction is taken uniformly to infinity, to the unique weak solution under the no-slip condition. Our result is that for initial velocity in $L^2_x$, the convergence holds in probability in $C_tW^{-\varepsilon,2}_x \cap L^2_tL^2_x$ for any $0 &lt; \varepsilon$. The noise is of transport-stretching type, although the theorem holds with other transport, multiplicative and additive noise structures. This seems to be the first work concerning the large boundary friction limit with noise, and convergence for weak solutions, due to only $L^2_{x}$ initial data, appears new even deterministically.</description>

      <title>Fractal and Regular Geometry of Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the geometric properties of random neural networks by investigating the boundary volumes of their excursion sets for different activation functions, as the depth increases. More specifically, we show that, for activations which are not very regular (e.g., the Heaviside step function), the boundary volumes exhibit fractal behavior, with their Hausdorff dimension monotonically increasing with the depth. On the other hand, for activations which are more regular (e.g., ReLU, logistic and $\tanh$), as the depth increases, the expected boundary volumes can either converge to zero, remain constant or diverge exponentially, depending on a single spectral parameter which can be easily computed. Our theoretical results are confirmed in some numerical experiments based on Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>First-passage properties of the jump process with a drift. Two exactly solvable cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the first-passage properties of a jump process with a constant drift, focusing on two key observables: the first-passage time $\tau$ and the number of jumps $n$ before the first-passage event. By mapping the problem onto an effective discrete-time random walk, we derive an exact expression for the Laplace transform of the joint distribution of $\tau$ and $n$ using the generalized Pollaczek-Spitzer formula. This result is then used to analyze the first-passage properties for two exactly solvable cases: (i) both the inter-jump intervals and jump amplitudes are exponentially distributed, and (ii) the inter-jump intervals are exponentially distributed while all jumps have the same fixed amplitude. We show the existence of two distinct regimes governed by the strength of the drift: (i) a survival regime, where the process remains positive indefinitely with finite probability; (ii) an absorption regime, where the first-passage eventually occurs; and (iii) a critical point at the boundary between these two phases. We characterize the asymptotic behavior of survival probabilities in each regime: they decay exponentially to a constant in the survival regime, vanish exponentially fast in the absorption regime, and exhibit power-law decay at the critical point. Furthermore, in the absorption regime, we derive large deviation forms for the marginal distributions of $\tau$ and n. The analytical predictions are validated through extensive numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Quantum Mechanics and Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that any Euclidean-time quantum mechanical theory may be represented as a neural network, ensured by the Kosambi-Karhunen-Lo\`eve theorem, mean-square path continuity, and finite two-point functions. The additional constraint of reflection positivity, which is related to unitarity, may be achieved by a number of mechanisms, such as imposing neural network parameter space splitting or the Markov property. Non-differentiability of the networks is related to the appearance of non-trivial commutators. Neural networks acting on Markov processes are no longer Markov, but still reflection positive, which facilitates the definition of deep neural network quantum systems. We illustrate these principles in several examples using numerical implementations, recovering classic quantum mechanical results such as Heisenberg uncertainty, non-trivial commutators, and the spectrum.</description>

      <title>A Method for Generating Connected Erdos-Renyi Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel and exact algorithm for generating connected Erdos-Renyi random graphs $G(n, p)$. Our approach exploits a link between the distribution of exploration process trajectories and an inhomogeneous random walk. In contrast to existing methods, our approach guarantees the correct distribution under the connectivity condition and achieves $O(n^2)$ runtime in the sparse case $p = c/n$. Furthermore, we show that our method can be extended to uniformly generate connected graphs $G(n, m)$ via an acceptance-rejection procedure.</description>

      <title>On the last zero process with an application in corporate bankruptcy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2003.06871v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a spectrally negative L\'evy process $X$, consider $g_t$, the last time $X$ is below the level zero before time $t\geq 0$. We use a perturbation method for L\'evy processes to derive an It\^o formula for the three-dimensional process $\{(g_t,t, X_t), t\geq 0 \}$ and its infinitesimal generator. Moreover, with $U_t:=t-g_t$, the length of a current positive excursion, we derive a general formula that allows us to calculate a functional of the whole path of $ (U, X)=\{(U_t, X_t),t\geq 0\}$ in terms of the positive and negative excursions of the process $X$. As a corollary, we find the joint Laplace transform of $(U_{\mathbf{e}_q}, X_{\mathbf{e}_q})$, where $\mathbf{e}_q$ is an independent exponential time, and the q-potential measure of the process $(U, X)$. Furthermore, using the results mentioned above, we find a solution to a general optimal stopping problem depending on $(U, X)$ with an application in corporate bankruptcy. Lastly, we establish a link between the optimal prediction of $g_{\infty}$ and optimal stopping problems in terms of $(U, X)$ as per Baurdoux and Pedraza (2024).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.01635v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Gaussian measure whose covariance is related to the Anderson Hamiltonian operator, proving that it admits a regular coupling to the (standard) Gaussian free field exploiting the stochastic optimal control formulation of Gibbs measures. Using this coupling, we define the renormalized powers of the Anderson free field and we prove that the associated quartic Gibbs measure is invariant under the flow of a nonlinear wave equation with renormalized cubic nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Normal approximation for exponential random graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The question of whether the central limit theorem (CLT) holds for the total number of edges in exponential random graph models (ERGMs) in the subcritical region of parameters has remained an open problem. In this paper, we establish the CLT. As a result of our proof, we also derive a convergence rate for the CLT, an explicit formula for the asymptotic variance, and the CLT for general subgraph counts. To establish our main result, we develop Stein's method for the normal approximation of general functionals of nonlinear exponential families of random variables, which is of independent interest. In addition to ERGMs, our general theorem can also be applied to other models. A key ingredient needed in our proof for the ERGM is a higher-order concentration inequality, which was known in a subset of the subcritical region called Dobrushin's uniqueness region. We use Stein's method to partially generalize such inequalities to the subcritical region.</description>

      <title>Disorder Chaos in Short-Range, Diluted, and L\'evy Spin Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09409v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent breakthrough [arXiv:2301.04112], Chatterjee proved site disorder chaos in the Edwards-Anderson (EA) short-range spin glass model utilizing the Hermite spectral method. In this paper, we demonstrate the further usefulness of this Hermite spectral approach by extending the validity of site disorder chaos in three related spin glass models.
  The first, called the mixed even $p$-spin short-range model, is a generalization of the EA model where the underlying graph is a deterministic bounded degree hypergraph consisting of hyperedges with even number of vertices. The second model is the diluted mixed $p$-spin model, which is allowed to have hyperedges with both odd and even number of vertices. For both models, our results hold under general symmetric disorder distributions. The main novelty of our argument is played by an elementary algebraic equation for the Fourier-Hermite series coefficients for the two-spin correlation functions. It allows us to deduce necessary geometric conditions to determine the contributing coefficients in the overlap function, which in spirit is the same as the crucial Lemma 1 in [arXiv:2301.04112]. Finally, we also establish disorder chaos in the L\'evy model with stable index $\alpha \in (1, 2)$.</description>

      <title>Genealogical processes of sequential Monte Carlo methods and other non-neutral population models under rapid mutation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that genealogical trees arising from a broad class of non-neutral models of population evolution converge to the Kingman coalescent under a suitable rescaling of time. As well as non-neutral biological evolution, our results apply to genetic algorithms encompassing the prominent class of sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods. The time rescaling we need differs slightly from that used in classical results for convergence to the Kingman coalescent, which has implications for the performance of different resampling schemes in SMC algorithms. In addition, our work substantially simplifies earlier proofs of convergence to the Kingman coalescent, and corrects an error common to several earlier results.</description>

      <title>Central limit theorems for linear spectral statistics of inhomogeneous random graphs with graphon limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish central limit theorems (CLTs) for the linear spectral statistics of the adjacency matrix of inhomogeneous random graphs across all sparsity regimes, providing explicit covariance formulas under the assumption that the variance profile of the random graphs converges to a graphon limit. Two types of CLTs are derived for the (non-centered) adjacency matrix and the centered adjacency matrix, with different scaling factors when the sparsity parameter $p$ satisfies $np = n^{\Omega(1)}$, and with the same scaling factor when $np = n^{o(1)}$. In both cases, the limiting covariance is expressed in terms of homomorphism densities from certain types of finite graphs to a graphon. These results highlight a phase transition in the centering effect for global eigenvalue fluctuations. For the non-centered adjacency matrix, we also identify new phase transitions for the CLTs in the sparse regime when $n^{1/m} \ll np \ll n^{1/(m-1)}$ for $m \geq 2$. Furthermore, weaker conditions for the graphon convergence of the variance profile are sufficient as $p$ decreases from being constant to $np \to c\in (0,\infty)$. These findings reveal a novel connection between graphon limits and linear spectral statistics in random matrix theory.</description>

Abstract: We study the Macroscopic Hausdorff dimension of the upper and lower level sets of the Airy processes, following the general method developed in Khoshnevisan et al. \cite{KKX17}. For the Airy$_1$ process, the approach to macroscopic Hausdorff dimension of level sets hinges on some inequalities for its joint probabilities, while for the Airy$_2$ process, we make use of some quantitative estimates on the tail probabilities of its maximum and minimum over an interval.</description>

      <title>Modularity of preferential attachment graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06771v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the preferential attachment model $G_n^h$. A graph $G_n^h$ is generated from a finite initial graph by adding new vertices one at a time. Each new vertex connects to $h\ge 1$ already existing vertices, and these are chosen with probability proportional to their current degrees. We are particularly interested in the community structure of $G_n^h$, which is expressed in terms of the so-called modularity. We prove that the modularity of $G_n^h$ is with high probability upper bounded by a function that tends to $0$ as $h$ tends to infinity. This resolves the conjecture of Prokhorenkova, Pralat, and Raigorodskii from 2016.
  As a byproduct, we obtain novel concentration results (which are interesting in their own right) for the volume and edge density parameters of vertex subsets of $G_n^h$. The key ingredient here is the definition of the function $\mu$, which serves as a natural measure for vertex subsets, and is proportional to the average size of their volumes. This extends previous results on the topic by Frieze, Pralat, P\'erez-Gim\'enez, and Reiniger from 2019.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of multiple extremal integrals as an extension of single extremal integrals, which have played important roles in extreme value theory. The multiple extremal integrals are formulated in terms of a product-form random sup measure derived from the $\alpha$-Fr\'{e}chet random sup measure. We establish a LePage-type representation similar to that used for multiple sum-stable integrals, which have been extensively studied in the literature. This approach allows us to investigate the integrability, tail behavior, and independence properties of multiple extremal integrals. Additionally, we discuss an extension of a recently proposed stationary model that exhibits an unusual extremal clustering phenomenon, now constructed using multiple extremal integrals.</description>

      <title>A Lagrangian approach to totally dissipative evolutions in Wasserstein spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.05211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study the class of totally dissipative multivalued probability vector fields (MPVF) $\boldsymbol{\mathrm F}$ on the Wasserstein space $(\mathcal{P}_2(\mathsf{X}),W_2)$ of Euclidean or Hilbertian probability measures. We show that such class of MPVFs is in one to one correspondence with law-invariant dissipative operators in a Hilbert space $L^2(\Omega,\mathcal{B},\mathbb{P};\mathsf{X})$ of random variables, preserving a natural maximality property. This allows us to import in the Wasserstein framework many of the powerful tools from the theory of maximal dissipative operators in Hilbert spaces, deriving existence, uniqueness, stability, and approximation results for the flow generated by a maximal totally dissipative MPVF and the equivalence of its Eulerian and Lagrangian characterizations. We will show that demicontinuous single-valued probability vector fields satisfying a metric dissipativity condition are in fact totally dissipative. Starting from a sufficiently rich set of discrete measures, we will also show how to recover a unique maximal totally dissipative version of a MPVF, proving that its flow provides a general mean field characterization of the asymptotic limits of the corresponding family of discrete particle systems.Such an approach also reveals new interesting structural properties for gradient flows of displacement convex functionals with a core of discrete measures dense in energy.</description>

      <title>Random harmonic maps into spheres</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $S$ be a punctured Riemann surface with Euler characteristic $\chi(S)&lt;0$. For any unitary representation $\rho: \pi_1(S) \to U(N)$, we introduce its renormalized energy and its harmonic representatives, which are equivariant harmonic maps from the universal cover of $S$ to the unit sphere in $\mathbb{C}^N$. Our main result is that if a sequence of unitary representations $\rho_j$ strongly converges, then their renormalized energies converge to $\frac{\pi}{4}|\chi(S)|$ and the shape of their harmonic representatives converges to a unique rescaled hyperbolic metric. Combining this statement with examples of strongly converging representations provided by random matrix theory, we derive the following applications.
  (1) If $\pi_1(S)$ is a free group, then for a random $\rho: \pi_1(S) \to U(N)$, the shape of its harmonic representatives concentrates around a rescaled hyperbolic metric with high probability as $N\to \infty$.
  (2) For any closed hyperbolic surface, a finite covering admits a harmonic immersion into some Euclidean unit sphere, which is almost isometric after rescaling.
  (3) There are closed, branched, minimal surfaces $\mathfrak{S}_j$ in some Euclidean unit spheres such that $\mathfrak{S}_j$ Benjamini-Schramm converges to a rescaled hyperbolic plane as $j\to \infty$, and the Gaussian curvature $K_j$ of $\mathfrak{S}_j$ satisfies $\lim_{j\to \infty} \frac{1}{\mathrm{Area}(\mathfrak{S}_j)}\int_{\mathfrak{S}_j} |K_j+8|=0.$</description>

      <title>A spectral mixture representation of isotropic kernels to generalize random Fourier features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02770v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rahimi and Recht (2007) introduced the idea of decomposing positive definite shift-invariant kernels by randomly sampling from their spectral distribution. This famous technique, known as Random Fourier Features (RFF), is in principle applicable to any such kernel whose spectral distribution can be identified and simulated. In practice, however, it is usually applied to the Gaussian kernel because of its simplicity, since its spectral distribution is also Gaussian. Clearly, simple spectral sampling formulas would be desirable for broader classes of kernels. In this paper, we show that the spectral distribution of positive definite isotropic kernels in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ for all $d\geq1$ can be decomposed as a scale mixture of $\alpha$-stable random vectors, and we identify the mixing distribution as a function of the kernel. This constructive decomposition provides a simple and ready-to-use spectral sampling formula for many multivariate positive definite shift-invariant kernels, including exponential power kernels, generalized Mat\'ern kernels, generalized Cauchy kernels, as well as newly introduced kernels such as the Beta, Kummer, and Tricomi kernels. In particular, we retrieve the fact that the spectral distributions of these kernels are scale mixtures of the multivariate Gaussian distribution, along with an explicit mixing distribution formula. This result has broad applications for support vector machines, kernel ridge regression, Gaussian processes, and other kernel-based machine learning techniques for which the random Fourier features technique is applicable.</description>
