      <title>Evaluating the Impact of Detector Design on Jet Flavor Tagging for Future Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jet flavor tagging is of utmost importance for unlocking the full physics potential of any future collider experiment. The performance of any jet flavor identification algorithm depends both on its underlying architecture and on the detector's design and capabilities. In this work, we present an analysis of the dependence of jet tagging algorithm performance on three detector designs being considered for future $e^{+}e^{-}$ colliders. To fully exploit the potential of these detector concepts, we utilize a graph neural network-based jet tagging algorithm. In addition, we evaluate the impact on the jet tagging performance of variations in the tracking and calorimeter systems for one of these detector concepts, the SiD detector, as well as the dependence on the center-of-mass energy.</description>

      <title>The ATLASPix3.1 CMOS Pixel Sensor Testbeam Performance and Serial Powering Characterisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-voltage CMOS (HV-CMOS) pixel technology is being considered for future Higgs factory experiments. The ATLASPix3.1 chip, with a pitch of 50$\mu m$ x 150$\mu m$, fabricated using TSI 180nm HV-CMOS technology, is a full reticle-size monolithic HV-CMOS sensor with shunt-low dropout (LDO) regulators that allow serial powering for multiple sensors. A beam test was conducted at DESY using 3-6 GeV electron beams, with chips operated in triggerless readout mode with zero suppression, demonstrating multi-chip capability. This was further evaluated with hadron beams, both with and without the built-in power regulators. This study presents the electrical characterisations of the shunt-LDO regulators for serial powering and test beam results of ATLASPix3.1 sensors.</description>

      <title>Detecting Critical Resonances in Microwave Amplifiers through Noise Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of critical resonances in microwave power amplifiers has a negative impact on its behavior and performance. These critical resonances are usually predicted from pole-zero stability simulations. In this paper, a different and less demanding approach for the circuit designer is proposed. It is based on performing noise simulations of the amplifier and observing the rise in the noise spectrum that happens when the system has low damping poles. Critical resonance detection is simplified since no additional probes have to be inserted in the circuit and no post-processing for pole-zero analysis is required. The technique is applied to two amplifier prototypes fabricated in microstrip hybrid technology and the results are compared with the conventional pole-zero approach.</description>

      <title>A Study of Afterglow Signatures in NaI and CsI Scintillator Modules for the Background and Transient Observer Instrument on COSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present measurements of the afterglow signatures in NaI(Tl) and CsI(Tl) detector modules as part of the Background and Transient Observer (BTO) mission detector trade-study. BTO is a NASA Student Collaboration Project flying on the Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) Small Explorer mission in 2027. The detectors utilized in this study are cylindrical in shape with a height and diameter of 5.1 cm and were read out by silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs). We conducted a radiation campaign at the HIMAC accelerator in Japan where the scintillators were irradiated with a 230 MeV/u helium beam (He beam) and 350 MeV/u carbon beam (C beam). We find that both the CsI and NaI scintillators exhibit afterglow signatures when irradiated with the C and He beams. The CsI crystal exhibits a stronger afterglow intensity with afterglow pulses occurring for an average 2.40 ms for C and 0.9 ms for He after the initial particle pulse. The duration of afterglow pulses in CsI is 8.6x and 5.6x the afterglow signal duration in NaI for C and He (0.28 ms and 0.16 ms, respectively). Although CsI has advantages such as a higher light yield and radiation hardness, the stronger afterglows in the CsI detector increase the complexity of the electronics and lead to a ~7x larger dead time per afterglow event or a ~3x higher energy threshold value. We use the measured dead times to predict the amount of observing time lost to afterglow-inducing events for an instrument like BTO in low Earth orbit. We simulate the background rates in a BTO-like orbit and find a total value of 114 counts/s for the full two-detector system. Based on the particle energies in the HIMAC experiment, we then determine that an event with sufficient energy to produce an afterglow signal occurs once every ~70 s and ~1.4 s in NaI and CsI detectors, respectively. Thus, we conclude that NaI is the better choice for the BTO mission.</description>

      <title>First Axion-Like Particle Results from a Broadband Search for Wave-Like Dark Matter in the 44 to 52 $\mu$eV Range with a Coaxial Dish Antenna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the results from the first axion-like particle search conducted using a dish antenna. The experiment was conducted at room temperature and sensitive to axion-like particles in the $44-52\,\mu\mathrm{eV}$ range ($10.7 - 12.5\,\mathrm{GHz}$). The novel dish antenna geometry was proposed by the BREAD collaboration and previously used to conduct a dark photon search in the same mass range. To allow for axion-like particle sensitivity, the BREAD dish antenna was placed in a $3.9\,\mathrm{T}$ solenoid magnet at Argonne National Laboratory. In the presence of a magnetic field, axion-like dark matter converts to photons at the conductive surface of the reflector. The signal is focused onto a custom coaxial horn antenna and read out with a low-noise radio-frequency receiver. No evidence of axion-like dark matter was observed in this mass range and we place the most stringent laboratory constraints on the axion-photon coupling strength, $g_{a\gamma\gamma}$, in this mass range at 90\% confidence.</description>

      <title>A General Track Fit based on Triplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a general three-dimensional track fit based on hit triplets.
  The general track fit considers spatial hit and multiple Coulomb scattering uncertainties, and can also be extended to include energy losses.
  Input to the fit are detector-specific triplet parameters, which contain information about
  the triplet geometry (hit positions),
  the radiation length of the material and the magnetic field.
  Since the solution is given by an analytical closed-form, it is possible to use the same fitting code for all kind of tracking detectors.
  Fitting formulas are given for the global track fit as well as for the local hit triplets.
  The latter allows filtering out triplets with poor fit quality at an early stage of track reconstruction.
  The construction and fit of local triplets is fully parallelizable, enabling accelerated computation with parallel hardware architectures.
  Formulas for the detector-specific triplet parameters are derived for the two most commonly used field configuration for tracking detectors, namely a uniform solenoidal field and gap spectrometer dipole.
  An algorithm to calculate the triplet parameters for an arbitrary magnetic field configuration is presented too.
  This paper also includes a discussion of inherent track fit biases.
  Furthermore, a new method is proposed to accelerate track fitting by classifying tracking regimes and using optimal fit formulas.</description>

      <title>On the resolution of dual readout calorimeters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15329v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dual readout calorimeters allow state-of-the-art resolutions for hadronic energy measurements. Their various incarnations are leading candidates for the calorimeter systems for future colliders. In this paper, we present a simple formula for the resolution of a dual readout calorimeter, which we verify with a toy simulation and with full simulation results. This formula can help those new to dual readout calorimetry understand its strengths and limitations. The paper also highlights that the dual readout correction works not just to compensate for binding energy loss, but also for energies escaping the calorimeter or clustering algorithm. Formulae are also presented for approximate resolutions and energy scales in terms of different sources of response.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field tunable spectral response of kinetic inductance detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We tune the onset of optical response in aluminium kinetic inductance detectors from a natural cutoff frequency of 90 GHz to 60 GHz by applying an external magnetic field. The change in spectral response is due to the decrease of the superconducting gap, from 90 GHz at zero magnetic field to 60 GHz at a magnetic field of around 3 mT. We characterize the variation of the superconducting gap, the detector frequency shift and the internal quality factor as a function of the applied field. In principle, the magnetic field tunable response could be used to make spectroscopic measurements. In practice, the internal quality factor behaves hysteretically with the magnetic field due to the presence of vortices in the thin superconducting film. We conclude by discussing possible solutions to achieve spectroscopy measurements using kinetic inductance detectors and magnetic field.</description>
