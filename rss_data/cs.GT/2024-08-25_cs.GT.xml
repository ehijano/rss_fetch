      <title>Non-Borda elections under relaxed IIA conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arrow's celebrated Impossibility Theorem asserts that an election rule, or Social Welfare Function (SWF), between three or more candidates meeting a set of strict criteria cannot exist. Maskin suggests that Arrow's conditions for SWFs are too strict. In particular he weakens the "Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives" condition (IIA), which states that if in two elections, each voter's binary preference between candidates $c_i$ and $c_j$ is the same, then the two results must agree on their preference between $c_i$ and $c_j$. Instead, he proposes a modified IIA condition (MIIA). Under this condition, the result between $c_i$ and $c_j$ can be affected not just by the order of $c_i$ and $c_j$ in each voter's ranking, but also the number of candidates between them. More candidates between $c_i$ and $c_j$ communicates some information about the strength of a voter's preference between the two candidates, and Maskin argues that it should be admissible evidence in deciding on a final ranking.
  We construct SWFs for three-party elections which meet the MIIA criterion along with other sensibility criteria, but are far from being Borda elections (where each voter assigns a score to each candidate linearly according to their ranking). On the other hand, we give cases in which any SWF must be the Borda rule.</description>

      <title>Contested Logistics: A Game-Theoretic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Contested Logistics Games, a variant of logistics problems that account for the presence of an adversary that can disrupt the movement of goods in selected areas. We model this as a large two-player zero-sum one-shot game played on a graph representation of the physical world, with the optimal logistics plans described by the (possibly randomized) Nash equilibria of this game. Our logistics model is fairly sophisticated, and is able to handle multiple modes of transport and goods, accounting for possible storage of goods in warehouses, as well as Leontief utilities based on demand satisfied. We prove computational hardness results related to equilibrium finding and propose a practical double-oracle solver based on solving a series of best-response mixed-integer linear programs. We experiment on both synthetic and real-world maps, demonstrating that our proposed method scales to reasonably large games. We also demonstrate the importance of explicitly modeling the capabilities of the adversary via ablation studies and comparisons with a naive logistics plan based on heuristics.</description>

      <title>Social Welfare Maximization for Federated Learning with Network Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A proper mechanism design can help federated learning (FL) to achieve good social welfare by coordinating self-interested clients through the learning process. However, existing mechanisms neglect the network effects of client participation, leading to suboptimal incentives and social welfare. This paper addresses this gap by exploring network effects in FL incentive mechanism design. We establish a theoretical model to analyze FL model performance and quantify the impact of network effects on heterogeneous client participation. Our analysis reveals the non-monotonic nature of FL network effects. To leverage such effects, we propose a model trading and sharing (MTS) framework that allows clients to obtain FL models through participation or purchase. To tackle heterogeneous clients' strategic behaviors, we further design a socially efficient model trading and sharing (SEMTS) mechanism. Our mechanism achieves social welfare maximization solely through customer payments, without additional incentive costs. Experimental results on an FL hardware prototype demonstrate up to 148.86% improvement in social welfare compared to existing mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Budget Pacing in Repeated Auctions: Regret and Efficiency without Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.08674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.08674v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the aggregate welfare and individual regret guarantees of dynamic \emph{pacing algorithms} in the context of repeated auctions with budgets. Such algorithms are commonly used as bidding agents in Internet advertising platforms, adaptively learning to shade bids by a tunable linear multiplier in order to match a specified budget. We show that when agents simultaneously apply a natural form of gradient-based pacing, the liquid welfare obtained over the course of the learning dynamics is at least half the optimal expected liquid welfare obtainable by any allocation rule. Crucially, this result holds \emph{without requiring convergence of the dynamics}, allowing us to circumvent known complexity-theoretic obstacles of finding equilibria. This result is also robust to the correlation structure between agent valuations and holds for any \emph{core auction}, a broad class of auctions that includes first-price, second-price, and generalized second-price auctions as special cases. For individual guarantees, we further show such pacing algorithms enjoy \emph{dynamic regret} bounds for individual value maximization, with respect to the sequence of budget-pacing bids, for any auction satisfying a monotone bang-for-buck property. To complement our theoretical findings, we provide semi-synthetic numerical simulations based on auction data from the Bing Advertising platform.</description>

      <title>Optimal Diffusion Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.02580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion auction design is a new trend in mechanism design for which the main goal is to incentivize existing buyers to invite new buyers, who are their neighbors on a social network, to join an auction even though they are competitors. With more buyers, a diffusion auction will be able to give a more efficient allocation and receive higher revenue. Existing studies have proposed many interesting diffusion auctions to attract more buyers, but the seller's revenue is not optimized. Hence, in this study, we investigate what optimal revenue the seller can achieve by attracting more buyers. Different from the traditional setting, the revenue that can be achieved in a diffusion auction highly relies on the structure of the network. Hence, we focus on optimal auctions with given classes of underlying networks. We propose a class of mechanisms, where for any given structure, an optimal diffusion mechanism can be found. We point out that it implies an idea of "reserve structure". Moreover, we show that an optimal mechanism that handles all structures does not exist. Therefore, we also propose mechanisms that have bounded approximations of the optimal revenue in all structures.</description>

      <title>Time-Dependent Blackwell Approachability and Application to Absorbing Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.04956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Blackwell's approachability (Blackwell, 1954, 1956) is a very general online learning framework where a Decision Maker obtains vector-valued outcomes, and aims at the convergence of the average outcome to a given ``target'' set. Blackwell gave a sufficient condition for the decision maker having a strategy guaranteeing such a convergence against an adversarial environment, as well as what we now call the Blackwell's algorithm, which then ensures convergence. Blackwell's approachability has since been applied to numerous problems, in regret minimization and game theory, in particular. We extend this framework by allowing the outcome function and the inner product to be time-dependent. We establish a general guarantee for the natural extension to this framework of Blackwell's algorithm. In the case where the target set is an orthant, we present a family of time-dependent inner products which yields different convergence speeds for each coordinate of the average outcome. We apply this framework to absorbing games (an important class of stochastic games) for which we construct $\varepsilon$-uniformly optimal strategies using Blackwell's algorithm in a well-chosen auxiliary approachability problem, thereby giving a novel illustration of the relevance of online learning tools for solving games.</description>
