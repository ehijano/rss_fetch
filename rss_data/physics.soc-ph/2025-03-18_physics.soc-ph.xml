      <title>Measuring the dynamical evolution of the United States lobbying network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lobbying systems are complex political networks that influence governmental decisions, with often profound socio-economic consequences on national and global scales. For most political systems, a comprehensive understanding of lobbying strategies and dynamics is likely to remain elusive as time-resolved system-spanning data and analysis are lacking. A notable exception is the United States (U.S.), where the Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA) of 1995 mandates that all federal lobbying activities be disclosed in detailed quarterly reports. Here, we introduce our recently completed relational LobbyView database that accounts for every reported lobbying instance since the implementation of the LDA. We demonstrate how LobbyView can be used as a resource to quantify the salient aspects of the U.S.~lobbying, such as dynamical evolution, economic impacts, or political polarization. By analyzing the dynamic evolution of the lobbying network, we identify fundamental self-organization principles, such as the self-accelerating accumulation of influence within a small group of powerful lobbying firms. We further show how LobbyView data can be used to accurately measure the synchronization of lobbying activities with election cycles. Finally, as a guide to future research, we illustrate how this data resource can enable quantitative time-resolved analysis to investigate a wide range of critical issues, including concentration of resources, demographic representation, and polarization dynamics in the U.S.~lobbying system. We envisage our database to be not only a potent resource for political and social scientists but also a starting point for quantitative interdisciplinary research, by leveraging insights and methods from statistical physics, systems biology, and machine learning.</description>

      <title>Paving the way to carbon neutrality: Evaluating the decarbonization of residential building electrification worldwide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of increasing global climate change, decarbonizing the residential building sector is crucial for sustainable development. This study is the first to analyze the role of various influencing factors in carbon intensity changes using the decomposing structural decomposition (DSD) to assess and compare the potential and effectiveness of electrifying end-use activities during the operational phase of residential buildings worldwide for decarbonization. The results show that (1) while the electrification rate varied in its impact on emissions across different countries and regions, the overall increase in electrification contributed to higher carbon intensity. In contrast, changes in the emission factor of electricity generally made a positive contribution to emission reduction globally. (2) The global electrification level has significantly increased, with the electrification rate rising from 29.9% in 2000 to 40.1% in 2021. A 39.8% increase in the electricity-related carbon emissions of global residential buildings was observed, increasing from 1452 MtCO2 to 2032 MtCO2, 2000-2021. (3) From 2000 to 2021, electrification of space heating was the main contributor to carbon reduction, whereas the contributions of electrification to cooling and lighting were relatively limited. Emission reductions from appliances and others remained stable. The electrification of water heating and cooking had varying effects on emission reductions in different countries. Furthermore, this study proposes a series of electrification decarbonization strategies. Overall, this study analyzes and contrasts decarbonization efforts from building electrification at the global and regional levels, explores the key motivations behind these efforts to aid national net-zero emission targets and accelerate the transition of the global residential building sector toward a carbon-neutral future.</description>

      <title>The topology of simple games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate the study of simple games from the point of view of combinatorial topology. The starting premise is that the losing coalitions of a simple game can be identified with a simplicial complex. Various topological constructions and results from the theory of simplicial complexes then carry over to the setting of simple games. Examples are cone, join, and the Alexander dual, each of which have interpretations as familiar game-theoretic objects. We also provide some new topological results about simple games, most notably in applications of homology of simplicial complexes to weighted simple games. The exposition is introductory and largely self-contained, intended to inspire further work and point to what appears to be a wealth of potentially fruitful directions of investigation bridging game theory and topology.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Meteorological Factors on Crop Price Volatility in India: Case studies of Soybean and Brinjal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The price volatility of agricultural crops (commodities) is influenced by meteorological variables such as temperature and precipitation (and many other environmental, social and governance factors), which is a critical challenge in sustainable finance, agricultural planning, and policy-making. This paper studies the impact of meteorological variables on price volatility of agricultural crops. As case studies, we choose the two Indian states of Madhya Pradesh (for Soybean) and Odisha (for Brinjal). We employ an Exponential Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (EGARCH) model to estimate the conditional volatility of the log returns of crop prices from 2012 to 2024. This study further explores the cross-correlations between volatility and the meteorological variables. Further, a Granger-causality test is carried out to analyze the causal effect of meteorological variables on the price volatility. Finally, the Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average with Exogenous Regressors (SARIMAX) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models are implemented as simple machine learning models of price volatility with meteorological factors as exogenous variables. We believe that this will illustrate the usefulness of simple machine learning models in agricultural finance, and help the farmers to make informed decisions by considering climate patterns and making beneficial decisions with regard to crop rotation or allocations. In general, implementing meteorological factors to assess agricultural performance could help to understand and reduce price volatility and possibly lead to economic stability.</description>

      <title>A Simple and Explainable Model for Park-and-Ride Car Park Occupancy Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a scenario of growing usage of park-and-ride facilities, understanding and predicting car park occupancy is becoming increasingly important. This study presents a model that effectively captures the occupancy patterns of park-and-ride car parks for commuters using truncated normal distributions for vehicle arrival and departure times. The objective is to develop a predictive model with minimal parameters corresponding to commuter behaviour, enabling the estimation of parking saturation and unfulfilled demand. The proposed model successfully identifies the regular, periodic nature of commuter parking behaviour, where vehicles arrive in the morning and depart in the afternoon. It operates using aggregate data, eliminating the need for individual tracking of arrivals and departures. The model's predictive and now-casting capabilities are demonstrated through real-world data from car parks in the Barcelona Metropolitan Area. A simple model extension furthermore enables the prediction of when a car park will reach its occupancy limit and estimates the additional spaces required to accommodate such excess demand. Thus, beyond forecasting, the model serves as a valuable tool for evaluating interventions, such as expanding parking capacity, to optimize park-and-ride facilities.</description>

      <title>Learning Service Slowdown using Observational Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07305v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Being able to identify service slowdowns is crucial to many operational problems. We study how to use observational congestion data to learn service slowdown in a multi-server system that uses adaptive congestion control mechanisms. We show that a commonly used summary statistic that relies on the marginal congestion measured at individual servers can be highly inaccurate in the presence of adaptive congestion control. We propose a new statistic based on potential routing actions, and show it provides a much more robust signal for server slowdown in these settings. Unlike the marginal statistic, potential action aims to detect changes in the routing actions, and is able to uncover slowdowns even when they do not reflect in marginal congestion. Our results highlight the complexity in performing observational statistical analysis for service systems in the presence of adaptive congestion control. They also suggest that practitioners may want to combine multiple, orthogonal statistics to achieve reliable slowdown detection.</description>

      <title>Navigating the Quantum Divide(s)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article explores the potential divides from emerging quantum technologies (QT) on society, covering impacts on science, technology, geopolitics, and societal structures. We aim to challenge the concept of a single "quantum divide" by offering a comprehensive view. We propose four divides: in science, technologies, between countries, and within societies. The "Quantum Divide in Science" highlights gaps among scientists and access inequalities in research communities. The second divide, "Quantum Divide in Technologies through Path-dependency," looks at technology adoption processes. The "Quantum Divide between Countries" examines adoption reasons and outcomes across countries with varying development levels. Lastly, the "Quantum Divide within Societies" addresses societal implications, one of the most discussed in literature. We propose directions to navigate these divides, noting their interconnectedness and impact on innovation ecosystems. This study guides those interested in the quantum divide, navigation strategies, and QT's influence on scientific, technological, international, and societal institutions.</description>

      <title>When Less is More: Evolutionary Dynamics of Deception in a Sender-Receiver Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spread of disinformation poses a significant threat to societal well-being. We analyze this phenomenon using an evolutionary game theory model of the sender-receiver game, where senders aim to mislead receivers and receivers aim to discern the truth. Using a combination of replicator equations, finite-size scaling analysis, and extensive Monte Carlo simulations, we investigate the long-term evolutionary dynamics of this game. Our central finding is a counterintuitive threshold phenomenon: the role (sender or receiver) with the larger difference in payoffs between successful and unsuccessful interactions is surprisingly more likely to lose in the long run. We show that this effect is robust across different parameter values and arises from the interplay between the relative speeds of evolution of the two roles and the ability of the slower evolving role to exploit the fixed strategy of the faster evolving role. Moreover, for finite populations we find that the initially less frequent strategy of the slower role is more likely to fixate in the population. The initially rarer strategy in the less-rewarded role is, paradoxically, more likely to prevail.</description>

      <title>Visually Wired NFTs: Exploring the Role of Inspiration in Non-Fungible Tokens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.17031v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fervor for Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) attracted countless creators, leading to a Big Bang of digital assets driven by latent or explicit forms of inspiration, as in many creative processes. This work exploits Vision Transformers and graph-based modeling to delve into visual inspiration phenomena between NFTs over the years. Our goals include unveiling the main structural traits that shape visual inspiration networks, exploring the interrelation between visual inspiration and asset performances, investigating crypto influence on inspiration processes, and explaining the inspiration relationships among NFTs. Our findings unveil how the pervasiveness of inspiration led to a temporary saturation of the visual feature space, the impact of the dichotomy between inspiring and inspired NFTs on their financial performance, and an intrinsic self-regulatory mechanism between markets and inspiration waves. Our work can serve as a starting point for gaining a broader view of the evolution of Web3.</description>

      <title>Is Contrasting All You Need? Contrastive Learning for the Detection and Attribution of AI-generated Text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The significant progress in the development of Large Language Models has contributed to blurring the distinction between human and AI-generated text. The increasing pervasiveness of AI-generated text and the difficulty in detecting it poses new challenges for our society. In this paper, we tackle the problem of detecting and attributing AI-generated text by proposing WhosAI, a triplet-network contrastive learning framework designed to predict whether a given input text has been generated by humans or AI and to unveil the authorship of the text. Unlike most existing approaches, our proposed framework is conceived to learn semantic similarity representations from multiple generators at once, thus equally handling both detection and attribution tasks. Furthermore, WhosAI is model-agnostic and scalable to the release of new AI text-generation models by incorporating their generated instances into the embedding space learned by our framework. Experimental results on the TuringBench benchmark of 200K news articles show that our proposed framework achieves outstanding results in both the Turing Test and Authorship Attribution tasks, outperforming all the methods listed in the TuringBench benchmark leaderboards.</description>

      <title>A Thorough Comparison Between Independent Cascade and Susceptible-Infected-Recovered Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study cascades in social networks with the independent cascade (IC) model and the Susceptible-Infected-recovered (SIR) model. The well-studied IC model fails to capture the feature of node recovery, and the SIR model is a variant of the IC model with the node recovery feature. In the SIR model, by computing the probability that a node successfully infects another before its recovery and viewing this probability as the corresponding IC parameter, the SIR model becomes an "out-going-edge-correlated" version of the IC model: the events of the infections along different out-going edges of a node become dependent in the SIR model, whereas these events are independent in the IC model. In this paper, we thoroughly compare the two models and examine the effect of this extra dependency in the SIR model. By a carefully designed coupling argument, we show that the seeds in the IC model have a stronger influence spread than their counterparts in the SIR model, and sometimes it can be significantly stronger. Specifically, we prove that, given the same network, the same seed sets, and the parameters of the two models being set based on the above-mentioned equivalence, the expected number of infected nodes at the end of the cascade for the IC model is weakly larger than that for the SIR model, and there are instances where this dominance is significant. We also study the influence maximization problem with the SIR model. We show that the above-mentioned difference in the two models yields different seed-selection strategies, which motivates the design of influence maximization algorithms specifically for the SIR model. We design efficient approximation algorithms with theoretical guarantees by adapting the reverse-reachable-set-based algorithms, commonly used for the IC model, to the SIR model. Finally, we conduct experimental studies over real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models can Achieve Social Balance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social balance is a well-established concept in sociology which dictates how individual interactions can lead a population to become one faction of positive interactions or be divided in two or more antagonistic factions. In this paper, we consider a group of large language models (LLMs) and study how, after continuous interactions, they can achieve social balance. Across three different LLM models, we find that achieving social balance depends on (i) the type of interaction; (ii) whether agents consider homophily or influence from their peers; and (iii) the population size. We characterize how each model achieves social balance with different frequency, diversity of positive or negative interactions, and interaction stability across conditions (i) to (iii). We show that models achieve different notions of social balance and justify their social dynamics differently. Remarkably, the largest model is not necessarily more likely to achieve social balance with more frequency, stability, and diversity than the smaller ones.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Open-Weight AI Model Growth on HuggingFace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15987v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the open-weight AI landscape continues to proliferate-with model development, significant investment, and user interest-it becomes increasingly important to predict which models will ultimately drive innovation and shape AI ecosystems. Building on parallels with citation dynamics in scientific literature, we propose a framework to quantify how an open-weight model's influence evolves. Specifically, we adapt the model introduced by Wang et al. for scientific citations, using three key parameters-immediacy, longevity, and relative fitness-to track the cumulative number of fine-tuned models of an open-weight model. Our findings reveal that this citation-style approach can effectively capture the diverse trajectories of open-weight model adoption, with most models fitting well and outliers indicating unique patterns or abrupt jumps in usage.</description>
