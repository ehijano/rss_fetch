      <title>A Pileup of Coronal Mass Ejections Produced the Largest Geomagnetic Storm in Two Decades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The largest geomagnetic storm in two decades occurred in 2024 May with a minimum $D_{\rm st}$ of $-412$ nT. We examine its solar and interplanetary origins by combining multipoint imaging and in situ observations. The source active region, NOAA AR 13664, exhibited extraordinary activity and produced successive halo eruptions, which were responsible for two complex ejecta observed at the Earth. In situ measurements from STEREO A, which was $12.6^{\circ}$ apart, allow us to compare the ``geo-effectiveness" at the Earth and STEREO A. We obtain key findings concerning the formation of solar superstorms and how mesoscale variations of coronal mass ejections affect geo-effectiveness: (1) the 2024 May storm supports the hypothesis that solar superstorms are ``perfect storms" in nature, i.e., a combination of circumstances resulting in an event of an unusual magnitude; (2) the first complex ejecta, which caused the geomagnetic superstorm, shows considerable differences in the magnetic field and associated ``geo-effectiveness" between the Earth and STEREO A, despite a mesoscale separation; and (3) two contrasting cases of complex ejecta are found in terms of the geo-effectiveness at the Earth, which is largely due to different magnetic field configurations within the same active region.</description>

      <title>On the Euler-type gravitomagnetic orbital effects in the field of a precessing body</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To the first post-Newtonian order, the gravitational action of mass-energy currents is encoded by the off-diagonal gravitomagnetic components of the spacetime metric tensor. If they are time-dependent, a further acceleration enters the equations of motion of a moving test particle. Let the source of the gravitational field be an isolated, massive body rigidly rotating whose spin angular momentum experiences a slow precessional motion. The impact of the aforementioned acceleration on the orbital motion of a test particle is analytically worked out in full generality. The resulting averaged rates of change are valid for any orbital configuration of the satellite; furthermore, they hold for an arbitrary orientation of the precessional velocity vector of the spin of the central object. In general, all the orbital elements, with the exception of the mean anomaly at epoch, undergo nonvanishing long-term variations which, in the case of the Juno spacecraft currently orbiting Jupiter and the double pulsar PSR J0737-3039 A/B turn out to be quite small. Such effects might become much more relevant in a star-supermassive black hole scenario; as an example, the relative change of the semimajor axis of a putative test particle orbiting a Kerr black hole as massive as the one at the Galactic Centre at, say, 100 Schwarzschild radii may amount up to about $7\%$ per year if the hole's spin precessional frequency is $10\%$ of the particle's orbital one.</description>

      <title>Post-Keplerian perturbations of the hyperbolic motion in the field of a massive, rotating object</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The perturbations of the hyperbolic motion of a test particle due to the general relativistic gravitoelectromagnetic Schwarzschild and Lense-Thirring components of the gravitational field of a massive, rotating body are analytically worked out to the first post-Newtonian level. To the Newtonian order, the impact of the quadrupole mass moment of the source is calculated as well. The resulting analytical expressions are valid for a generic orientation in space of both the orbital plane of the probe and the spin axis of the primary, and for arbitrary values of the eccentricity. They are applied first to 'Oumuamua, an interstellar asteroid which recently visited our solar system along an unbound heliocentric orbit. While its gravitoelectric shifts occurred close to the Sun's flyby are less than some tens of milliarcseconds, those due to the solar oblateness and angular momentum are of the order of microarcseconds throughout the whole trajectory. Comparable values occur for the post-Newtonian shifts of the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR) spacecraft during its flyby of the Earth, while those due to the oblateness of the latter are nominally several orders of magnitude larger. The current (formal) uncertainty in the quadrupole mass moment of the geopotential would bring the mismodeling of such classical effects below the nominal value of the predicted relativistic disturbances. The hyperbolic excess velocity is not changed by any of the post--Keplerian accelerations considered. The calculational approach developed can be straightforwardly extended to any alternative models of gravity as well.</description>

      <title>Self-similar solutions of oscillatory reconnection: parameter study of magnetic field strength and background temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Oscillatory reconnection is a specific type of time-dependent reconnection which involves periodic changes in the magnetic topology of a null point. The mechanism has been reported for a variety of magnetic field strengths and configurations, background temperatures and densities. All these studies report an oscillation in the current density at the null point, but also report a variety of periods, amplitudes and overall behaviors. We conduct a parametric study for equilibrium magnetic field strength and initial background temperature, solving 2D resistive MHD equations around a magnetic X-point. We introduce a parameter space for the ratio of internal-to-magnetic energy and find self-similar solutions for simulations where this ratio is below 0.1 (which represents a magnetically-dominated environment or, equivalently, a low-beta plasma). Self-similarity can be seen in oscillations in the current density at the null (including amplitude and period), Ohmic heating and the temperature generated via reconnection jets. The parameter space of energy ratios also allows us to contextualize previous studies of the oscillatory reconnection mechanism and bring those different studies together into a single unified understanding.</description>
