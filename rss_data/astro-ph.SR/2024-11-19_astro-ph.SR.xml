      <title>DECaPS and SMA discovery of a highly-inclined class I YSO with an outflow: IRAS 08235-4316</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present images of IRAS~08235--4316 with the Dark Energy Camera Plane Survey (DECaPS; spanning 0.398--1.034$\,\mu$m, at ${\sim}1''$ resolution) and the Submillimeter Array (SMA; at 1.38\,mm/217\,GHz, at ${\sim}1.9''\times1.2''$ resolution), a YSO located in the Vela constellation near to the Puppis boundary, detected in a systematic search for new large/extended emission sources. The DECaPS data show an asymmetric bi--polar morphology with a large angular extent of ${\sim}7.1''$ separated by a dark lane, characteristic of highly--inclined protoplanetary disks and less-evolved YSOs with outflows. The SMA data show an extended continuum structure along the optical dark lane with a smaller angular extent of ${\sim}4.6''$. The detected $^{12}$CO J=2--1 emission tentatively shows a velocity gradient along the position angle of the dark lane/millimeter continuum, that may trace rotating gas. Additional $^{12}$CO emission is present which could trace infalling/outflowing gas, and/or a nearby gas cloud. We estimate a distance to IRAS~08235--4316 of at least ${\sim}191\,$pc. Supported by additional SED modelling, we infer IRAS~08235--4316 to be a newly discovered class~I YSO with an outflow, host to an embedded protoplanetary disk, with a large millimeter radius of ${\sim}440$\,au and dust mass ${\gtrsim}11\,M_\oplus$.</description>

      <title>Testing the Breakdown of the Asteroseismic Scaling Relations in Luminous Red Giants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nearly all cool, evolved stars are solar-like oscillators, and fundamental stellar properties can be inferred from these oscillations with asteroseismology. Scaling relations are commonly used to relate global asteroseismic properties, the frequency of maximum power $\nu_{max}$ and the large frequency separation $\Delta \nu$, to stellar properties. Mass, radius, and age can then be inferred with the addition of stellar spectroscopy. There is excellent agreement between seismic radii and fundamental data on the lower red giant branch and red clump. However, the scaling relations appear to breakdown in luminous red giant stars. We attempt to constrain the contributions of the asteroseismic parameters to the observed breakdown. We test the $\nu_{max}$ and $\Delta \nu$ scaling relations separately, by using stars of known mass and radius in star clusters and the Milky Way's high-$\alpha$ sequence. We find evidence that the $\Delta \nu$-scaling relation contributes to the observed breakdown in luminous giants more than the $\nu_{max}$ relation. We test different methods of mapping the observed $\Delta \nu$ to the mean density via a correction factor, $F_{\Delta \nu}$ and find a $\approx 1 - 3\%$ difference in the radii in the luminous giant regime depending on the technique used to measure $F_{\Delta \nu}$. The differences between the radii inferred by these two techniques are too small on the luminous giant branch to account for the inflated seismic radii observed in evolved giant stars. Finally, we find that the $F_{\Delta \nu}$ correction is insensitive to the adopted mixing length, chosen by calibrating the models to observations of $T_{eff}$.</description>

      <title>The Ubiquity of Twisted Flux Ropes in the Quiet Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models and observations have demonstrated that Twisted Flux Ropes (TFRs) play a significant role in the structure and eruptive dynamics of active regions. Their role in the dynamics of the quiet Sun atmosphere on has remained elusive, their fundamental relevance emerging mainly from theoretical models (Amari et al. 2015), showing that they form and erupt as a result of flux cancellation. Here HINODE high-resolution photospheric vector magnetic field measurements are integrated with advanced environment reconstruction models: TFRs develop on various scales and are associated with the appearance of mesospots. The developing TFRs contain sufficient free magnetic energy to match the requirements of the recently observed "campfires" discovered by Solar Orbiter in the quiet Sun. The free magnetic energy is found to be large enough to trigger eruptions while the magnetic twist large enough to trigger confined eruptions, heating the atmosphere. TFRs are also connected to larger scale magnetic fields such as supergranulation loops, allowing the generation of Alfv\'en waves at the top of the chromosphere that can propagate along them. High-resolution magnetohydrodynamic simulations, incorporating subsurface dynamo activity at an unprecedented 30 km spatial resolution, confirm that TFRs are ubiquitous products of the permanent small scale dynamo engine that feeds their formation, destabilization, eruption via flux emergence, submergence and cancellation of their chromospheric feet, similar to the dynamics driving large scale eruptive events. Future investigations, especially with the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) and Solar Orbiter will deepen our understanding of TFRs in the context of atmospheric heating.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric abundances and bulk properties of the binary brown dwarf Gliese 229 Bab from JWST/MIRI spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present JWST/MIRI low-resolution spectroscopy ($4.75-14~\mu$m) of the first known substellar companion, Gliese 229 Bab, which was recently resolved into a tight binary brown dwarf. Previous atmospheric retrieval studies modeling Gliese 229 B as a single brown dwarf have reported anomalously high carbon-to-oxygen ratios (C/O) of $\approx 1.1$ using $1-5~\mu$m ground-based spectra. Here, we fit the MIRI spectrum of Gliese 229 Bab with a two-component binary model using the Sonora Elf Owl grid and additionally account for the observed $K$ band flux ratio of the binary brown dwarf. Assuming the two brown dwarfs share the same abundances, we obtain $\rm C/O=0.65\pm0.05$ and $\rm [M/H]=0.00^{+0.04}_{-0.03}$ as their abundances ($2\sigma$ statistical errors), which are fully consistent with the host star abundances. We also recover the same abundances if we fit the MIRI spectrum with a single brown dwarf model, indicating that binarity does not strongly affect inferred abundances from mid-infrared data when the $T_\rm{eff}$ are similar between components of the binary. We measure $T_\rm{eff}=900^{+78}_{-29}~$K and $T_\rm{eff}=775^{+20}_{-33}~$K for the two brown dwarfs. We find that the vertical diffusion coefficients of $\log{K_\rm{zz}} \approx4.0$ are identical between the two brown dwarfs and in line with $\log{K_\rm{zz}}$ values inferred for isolated brown dwarfs with similar $T_\rm{eff}$. Our results demonstrate the power of mid-infrared spectroscopy in providing robust atmospheric abundance measurements for brown dwarf companions and by extension, giant planets.</description>

      <title>Distribution of Europium in The Milky Way Disk; Its Connection to Planetary Habitability and The Source of The R-Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy provided in the radioactive decay of thorium (Th) and uranium (U) isotopes, embedded in planetary mantles, sustains geodynamics important for surface habitability such as the generation of a planetary magnetic dynamo. In order to better understand the thermal evolution of nearby exoplanets, stellar photospheric abundances can be used to infer the material composition of orbiting planets. Here we constrain the intrinsic dispersion of the r-process element europium (Eu) (measured in relative abundance [Eu/H]) as a proxy for Th and U in local F, G, and K type dwarf stars. Adopting stellar-chemical data from two high quality spectroscopic surveys, we have determined a small intrinsic scatter of 0.025 dex in [Eu/H] within the disk. We further investigate the stellar anti-correlation in [Eu/$\alpha$] vs [$\alpha$/H] at late metallicities to probe in what regimes planetary radiogenic heating may lead to periods of extended dynamo collapse. We find that only near-solar metallicity stars in the disk have Eu inventories supportive of a persistent dynamo in attendant planets, supporting the notion of a ``metallicity Goldilocks zone'' in the galactic disk. The observed anti-correlation further provides novel evidence regarding the nature of r-processes injection by substantiating $\alpha$ element production is decoupled from Eu injection. This suggests either a metallicity-dependent r-process in massive core-collapse supernovae, or that neutron-star merger events dominate r-process production in the recent universe.</description>

      <title>Investigating explosive events in a 3D quiet-Sun model: Transition region and coronal response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition region explosive events are characterized by non-Gaussian profiles of the emission lines formed at transition region temperatures, and they are believed to be manifestations of small-scale reconnection events in the transition region. We took a 3D self-consistent quiet-Sun model extending from the upper convection zone to the lower corona calculated using the MURaM code. We first synthesized the Si IV line profiles from the model and then located the profiles which show signatures of bi-directional flows. These tend to appear along network lanes, and most do not reach coronal temperatures. We isolated two hot (around 1 MK) events and one cool (order of 0.1 MK) event and examined the magnetic field evolution in and around these selected events. Furthermore, we investigated why some explosive events reach coronal temperatures while most remain cool. The field lines around two events reconnect at small angles, i.e., they undergo component reconnection. The third case is associated with the relaxation of a highly twisted flux rope. All of the three events reveal signatures in the synthesized EUI 174 {\AA} images. The intensity variations in two events are dominated by variations of the coronal emissions, while the cool component seen in the respective channel contributes significantly to the intensity variation in one case. Comparing to the cool event, one hot event is embedded in regions with higher magnetic field strength and heating rates while the densities are comparable, and the other hot event is heated to coronal temperatures mainly because of the low density. Small-scale heating events seen in EUV channels of AIA or EUI might be hot or cool. Our results imply that the major difference between the events in which coronal counterparts dominate or not is the amount of converted magnetic energy and/or density in and around the reconnection region.</description>

      <title>An Extreme Stellar Prominence Eruption Observed by LAMOST Time-Domain Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the detection of an extreme stellar prominence eruption on the M dwarf LAMOST J044431.62+235627.9, observed through time-domain H$\alpha$ spectroscopy with the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST). This prominence eruption was accompanied by a superflare lasting over 160.4 minutes. The H$\alpha$ line profile exhibits significant blue-wing enhancement during the impulsive phase and near the flare peak, with a projected bulk blueshift velocity of $-228\pm11$~km~s$^{-1}$ and a maximum blueshift velocity reaching $-605\pm15$~km~s$^{-1}$. Velocity analysis of the eruptive prominence at various heights above the stellar surface indicates that some of the projected ejection velocities along the line of sight exceed the corresponding escape velocities, suggesting a potential coronal mass ejection (CME). The equivalent width (EW) of the H$\alpha$ blue-wing enhancement in this eruption appears to be the largest observed to date and is comparable to the EW of the H$\alpha$ line profile during the quiescent phase of the host star. We performed a two-cloud modeling for the prominence and the associated flare, which suggests that the eruptive prominence has a mass ranging from $1.6 \times 10^{19}~\text{g}$ to $7.2 \times 10^{19}~\text{g}$. More importantly, the mass ratio of the erupting prominence to its host star is the largest among all reported stellar prominence eruptions/CMEs.</description>

      <title>The Blue Horizontal-Branch Stars From the LAMOST Survey: Atmospheric Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blue horizontal-branch (BHB) stars are crucial for studying the structure of the Galactic halo. Accurate atmospheric parameters of BHB stars are essential for investigating the formation and evolution of the Galaxy. In this work, a data-driven technique named stellar label machine (SLAM) is used to estimate the atmospheric parameters of Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope low-resolution spectra (LAMOST-LRS) for BHB stars with a set of A-type theoretical spectra as the training dataset. We add color indexes ($(BP-G), (G-RP), (BP-RP), (J-H)$) during the training process to constrain the stellar temperature further. Finally, we derive the atmospheric parameters ($T_\mathrm{eff}$, log\, $g$, [Fe/H]) for 5,355 BHB stars. Compared to existing literature results, our results are more robust, after taking the color index into account, the resulted precisoin of $T_\mathrm{eff}$, log\, $g$ is significantly improved, especially for the spectrum with low signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). Based on the duplicate observations with a S/N difference $&lt; 20\%$, the random errors are around 30\,K, 0.1~dex, and 0.12~dex for $T_\mathrm{eff}$, log\,$g$, [Fe/H], respectively. The stellar labels provided by SLAM are also compared to those from the high-resolution spectra in literature. The standard deviation between the predicted star labels and the published values from the high-resolution spectra is adopted as \sout{to} the statistical uncertainty of our results. They are $\sigma$($T_\mathrm{eff}$) = 76\,K, $\sigma$(log\,$g$) = 0.04~dex, and $\sigma$([Fe/H]) = 0.09~dex, respectively.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Superflares in HR 1099 using Temporal and Spectral Analysis of XMM-Newton Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, we analyze three energetic X-ray flares from the active RS CVn binary HR 1099 using data obtained from XMM-Newton. The flare duration ranges from 2.8 to 4.1 h, with e-folding rise and decay times in the range of 27 to 38 minutes and 1.3 to 2.4 h, respectively, indicating rapid rise and slower decay phases. The flare frequency for HR 1099 is one flare per rotation period. Time-resolved spectroscopy reveals peak flare temperatures of 39.44, 35.96, and 32.48 MK, emission measures of $7 \times 10^{53}$ to $8 \times 10^{54}$ cm$^{-3}$, global abundances of 0.250, 0.299, and 0.362 $Z_\odot$, and peak X-ray luminosities of $ 10^{31.21-32.29}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The quiescent state is modeled with a three-temperature plasma maintained at 3.02, 6.96, and 12.53 MK. Elemental abundances during quiescent and flaring states exhibit the inverse-FIP effect. We have conducted a comparative analysis of coronal abundances with previous studies and found evidence supporting the i-FIP effect. The derived flare semi-loop lengths of 6 to 8.9 $\times 10^{10}$ cm were found to be comparable to the other flares detected on HR 1099; however, they are significantly larger than typical solar flare loops. The estimated flare energies, ranging from $10^{35.83-37.03}$ erg, classify these flares as super-flares. The magnetic field strengths of the loops are found to be in the range of 350 to 450 G. We diagnose the physical conditions of the flaring corona in HR 1099 through the observations of superflares and provide inference on the plasma processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compact hierarchical triples (CHTs) are triple stars where the tertiary is in an orbit of a period less than 1000 d. They were thought to be rare but we are discovering more of these systems recently, thanks to space-based missions like TESS, Kepler, and GAIA. In this work, we use orbital parameters obtained from these missions to constrain the formation process of CHTs. We also use spectroscopic and systemic parameters from our work, and the literature to understand the effects of metallicity and dynamics on the formation processes.</description>

      <title>High-temperature dust formation in carbon-rich astrophysical environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Condensation processes, which are responsible for the main chemical differences between gas and solids in the Galaxy, are the major mechanisms that control the cycle of dust from evolved stars to planetary systems. However, they are still poorly understood, mainly because the thermodynamics and kinetic models of nucleation or grain growth lack experimental data. To bridge this gap, we used a large-volume three-phase alternating-current plasma torch to obtain a full high-temperature condensation sequence at an elevated carbon-to-oxygen ratio from a fluxed chondritic gas composition. We show that the crystallized suites of carbides, silicides, nitrides, sulfides, oxides and silicates and the bulk composition of the condensates are properly modelled by a kinetically inhibited condensation scenario controlled by gas flow. This validates the thermodynamic predictions of the condensation sequence at a high carbon-to-oxygen ratio. On this basis and using appropriate optical properties, we also demonstrate the influence of pressure on dust chemistry as well as the low probability of forming and detecting iron silicides in asymptotic giant branch C-rich circumstellar environments as well as in our chondritic meteorites. By demonstrating the potential of predicting dust mineralogy in these environments, this approach holds high promise for quantitatively characterizing dust composition and formation in diverse astrophysical settings.</description>

      <title>Analysis of solar eruptions deflecting in the low corona: influence of the magnetic environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) can exhibit non-radial evolution. The background magnetic field is considered the main driver for the trajectory deviation relative to the source region. The influence of the magnetic environment has been largely attributed to the gradient of the magnetic pressure. In this work, we propose a new approach to investigate the role of topology on CME deflection and to quantify and compare the action between the magnetic field gradient (`gradient' path) and the topology (`topological' path).
  We investigate 8 events simultaneously observed from Solar Orbiter, STEREO-A and SDO; and, with a new tracking technique, we reconstruct the 3D evolution of the eruptions. Then, we compare their propagation with the predictions from the two magnetic drivers. We find that the `topological' path describes the CME actual trajectory much better than the more traditional `gradient path'.
  Our results strongly indicate that the ambient topology may be the dominant driver for deflections in the low corona, and that presents a promising method to estimate the direction of propagation of CMEs early in their evolution.</description>

      <title>Non-LTE radiative transfer simulations: Improved agreement of the double detonation with normal Type Ia supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The double detonation is a widely discussed explosion mechanism for Type Ia supernovae, whereby a helium shell detonation ignites a secondary detonation in the carbon/oxygen core of a white dwarf. Even for modern models that invoke relatively small He shell masses, many previous studies have found that the products of the helium shell detonation lead to discrepancies with normal Type Ia supernovae, such as strong Ti II absorption features, extremely red light curves and too large a variation with viewing direction. It has been suggested that non local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) effects may help to reduce these discrepancies with observations. Here we carry out full non-LTE radiative transfer simulations for a recent double detonation model with a relatively small helium shell mass of 0.05 M$_\odot$. We construct 1D models representative of directions in a 3D explosion model to give an indication of viewing angle dependence. The full non-LTE treatment leads to improved agreement between the models and observations. The light curves become less red, due to reduced absorption by the helium shell detonation products, since these species are more highly ionised. Additionally, the expected variation with observer direction is reduced. The full non-LTE treatment shows promising improvements, and reduces the discrepancies between the double detonation models and observations of normal Type Ia supernovae.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical Outflows Shaped by Ambient Pressure Gradients: a Unified Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astrophysical outflows are ubiquitous across cosmic scales, from stellar to galactic systems. While diverse launching mechanisms have been proposed, we demonstrate that these outflows share a fundamental commonality: their morphology follows the physics of pressure-confined supersonic flows. By extending classical deLaval nozzle theory to account for ambient pressure gradients, we present a unified framework that successfully describes outflows from young stellar objects to active galactic nuclei. Our model reveals a remarkable consistency in pressure profiles, characterized by a power-law exponent near minus two, independent of the internal characteristics of the outflow or the nature of central engine. This discovery suggests a universal mechanism for outflow collimation and acceleration, bridging the gap between theoretical models and observational features across a wide range of astronomical scales.</description>

      <title>Mass Transfer in Eccentric Orbits with Self-consistent Stellar Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate Roche lobe overflow mass transfer (MT) in eccentric binary systems between stars and compact objects (COs), modeling the coupled evolution of both the star and the orbit due to eccentric MT (eMT) in a self-consistent framework. We implement the analytic expressions for secular rates of change of the orbital semi-major axis and eccentricity, assuming a delta function MT at periapse, into the binary stellar evolution code MESA. Two scenarios are examined: (1) a simplified model isolating the effects of eMT on stellar and orbital evolution, and (2) realistic binary configurations that include angular momentum exchange (e.g., tides, mass loss, spin-orbit coupling, and gravitational wave radiation). Unlike the ad hoc approach of instant circularization that is often employed, explicit modeling of eMT reveals a large fraction of binaries can remain eccentric post-MT. Even binaries which naturally circularize during eMT have different properties (donor mass and orbital size) compared to predictions from instant circularization, with some showing fundamentally different evolutionary outcomes (e.g., stable versus unstable MT). We demonstrate that a binary's initial mass ratio and eccentricity are predictive of whether it will remain eccentric or circularize after eMT. These findings underscore the importance of eMT in understanding CO-hosting binary populations, including X-ray binaries, gravitational wave sources, and other high-energy transients.</description>

      <title>The role of Solar Activity in shaping Precipitation Extremes: A Regional Exploration in Kerala, India</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been global attention focused on extreme climatic changes. The purpose of this paper is to explore the response of extreme precipitation events to solar activity, over Kerala, India. The three solar indices - sunspot number, F10.7 index, and cosmic ray intensity - are examined, and their relationship to rainfall is examined during a 57-year period (1965 - 2021), starting with Solar Cycle 20. Both solar and rainfall data are considered on an annual scale as well as on a seasonal scale by dividing them into winter, pre-monsoon, monsoon, and post-monsoon seasons. The solar indices are used to calculate correlation coefficients with seasonal rainfall. Through correlation analysis, it is found that the precipitation in Kerala is correlated with the sunspot activity, but with different significance. When solar activity is high, the winter and monsoon seasons exhibit strong correlations with high significance. The solar influence at the regional level is also studied. The central and southern parts of Kerala appear to be influenced by the Sun during periods of high activity. The years with excess and deficiency of rainfall are calculated and compared with the solar indices. It was observed that the years with excessive and insufficient rainfall coincide with the years when the solar activity is at its highest or minimum. It is suggested that there is a physical link and a way to predict extreme rainfall events in Kerala based on the association between solar activity and those events.</description>

      <title>Evidence of non-Solar elemental composition in the clocked bursts from SRGA J144459.2$-$604207</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In February and March 2024, several Type I X-ray bursts from the accreting neutron star SRGA J144459.2$-$60420 were detected by multiple X-ray satellites, with the first reports coming from INTEGRAL and NinjaSat. These observations reveal that after exhibiting very regular behavior as a ``clocked" burster, the peak luminosity of the SRGA J144459.2$-$60420 X-ray bursts shows a gradual decline. The observed light curves exhibit a short plateau feature, potentially with a double peak, followed by a rapid decay in the tail-features unlike those seen in previously observed clocked bursters. In this study, we calculate a series of multizone X-ray burst models with various compositions of accreted matter, specifically varying the mass fractions of hydrogen ($X$), helium ($Y$), and heavier CNO elements or metallicity ($Z_{\rm CNO}$). We demonstrate that a model with higher $Z_{\rm CNO}$ and/or lower $X/Y$ compared to the solar values can reproduce the observed behavior of SRGA J144459.2$-$60420. Therefore, we propose that this new XRB is likely the first clocked burster with non-solar elemental compositions. Moreover, based on the X-ray burst light curve morphology in the decline phase observed by NinjaSat, a He-enhanced model with $X/Y \approx 1.5$ seems preferred over high-metallicity cases. We also give a brief discussion on the implications for the neutron star mass, binary star evolution, inclination angle, and the potential for a high-metallicity scenario, the last of which is closely related to the properties of the hot CNO cycle.</description>

      <title>Physics-driven Explosions of Stripped High-Mass Stars: Synthetic Light Curves and Spectra of Stripped-Envelope Supernovae with Broad Lightcurves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stripped-envelope supernovae (SESNe) represent a significant fraction of core-collapse supernovae, arising from massive stars that have shed their hydrogen and, in some cases, helium envelopes. The origins and explosion mechanisms of SESNe remain a topic of active investigation. In this work, we employ radiative-transfer simulations to model the light curves and spectra of a set of explosions of single, solar-metallicity, massive Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars with ejecta masses ranging from 4 to 11 Msun, that were computed from a turbulence-aided and neutrino-driven explosion mechanism. We analyze these synthetic observables to explore the impact of varying ejecta mass and helium content on observable features. We find that the light curve shape of these progenitors with high ejecta masses is consistent with observed SESNe with broad light curves but not the peak luminosities. The commonly used analytic formula based on rising bolometric light curves overestimates the ejecta mass of these high-initial-mass progenitor explosions by a factor up to 2.6. In contrast, the calibrated method by Haynie et al., which relies on late-time decay tails, reduces uncertainties to an average of 20% within the calibrated ejecta mass range.Spectroscopically, the He I 1.083 um line remains prominent even in models with as little as 0.02 Msun of helium. However, the strength of the optical He I lines is not directly proportional to the helium mass but instead depends on a complex interplay of factors such as 56Ni distribution, composition, and radiation field. Thus, producing realistic helium features requires detailed radiative transfer simulations for each new hydrodynamic model.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Modeling of Luminous Transients Powered by H-Rich and He-Rich Circumstellar Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we perform detailed spectroscopic modeling to analyze the interaction of circumstellar material (CSM) with ejecta in both hydrogen-rich and hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe), systematically varying properties such as CSM density, composition, and geometry to explore their effects on spectral lines and light curve evolution. Using advanced radiative transfer simulations with the new, open-source SuperLite code to generate synthetic spectra, we identify key spectroscopic indicators of CSM characteristics. Our findings demonstrate that spectral lines of hydrogen and helium exhibit significant variations due to differences in CSM mass and composition. In hydrogen-rich SLSN- II, we observe pronounced hydrogen emission lines that correlate strongly with dense, extended CSM, suggesting massive, eruptive mass-loss histories. Conversely, in hydrogen-poor SLSNe, we recover mostly featureless spectra at early times, with weak hydrogen lines appearing only in the very early phases of the explosion, highlighting the quick ionization of traces of hydrogen present in the CSM. We analyze the properties of the resulting emission lines, particularly $\rm H_{\alpha}$ and $\rm H_{\beta}$, for our models using sophisticated statistical methods. This analysis reveals how variations in the supernova progenitor and CSM properties can lead to distinct spectroscopic evolutions over time. These temporal changes provide crucial insights into the underlying physics driving the explosion and the subsequent interaction with the CSM. By linking these spectroscopic observations to the initial properties of the progenitor and its surrounding ma</description>

      <title>A Time-Dependent Spectral Analysis of $\gamma$ Cassiopeiae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated the temporal and spectral features of $\gamma$ Cassiopeiae's X-ray emission within the context of the white dwarf accretion hypothesis. We find that the variabilities present in the X-ray data show two different signals, one primarily due to absorption and the other due to flickering like in non-magnetic cataclysmic variables. We then use this two-component insight to investigate previously un-reported simultaneous XMM and NuSTAR data. The model fitting results find white dwarf properties consistent with optical studies alongside a significant secondary, thermal source. We propose a secondary shock between the Be decretion disk and white dwarf accretion disk as the source. Finally, we analyzed a unique, low-count rate event of the XMM light curve as potential evidence for the white dwarf encountering Be decretion disk structures.</description>

      <title>Let there be neutrons! Hadronic photoproduction from a large flux of high-energy photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose that neutrons may be generated in high-energy, high-flux photon environments via photo-induced reactions on pre-existing baryons. These photo-hadronic interactions are expected to occur in astrophysical jets and surrounding material. Historically, these reactions have been attributed to the production of high-energy cosmic rays and neutrinos. We estimate the photoproduction off of protons in the context of gamma-ray bursts, where it is expected there will be sufficient baryonic material that may be encompassing or entrained in the jet. We show that typical stellar baryonic material, even material completely devoid of neutrons, can become inundated with neutrons in situ via hadronic photoproduction. Consequently, this mechanism provides a means for collapsars and other astrophysical sites containing substantial flux of high-energy photons to be favorable for neutron-capture nucleosynthesis.</description>

      <title>The Solar and Geomagnetic Storms in May 2024: A Flash Data Report</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In May 2024, the scientific community observed intense solar eruptions that resulted in a great geomagnetic storm and auroral extension, highlighting the need to document and quantify these events. This study mainly focuses on their quantification. The source active region (AR 13664) evolved from 113 to 2761 millionths of the solar hemisphere between 4 May and 14 May. AR 13664's magnetic free energy surpassed 10^33 erg on 7 May, triggering 12 X-class flares on 8 -- 15 May. Multiple interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) were produced from this AR, accelerating solar energetic particles toward Earth. According to satellite and interplanetary scintillation data, at least 4 ICMEs erupted from 13664 eventually overcoming each other and combining. The shock arrival at 17:05 UT on 10 May significantly compressed the magnetosphere down to ~ 5.04 RE, and triggered a deep Forbush Decrease. GOES satellite data and ground-based neutron monitors confirmed a ground-level enhancement from 2 UT to 10 UT on 11 May 2024. The ICMEs induced exceptional geomagnetic storms, peaking at a Dst index of -412 nT at 2 UT on 11 May, marking the sixth-largest storm since 1957. The AE and AL indices showed great auroral extensions that located the AE/AL stations into the polar cap. We gathered auroral records at that time and reconstructed the equatorward boundary of the visual auroral oval to 29.8{\deg} invariant latitude. We compared naked-eye and camera auroral visibility, providing critical caveats on their difference. We also confirmed global enhancements of storm-enhanced density of the ionosphere.</description>

      <title>Limb Observations of Global Solar Coronal Extreme-ultraviolet Wavefronts: The Inclination, Kinematics, Coupling with the Expanding Coronal Mass Ejections, and Connection with the Coronal Mass Ejection Driven Shocks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15017v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We select and investigate six global solar extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) wave events using data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory and the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory. These eruptions are all on the limb but recorded as halo coronal mass ejections (CMEs) because the CME-driven shocks have expanded laterally to the opposite side. With the limb observations avoiding the projection effect, we have measured the inclination and speed of the EUV wavefront from 1.05 to 1.25 $R_\odot$. We also investigate the coupling and connection of the EUV wavefront with the CME boundary and the CME-driven shock, respectively. The major findings in the six events are: (1) the forward inclination of the primary and coronal-hole-transmitted EUV wavefronts is estimated, respectively, and the origins of these inclinations and their effects on the estimate of actual wavefronts speed are investigated; (2) the wavefront speed can be elevated by loop systems near the coronal base, and the average speed in the low corona has no clear correlation with the lateral expansion of the CME-driven shock in the high corona; (3) the fast magnetosonic Mach number of the wavefront is larger than unity from the coronal base; (4) the EUV wavefront is coupled with the CME driver throughout the propagation in two events; (5) after the EUV wavefront vanishes, the CME-driven shock continues traveling on the opposite side and disconnects from the EUV wavefront in four events. These results and their implications are discussed, which provide insight into the properties of global EUV waves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, contrastive learning (CL), a technique most prominently used in natural language and computer vision, has been used to train informative representation spaces for galaxy spectra and images in a self-supervised manner. Following this idea, we implement CL for stars in the Milky Way, for which recent astronomical surveys have produced a huge amount of heterogeneous data. Specifically, we investigate Gaia XP coefficients and RVS spectra. Thus, the methods presented in this work lay the foundation for aggregating the knowledge implicitly contained in the multimodal data to enable downstream tasks like cross-modal generation or fused stellar parameter estimation. We find that CL results in a highly structured representation space that exhibits explicit physical meaning. Using this representation space to perform cross-modal generation and stellar label regression results in excellent performance with high-quality generated samples as well as accurate and precise label predictions.</description>

      <title>Probing the Soft X-ray Properties and Multi-Wavelength Variability of SN2023ixf and its Progenitor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13101v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of nearly two decades of optical/UV and X-ray data to study the multi-wavelength pre-explosion properties and post-explosion X-ray properties of nearby SN2023ixf located in M101. We find no evidence of precursor activity in the optical to UV down to a luminosity of $\lesssim 7\times10^{4}\, \rm L_{\odot}$, while X-ray observations covering nearly 18 years prior to explosion show no evidence of luminous precursor X-ray emission down to an absorbed 0.3 - 10.0 keV X-ray luminosity of $\sim6\times10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Extensive Swift observations taken post-explosion did not detect soft X-ray emission from SN2023ixf within the first $\sim$3.3 days after first light, which suggests a mass-loss rate for the progenitor of $\lesssim5\times10^{-4}\,\rm M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ or a radius of $\lesssim4\times10^{15}$ cm for the circumstellar material. Our analysis also suggests that if the progenitor underwent a mass-loss episode, this had to occur $&gt;$ 0.5 - 1.5 years prior to explosion, consistent with previous estimates. Swift detected soft X-rays from SN2023ixf $\sim4.25$ days after first light, and it rose to a peak luminosity of $\sim10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$ after 10 days and has maintained this luminosity for nearly 50 days post first light. This peak luminosity is lower than expected, given the evidence that SN2023ixf is interacting with dense material. However, this might be a natural consequence of an asymmetric circumstellar medium. X-ray spectra derived from merging all Swift observations over the first 50 days are best described by a two-component bremsstrahlung model consisting of a heavily absorbed and hotter component similar to that found using NuSTAR, and a less-absorbed, cooler component. We suggest that this soft component arises from cooling of the forward shock similar to that found in Type IIn SN2010jl.</description>

      <title>$\texttt{slick}$: Modeling a Universe of Molecular Line Luminosities in Hydrodynamical Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present {\sc slick} (the Scalable Line Intensity Computation Kit), a software package that calculates realistic CO, [\ion{C}{1}], and [\ion{C}{2}] luminosities for clouds and galaxies formed in hydrodynamic simulations. Built on the radiative transfer code {\sc despotic}, {\sc slick} computes the thermal, radiative, and statistical equilibrium in concentric zones of model clouds, based on their physical properties and individual environments. We validate our results applying {\sc slick} to the high-resolution run of the {\sc Simba} simulations, testing the derived luminosities against empirical and theoretical/analytic relations. To simulate the line emission from a universe of emitting clouds, we have incorporated random forest machine learning (ML) methods into our approach, allowing us to predict cosmologically evolving properties of CO, [\ion{C}{1}] and [\ion{C}{2}] emission from galaxies such as luminosity functions. We tested this model in 100,000 gas particles, and 2,500 galaxies, reaching an average accuracy of $\sim$99.8\% for all lines. Finally, we present the first model light cones created with realistic and ML-predicted CO, [\ion{C}{1}], and [\ion{C}{2}] luminosities in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, from $z=0$ to $z=10$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A model of a conducting cylinder with a radial temperature gradient which creates an electric field that increases with time in the surrounding vacuum is examined. The conditions under which this model functions are pointed out. An electric field is also generated when a magnetic field exists along the axis of the cylinder. This article discusses the interactions of the thermal flux, magnetic field, and charge distribution. Four models are considered with different conditions for the supply of electrons from a central source and the possibility either of capturing electrons inside the cylinder or their freely leaving it through the outer boundary.</description>

      <title>The PLATO Mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: PLATO (PLAnetary Transits and Oscillations of stars) is ESA's M3 mission designed to detect and characterise extrasolar planets and perform asteroseismic monitoring of a large number of stars. PLATO will detect small planets (down to &lt;2 R_(Earth)) around bright stars (&lt;11 mag), including terrestrial planets in the habitable zone of solar-like stars. With the complement of radial velocity observations from the ground, planets will be characterised for their radius, mass, and age with high accuracy (5 %, 10 %, 10 % for an Earth-Sun combination respectively). PLATO will provide us with a large-scale catalogue of well-characterised small planets up to intermediate orbital periods, relevant for a meaningful comparison to planet formation theories and to better understand planet evolution. It will make possible comparative exoplanetology to place our Solar System planets in a broader context. In parallel, PLATO will study (host) stars using asteroseismology, allowing us to determine the stellar properties with high accuracy, substantially enhancing our knowledge of stellar structure and evolution.
  The payload instrument consists of 26 cameras with 12cm aperture each. For at least four years, the mission will perform high-precision photometric measurements. Here we review the science objectives, present PLATO's target samples and fields, provide an overview of expected core science performance as well as a description of the instrument and the mission profile at the beginning of the serial production of the flight cameras. PLATO is scheduled for a launch date end 2026. This overview therefore provides a summary of the mission to the community in preparation of the upcoming operational phases.</description>
