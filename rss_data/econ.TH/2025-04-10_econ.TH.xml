      <title>Market, power, gift, and concession economies: Comparison using four-mode primitive network models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reducing wealth inequality is a global challenge, and the problems of capitalism stem from the enclosure of the commons and the breakdown of the community. According to previous studies by Polanyi, Karatani, and Graeber, economic modes can be divided into capitalist market economy (enclosure and exchange), power economy (de-enclosure and redistribution), gift economy (obligation to return and reciprocity), and concession economy (de-obligation to return). The concession economy reflects Graeber's baseline communism (from each according to their abilities, to each according to their needs) and Deguchi's We-turn philosophy (the "I" as an individual has a "fundamental incapability" and the subject of physical action, responsibility, and freedom is "We" as a multi-agent system, including the "I"). In this study, we constructed novel network models for these four modes and compared their properties (cluster coefficient, graph density, reciprocity, assortativity, centrality, and Gini coefficient). From the calculation results, it became clear that the market economy leads to inequality; the power economy mitigates inequality but cannot eliminate it; the gift and concession economies lead to a healthy and equal economy; and the concession economy, free from the ties of obligation to return, is possible without guaranteeing reciprocity. We intend to promote the transformation from a capitalist economy to a concession economy through activities that disseminate baseline communism and the We-turn philosophy that promotes concession, that is, developing a cooperative platform to support concession through information technology and empirical research through fieldwork.</description>

      <title>Ranking alternatives from opinions on criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A primary challenge in collective decision-making is that achieving unanimous agreement is difficult, even at the level of criteria. The history of social choice theory illustrates this: numerous normative criteria on voting rules have been proposed; however, disagreements persist regarding which criteria should take precedence. This study addresses the problem of ranking alternatives based on the aggregation of opinions over criteria that the alternatives might fulfill. Using the opinion aggregation model, we propose a new rule, termed the Intersection Initial Segment (IIS) rule, and characterize it using five axioms: neutrality, independence of the worst set, independence of the best set, weak intersection very important player, and independence of non-unanimous improvement. We illustrate our approach on a running example where the objective is to rank voting rules, showing that our opinion aggregation model is particularly well-suited to this context, and that the IIS rule is a counterpart to the method discussed in Nurmi's paper (2015).</description>

      <title>More connection, less community: network formation and local public goods provision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a model of network formation and public goods provision in local communities. Here, networks can sustain public good provision by spreading information about people's behaviour. I find a critical threshold in network connectedness at which public good provision drops sharply, even though agents are highly heterogeneous. Technology change can tear a community's social fabric by pushing high-skilled workers to withdraw from their local community. This can help explain rising resentment toward perceived ``elites'' -- their withdrawal actively harms those left behind. Moreover, well-meaning policies that upskill workers can make them worse off by reducing network connectedness.</description>

      <title>A Game Theoretic Treatment of Contagion in Trade Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global trade of material goods involves the potential to create pathways for the spread of infectious pathogens. One trade sector in which this synergy is clearly critical is that of wildlife trade networks. This highly complex system involves important and understudied bidirectional coupling between the economic decision making of the stakeholders and the contagion dynamics on the emergent trade network. While each of these components are independently well studied, there is a meaningful gap in understanding the feedback dynamics that can arise between them. In the present study, we describe a general game theoretic model for trade networks of goods susceptible to contagion. The primary result relies on the acyclic nature of the trade network and shows that, through the course of trading with stochastic infections, the probability of infection converges to a directly computable fixed point. This allows us to compute best responses and thus identify equilibria in the game. We present ways to use this model to describe and evaluate trade networks in terms of global and individual risk of infection under a wide variety of structural or individual modifications to the trade network. In capturing the bidirectional coupling of the system, we provide critical insight into the global and individual drivers and consequences for risks of infection inherent in and arising from the global wildlife trade, and any economic trade network with associated contagion risks.</description>

      <title>A Dominance Argument Against Incompleteness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article presents a new argument against many forms of moral and prudential value incompleteness. The argument relies on two central principles: (i) a weak "negative dominance" principle, to the effect that Lottery 1 is better than Lottery 2 only if some possible outcome of Lottery 1 is better than some possible outcome of Lottery 2, and (ii) a weak form of ex ante Pareto, to the effect that, if Lottery 1 gives an unambiguously better (stochastically dominant) prospect to some individuals than Lottery 2, and equally good prospects to everyone else, then Lottery 1 is better than Lottery 2. Given modest auxiliary assumptions, these two principles rule out incompleteness in the prudential ranking of individual lives, and many forms of incompleteness in the moral rankings of outcomes and lotteries.</description>

      <title>A theory of anticipated surprise for understanding risky intertemporal choices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19514v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: People often deviate from expected utility theory when making risky and intertemporal choices. While the effects of probabilistic risk and time delay have been extensively studied in isolation, their interplay and underlying theoretical basis are still under debate. In this work, we applied our previously proposed anticipated surprise framework to intertemporal choices with and without explicit probabilistic risk, assuming that delayed reward may fail to materialize at a fixed hazard rate. The model prediction is consistent with key empirical findings: time inconsistency and aversion to timing risk stem from the avoidance of large negative surprises, while differences in mental representations of outcome resolution explain the conflicting effects of probabilistic risk on temporal discounting. This framework is applicable to a broad range of decision-making problems and offers a new perspective over how various types of risk may interact.</description>

      <title>Voting power in the Council of the European Union: A comprehensive sensitivity analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16878v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Council of the European Union (EU) is one of the main decision-making bodies of the EU. A number of decisions require a qualified majority, the support of 55% of the member states (currently 15) that represent at least 65% of the total population. We investigate how the power distribution -- based on the Shapley--Shubik index -- and the proportion of winning coalitions change if these criteria are modified within reasonable bounds. The power of the two countries with about 4% of the total population each is found to be almost flat. The decisiveness index decreases if the population criterion is above 68% or the states criterion is at least 17. Some quota combinations contradict the principles of double majority. The proportion of winning coalitions can be increased from 13.2% to 20.8% (30.1%) such that the maximal relative change in the Shapley--Shubik indices remains below 3.5% (5.5%). Our results are indispensable in evaluating any proposal for reforming the qualified majority voting system.</description>
