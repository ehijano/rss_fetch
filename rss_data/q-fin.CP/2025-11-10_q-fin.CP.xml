      <title>Economic uncertainty and exchange rates linkage revisited: modelling tail dependence with high frequency data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to dig deeper into understanding the exchange rates and uncertainty dependence. Using the novel Baker et al. (2020)'s daily Twitter Uncertainty Index and BRICS exchange rates, we investigate their extreme tail dependence within an original time-varying copula framework. Our analysis makes several noteworthy results. Evidence for Indian, Russian and South African currencies indicates an elliptical copulas' dominance implying neither asymmetric features nor extreme movements in their dependence structure with the global economic uncertainty. Importantly, Brazilian and Chinese currencies tail dependence is upward trending suggesting a safe-haven role in times of high global economic uncertainty including the recent COVID-19 pandemic. In such circumstances, these markets offer opportunities to significant gains through portfolio diversification.</description>

      <title>NMIXX: Domain-Adapted Neural Embeddings for Cross-Lingual eXploration of Finance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: General-purpose sentence embedding models often struggle to capture specialized financial semantics, especially in low-resource languages like Korean, due to domain-specific jargon, temporal meaning shifts, and misaligned bilingual vocabularies. To address these gaps, we introduce NMIXX (Neural eMbeddings for Cross-lingual eXploration of Finance), a suite of cross-lingual embedding models fine-tuned with 18.8K high-confidence triplets that pair in-domain paraphrases, hard negatives derived from a semantic-shift typology, and exact Korean-English translations. Concurrently, we release KorFinSTS, a 1,921-pair Korean financial STS benchmark spanning news, disclosures, research reports, and regulations, designed to expose nuances that general benchmarks miss.
  When evaluated against seven open-license baselines, NMIXX's multilingual bge-m3 variant achieves Spearman's rho gains of +0.10 on English FinSTS and +0.22 on KorFinSTS, outperforming its pre-adaptation checkpoint and surpassing other models by the largest margin, while revealing a modest trade-off in general STS performance. Our analysis further shows that models with richer Korean token coverage adapt more effectively, underscoring the importance of tokenizer design in low-resource, cross-lingual settings. By making both models and the benchmark publicly available, we provide the community with robust tools for domain-adapted, multilingual representation learning in finance.</description>

      <title>Portfolio construction using a sampling-based variational quantum scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13557v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The efficient and effective construction of portfolios that adhere to real-world constraints is a challenging optimization task in finance. We investigate a concrete representation of the problem with a focus on design proposals of an Exchange Traded Fund. We evaluate the sampling-based CVaR Variational Quantum Algorithm (VQA), combined with a local-search post-processing, for solving problem instances that beyond a certain size become classically hard. We also propose a problem formulation that is suited for sampling-based VQA. Our utility-scale experiments on IBM Heron processors involve 109 qubits and up to 4200 gates, achieving a relative solution error of 0.49%. Results indicate that a combined quantum-classical workflow achieves better accuracy compared to purely classical local search, and that hard-to-simulate quantum circuits may lead to better convergence than simpler circuits. Our work paves the path to further explore portfolio construction with quantum computers.</description>
