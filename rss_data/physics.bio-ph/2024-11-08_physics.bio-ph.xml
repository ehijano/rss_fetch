      <title>Velocity fluctuation and force scaling during driven polymer transport through a nanopore</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by its central role in many biological processes, the transport of biopolymers across nanoscale pores is at the heart of a single-molecule sensing technology aimed at nucleic acid and protein sequencing, as well as biomarker detection. When electrophoretically driven through a pore by an electric potential gradient, a translocating polymer hinders the flow of ions, producing a transient current blockage signature that can be mapped to physicochemical properties of the polymer. Although investigated theoretically and by simulations, few experimental studies have attempted to validate the predicted transport properties, mainly due to the complex nature of the non-equilibrium translocation process. Here, we elucidate these fundamental concepts by constructing a patterned DNA nanostructure whose current signatures allow measurement of the instantaneous velocity throughout the translocation process. With simple physical insights from polymer and fluid dynamics, we show how the resulting molecular velocity profiles can be used to investigate the nanoscale forces at play and their dependence on experimental parameters such as polymer length, pore size and voltage. These results allow testing of theoretical models and outline their limitations. In addition to bridging experiment and theory, knowledge of the velocity fluctuation and force scaling during passage can assist researchers in designing nanopore experiments with optimized sensing performance.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of prebiotic synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, I outline the correspondence of vector partitions with the combinatorics of dynamical systems whose states are partitions of multisets. I use the notion of a limiting shape of vector partitions to determine properties of the equilibrium distribution for these systems. I investigate prebiotic systems as ergodic series of chemical reactions as an example. I determine under what conditions long polymers of RNA are favorable at equilibrium using the limit shape of the vector partitions.</description>

      <title>The Effect of a Knot on the Thermal Stability of Protein MJ0366: Insights from Molecular Dynamics and Monte Carlo Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein MJ0366 is a hypothetical protein from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii that has a rare and complex knot in its structure. The knot is a right-handed trefoil knot that involves about half of the protein's residues. In this article, we investigate the thermal stability of protein MJ0366 using numerical simulations based on molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo methods. We compare the results with those of a similar unknotted protein and analyze the effects of the knot on the folding and unfolding processes. We show that the knot in protein MJ0366 increases its thermal stability by creating a topological barrier that prevents the protein from unfolding at high temperatures. We also discuss the possible biological implications of the knot for the function and evolution of protein MJ0366.</description>

      <title>Odd Viscodiffusive Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a theory of "odd viscodiffusive fluids," which exhibit three-dimensional odd transport phenomena through the coupling of viscous and diffusive transport. In these fluids, diffusive fluxes may arise from orthogonal velocity gradients and, reciprocally, stresses may arise from concentration gradients. We examine microscopic fluctuations using the recently proposed "flux hypothesis" to derive Green-Kubo and reciprocal relations for the governing transport coefficients. These relations suggest that only parity symmetry, and not time-reversal symmetry, must be broken at the microscopic scale to observe these couplings. Chiral liquids, whether passive or active, are therefore a natural choice as viscodiffusive fluids. We then introduce two analytically tractable model systems, namely a generator and a corresponding reciprocal engine, which illustrate the nature of viscodiffusive cross-coupling in chiral matter and enable the experimental measurement of the novel transport coefficients. Finally, we make the case for chiral bacterial suspensions to be odd viscodiffusive fluids, and use our theory to predict the behaviors exhibited in prior experimental microfluidic studies involving bacterial migration in response to shearing flows.</description>

      <title>Strong anomalous diffusion for free-ranging birds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Natural and anomalous diffusion are widely observed and used to explore causes and consequences of movement across organisms, resulting in extensive use of the mean and mean-squared displacement (MSD). Using high-resolution data from over 70 million localizations of young and adult free-ranging Barn Owls (\textit{Tyto alba}), we demonstrate the necessity of a broad spectrum of displacement moments to characterize bird movement across scales. The mean and MSD -- interchangeable with moments $q=1$ and 2 -- are insufficient special cases. We reveal empirical strong anomalous diffusion as a nonlinear growth of displacement moments according to $\left&lt;|x(t)|^q\right&gt; \sim t^{\lambda(q)}$. The moment spectrum function $\lambda(q)$ displays piecewise linearity with a critical moment marking the crossover point between two scaling regimes, linked to a combination of age-specific behavioral modes. A critical timescale of five minutes marks an unexpected transition from a convex $\lambda_s(q)$ to a concave $\lambda_\ell(q)$, related to environmental and behavioral constraints. Using two stochastic models of varying ecological complexity, we demonstrate that strong anomalous diffusion may be widespread in animal movement, underscoring the importance of expanding analysis beyond the average and MSD.</description>

      <title>L\'evy distributed fluctuations in the living cell cortex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The actomyosin cortex is an active material that provides animal cells with a strong but flexible exterior, whose mechanics, including non-Gaussian fluctuations and occasional large displacements or cytoquakes, have defied explanation. We study the active fluctuations of the cortex using nanoscale tracking of arrays of flexible microposts adhered to multiple cultured cell types. When the confounding effects of static heterogeneity and tracking error are removed, the fluctuations are found to be heavy-tailed and well-described by a truncated L\'evy alpha-stable distribution over a wide range of timescales, in multiple cell types. The largest random displacements closely resemble the earlier-reported cytoquakes, but notably, we find these cytoquakes are not due to earthquake-like cooperative rearrangement of many cytoskeletal elements. Rather, they are indistinguishable from chance large excursions of a super-diffusive random process driven by heavy-tailed noise. The non-cooperative microscopic events driving these fluctuations need not be larger than the expected elastic energy of single tensed cortical actin filaments, and the implied distribution of microscopic event energies will need to be accounted for by future models of the cytoskeleton.</description>

      <title>A minimal model of cognition based on oscillatory and current-based reinforcement processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02520v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building mathematical models of brains is difficult because of the sheer complexity of the problem. One potential starting point is through basal cognition, which gives abstract representation of a range of organisms without central nervous systems, including fungi, slime moulds and bacteria. We propose one such model, demonstrating how a combination of oscillatory and current-based reinforcement processes can be used to couple resources in an efficient manner, mimicking the way these organisms function. A key ingredient in our model, not found in previous basal cognition models, is that we explicitly model oscillations in the number of particles (i.e. the nutrients, chemical signals or similar, which make up the biological system) and the flow of these particles within the modelled organisms. Using this approach, we find that our model builds efficient solutions, provided the environmental oscillations are sufficiently out of phase. We further demonstrate that amplitude differences can promote efficient solutions and that the system is robust to frequency differences. In the context of these findings, we discuss connections between our model and basal cognition in biological systems and slime moulds, in particular, how oscillations might contribute to self-organised problem-solving by these organisms.</description>

      <title>Characterizing RNA oligomers using Stochastic Titration Constant-pH Metadynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: RNA molecules exhibit various biological functions intrinsically dependent on their diverse ecosystem of highly flexible structures. This flexibility arises from complex hydrogen-bonding networks defined by canonical and non-canonical base pairs that require protonation events to stabilize or perturb these interactions. Constant pH molecular dynamics (CpHMD) methods provide a reliable framework to explore the conformational and protonation space of dynamic structures and for robust calculations of pH-dependent properties, such as the pK$_\mathrm{a}$ of titrable sites. Despite growing biological evidence concerning pH regulation of certain motifs and in biotechnological applications, pH-sensitive in silico methods have rarely been applied to nucleic acids. In this work, we extended the stochastic titration CpHMD method to include RNA parameters from the standard $\chi$OL3 AMBER force field and highlighted its capability to depict titration events of nucleotides in single-stranded RNAs. We validated the method using trimers and pentamers with a single central titrable site while integrating a well-tempered metadynamics approach into the st-CpHMD methodology (CpH-MetaD) using PLUMED. This approach enhanced the convergence of the conformational landscape and enabled more efficient sampling of protonation-conformation coupling. Our pK$_\mathrm{a}$ estimates agree with experimental data, validating the method's ability to reproduce electrostatic changes around a titrable nucleobase in single-stranded RNA. These findings provided molecular insight into intramolecular phenomena, such as nucleobase stacking and phosphate interactions, that dictate the experimentally observed pK$_\mathrm{a}$ shifts between different strands. Overall, this work validates both the st-CpHMD and the metadynamics integration as reliable tools for studying biologically relevant RNA systems.</description>
