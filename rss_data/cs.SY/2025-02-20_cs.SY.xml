      <title>Observability-Blocking Controls for Double-Integrator and Higher Order Integrator Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of state-feedback controls to block observability at remote nodes is studied for double integrator network (DIN) and higher order integrator network models. A preliminary design algorithm is presented first for DIN that requires $m+2$ actuation nodes to block observability for the measurement obtained from a set of $m$ nodes. The algorithm is based on eigenstructure assignment technique and leverages the properties of the eigenvectors in DIN. Next, the topological structure of the network is exploited to reduce the number of controllers required for blocking observability. The number of actuation nodes in sparser design depends on the cardinality of a cutset separating the actuation and measurement locations. Later, the design principles are generalized for blocking observability in $N$-th order integrator network models.</description>

      <title>An Uncertainty-Aware Data-Driven Predictive Controller for Hybrid Power Plants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the advancements in data-driven modeling for complex engineering and scientific applications, this work utilizes a data-driven predictive control method, namely subspace predictive control, to coordinate hybrid power plant components and meet a desired power demand despite the presence of weather uncertainties. An uncertainty-aware data-driven predictive controller is proposed, and its potential is analyzed using real-world electricity demand profiles. For the analysis, a hybrid power plant with wind, solar, and co-located energy storage capacity of 4 MW each is considered. The analysis shows that the predictive controller can track a real-world-inspired electricity demand profile despite the presence of weather-induced uncertainties and be an intelligent forecaster for HPP performance.</description>

      <title>A Note on Structural Controllability and Observability Indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we investigate the structural controllability and observability indices of structured systems. We provide counter-examples showing that an existing graph-theoretic characterization for the structural controllability index (SCOI) may not hold, even for systems with self-loop at every state node. We further demonstrate that this characterization actually provides upper bounds, and extend them to new graph-theoretic characterizations applicable to systems that are not necessarily structurally controllable. Additionally, we reveal that an existing method may fail to obtain the exact SCOI. Consequently, complete graph-theoretic characterizations and polynomial-time computation of SCOI remain open. Given this, we present an efficiently computable tight lower bound, whose tightness is validated by numerical simulations. All these results apply to the structural observability index by the duality between controllability and observability.</description>

      <title>Empirical Study of Dynamic Regret in Online Model Predictive Control for Linear Time-Varying Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a widely used technique for managing timevarying systems, supported by extensive theoretical analysis. While theoretical studies employing dynamic regret frameworks have established robust performance guarantees, their empirical validation remains sparse. This paper investigates the practical applicability of MPC by empirically evaluating the assumptions and theoretical results proposed by Lin et al. [2022]. Specifically, we analyze the performance of online MPC under varying prediction errors and prediction horizons in Linear Time-Varying (LTV) systems. Our study examines the relationship between dynamic regret, prediction errors, and prediction horizons, providing insights into the trade-offs involved. By bridging theory and practice, this work advances the understanding and application of MPC in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Kernel Mean Embedding Topology: Weak and Strong Forms for Stochastic Kernels and Implications for Model Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel topology, called Kernel Mean Embedding Topology, for stochastic kernels, in a weak and strong form. This topology, defined on the spaces of Bochner integrable functions from a signal space to a space of probability measures endowed with a Hilbert space structure, allows for a versatile formulation. This construction allows one to obtain both a strong and weak formulation. (i) For its weak formulation, we highlight the utility on relaxed policy spaces, and investigate connections with the Young narrow topology and Borkar (or \( w^* \))-topology, and establish equivalence properties. We report that, while both the \( w^* \)-topology and kernel mean embedding topology are relatively compact, they are not closed. Conversely, while the Young narrow topology is closed, it lacks relative compactness. (ii) We show that the strong form provides an appropriate formulation for placing topologies on spaces of models characterized by stochastic kernels with explicit robustness and learning theoretic implications on optimal stochastic control under discounted or average cost criteria. (iii) We show that this topology possesses several properties making it ideal to study optimality, approximations, robustness and continuity properties. In particular, the kernel mean embedding topology has a Hilbert space structure, which is particularly useful for approximating stochastic kernels through simulation data.</description>

      <title>Implementation of an IEEE 802.11ax-Based Maritime Mesh Network in the Red Sea</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we explore the limitations of satellite phones in meeting the communication needs of fishermen operating in the Red Sea. We propose AX-MMN, a maritime mesh network based on the IEEE 802.11ax standard, to address these shortcomings of satellite phones and outline AX-MMN's system architecture. To validate the performance of AX-MMN, we conduct extensive real-world experiments, demonstrating its potential to enhance maritime connectivity significantly. We also discuss the broader benefits of AX-MMN, particularly for fishermen in underdeveloped East African countries bordering the Red Sea, emphasizing its capacity to improve their communication capabilities and overall quality of life.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Data-Enabled Policy Optimization Approach for Autonomous Bicycle Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a unified control framework that integrates a Feedback Linearization (FL) controller in the inner loop with an adaptive Data-Enabled Policy Optimization (DeePO) controller in the outer loop to balance an autonomous bicycle. While the FL controller stabilizes and partially linearizes the inherently unstable and nonlinear system, its performance is compromised by unmodeled dynamics and time-varying characteristics. To overcome these limitations, the DeePO controller is introduced to enhance adaptability and robustness. The initial control policy of DeePO is obtained from a finite set of offline, persistently exciting input and state data. To improve stability and compensate for system nonlinearities and disturbances, a robustness-promoting regularizer refines the initial policy, while the adaptive section of the DeePO framework is enhanced with a forgetting factor to improve adaptation to time-varying dynamics. The proposed DeePO+FL approach is evaluated through simulations and real-world experiments on an instrumented autonomous bicycle. Results demonstrate its superiority over the FL-only approach, achieving more precise tracking of the reference lean angle and lean rate.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical RL-MPC for Demand Response Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a hierarchical framework for demand response optimization in air separation units (ASUs) that combines reinforcement learning (RL) with linear model predictive control (LMPC). We investigate two control architectures: a direct RL approach and a control-informed methodology where an RL agent provides setpoints to a lower-level LMPC. The proposed RL-LMPC framework demonstrates improved sample efficiency during training and better constraint satisfaction compared to direct RL control. Using an industrial ASU case study, we show that our approach successfully manages operational constraints while optimizing electricity costs under time-varying pricing. Results indicate that the RL-LMPC architecture achieves comparable economic performance to direct RL while providing better robustness and requiring fewer training samples to converge. The framework offers a practical solution for implementing flexible operation strategies in process industries, bridging the gap between data-driven methods and traditional control approaches.</description>

      <title>PEDRO-V: From a concurrent engineering case study to a promising phase zero mission definition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Each year, the European Space Agency (ESA) organizes challenges for university students, from BSc to PhD levels. The ESA Concurrent Engineering Challange 2024 was hosted by four Concurrent Design Facilites (CDF) across Europe: ESEC Galazia, ISAE SUPAERO, the University of Athens, and the University of Portsmouth. A total of 102 students participated in the event. Over five days, students worked on a feasibility study for a space mission, simulating ESA's design session at ESTEC, the ESA headquarters. Students were divided into specializes groups based on their backgrounds, reflecting ESA's concurrent engineering teams. This paper discusses the design of subsystems by students, their trade-off results, and the outcomes of the CDF study. It highlights the effectiveness of concurrent engineering, which enabled rapid and efficient results even from non-esxpert teams. The future development roadmap and lessons learned are also presented. The students used CDP4-Comet software within the replicated ESA CDF, resulting in the PEDRO-V mission proposal: Planetary Exploration Deployment and Research Operation - Venus. The teams collaboratively defined the Concept of Operations, identified actors, worst-case scenarios, use cases, and activities. Their output included a list of requirements, a draft product breakdown structure, and key subsystems information. The concurrent engineering process led to continuous improvement and convergence of key parameters. This approach proved to be effective by aligning different teams' solutions and comparing them to similar missions. The PEDRO-V mission feasibility was confirmed, demonstrating the potential of concurrent engineering in accademic settings for space missions. (summarized with AI)</description>

      <title>Class E/EF Inductive Power Transfer to Achieve Stable Output under Variable Low Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops an inductive power transfer(IPT)system with stable output power based on a Class E/EF inverter. Load-independent design of Class E/EF inverter has recently attracted widespread interest. However, applying this design to IPT systems has proven challenging when the coupling coefficient is weak. To solve this issue, this paper uses an expanded impedance model and substitutes the secondary side's perfect resonance with a detuned design. Therefore, the system can maintain stable output even under a low coupling coefficient. A 400 kHz experimental prototype validates these findings. The experimental results indicate that the output power fluctuation remains within 15% as the coupling coefficient varies from 0.04 to 0.07. The peak power efficiency achieving 91%</description>

      <title>Highly Dynamic and Flexible Spatio-Temporal Spectrum Management with AI-Driven O-RAN: A Multi-Granularity Marketplace Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current spectrum-sharing frameworks struggle with adaptability, often being either static or insufficiently dynamic. They primarily emphasize temporal sharing while overlooking spatial and spectral dimensions. We propose an adaptive, AI-driven spectrum-sharing framework within the O-RAN architecture, integrating discriminative and generative AI (GenAI) to forecast spectrum needs across multiple timescales and spatial granularities. A marketplace model, managed by an authorized spectrum broker, enables operators to trade spectrum dynamically, balancing static assignments with real-time trading. GenAI enhances traffic prediction, spectrum estimation, and allocation, optimizing utilization while reducing costs. This modular, flexible approach fosters operator collaboration, maximizing efficiency and revenue. A key research challenge is refining allocation granularity and spatio-temporal dynamics beyond existing models.</description>

      <title>Conveniently Identify Coils in Inductive Power Transfer System Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-frequency inductive power transfer (IPT) has garnered significant attention in recent years due to its long transmission distance and high efficiency. The inductance values L and quality factors Q of the transmitting and receiving coils greatly influence the system's operation. Traditional methods involved impedance analyzers or network analyzers for measurement, which required bulky and costly equipment. Moreover, disassembling it for re-measurement is impractical once the product is packaged. Alternatively, simulation software such as HYSS can serve for the identification. Nevertheless, in the case of very high frequencies, the simulation process consumes a significant amount of time due to the skin and proximity effects. More importantly, obtaining parameters through simulation software becomes impractical when the coil design is more complex. This paper firstly employs a machine learning approach for the identification task. We simply input images of the coils and operating frequency into a well-trained model. This method enables rapid identification of the coil's L and Q values anytime and anywhere, without the need for expensive machinery or coil disassembly.</description>

      <title>System-level Analysis of Dual-Mode Networked Sensing: ISAC Integration &amp; Coordination Gains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper characterizes integration and coordination gains in dense millimeter-wave ISAC networks through a dual-mode framework that combines monostatic and multistatic sensing. A comprehensive system-level analysis is conducted, accounting for base station (BS) density, power allocation, antenna misalignment, radar cross-section (RCS) fluctuations, clutter, bistatic geometry, channel fading, and self-interference cancellation (SIC) efficiency. Using stochastic geometry, coverage probabilities and ergodic rates for sensing and communication are derived, revealing tradeoffs among BS density, beamwidth, and power allocation. It is shown that the communication performance sustained reliable operation despite the overlaid sensing functionality. In contrast, the results reveal the foundational role of spatial sensing diversity, driven by the dual-mode operation, to compensate for the weak sensing reflections and vulnerability to imperfect SIC along with interference and clutter. To this end, we identify a system transition from monostatic to multistatic-dominant sensing operation as a function of the SIC efficiency. In the latter case, using six multistatic BSs instead of a single bistatic receiver improved sensing coverage probability by over 100%, highlighting the coordination gain. Moreover, comparisons with pure communication networks confirm substantial integration gain. Specifically, dual-mode networked sensing with four cooperative BSs can double throughput, while multistatic sensing alone improves throughput by over 50%.</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity Cooperative Payload Transportation for Nonholonomic Mobile Robots Under Scalable Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cooperative transportation, a key aspect of logistics
  cyber-physical systems (CPS), is typically approached using dis tributed control and optimization-based methods. The distributed
  control methods consume less time, but poorly handle and extend
  to multiple constraints. Instead, optimization-based methods
  handle constraints effectively, but they are usually centralized,
  time-consuming and thus not easily scalable to numerous robots.
  To overcome drawbacks of both, we propose a novel cooperative
  transportation method for nonholonomic mobile robots by im proving conventional formation control, which is distributed, has
  a low time-complexity and accommodates scalable constraints.
  The proposed control-based method is testified on a cable suspended payload and divided into two parts, including robot
  trajectory generation and trajectory tracking. Unlike most time consuming trajectory generation methods, ours can generate
  trajectories with only constant time-complexity, needless of global
  maps. As for trajectory tracking, our control-based method not
  only scales easily to multiple constraints as those optimization based methods, but reduces their time-complexity from poly nomial to linear. Simulations and experiments can verify the
  feasibility of our method.</description>

      <title>Generative Predictive Control: Flow Matching Policies for Dynamic and Difficult-to-Demonstrate Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative control policies have recently unlocked major progress in robotics. These methods produce action sequences via diffusion or flow matching, with training data provided by demonstrations. But despite enjoying considerable success on difficult manipulation problems, generative policies come with two key limitations. First, behavior cloning requires expert demonstrations, which can be time-consuming and expensive to obtain. Second, existing methods are limited to relatively slow, quasi-static tasks. In this paper, we leverage a tight connection between sampling-based predictive control and generative modeling to address each of these issues. In particular, we introduce generative predictive control, a supervised learning framework for tasks with fast dynamics that are easy to simulate but difficult to demonstrate. We then show how trained flow-matching policies can be warm-started at run-time, maintaining temporal consistency and enabling fast feedback rates. We believe that generative predictive control offers a complementary approach to existing behavior cloning methods, and hope that it paves the way toward generalist policies that extend beyond quasi-static demonstration-oriented tasks.</description>

      <title>Probabilistically Robust Uncertainty Analysis and Optimal Control of Continuous Lyophilization via Polynomial Chaos Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lyophilization, aka freeze drying, is a process commonly used to increase the stability of various drug products in biotherapeutics manufacturing, e.g., mRNA vaccines, allowing for higher storage temperature. While the current trends in the industry are moving towards continuous manufacturing, the majority of industrial lyophilization processes are still being operated in a batch mode. This article presents a framework that accounts for the probabilistic uncertainty during the primary and secondary drying steps in continuous lyophilization. The probabilistic uncertainty is incorporated into the mechanistic model via polynomial chaos theory (PCT). The resulting PCT-based model is able to accurately and efficiently quantify the effects of uncertainty on several critical process variables, including the temperature, sublimation front, and concentration of bound water. The integration of the PCT-based model into stochastic optimization and control is demonstrated. The proposed framework and case studies can be used to guide the design and control of continuous lyophilization while accounting for probabilistic uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Multi-Target Radar Search and Track Using Sequence-Capable Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The research addresses sensor task management for radar systems, focusing on efficiently searching and tracking multiple targets using reinforcement learning. The approach develops a 3D simulation environment with an active electronically scanned array radar, using a multi-target tracking algorithm to improve observation data quality. Three neural network architectures were compared including an approach using fated recurrent units with multi-headed self-attention. Two pre-training techniques were applied: behavior cloning to approximate a random search strategy and an auto-encoder to pre-train the feature extractor. Experimental results revealed that search performance was relatively consistent across most methods. The real challenge emerged in simultaneously searching and tracking targets. The multi-headed self-attention architecture demonstrated the most promising results, highlighting the potential of sequence-capable architectures in handling dynamic tracking scenarios. The key contribution lies in demonstrating how reinforcement learning can optimize sensor management, potentially improving radar systems' ability to identify and track multiple targets in complex environments.</description>

      <title>Learning to explore when mistakes are not allowed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning (GCRL) provides a versatile framework for developing unified controllers capable of handling wide ranges of tasks, exploring environments, and adapting behaviors. However, its reliance on trial-and-error poses challenges for real-world applications, as errors can result in costly and potentially damaging consequences. To address the need for safer learning, we propose a method that enables agents to learn goal-conditioned behaviors that explore without the risk of making harmful mistakes. Exploration without risks can seem paradoxical, but environment dynamics are often uniform in space, therefore a policy trained for safety without exploration purposes can still be exploited globally. Our proposed approach involves two distinct phases. First, during a pretraining phase, we employ safe reinforcement learning and distributional techniques to train a safety policy that actively tries to avoid failures in various situations. In the subsequent safe exploration phase, a goal-conditioned (GC) policy is learned while ensuring safety. To achieve this, we implement an action-selection mechanism leveraging the previously learned distributional safety critics to arbitrate between the safety policy and the GC policy, ensuring safe exploration by switching to the safety policy when needed. We evaluate our method in simulated environments and demonstrate that it not only provides substantial coverage of the goal space but also reduces the occurrence of mistakes to a minimum, in stark contrast to traditional GCRL approaches. Additionally, we conduct an ablation study and analyze failure modes, offering insights for future research directions.</description>

      <title>Practical Challenges for Reliable RIS Deployment in Heterogeneous Multi-Operator Multi-Band Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15867v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have been introduced as arrays of nearly passive elements with software-tunable electromagnetic properties to dynamically manipulate the reflection/transmission of radio signals. Research works in this area are focused on two applications, namely {\it user-assist} RIS aiming at tuning the RIS to enhance the quality-of-service (QoS) of target users, and the {\it malicious} RIS aiming for an attacker to degrade the QoS at victim receivers through generating {\it intended} destructive interference. While both user-assist and malicious RIS applications have been explored extensively, the impact of RIS deployments on imposing {\it unintended} interference on various wireless user-equipments (EUs) remains underexplored. This paper investigates the challenges of integrating RISs into multi-carrier, multi-user, and multi-operator networks. We discuss how RIS deployments intended to benefit specific users can negatively impact other users served at various carrier frequencies through different network operators. While not an ideal solution, we discuss how ultra-narrowband metasurfaces can be incorporated into the manufacturing of RISs to mitigate some challenges of RIS deployment in wireless networks. We also present a simulation scenario to illuminate some practical challenges associated with the deployment of RISs in shared public environments.</description>

      <title>Collision Avoidance for Convex Primitives via Differentiable Optimization Based High-Order Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ensuring the safety of dynamical systems is crucial, where collision avoidance is a primary concern. Recently, control barrier functions (CBFs) have emerged as an effective method to integrate safety constraints into control synthesis through optimization techniques. However, challenges persist when dealing with convex primitives and tasks requiring torque control, as well as the occurrence of unintended equilibria. This work addresses these challenges by introducing a high-order CBF (HOCBF) framework for collision avoidance among convex primitives. We transform nonconvex safety constraints into linear constraints by differentiable optimization and prove the high-order continuous differentiability. Then, we employ HOCBFs to accommodate torque control, enabling tasks involving forces or high dynamics. Additionally, we analyze the issue of spurious equilibria in high-order cases and propose a circulation mechanism to prevent the undesired equilibria on the boundary of the safe set. Finally, we validate our framework with three experiments on the Franka Research 3 robotic manipulator, demonstrating successful collision avoidance and the efficacy of the circulation mechanism.</description>

      <title>Weather-Driven Priority Charging for Battery Storage Systems in Hybrid Renewable Energy Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of renewable energy into the power grid is often hindered by its fragmented infrastructure, leading to inefficient utilization due to the variability of energy production and its reliance on weather conditions. Battery storage systems, while essential for stabilizing energy supply, face challenges like sub-optimal energy distribution, accelerating battery degradation, and reducing operational efficiency. This paper presents a novel solution to these challenges by developing a large-scale, interconnected renewable energy network that optimizes energy storage and distribution. The proposed system includes strategically placed battery storage facilities that stabilize energy production by compensating for fluctuations in renewable output. A priority charging algorithm, informed by real-time weather forecasting and load monitoring, ensures that the most suitable battery systems are charged under varying conditions. Within each storage facility, a secondary priority charging algorithm minimizes battery degradation by ranking batteries based on critical parameters such as state of health (SoH) and state of charge (SoC) and deciding which to charge. This comprehensive approach enhances the efficiency and longevity of battery storage systems, offering a more reliable and resilient renewable energy infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Trajectory Map-Matching in Urban Road Networks Based on RSS Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes an RSS-based approach to reconstruct vehicle trajectories within a road network, enforcing signal propagation rules and vehicle mobility constraints to mitigate the impact of RSS noise and sparsity. The key challenge lies in leveraging latent spatiotemporal correlations within RSS data while navigating complex road networks. To address this, we develop a Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based RSS embedding (HRE) technique that employs alternating optimization to infer vehicle trajectories from RSS measurements. This model captures spatiotemporal dependencies while a road graph ensures network compliance. Additionally, we introduce a maximum speed-constrained rough trajectory estimation (MSR) method to guide the optimization process, enabling rapid convergence to a favorable local solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the impacts of U-turn configurations on intersection safety and traffic operations is essential for developing effective strategies to enhance road safety and efficiency. Extensive research has been conducted to investigate the role of geometric designs, driver behavior, and advanced technologies in mitigating crash risks and improving traffic flow at U-turn facilities. By synthesizing this collective body of work through the guidelines of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), this paper provides a valuable resource for transportation professionals, policymakers, and researchers seeking evidence-based solutions. This systematic review draws on studies from diverse traffic environments and regional contexts, focusing on innovative design interventions, such as restricted crossing U-turns (RCUTs) and median U-turn intersections (MUTs), as well as integrated strategies leveraging technological advancements. By presenting a comprehensive analysis of U-turn-related challenges and opportunities, this review contributes to advancing transportation safety research and guiding the development of adaptive strategies tailored to varied traffic conditions and evolving technologies.</description>

      <title>Variation Bayesian Interference for Multiple Extended Targets or Unresolved Group Targets Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15226v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a tracking method for multiple extended targets or unresolvable group targets based on the Variational Bayesian Inference (VBI). Firstly, based on the most commonly used Random Matrix Model (RMM), the joint states of a single target are modeled as a Gamma Gaussian Inverse Wishart (GGIW) distribution, and the multi-target joint association variables are involved in the estimation together as unknown information with a prior distribution. A shape evolution model and VBI are employed to address the shortcomings of the RMM. Through the VBI, we can derive the approximate variational posterior for the exact multi-target posterior. Furthermore, to demonstrate the applicability of the method in real-world tracking scenarios, we present two potential lightweight schemes. The first is based on clustering, which effectively prunes the joint association events. The second is a simplification of the variational posterior through marginal association probabilities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method using simulation experiments, and the proposed method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and adaptability. This manuscript is only a preprint version, a completer and more official version will be uploaded as soon as possible</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-connectivity (MC) in satellite-terrestrial integrated networks (STINs), included in the Third-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standards, is regarded as a promising technology for future networks, especially the non-terrestrial network (NTN). The significant advantages of MC in improving coverage, communication, and sensing through satellite-terrestrial collaboration have sparked widespread interest. This article introduces three fundamental deployment architectures of MC systems in STINs, including multi-satellite, single-satellite single-base-station, and multi-satellite multi-base-station configurations. Considering the emerging but still evolving satellite networking, we explore system design challenges such as satellite networking schemes, such as cell-free and multi-tier satellite networks. Subsequently, key technical challenges severely influencing the quality of mutual communications, including beamforming, channel estimation, and synchronization, are discussed. Furthermore, typical applications such as coverage enhancement, traffic offloading, collaborative sensing, and low-altitude communication are demonstrated, followed by a case study comparing coverage performance in MC and single-connectivity (SC) configurations. Several essential future research directions for MC in STINs are presented to facilitate further exploration.</description>
