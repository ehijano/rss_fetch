      <title>A Transdisciplinary Approach to Cybersecurity: A Framework for Encouraging Transdisciplinary Thinking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical cybersecurity is often perceived as a rigid science discipline filled with computer scientists and mathematicians. However, due to the rapid pace of technology development and integration, new criminal enterprises, new defense tactics, and the understanding of the human element, cybersecurity is quickly beginning to encompass more than just computers. Cybersecurity experts must broaden their perspectives beyond traditional disciplinary boundaries to provide the best protection possible. They must start to practice transdisciplinary cybersecurity. Taking influence from the Stakeholder Theory in business ethics, this paper presents a framework to encourage transdisciplinary thinking and assist experts in tackling the new challenges of the modern day. The framework uses the simple Think, Plan, Do approach to enable experts to develop their transdisciplinary thinking. The framework is intended to be used as an evaluation tool for existing cybersecurity practices or postures, as a development tool to engage with other disciplines to foster learning and create new methods, and as a guidance tool to encourage new ways of thinking about, perceiving, and executing cybersecurity practices. For each of those intended uses, a use case is presented as an example to showcase how the framework might be used. The ultimate goal of this paper is not the framework but transdisciplinary thinking. By using the tool presented here and developing their own transdisciplinary thinking, cybersecurity experts can be better prepared to face cybersecurity's unique and complex challenges.</description>

      <title>Dealing Doubt: Unveiling Threat Models in Gradient Inversion Attacks under Federated Learning, A Survey and Taxonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a leading paradigm for decentralized, privacy preserving machine learning training. However, recent research on gradient inversion attacks (GIAs) have shown that gradient updates in FL can leak information on private training samples. While existing surveys on GIAs have focused on the honest-but-curious server threat model, there is a dearth of research categorizing attacks under the realistic and far more privacy-infringing cases of malicious servers and clients. In this paper, we present a survey and novel taxonomy of GIAs that emphasize FL threat models, particularly that of malicious servers and clients. We first formally define GIAs and contrast conventional attacks with the malicious attacker. We then summarize existing honest-but-curious attack strategies, corresponding defenses, and evaluation metrics. Critically, we dive into attacks with malicious servers and clients to highlight how they break existing FL defenses, focusing specifically on reconstruction methods, target model architectures, target data, and evaluation metrics. Lastly, we discuss open problems and future research directions.</description>

      <title>Generative AI for Secure and Privacy-Preserving Mobile Crowdsensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, generative AI has attracted much attention from both academic and industrial fields, which has shown its potential, especially in the data generation and synthesis aspects. Simultaneously, secure and privacy-preserving mobile crowdsensing (SPPMCS) has been widely applied in data collection/ acquirement due to an advantage on low deployment cost, flexible implementation, and high adaptability. Since generative AI can generate new synthetic data to replace the original data to be analyzed and processed, it can lower data attacks and privacy leakage risks for the original data. Therefore, integrating generative AI into SPPMCS is feasible and significant. Moreover, this paper investigates an integration of generative AI in SPPMCS, where we present potential research focuses, solutions, and case studies. Specifically, we firstly review the preliminaries for generative AI and SPPMCS, where their integration potential is presented. Then, we discuss research issues and solutions for generative AI-enabled SPPMCS, including security defense of malicious data injection, illegal authorization, malicious spectrum manipulation at the physical layer, and privacy protection on sensing data content, sensing terminals' identification and location. Next, we propose a framework for sensing data content protection with generative AI, and simulations results have clearly demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Finally, we present major research directions for generative AI-enabled SPPMCS.</description>

      <title>SMARD: A Cost Effective Smart Agro Development Technology for Crops Disease Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agriculture has a significant role in a country's economy. The "SMARD" project aims to strengthen the country's agricultural sector by giving farmers with the information and tools they need to solve common difficulties and increase productivity. The project provides farmers with information on crop care, seed selection, and disease management best practices, as well as access to tools for recognizing and treating crop diseases. Farmers can also contact the expert panel through text message, voice call, or video call to purchase fertilizer, seeds, and pesticides at low prices, as well as secure bank loans. The project's goal is to empower farmers and rural communities by providing them with the resources they need to increase crop yields. Additionally, the "SMARD" will not only help farmers and rural communities live better lives, but it will also have a good effect on the economy of the nation. Farmers are now able to recognize plant illnesses more quickly because of the application of machine learning techniques based on image processing categorization. Our experiments' results show that our system "SMARD" outperforms the cutting-edge web applications by attaining 97.3% classification accuracy and 96% F1-score in crop disease classification. Overall, our project is an important endeavor for the nation's agricultural sector because its main goal is to give farmers the information, resources, and tools they need to increase crop yields, improve economic outcomes, and improve livelihoods.</description>

      <title>Seeing is (Not) Believing: Practical Phishing Attacks Targeting Social Media Sharing Cards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the digital era, Online Social Networks (OSNs) play a crucial role in information dissemination, with sharing cards for link previews emerging as a key feature. These cards offer snapshots of shared content, including titles, descriptions, and images. In this study, we investigate the construction and dissemination mechanisms of these cards, focusing on two primary server-side generation methods based on Share-SDK and HTML meta tags. Our investigation reveals a novel type of attack, i.e., Sharing Card Forgery (SCF) attack that can be exploited to create forged benign sharing cards for malicious links. We demonstrate the feasibility of these attacks through practical implementations and evaluate their effectiveness across 13 various online social networks. Our findings indicate a significant risk, as the deceptive cards can evade detection and persist on social platforms, thus posing a substantial threat to user security. We also delve into countermeasures and discuss the challenges in effectively mitigating these types of attacks. This study not only sheds light on a novel phishing technique but also calls for heightened awareness and improved defensive strategies in the OSN ecosystem.</description>

      <title>The MESA Security Model 2.0: A Dynamic Framework for Mitigating Stealth Data Exfiltration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rising complexity of cyber threats calls for a comprehensive reassessment of current security frameworks in business environments. This research focuses on Stealth Data Exfiltration, a significant cyber threat characterized by covert infiltration, extended undetectability, and unauthorized dissemination of confidential data. Our findings reveal that conventional defense-in-depth strategies often fall short in combating these sophisticated threats, highlighting the immediate need for a shift in information risk management across businesses. The evolving nature of cyber threats, driven by advancements in techniques such as social engineering, multi-vector attacks, and Generative AI, underscores the need for robust, adaptable, and comprehensive security strategies. As we navigate this complex landscape, it is crucial to anticipate potential threats and continually update our defenses. We propose a shift from traditional perimeter-based, prevention-focused models, which depend on a static attack surface, to a more dynamic framework that prepares for inevitable breaches. This suggested model, known as MESA 2.0 Security Model, prioritizes swift detection, immediate response, and ongoing resilience, thereby enhancing an organizations ability to promptly identify and neutralize threats, significantly reducing the consequences of security breaches. This study suggests that businesses adopt a forward-thinking and adaptable approach to security management to stay ahead of the ever-changing cyber threat landscape.</description>

      <title>POSTER: Testing network-based RTK for GNSS receiver security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) provide precise location, while Real Time Kinematics (RTK) allow mobile receivers (termed rovers), leveraging fixed stations, to correct errors in their Position Navigation and Timing (PNT) solution. This allows compensating for multi-path effects, ionospheric errors, and observation biases, enabling consumer receivers to achieve centimeter-level accuracy. While network distribution of correction streams can be protected with common secure networking practices, the reference stations can still be attacked by GNSS spoofing or jamming. This work investigates (i) the effect RTK reference station spoofing has on the rover's PNT solution quality and (ii) the potential countermeasures towards hardening the RTK infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Not All Prompts Are Secure: A Switchable Backdoor Attack Against Pre-trained Vision Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given the power of vision transformers, a new learning paradigm, pre-training and then prompting, makes it more efficient and effective to address downstream visual recognition tasks. In this paper, we identify a novel security threat towards such a paradigm from the perspective of backdoor attacks. Specifically, an extra prompt token, called the switch token in this work, can turn the backdoor mode on, i.e., converting a benign model into a backdoored one. Once under the backdoor mode, a specific trigger can force the model to predict a target class. It poses a severe risk to the users of cloud API, since the malicious behavior can not be activated and detected under the benign mode, thus making the attack very stealthy. To attack a pre-trained model, our proposed attack, named SWARM, learns a trigger and prompt tokens including a switch token. They are optimized with the clean loss which encourages the model always behaves normally even the trigger presents, and the backdoor loss that ensures the backdoor can be activated by the trigger when the switch is on. Besides, we utilize the cross-mode feature distillation to reduce the effect of the switch token on clean samples. The experiments on diverse visual recognition tasks confirm the success of our switchable backdoor attack, i.e., achieving 95%+ attack success rate, and also being hard to be detected and removed. Our code is available at https://github.com/20000yshust/SWARM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cryptocurrency can be understood as a digital asset transacted among participants in the crypto economy. Every cryptocurrency must have an associated Blockchain. Blockchain is a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) which supports cryptocurrencies, this may be considered as the most promising disruptive technology in the industry 4.0 context. Decentralized finance (DeFi) is a Blockchain-based financial infrastructure, the term generally refers to an open, permissionless, and highly interoperable protocol stack built on public smart contract platforms, such as the Ethereum Blockchain. It replicates existing financial services in a more open and transparent way. DeFi does not rely on intermediaries and centralized institutions. Instead, it is based on open protocols and decentralized applications (Dapps). Considering that there are many digital coins, stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), these currencies should interact among each other sometime. For this interaction the Information Technology elements play an important whole as enablers and IT strategic alignment. This paper considers the strategic alignment model proposed by Henderson and Venkatraman (1993) and Luftman (1996). This paper seeks to answer two main questions 1) What are the common IT elements in the DeFi? And 2) How the elements connect to the IT strategic alignment in DeFi? Through a Systematic Literature Review (SLR). Results point out that there are many IT elements already mentioned by literature, however there is a lack in the literature about the connection between IT elements and IT strategic alignment in a Decentralized Finance (DeFi) architectural network. After final considerations, limitations and future research agenda are presented. Keywords: IT Strategic alignment, Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Cryptocurrency, Digital Economy.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Graph Backdoor Attacks: A Distribution-Preserving Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable performance in various tasks. However, recent works reveal that GNNs are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Generally, backdoor attack poisons the graph by attaching backdoor triggers and the target class label to a set of nodes in the training graph. A GNN trained on the poisoned graph will then be misled to predict test nodes attached with trigger to the target class. Despite their effectiveness, our empirical analysis shows that triggers generated by existing methods tend to be out-of-distribution (OOD), which significantly differ from the clean data. Hence, these injected triggers can be easily detected and pruned with widely used outlier detection methods in real-world applications. Therefore, in this paper, we study a novel problem of unnoticeable graph backdoor attacks with in-distribution (ID) triggers. To generate ID triggers, we introduce an OOD detector in conjunction with an adversarial learning strategy to generate the attributes of the triggers within distribution. To ensure a high attack success rate with ID triggers, we introduce novel modules designed to enhance trigger memorization by the victim model trained on poisoned graph. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in generating in distribution triggers that can by-pass various defense strategies while maintaining a high attack success rate.</description>

      <title>ScionFL: Efficient and Robust Secure Quantized Aggregation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.07376v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Secure aggregation is commonly used in federated learning (FL) to alleviate privacy concerns related to the central aggregator seeing all parameter updates in the clear. Unfortunately, most existing secure aggregation schemes ignore two critical orthogonal research directions that aim to (i) significantly reduce client-server communication and (ii) mitigate the impact of malicious clients. However, both of these additional properties are essential to facilitate cross-device FL with thousands or even millions of (mobile) participants.
  In this paper, we unite both research directions by introducing ScionFL, the first secure aggregation framework for FL that operates efficiently on quantized inputs and simultaneously provides robustness against malicious clients. Our framework leverages (novel) multi-party computation (MPC) techniques and supports multiple linear (1-bit) quantization schemes, including ones that utilize the randomized Hadamard transform and Kashin's representation.
  Our theoretical results are supported by extensive evaluations. We show that with no overhead for clients and moderate overhead for the server compared to transferring and processing quantized updates in plaintext, we obtain comparable accuracy for standard FL benchmarks. Moreover, we demonstrate the robustness of our framework against state-of-the-art poisoning attacks.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Cyber-Resilience Approaches for Cyber-Physical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.05402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Concerns for the resilience of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)s in critical infrastructure are growing. CPS integrate sensing, computation, control, and networking into physical objects and mission-critical services, connecting traditional infrastructure to internet technologies. While this integration increases service efficiency, it has to face the possibility of new threats posed by the new functionalities. This leads to cyber-threats, such as denial-of-service, modification of data, information leakage, spreading of malware, and many others. Cyber-resilience refers to the ability of a CPS to prepare, absorb, recover, and adapt to the adverse effects associated with cyber-threats, e.g., physical degradation of the CPS performance resulting from a cyber-attack. Cyber-resilience aims at ensuring CPS survival by keeping the core functionalities of the CPS in case of extreme events. The literature on cyber-resilience is rapidly increasing, leading to a broad variety of research works addressing this new topic. In this article, we create a systematization of knowledge about existing scientific efforts of making CPSs cyber-resilient. We systematically survey recent literature addressing cyber-resilience with a focus on techniques that may be used on CPSs. We first provide preliminaries and background on CPSs and threats, and subsequently survey state-of-the-art approaches that have been proposed by recent research work applicable to CPSs. In particular, we aim at differentiating research work from traditional risk management approaches based on the general acceptance that it is unfeasible to prevent and mitigate all possible risks threatening a CPS. We also discuss questions and research challenges, with a focus on the practical aspects of cyber-resilience, such as the use of metrics and evaluation methods as well as testing and validation environments.</description>

      <title>ATM: a Logic for Quantitative Security Properties on Attack Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Critical infrastructure systems - for which high reliability and availability are paramount - must operate securely. Attack trees (ATs) are hierarchical diagrams that offer a flexible modelling language used to assess how systems can be attacked. ATs are widely employed both in industry and academia but - in spite of their popularity - little work has been done to give practitioners instruments to formulate queries on ATs in an understandable yet powerful way. In this paper we fill this gap by presenting ATM, a logic to express quantitative security properties on ATs. ATM allows for the specification of properties involved with security metrics that include "cost", "probability" and "skill" and permits the formulation of insightful what-if scenarios. To showcase its potential, we apply ATM to the case study of a CubeSAT, presenting three different ways in which an attacker can compromise its availability. We showcase property specification on the corresponding attack tree and we present theory and algorithms - based on binary decision diagrams - to check properties and compute metrics of ATM-formulae.</description>

      <title>Bypassing the Safety Training of Open-Source LLMs with Priming Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the recent surge in popularity of LLMs has come an ever-increasing need for LLM safety training. In this paper, we investigate the fragility of SOTA open-source LLMs under simple, optimization-free attacks we refer to as $\textit{priming attacks}$, which are easy to execute and effectively bypass alignment from safety training. Our proposed attack improves the Attack Success Rate on Harmful Behaviors, as measured by Llama Guard, by up to $3.3\times$ compared to baselines. Source code and data are available at https://github.com/uiuc-focal-lab/llm-priming-attacks.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Study of Jailbreak Attack versus Defense for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMS) have increasingly become central to generating content with potential societal impacts. Notably, these models have demonstrated capabilities for generating content that could be deemed harmful. To mitigate these risks, researchers have adopted safety training techniques to align model outputs with societal values to curb the generation of malicious content. However, the phenomenon of "jailbreaking", where carefully crafted prompts elicit harmful responses from models, persists as a significant challenge. This research conducts a comprehensive analysis of existing studies on jailbreaking LLMs and their defense techniques. We meticulously investigate nine attack techniques and seven defense techniques applied across three distinct language models: Vicuna, LLama, and GPT-3.5 Turbo. We aim to evaluate the effectiveness of these attack and defense techniques. Our findings reveal that existing white-box attacks underperform compared to universal techniques and that including special tokens in the input significantly affects the likelihood of successful attacks. This research highlights the need to concentrate on the security facets of LLMs. Additionally, we contribute to the field by releasing our datasets and testing framework, aiming to foster further research into LLM security. We believe these contributions will facilitate the exploration of security measures within this domain.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Federated Learning: A Systematic Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08299</link>

Abstract: In recent years, privacy and security concerns in machine learning have promoted trusted federated learning to the forefront of research. Differential privacy has emerged as the de facto standard for privacy protection in federated learning due to its rigorous mathematical foundation and provable guarantee. Despite extensive research on algorithms that incorporate differential privacy within federated learning, there remains an evident deficiency in systematic reviews that categorize and synthesize these studies.
  Our work presents a systematic overview of the differentially private federated learning. Existing taxonomies have not adequately considered objects and level of privacy protection provided by various differential privacy models in federated learning. To rectify this gap, we propose a new taxonomy of differentially private federated learning based on definition and guarantee of various differential privacy models and federated scenarios. Our classification allows for a clear delineation of the protected objects across various differential privacy models and their respective neighborhood levels within federated learning environments. Furthermore, we explore the applications of differential privacy in federated learning scenarios. Our work provide valuable insights into privacy-preserving federated learning and suggest practical directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Transpose Attack: Stealing Datasets with Bidirectional Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks are normally executed in the forward direction. However, in this work, we identify a vulnerability that enables models to be trained in both directions and on different tasks. Adversaries can exploit this capability to hide rogue models within seemingly legitimate models. In addition, in this work we show that neural networks can be taught to systematically memorize and retrieve specific samples from datasets. Together, these findings expose a novel method in which adversaries can exfiltrate datasets from protected learning environments under the guise of legitimate models. We focus on the data exfiltration attack and show that modern architectures can be used to secretly exfiltrate tens of thousands of samples with high fidelity, high enough to compromise data privacy and even train new models. Moreover, to mitigate this threat we propose a novel approach for detecting infected models.</description>

      <title>Differentially private projection-depth-based medians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07792v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differentially private projection-depth-based medians using the propose-test-release (PTR) and exponential mechanisms. Under general conditions on the input parameters and the population measure, (e.g. we do not assume any moment bounds), we quantify the probability the test in PTR fails, as well as the cost of privacy via finite sample deviation bounds. We then present a new definition of the finite sample breakdown point which applies to a mechanism, and present a lower bound on the finite sample breakdown point of the projection-depth-based median. We demonstrate our main results on the canonical projection-depth-based median, as well as on projection-depth-based medians derived from trimmed estimators. In the Gaussian setting, we show that the resulting deviation bound matches the known lower bound for private Gaussian mean estimation. In the Cauchy setting, we show that the "outlier error amplification" effect resulting from the heavy tails outweighs the cost of privacy. This result is then verified via numerical simulations. Additionally, we present results on general PTR mechanisms and a uniform concentration result on the projected spacings of order statistics, which may be of general interest.</description>

      <title>Novel Long Distance Free Space Quantum Secure Direct Communication for Web 3.0 Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09108v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the advent of Web 3.0, the swift advancement of technology confronts an imminent threat from quantum computing. Security protocols safeguarding the integrity of Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 are growing more susceptible to both quantum attacks and sophisticated classical threats. The article introduces our novel long-distance free-space quantum secure direct communication (LF QSDC) as a method to safeguard against security breaches in both quantum and classical contexts. Differing from techniques like quantum key distribution (QKD), LF QSDC surpasses constraints by facilitating encrypted data transmission sans key exchanges, thus diminishing the inherent weaknesses of key-based systems. The distinctiveness of this attribute, coupled with its quantum mechanics base, protects against quantum computer assaults and advanced non-quantum dangers, harmonizing seamlessly with the untrustworthy tenets of the Web 3.0 age. The focus of our study is the technical design and incorporation of LF QSDC into web 3.0 network infrastructures, highlighting its efficacy for extended-range communication. LF QSDC is based on the memory DL04 protocol and enhanced with our novel Quantum-Aware Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC), Pointing, Acquisition, and Tracking (PAT) technologies, and Atmospheric Quantum Correction Algorithm (AQCA). Utilizing this method not only bolsters the security of worldwide Web 3.0 networks but also guarantees their endurance in a time when quantum and sophisticated classical threats exist simultaneously. Consequently, LF QSDC stands out as a robust security solution, well-suited for Web 3.0 systems amidst the constantly evolving digital environment.</description>
