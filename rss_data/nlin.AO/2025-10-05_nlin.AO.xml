      <title>Finite-size fluctuations for stochastic coupled oscillators: A general theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase transitions, sharp in the thermodynamic limit, get smeared in finite systems where macroscopic order-parameter fluctuations dominate. Achieving a coherent and complete theoretical description of these fluctuations is a central challenge. We develop a general framework to quantify these finite-size effects in synchronization transitions of generic stochastic, globally-coupled nonlinear oscillators. By applying a center-manifold reduction to the nonlinear stochastic PDE for the single-oscillator distribution in finite systems, we derive a mesoscopic description that yields the complete time evolution of the order parameter in the form of a Langevin equation. In particular, this equation provides the first closed-form steady-state distribution of the order parameter, fully capturing finite-size effects. Free from integrability constraints and the celebrated Ott-Antonsen ansatz, our theory shows excellent agreement with simulations across diverse coupling functions and frequency distributions, demonstrating broad applicability. Strikingly, it surpasses recent approaches near criticality and in the incoherent phase, where finite-size fluctuations are most pronounced.</description>

      <title>The systemic impact of edges in financial networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we assess how the stability of financial networks is affected by interconnectedness considering its tiniest variation: the edge. We compute the impact of edges as the percentage difference in the systemic risk (SR) of the whole network caused by the inclusion of that edge. We apply this framework to a thorough Brazilian dataset to compute the impact of bank-firm edges. After observing that (i) edges are heterogeneous regarding their impact on the SR, and (ii) the fraction of edges whose impact on the SR is non-positive increases with the level of the initial shock, we use machine learning techniques to try to predict two variables: the criticality of the edges (defining as critical an edge whose impact on SR is significantly greater than that of the others) and the sign of the edge impact. The level of accuracy obtained in these prediction exercises was very high. These results have important implications for the development macroprudential policies aimed at financial stability. Our framework allows to identify, based on features related to the origin and destination nodes of the edge (i.e., the lending bank and the borrowing firm), whether an additional loan will have a significant and positive impact on the SR.</description>

      <title>Minimal-Dissipation Learning for Energy-Based Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the bias of the approximate maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE) objective of a persistent chain energy-based model (EBM) is precisely equal to the thermodynamic excess work of an overdamped Langevin dynamical system. We then answer the question of whether such a model can be trained with minimal excess work, that is, energy dissipation, in a finite amount of time. We find that a Gaussian energy function with constant variance can be trained with minimal excess work by controlling only the learning rate. This proves that it is possible to train a persistent chain EBM in a finite amount of time with minimal dissipation and also provides a lower bound on the energy required for the computation. We refer to such a learning process that minimizes the excess work as minimal-dissipation learning. We then provide a generalization of the optimal learning rate schedule to general potentials and find that it induces a natural gradient flow on the MLE objective, a well-known second-order optimization method.</description>
