      <title>Diffusion Transients in Motility-Induced Phase Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically investigate normal diffusion in a two-dimensional athermal suspension of active particles undergoing motility-induced phase separation. The particles are modeled as achiral Janus disks with fixed self-propulsion speed and weakly fluctuating orientation. When plotted versus the overall suspension packing fraction, the relevant diffusion constant traces a hysteresis loop with sharp jumps in correspondence with the binodal and spinodal of the gaseous phase. No hysteresis loop is observed between the spinodal and binodal of the dense phase, as they appear to overlap. Moreover, even under steady-state phase separation, the particle displacement distributions exhibit non-Gaussian normal diffusion with transient fat (thin) tails in the presence (absence) of phase separation.</description>

      <title>Inherited Berry curvature of phonons in Dirac materials with time-reversal symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Berry curvature of phonons is an active subject of research in condensed matter physics. Here, we present a model in which phonons acquire a Berry curvature through their coupling to electrons in crystals with time-reversal symmetry. We illustrate this effect for BaMnSb$_2$, a quasi two-dimensional Dirac insulator, whose low-energy massive Dirac fermions generate a phonon Berry curvature that is proportional to the electronic valley Chern number.</description>

      <title>Variational formulation of dynamical electronic response functions in presence of nonlocal exchange interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22889v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the dynamical electronic response function in theoretical frameworks that include nonlocal exchange interactions, such as the Bethe-Salpeter equation with the frequency independent approximation of the screened interaction, Hartree-Fock, and range-separated Hybrid DFT approaches. Within these pictures, we demonstrate that any time-dependent electronic linear response function allows for a formulation which is variational in the electronic density matrix. To achieve our goal, we consider the usual form of a response function, written in terms of a screened and a bare electronic vertices (`bare-screen'), and perform an exact rewriting in terms of purely screened electronic vertices (`screen-screen'). Within the `screen-screen' formulation, the response function can be written as a stationary point of a functional of the exact density matrix. Further, we show that the imaginary part of any electronic response can be written in the form of a generalized Fermi Golden Rule, by introducing an exact complementary rewriting in terms of vertices related by complex conjugation (`screen*-screen'). The screen-screen formulation can be further extended partitioning the electronic interaction in separate contributions, expressing the response in terms of partially screened electronic vertices (`partial screen-partial screen'), preserving the stationary properties. We numerically validate the effectiveness of our formalism by calculating the optical conductivity of graphene, which exhibits strong excitonic effects. To do so, we solve the Bethe-Salpeter Equation on a tight-binding model, including exchange effects in the response of graphene. Our findings show the advantages of the variationality of the screen-screen formulation over the others both in convergence properties and robustness with density-matrix approximations.</description>
