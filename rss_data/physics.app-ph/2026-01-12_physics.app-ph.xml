      <title>All-optical photoacoustic tomography via beam deflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) uniquely combines the advantages of optical contrast with deep tissue penetration capability of acoustic waves, enabling imaging at depths of several centimeters. Conventional photoacoustic imaging methods have relied on pulsed lasers to induce the photoacoustic effect, coupled with arrays of pressure transducers to detect the resulting ultrasound signals. In this work, we propose an alternative all-optical approach that leverages optical deflection to record photoacoustic waves by an array of detection beams. The measured signal is shown to be the Radon transform of the pressure gradients. An optimization-based inversion procedure is used to reconstruct the initial time pressure gradient field. Subsequently, a Galerkin method is used to reconstruct the pressure field from the pressure gradient field. The new modality offers the potential for enhanced sensitivity and reduced signal distortion, advancing the capabilities of photoacoustic imaging beyond traditional transducer-based systems.</description>

      <title>Mobile Robot Localization Using a Novel Whisker-Like Sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whisker-like touch sensors offer unique advantages for short-range perception in environments where visual and long-range sensing are unreliable, such as confined, cluttered, or low-visibility settings. This paper presents a framework for estimating contact points and robot localization in a known planar environment using a single whisker sensor. We develop a family of virtual sensor models. Each model maps robot configurations to sensor observations and enables structured reasoning through the concept of preimages - the set of robot states consistent with a given observation. The notion of virtual sensor models serves as an abstraction to reason about state uncertainty without dependence on physical implementation. By combining sensor observations with a motion model, we estimate the contact point. Iterative estimation then enables reconstruction of obstacle boundaries. Furthermore, intersecting states inferred from current observations with forward-projected states from previous steps allow accurate robot localization without relying on vision or external systems. The framework supports both deterministic and possibilistic formulations and is validated through simulation and physical experiments using a low-cost, 3D printed, Hall-effect-based whisker sensor. Results demonstrate accurate contact estimation and localization with errors under 7 mm, demonstrating the potential of whisker-based sensing as a lightweight, adaptable complement to vision-based navigation.</description>

      <title>A Novel Stability Improvement Method of S-Band Magnetron Systems Based on Its Anode Current Feature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetrons are widely used as a high-efficiency, large-power, and low-cost microwave source. This article proposes a method to improve the magnetron output characteristics based on regulating its anode current by a novel active distortion eliminator. It takes advantage of the constant current state of MOSFETs to suppress the anode current ripple and eliminate the magnetron output ripples. An improved switch-mode power supply is applied to a 1-kW commercial S -band magnetron in the experiment. The peak-to-peak anode current ripple is reduced from 31 to 7 mA. The spectral width of the free-running magnetron is decreased from 246 to 87 kHz. In the injection locking state, the spur noise is significantly reduced with a maximum suppression strength of 23 dB at a 100-Hz offset. The peak-to-peak value of the magnetron magnitude and phase jitter are suppressed to 15% and 16% of their original values at a power injection ratio of 0.13. This method provides a novel approach for stabilizing the output phase of an injection-locked magnetron, making it promising for applications in phased arrays, wireless power transfer, particle accelerators, large-power communication, and other scenarios that require high phase stability.</description>

      <title>Comparison of reverse current mechanisms in GaN Schottky diodes grown on sapphire versus ammonothermal GaN substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we analyse the reverse current mechanisms in GaN Schottky barrier diodes (SBDs) grown on sapphire and native GaN substrates. For the sapphire-substrate sample, two conduction mechanisms are identified: Poole-Frenkel emission (PFE) and trap-assisted tunneling (TAT), with corresponding trap energy levels of 0.9 eV and 0.3 eV, respectively. In contrast, only PFE is observed in the GaN-substrate sample, with a trap energy of 0.75 eV, suggesting that the presence of TAT is related to the higher dislocation density in structures grown on sapphire substrates. The leakage mechanisms and associated trap energies are extracted by comparing experimental current-voltage (I-V) characteristics with a model that includes thermionic emission and tunneling contributions for different temperatures, from 298K up to 443K.</description>

      <title>Development and Experimental Validation of Novel Evaluation Criteria for Turbulent Two-Phase VOF Simulations in High-Pressure Die Casting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Air entrapment during mold filling critically affects porosity and overall casting quality in High Pressure Die Casting. This study assesses the feasibility of applying the vof method within OpenFOAM to simulate compressible, turbulent mold filling in a thin-walled geometry. Three-dimensional simulations with the "compressibleInterFoam" solver were carried out under ambient initial cavity conditions, using both laminar flow and the k-e turbulence model. The free surface dynamics were examined across a range of inlet velocities to evaluate their influence on interface morphology, cavity pressurization, and gas entrapment. To quantify these effects, three evaluation criteria were introduced: the TIFSA as a measure of oxidation risk, the TMVF as an indicator of filling continuity and air entrapment, and the TIVF as a proxy for surface loading. Results show that turbulence modeling accelerates pressurization and limits the persistence of entrapped gas, with velocity governing the balance between smooth filling, turbulent breakup, and exposure duration. Comparison with experimental casting trials, including CT based porosity analysis and photogrammetric surface evaluation, validated that the model captures key defect mechanisms and provides quantitative guidance for process optimization.</description>

      <title>Reservoir computing from collective dynamics of active colloidal oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physical reservoir computing is a computational framework that offers an energy- and computation-efficient alternative to conventional training of neural networks. In reservoir computing, input signals are mapped into the high-dimensional dynamics of a nonlinear system, and only a simple readout layer is trained. In most physical implementations, the interactions that give rise to the dynamics cannot be tuned directly and high dimensionality is typically achieved through time-multiplexing, which can limit flexibility and efficiency. Here we introduce a reservoir composed of hundreds of hydrodynamically coupled active colloidal oscillators forming a fully parallel physical reservoir and whose coupling strength and fading-memory time can be tuned in situ. The collective dynamics of the active oscillators allow accurate predictions of chaotic time series from single reservoir readouts without time-multiplexing. We further demonstrate real-time detection of subtle hidden anomalies that preserve all instantaneous statistical properties of the signal yet disrupt its underlying temporal correlations. These results establish interacting active colloids as a reconfigurable platform for physical computation and edge-integrated intelligent sensing for model-free detection of irregularities in complex time signals.</description>

      <title>Phonon Trapping Lateral Field Excited Suspended Bulk Acoustic Wave Resonators (XBARs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Film bulk acoustic wave resonators (FBARs) underpin modern wireless communication by enabling compact, high-performance RF filters in modern smartphones. Traditionally, these FBAR devices work with quasi-plane waves of sound where the transverse extent of the acoustic field $\gg$ the acoustic wavelength ($\lambda_a$). On the other hand, strong modal confinement is needed for achieving the interaction strengths necessary for building efficient microwave to optical quantum photon transducers (MW-OT) around an FBAR opto-mechanical cavity platform. Here, we fabricate a small mode-volume phonon trapping lateral field excited FBAR resonator (XBAR) by shaping the piezoelectric layer into a spherical lens, show an improvement in modal confinement and quality factor ($\approx$ 4$\times$), and discuss the improvements needed for building efficient MW-OTs around this XBAR geometry.</description>

      <title>Physics-based Full-band GaN High-Electron-Mobility Transistor Simulation Suggests Upper Bound of LO Phonon Lifetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06226v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intrinsic limits to device performance arise from fundamental material properties that define the best achievable operation, independent of engineering constraints. In GaN high-electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs), hot longitudinal optical (LO) phonons can act as an intrinsic performance bottleneck by reducing electron saturation velocity, output current, and transconductance, which are key device metrics. While bulk GaN studies report LO phonon lifetimes of approximately 1 ps, leading to strong nonequilibrium phonon populations, ungated heterostructures show much shorter lifetimes of only tens of femtoseconds. Because direct measurement inside a HEMT channel is challenging, the true impact of hot phonons remains uncertain. Using full-band transport simulations of a fabricated GaN HEMT, we show that LO phonon lifetimes must be less than about 40 fs to reproduce measured I-V characteristics, consistent with ultrafast decay observed in GaN heterostructures. We further demonstrate that even these ultrafast lifetimes are not sufficient to eliminate hot phonon effects: the residual nonequilibrium LO population continues to limit the current density at high bias. Moreover, when the LO phonon lifetime exceeds a few tens of femtoseconds, a pronounced hot phonon bottleneck emerges, leading to substantial current-density suppression that is inconsistent with experiment.</description>

      <title>Magnetodynamics of short nanoparticle chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been increasing interest in the understanding and application of nanoparticle assemblies driven by external fields. Although these systems can exhibit marked transitions in behavior compared to non-interacting counterparts, it has often proven challenging to connect their dynamics with underlying physical mechanisms or even to verifiably establish their structure under realistic experimental conditions. We have studied colloidal iron oxide nanoparticles that assemble into ordered, few-particle linear chains under the influence of oscillating and pulsed magnetic fields. In this work, our goal has been to answer the following question: by what physical mechanisms does the magnetic switching of a linear chain evolve from the switching of its constituent particles? Cryo-TEM has been used to flash freeze and image the structures formed by oscillatory drive fields, and magnetic relaxometry has been used to extract the multiple time constants associated with magnetic switching of the short chains. Armed with the physical structure from microscopy and the field-dependent switching times from magnetic measurements, we have conducted extensive micromagnetic simulations, revealing probable physical mechanisms for each time constant regime spanning ~1 microsecond to 1 s in time. These types of magnetic nanomaterials have great potential for biomedical technologies, particularly magnetic particle imaging and hyperthermia, and rigorous elucidation of their physics will hasten their optimization.</description>

      <title>Phased-Array Laser Power Beaming from Cislunar Space to the Lunar Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10855v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a time-dependent, end-to-end framework for laser power beaming from cislunar orbits to the lunar surface. The model links on-orbit generation (solar arrays and wall-plug to optical), terrain-masked visibility and range, beam propagation with realistic divergence and jitter, and surface conversion with thermal and dust limits, returning delivered daily energy. Baseline loads for early polar activities (habitat survival, mobility, comm/nav, pilot ISRU) set target Wh\,day$^{-1}$ and are used consistently in scaling laws and design maps. A near-rectilinear halo orbit (NRHO) to a Shackleton-rim site provides a worked example: for a 2\,m-class phased array at 1064\,nm the reference geometry yields $\sim$0.6--0.8\,kWh\,day$^{-1}$ to a 1\,m$^2$ receiver (about 28\,W averaged over the day). We place this result in context by comparing on the same daily-energy metric to surface photovoltaics (PV) with storage and to compact fission, and by showing how delivered energy scales nearly linearly with transmit power and as $D_{\rm eff}^{2}$ via encircled-energy capture, with a multiplicative gain from visibility (constellations). The same framework indicates practical regimes already within reach: e.g., a 10\,m effective-aperture optical phased array at $P_{\rm tx}=100$\,kW delivers $\sim$30--50\,kWh\,day$^{-1}$ at polar sites with typical single-orbiter visibility, as quantified by the delivered-energy and sizing maps. Thus, laser beaming is mass-competitive where darkness or permanent shadow forces deep storage for PV, or where distributed and duty-cycled users can amortize a shared transmitter; compact fission retains advantage for continuous multi-kW baseload at fixed sites.</description>
