      <title>Physics-guided curriculum learning for the identification of reaction-diffusion dynamics from partial observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reaction-diffusion (RD) systems provide fundamental models for understanding self-organized spatiotemporal patterns across diverse natural and engineered settings, but reliable parameter estimation remains challenging, particularly when observations are sparse, noisy, and restricted to a subset of state variables. Based on physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), a physics-guided Curriculum Learning Identification via PINNs (CLIP) method is introduced in this work, for joint parameter inference and hidden state reconstruction. Leveraging the physical separability of RD systems, the CLIP training progresses from reaction-dominated regimes to full spatiotemporal dynamics using curriculum learning and an anchored widening transfer strategy. Across three canonical reaction-diffusion benchmarks, CLIP achieves more accurate and robust identification than baseline methods. Furthermore, the CLIP framework is successfully applied to infer the dynamics of Min system in bacteria, where only membrane bound species are observed and key kinetic rates span multiple orders of magnitude. Moreover, ablation experiments and loss landscape analyses provide mechanistic evidence that the curriculum stages and anchored transfer enhance trainability and convergence.</description>

      <title>Conformal Quantile Regression for Probabilistic Constitutive Modeling of Anisotropic Soft Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological soft tissues exhibit substantial inter-subject variability, making the automation of constitutive material modeling essential for patient-specific analysis and design. Such materials are not only highly nonlinear but also display intrinsic stochasticity arising from their complex and heterogeneous microstructure. Despite recent advances in data-driven constitutive modeling, most existing approaches remain deterministic and fail to quantify predictive uncertainty, thereby limiting their reliability in downstream mechanical analyses. In this work, we propose a probabilistic, data-driven constitutive modeling framework for anisotropic soft materials that explicitly accounts for uncertainty through conformalized quantile regression applied to tensor-valued fields. The proposed framework is built upon a strain-invariant, polyconvex formulation that ensures thermodynamic consistency and promotes robust predictive performance, including in extrapolative regimes. A key advantage of the proposed approach is its simplicity: it can be applied in a plug-and-play manner to endow existing deterministic models with probabilistic predictions, while remaining distribution-free and requiring no assumptions on the underlying data distribution. Moreover, the method is straightforward to train, scalable to models with a large number of parameters, and avoids Monte Carlo sampling at inference, making it computationally efficient and well suited for uncertainty propagation in large-scale mechanical simulations. The proposed method is validated using several benchmark datasets synthesized and collected from the literature.</description>

      <title>Frequency-domain general synthetic iterative scheme for efficient simulation of oscillatory rarefied gas flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oscillatory rarefied gas flows are frequently encountered in MEMS, and their efficient numerical simulation remains a major challenge due to the time dependent nature of the problem and the high dimensionality of the Boltzmann kinetic equation. Here, we address this challenge by focusing on the periodic steady state and solving the resulting problem using the frequency domain general synthetic iterative scheme (GSIS). The key idea of GSIS is to simultaneously solve the mesoscopic kinetic equation and the macroscopic synthetic equation. The kinetic equation provides high-order constitutive relations, beyond those given by the Newton law of viscosity and the Fourier law of heat conduction, to the synthetic equation. In turn, the synthetic equation, which converges to the periodic steady state much faster than the kinetic equation, boosts the evolution of the kinetic equation toward the periodic steady state. As a result, super convergence is achieved, together with an asymptotic preserving property that allows the use of coarse spatial grids. The analytical Fourier stability analysis and the Chapman-Enskog expansion, together with challenging numerical simulations, are employed to demonstrate the fast convergence and asymptotic-preserving properties of GSIS, revealing that it can be three orders of magnitude faster than conventional kinetic schemes in near continuum flow regimes.</description>

      <title>Smooth Polar B-Splines with High-Order Regularity at the Origin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a smooth B-spline discretization in polar coordinates on the unit disc that corrects the loss of regularity present at the origin caused by the coordinate singularity in standard tensor-product B-spline formulations. The method constructs "smooth polar splines" via a Galerkin projection of harmonic polar functions $S_l^{-m}(r,\theta) := r^l \sin(m\theta)$ and $S_l^{m}(r,\theta) := r^l \cos(m\theta)$, derived from the polar representation of Cartesian monomials, onto the central tensor-product B-spline basis in the innermost radial region. The radial component reproduces $r^l$ exactly for $0 \le l \leq p$, where $p$ is the B-spline degree, satisfying the near-origin regularity condition. However, exact compatibility with $C^\infty$-regularity at the origin is recovered only in the limit $\Delta\theta \to 0$, when the angular component resolves all angular harmonics accurately. The smooth polar splines are linear combinations of standard tensor-product B-splines and lie in the same function space, enabling mapping between the $C^\infty$-regular subspace and the original discretization space via an exact prolongation operator and a corresponding restriction operator acting on the discrete variables. They match standard tensor-product B-splines away from the origin, preserve orthogonality among the newly constructed origin-centered basis functions, and maintain local support and sparse matrices. This smoothness and locality improve the conditioning of mass and stiffness matrices, conserve charge, and reduce statistical errors in particle-in-cell simulations near the origin, while eliminating spurious eigenvalues in eigenvalue problems. The approach provides a robust, high-order, and efficient adaptation of tensor-product B-splines for polar coordinates in physics simulations.</description>

      <title>Recursive Manifold Coherence: A Geometric Framework for Deadtime Recovery in Distributed Trigger Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale neutrino observatories operate under unavoidable detector deadtime and signal pile-up, leading to systematic inefficiencies in conventional coincidence-based trigger systems. Such triggers typically rely on binary temporal windows and assume continuous sensor availability, causing partial or complete loss of correlated signal information during non-live intervals. We introduce Recursive Manifold Coherence (RMC), a geometric framework that reformulates distributed trigger logic as a continuous state estimation problem in a low-dimensional information space defined by correlated charge and timing observables. Instead of applying hard vetoes during deadtime, the proposed method employs a recursive update rule that propagates a coherence state across sensor nodes, allowing partially obscured signals to be retained and evaluated consistently. Using simulation studies representative of large optical detector arrays, we demonstrate that RMC successfully recovers event-level coherence for high-multiplicity topologies even when direct coincidence chains are broken. By treating the detector response as a smooth manifold rather than discrete hits, the framework achieves superior robustness against data fragmentation compared to standard binary logic. The framework is detector-agnostic and compatible with software-defined trigger pipelines, providing a flexible foundation for deadtime-aware analysis and triggering strategies in future distributed detector systems.</description>

      <title>ChemNavigator: Agentic AI Discovery of Design Rules for Organic Photocatalysts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of high-performance organic photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution remains limited by the vastness of chemical space and the reliance on human intuition for molecular design. Here we present ChemNavigator, an agentic AI system that autonomously derives structure-property relationships through hypothesis-driven exploration of organic photocatalyst candidates. The system integrates large language model reasoning with density functional tight binding calculations in a multi-agent architecture that mirrors the scientific method: formulating hypotheses, designing experiments, executing calculations, and validating findings through rigorous statistical analysis. Through iterative discovery cycles encompassing 200 molecules, ChemNavigator autonomously identified six statistically significant design rules governing frontier orbital energies, including the effects of ether linkages, carbonyl groups, extended conjugation, cyano groups, halogen substituents, and amine groups. Importantly, these rules correspond to established principles of organic electronic structure (resonance donation, inductive withdrawal, $\pi$-delocalization), demonstrating that the system can independently derive chemical knowledge without explicit programming. Notably, autonomous agentic reasoning extracted these six validated rules from a molecular library where previous ML approaches identified only carbonyl effects. Furthermore, the quantified effect sizes provide a prioritized ranking for synthetic chemists, while feature interaction analysis revealed diminishing returns when combining strategies, challenging additive assumptions in molecular design. This work demonstrates that agentic AI systems can autonomously derive interpretable, chemically grounded design principles, establishing a framework for AI-assisted materials discovery that complements rather than replaces chemical intuition.</description>

      <title>Minimal model for vortex nucleation and reversal in spherical magnetic nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic nanoparticles beyond the single-domain limit often develop vortex-like magnetization textures arising from the competition between exchange and magnetostatic energies. While such states are routinely studied using micromagnetic simulations, transparent analytical descriptions of vortex-mediated hysteresis and nucleation remain scarce. Here, we develop a semi-analytical minimal framework for vortex states in spherical magnetic nanoparticles. Guided by micromagnetic simulations, we introduce a parametrized vortex magnetization Ansatz based on hyperbolic functions that continuously interpolates between uniform and vortex states. In this way, we achieve a complexity reduction leading to a minimal Hamiltonian, which enables the efficient computation of magnetization curves and provides insight into vortex-mediated magnetization reversal. As an application, we derive analytical estimates for the critical vortex nucleation radius and field, recovering the functional form of Brown's classic result and extending it within a variational framework.</description>

      <title>A fast and accurate method for simulating Bragg atom interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atom interferometers are used in a variety of applications, from measuring gravity and gravity gradients in the field to performing tests of fundamental physics in the lab. One method of increasing interferometer sensitivity is to produce a larger momentum difference between interferometer arms through the use of large momentum transfer methods, such as Bragg diffraction. However, Bragg diffraction introduces systematic effects in the accumulated interferometer phase that are challenging to characterize.
  A Bragg atom interferometer is described by the one-dimensional time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation (1D-TDSE). In this paper we show that for the case of Bragg diffraction the 1D-TDSE partial differential equation can be separated into several systems of ordinary differential equations, allowing for the use of adaptive step size Runge-Kutta methods. We compare the convergence of this method to the split-step and Crank-Nicolson methods, and present a method for further computational speed-ups using a lookup table.</description>

      <title>Fully Turbulent Wakes at Low Reynolds Numbers: the Case of the Thin Flat Plate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the wake flow past a thin two-dimensional flat plate normal to the uniform stream and demonstrate that this flow is turbulent already at a relatively low Reynolds number of $Re = 400$. This is achieved by performing a careful comparison of the results of a DNS of this flow with experimental measurements of wake flows in the same geometric configuration at the Reynolds numbers of $Re=12500, 19700$. This comparison reveals that the distribution of several key quantities, including the mean velocity, Reynolds stresses and different effects contributing to the transport of the turbulent kinetic energy, are, up to measurement uncertainty, the same in these flows. Moreover, the wake flow at $Re = 400$ also features energy spectra characteristic of turbulent flows with intermittency detected in the distributions of the fluctuating strain and rotation rates. In contrast, these features are absent from the results of the DNS of the wake flow at $Re = 150$ where the distribution of the key quantities is also fundamentally different. These results show that the path to transition to turbulence in the wake past a thin flat plate is different from that in the wakes of canonical (i.e., circular or square) cylinders. We also identify possible physical mechanisms that may be responsible for these differences.</description>

      <title>The dimensionality of the Hopfield model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the Binary Intrinsic Dimension (BID), a geometrical measure designed for binary data, to analyze the Hopfield model, a paradigmatic spin system from statistical mechanics, machine learning and neuroscience. The BID allows us to characterize the phases and transitions of this system, and moreover it is robust against finite-size effects that interfere with the correct numerical estimation of the spin-glass order parameter ($q$). We observe that the BID scales linearly with system size in the retrieval and paramagnetic phases, where the correlations between spins are small, and exhibits sublinear scaling in the whole spin-glass phase, highlighting its correlated structure. Furthermore, we establish a direct relationship between the BID and the overlap distribution, unveiling a novel connection between the geometry of the state-space and standard spin order parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.17459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Qhronology is a novel scientific-computing package for studying quantum models of closed timelike curves (CTCs) and simulating general quantum information processing and computation. Written in Python, the program provides a comprehensive framework for analyzing quantum theories of antichronological time travel, including functionality to calculate quantum resolutions to temporal paradoxes. It also operates as a complete quantum circuit simulator, enabling the examination of quantum algorithms and protocols in both numerical and symbolic capacities. In this paper, we formally introduce Qhronology, beginning with discussion on aspects of its design philosophy and architecture. An overview of its basic usage is then presented, along with a collection of examples demonstrating its various capabilities within a variety of distinct contexts. Lastly, the performance of the package's circuit simulation component is characterized by way of some simple empirical benchmarking.</description>

      <title>Residual neural-field ptychography for dose-efficient electron, X-ray, and optical nanoscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ptychography spans from sub-angstrom to meter scales yet suffers from convergence instability and excessive data redundancy. Here we introduce self-correcting residual neural fields as a dose-efficient framework for electron, X-ray, and optical ptychography. Unlike approaches that split complex fields, our complex-valued architecture employs holomorphic phasor activation e^i{\omega}z to preserve intrinsic phase-amplitude coupling. We reformulate reconstruction as residual learning, where the network learns only corrections to physical priors rather than complete wavefields. By embedding the physical model as a differentiable layer within the network, we enable end-to-end automatic differentiation where experimental parameters are jointly corrected alongside the neural fields. We validate our scheme across conventional, near-field, coded, and Fourier ptychography and achieve record-breaking lensless resolution of 244-nm linewidth with visible light. Extending to electron wavelengths, we reveal synaptic connectivity in brain sections with superior performance over conventional approaches. Our framework provides a solution for high-throughput, dose-efficient nanoscopy across the electromagnetic spectrum.</description>

      <title>cuGUGA: Operator-Direct Graphical Unitary Group Approach Accelerated with CUDA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present cuGUGA, an operator-direct graphical unitary group approach (GUGA) configuration interaction (CI) solver in a spin-adapted configuration state function (CSF) basis. Dynamic-programming walk counts provide constant-time CSF ranking/unranking, and pretabulated segment factors enable constant-time evaluation of coupling coefficients. Two-electron contributions are organized through an intermediate-weight formulation that separates sparse generator enumeration from integral contraction and supports both dense and density-fitted/Cholesky backends. We further map the same primitives to GPUs by implementing the irregular DRT traversal and accumulation in custom CUDA kernels while delegating contractions to CUDA libraries. The implementation reproduces reference energies at the 10^{-11} Eh level and matches CPU/GPU sigma-vectors to 10^{-14}. On an RTX 4090, the GPU backend provides up to ~10x speedup over the CPU backend for smaller active spaces and multifold speedups on representative CASCI kernels. Speedup decreases as the active space grows because the workload becomes increasingly dominated by FP64 GEMM, which is not strongly accelerated on consumer GPUs. In addition, the cuGUGA CPU backend generally delivers &gt;2x speedup over PySCF's determinant backend and &gt;4x speedup over PySCF CSF backend.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Mechanical Fingerprints for THz Sensing of 'Hidden' Nanoparticles in Complex Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) spectroscopy holds transformative potential for non-invasive sensing, yet characterizing individual nanoparticles in complex biological environments remains challenging due to the far-field diffraction limit. While near-field dipolar theory is well established, its application to characterizing/identifying nanoparticles immersed in complex media at THz frequencies is largely unexplored.
  This work utilizes numerical simulations of magneto-optical (MO) heterodimers -- comprising n-doped Indium Antimonide (n-InSb) and isotropic or birefringent particles (e.g., SiO2, GaSe) -- under counter-propagating, circularly polarized THz illumination. We demonstrate that while far-field observables like absorption cross-sections are often dominated by the MO-active particle, mechanical variables-specifically induced binding forces and spin/orbital torques-exhibit superior sensitivity for detecting "hidden" neighboring components. Because these mechanical signatures depend directly on near-field interactions, they provide higher information density regarding interparticle coupling.
  Key findings reveal material-specific spectral "hotspots" and "zeros" that serve as robust calibration markers even within dispersive biological surrogates. We show that the spin torque on non-MO particles is significantly modified by MO-neighbor proximity, a phenomenon controllable via static magnetic fields. Furthermore, these variables exhibit high angular sensitivity in perpendicular configurations. Our results provide a roadmap for using optomechanical signatures as high-resolution detectors for in-vivo diagnostics, signal transduction, and low-energy nanocircuit control.</description>

      <title>Interpreting Moment Matrix Blocks Spectra using Mutual Shadow Area</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mutual shadow area of pairs of surface regions is used for guiding the study of the spectral components and rank of their wave interaction, as captured by the corresponding moment matrix blocks. It is demonstrated that the mutual shadow area provides an asymptotically accurate predictor of the location of the singular value curve knee. This predicted knee index is shown to partition the interacting parts of the range and domain of blocks into two subspaces that can be associated with different wave phenomena: an "aperture" subspace of dimension that scales with the subdomains area (or length in 2-D) and a remainder "diffraction" subspace of dimension that scales much slower with the electrical length, depending on the geometric configuration. For interactions between open surface domains typical for the common hierarchical partitioning in most fast solvers, the latter can be attributed to the domain edges visible by its interacting counterpart. For interactions in 3-D with a small aspect angles between the source and observers, the diffraction subspace dimension is dominant in determining the rank until fairly large electrical lengths are reached. This explains the delayed asymptotic scaling of ranks and impressive fast solver performance observed in recent literature for seemingly arbitrary scatterers with no special geometric characteristics. In the extreme cases of "endfire" reduced dimensionality interactions, where the shadow area vanishes, the diffraction governs also the asymptotic rank, which translates to superior asymptotic solver performance.</description>

      <title>Feedback-Based Quantum Control for Safe and Synergistic Drug Combination Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) strongly affect the safety and efficacy of combination therapies. Despite the availability of large DDI databases, selecting optimal multi-drug combinations that balance safety, therapeutic benefit, and regimen size remains a challenging combinatorial optimization problem. Here, we present a quantum-control-based framework for DDI-aware drug combination optimization, in which known harmful and synergistic interactions are encoded into Ising Hamiltonians as penalties and rewards, respectively. The optimization is performed using the feedback-based quantum algorithm FALQON, a gradient-free variational approach. We study two clinically motivated tasks: the Maximum Safe Subset problem and the Synergy-Constrained Optimization problem. Numerical simulations using interaction data from Drugs.com and SYNERGxDB demonstrate efficient convergence and high-quality solutions for clinically relevant drug sets, including COVID-19 case studies.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Deadtime in Distributed Optical Arrays: A Liveness-Aware Trigger Approach for High-Energy Neutrino Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale neutrino observatories operate under unavoidable detector deadtime arising from photomultiplier saturation, digitizer limits, and front-end readout constraints. Conventional coincidence-based trigger logic implicitly assumes continuous sensor availability and therefore suffers systematic efficiency loss when channels become temporarily non-live. This work presents the design of a liveness-aware trigger architecture targeting low-latency FPGA deployment in distributed optical arrays. We introduce a recursive Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) update law implemented as a fully synthesizable pipeline that constructs a continuity-preserving effective observable at each sensor node. Rather than collapsing during non-liveness intervals, the observable decays smoothly while retaining phase and amplitude information relevant for network-level coherence estimation. By explicitly separating continuous measurement construction from discrete trigger decision logic, the proposed architecture enables graceful degradation under partial channel non-liveness. Performance is evaluated using a hybrid validation framework that combines representative event topologies derived from IceCube Open Data with a hardware-accurate signal and noise model spanning a wide dynamic range. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed trigger sustains high event recovery efficiency in regimes of elevated deadtime probability, where conventional coincidence logic degrades substantially. Furthermore, the continuity-preserving observable yields up to a two-order-of-magnitude improvement in effective signal-to-noise ratio, enabling robust detection under strong saturation and non-ideal operating conditions. This method provides a robust foundation for next-generation firmware-level trigger strategies in large-scale, noise-dominated detector systems.</description>

      <title>Sub-ion scale current sheets in kinetic Alfv\'en wave turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations are performed using the kinetic Alfv\'en wave (KAW) eigenvector relations from a two-fluid model as initial conditions, in order to study turbulent fluctuations and intermittent structures at sub-ion and electron scales. Simulations with different ion-to-electron mass ratios are set up to investigate the role of electron scales in the formation of intermittent structures. We analyze the current sheet structures that develop in these simulations. Two algorithms, namely Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), are employed to determine the thickness, length, and width of the current sheets, and both methods are found to yield consistent results. The average current sheet thickness scales inversely with the square root of the ion-to-electron mass ratio, with values close to the electron skin depth ($d_e$), indicating the presence of electron-scale current sheets in the simulations. The widths and lengths of the current sheets show a weaker scaling with the mass ratio. The scale-dependent kurtosis reveals enhanced intermittency at electron scales, consistent with magnetosheath observations. Distributions of scale-dependent properties of the current sheets also align with the electron skin depth of the different simulations and they lie within ranges observed in kinetic scale solar wind turbulence. This study reveals the nature of sub-ion-scale current sheets in KAW turbulence and their role in dissipation.</description>

      <title>Data-Efficient Electromagnetic Surrogate Solver Through Dissipative Relaxation Transfer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In neural-network surrogate solvers for electromagnetic simulations, accurately modeling resonant phenomena remains a central challenge. High-amplitude resonances generate strongly localized field patterns that appear as outlier samples, deviating significantly from the general distribution of non-resonant cases, leading to instability and degraded predictive performance. To address this, we introduce dissipative relaxation transfer learning (DIRTL), a data-efficient training framework that integrates transfer learning with loss-regularized optimization principles from high-Q photonics. DIRTL first pretrains the model on data generated with a small fictitious material loss, which broadens sharp resonant modes and suppresses extreme field amplitudes. This smoothing of the response landscape enables the model to learn global modal features more effectively. The pretrained model is subsequently fine-tuned on the target lossless dataset containing the true high-amplitude resonances, allowing stable adaptation based on the pretrained information. Applied to both the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) and UNet architectures, DIRTL yields substantial improvements in prediction accuracy, including up to a two-fold error reduction for the FNO variant. Furthermore, DIRTL exhibits robustness across diverse training conditions and supports strong multi-task performance, underscoring the generalizability and flexibility of the pretrained core. Altogether, these results establish DIRTL as a physically grounded and architecture-agnostic curriculum for enhancing the reliability of machine-learning-based electromagnetic surrogate solvers.</description>

      <title>Structural and dynamic anomalous properties of TIP4P/2005 water at extreme pressures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Water shows numerous thermodynamic, dynamic, and structural anomalies. Recent experiments [Eichler et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 134101 (2025)], based on measurements of shear and bulk viscosities of liquid water up to 1.6 GPa, have reported the existence of a minimum in the variation of the structural relaxation time {\tau}{\alpha} with pressure at room temperature. Here we investigate this and related properties with molecular dynamics simulations of the TIP4P/2005 water model, performed at extreme pressures commensurate with the experiments. Specifically, we compute dynamic (self-diffusion, shear and bulk viscosities, and structural relaxation time) and structural (oxygen-oxygen radial distribution function and structure factor, translational order parameter) properties down to 220 K and up to 2.7 GPa. We find good agreement with the experimental observations, and confirm the existence of a minimum in {\tau}{\alpha} . The microscopic information obtained from the simulations suggests that this anomaly is connected with the sudden reorganization of the hydrogen bond network induced by pressurization.</description>

      <title>Flash evaporation Riemann Problem: Formulation and its Exact Solution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flash evaporation, a liquid-to-gas phase transition phenomenon in real fluids, is prevalent in aerospace propulsion systems. To elucidate the physical mechanisms of such complex flows and provide theoretical benchmarks for Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations, this paper formalizes the Flash evaporation Riemann problem (FeRP) characterized by the expansion branch crossing the saturation line, within the framework of Homogeneous Equilibrium and Vapor-Liquid Equilibrium assumptions. An exact solution framework that analytically resolves all thermodynamic derivatives of equilibrium two-phase fluids is established for arbitrary two-parameter equations of state. By evaluating the Landau fundamental derivative, the non-classical wave structures arising in the FeRP are analyzed, for which a stable iterative solution strategy incorporating the Chapman-Jouguet condition as an outer constraint is proposed. Furthermore, an exact solution for the FeRP based on Wood's mechanical equilibrium speed of sound is developed, enabling a comprehensive evaluation of its thermodynamic implications. Results indicate that Wood's model alters the definition of the two-phase mixture entropy in the Euler equations, introducing an isentropic path characterized by a "density lag" effect and non-physical entropy decrease. Comparative analysis of the FeRP under typical scramjet fuel injection conditions reveals that, although Wood's model captures the general trend of the Riemann solution curve, it significantly underestimates intermediate pressure, velocity, and the extent of vaporization relative to the complete equilibrium model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This computational study investigates lateral optical forces in asymmetric dielectric nanostructures, focusing on their connection to resonant light-matter interactions. We examine isosceles triangular motifs that exhibit two distinct types of optical force response under plane wave illumination. Through parameter-space analysis, we identify stable zones where optical forces remain consistent and switching bands where forces change abruptly as parameters are altered. The observed force spectra show characteristic asymmetric lineshapes, suggesting Fano-resonance behavior. Eigenfrequency analysis confirms these effects arise from interference between discrete eigenmodes and continuum propagation states, with the eigenmode Q-factors correlating with transition sharpness. These findings provide insights into how structural geometry influences optical forces through resonant effects, offering guidance for designing optically-driven systems where controlled optical force responses are desired.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Uncertainty Enables Reliable AI-driven Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse design is a central goal in much of science and engineering, including frequency-selective surfaces (FSS) that are critical to microelectronics for telecommunications and optical metamaterials. Traditional surrogate-assisted optimization methods using deep learning can accelerate the design process but do not usually incorporate uncertainty quantification, leading to poorer optimization performance due to erroneous predictions in data-sparse regions. Here, we introduce and validate a fundamentally different paradigm of Physics-Informed Uncertainty, where the degree to which a model's prediction violates fundamental physical laws serves as a computationally-cheap and effective proxy for predictive uncertainty. By integrating physics-informed uncertainty into a multi-fidelity uncertainty-aware optimization workflow to design complex frequency-selective surfaces within the 20 - 30 GHz range, we increase the success rate of finding performant solutions from less than 10% to over 50%, while simultaneously reducing computational cost by an order of magnitude compared to the sole use of a high-fidelity solver. These results highlight the necessity of incorporating uncertainty quantification in machine-learning-driven inverse design for high-dimensional problems, and establish physics-informed uncertainty as a viable alternative to quantifying uncertainty in surrogate models for physical systems, thereby setting the stage for autonomous scientific discovery systems that can efficiently and robustly explore and evaluate candidate designs.</description>

      <title>Efficient Trotter-Suzuki Schemes for Long-time Quantum Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately simulating long-time dynamics of many-body systems is a challenge in both classical and quantum computing due to the accumulation of Trotter errors. While low-order Trotter-Suzuki decompositions are straightforward to implement, their rapidly growing error limits access to long-time observables. We present a framework for constructing efficient high-order Trotter-Suzuki schemes by identifying their structure and directly optimizing their parameters over a high-dimensional space. This method enables the discovery of new schemes with significantly improved efficiency compared to traditional constructions, such as those by Suzuki and Yoshida. Based on the theoretical efficiency and practical performance, we recommend two novel highly efficient schemes at $4^{\textrm{th}}$ and $6^{\textrm{th}}$ order. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of these decompositions on the Heisenberg model and the quantum harmonic oscillator, and find that for a fixed final time they perform better across the computational cost. Even when using large time steps, they surpass established low-order schemes like the Leapfrog. Finally, we investigate the in-practice performance of different Trotter schemes and find the decompositions with more uniform coefficients tend to feature improved error accumulation over long times. We have included this observation into our choice of recommended schemes.</description>

      <title>OptiGAN for Crystal Arrays: Physics-Informed Generative Modeling of Optical Photon Transport in PET Detector Arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monte Carlo simulations of optical photon transport are computationally prohibitive for large-scale optical systems including detector arrays and PET systems, restricting practical use to single-crystal studies. This work presents an enhanced conditional generative adversarial network (optiGAN) replacing optical simulations at the crystal array level, extending our single-crystal approach to a 3x3 BGO array. We enhance the Wasserstein-GAN framework with Fourier feature encoding, a learnable latent mapping network, and a physics-informed loss enforcing momentum conservation. Training data is reduced eight-fold by exploiting symmetry. Evaluation employs three studies: a full array evaluation testing generalization from the fundamental domain to the complete geometry, a high-resolution study probing out-of-distribution generalization to untrained positions, and a pencil beam $\gamma$-photon study assessing practical applicability for experimental detector characterization. Performance is benchmarked against GATE10/Geant4 ground truth, using intrinsic fluctuations between independent Monte Carlo runs as baseline. OptiGAN achieves sliced Wasserstein similarity within 3$\sigma$-agreement of the baseline across all conditions, demonstrating successful generalization to the full array. The model transitions from electron-emission training data to realistic $\gamma$-photon interactions, producing flood maps that reproduce characteristic patterns including photopeak clusters and inter-crystal scatter lines. This proof-of-concept demonstrates that physics-informed generative models can accurately simulate optical photon transport in segmented scintillator arrays. The reproduction of experimentally relevant flood map features validates optiGAN for PET detector development and establishes a foundation for models generalizing across diverse array configurations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a universal quantum Monte Carlo algorithm for simulating arbitrary high-spin (spin greater than 1/2) Hamiltonians, based on the recently developed permutation matrix representation (PMR) framework. Our approach extends a previously developed PMR-QMC method for spin-1/2 Hamiltonians [Phys. Rev. Research 6, 013281 (2024)]. Because it does not rely on a local bond decomposition, the method applies equally well to models with arbitrary connectivities, long-range and multi-spin interactions, and its closed-walk formulation allows a natural analysis of sign-problem conditions in terms of cycle weights. To demonstrate its applicability and versatility, we apply our method to spin-1 and spin-3/2 quantum Heisenberg models on the square lattice, as well as to randomly generated high-spin Hamiltonians. Additionally, we show how the approach naturally extends to general Hamiltonians involving mixtures of particle species, including bosons and fermions. We have made our program code freely accessible on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Multi-Scale Negative Coupled Information Systems (MNCIS): A Unified Spectral Topology Framework for Stability in Turbulence, AI, and Biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex dynamical systems frequently encounter a recurrent structural instability: the collapse of the spectral gap, driving the system toward a low-dimensional "Zero-Mode Attractor" (e.g., spectral pile-up or over-smoothing). Building upon recent global well-posedness estimates [Hou, arXiv:2601.00638], this work generalizes the Multi-Scale Negative Coupled Information System (MNCIS) framework. We postulate that global stability requires an active topological operator - Adaptive Spectral Negative Coupling (ASNC) - functioning as a state-dependent high-pass filter that penalizes entropy accumulation at spectral boundaries. We validate this unified framework via three implementations: (1) Hydrodynamics: In 3D Navier-Stokes turbulence ($N=256^3$), ASNC acts as a global-enstrophy adaptive sub-grid scale (SGS) model, stabilizing the inviscid limit and preserving the Kolmogorov $-5/3$ inertial range without artificial hyper-viscosity. Crucially, we verify that the operator remains dormant ($\gamma \approx 0$) during the linear growth phase of physical instabilities, functioning strictly as a conditional topological clamp. (2) Artificial Intelligence: Addressing Over-smoothing in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), we implement ASNC as a parameter-free topological constraint. Unlike baselines (e.g., DeepGCNs) relying on dense residual connections, our framework enables the training of ultra-deep 64-layer networks without residual connections, maintaining perfectly stationary feature variance ($\sigma^2 \equiv 1.0$) on the ogbn-arxiv benchmark. (3) Biological Physics: In reaction-diffusion morphogenesis, it stabilizes Turing patterns against diffusive washout in high-entropy regimes. Our results suggest that the MNCIS framework provides a base-independent topological condition for distinguishing viable complex systems from those collapsing into thermal equilibrium.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09395v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce version 2.0 of the SmoQyDQMC.jl package, a Julia implementation of the determinant quantum Monte Carlo algorithm. SmoQyDQMC.jl supports generalized tight-binding Hamiltonians with local and extended Hubbard and generalized electron-phonon (e-ph) interactions, including non-linear e-ph coupling and anharmonic lattice potentials. Our implementation uses an optimized hybrid Monte Carlo method with exact forces to efficiently sample the phonon fields, enabling the simulation of low-energy phonon branches, including acoustic phonons. The SmoQyDQMC.jl package also uses a flexible scripting interface, allowing users to adapt it to different workflows and interface with other software packages in the Julia ecosystem. The code for this package can be downloaded from our GitHub repository at https://github.com/SmoQySuite/SmoQyDQMC.jl or installed using the Julia package manager. The online documentation, including examples, is found at https://smoqysuite.github.io/SmoQyDQMC.jl/stable/.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Enhanced Neural Exchange-Correlation Functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14258v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory (KS-DFT) provides the exact ground state energy and electron density of a molecule, contingent on the as-yet-unknown universal exchange-correlation (XC) functional. Recent research has demonstrated that neural networks can efficiently learn to represent approximations to that functional, offering accurate generalizations to molecules not present during the training process. With the latest advancements in quantum-enhanced machine learning (ML), evidence is growing that Quantum Neural Network (QNN) models may offer advantages in ML applications. In this work, we explore the use of QNNs for representing XC functionals, enhancing and comparing them to classical ML techniques. We present QNNs based on differentiable quantum circuits (DQCs) as quantum (hybrid) models for XC in KS-DFT, implemented across various architectures. We assess their performance on 1D and 3D systems. To that end, we expand existing differentiable KS-DFT frameworks and propose strategies for efficient training of such functionals, highlighting the importance of fractional orbital occupation for accurate results. Our best QNN-based XC functional yields energy profiles of the H$_2$ and planar H$_4$ molecules that deviate by no more than 1 mHa from the reference DMRG and FCI/6-31G results, respectively. Moreover, they reach chemical precision on a system, H$_2$H$_2$, not present in the training dataset, using only a few variational parameters. This work lays the foundation for the integration of quantum models in KS-DFT, thereby opening new avenues for expressing XC functionals in a differentiable way and facilitating computations of various properties.</description>

      <title>ELECTRA: A Cartesian Network for 3D Charge Density Prediction with Floating Orbitals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08305v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the Electronic Tensor Reconstruction Algorithm (ELECTRA) - an equivariant model for predicting electronic charge densities using floating orbitals. Floating orbitals are a long-standing concept in the quantum chemistry community that promises more compact and accurate representations by placing orbitals freely in space, as opposed to centering all orbitals at the position of atoms. Finding the ideal placement of these orbitals requires extensive domain knowledge, though, which thus far has prevented widespread adoption. We solve this in a data-driven manner by training a Cartesian tensor network to predict the orbital positions along with orbital coefficients. This is made possible through a symmetry-breaking mechanism that is used to learn position displacements with lower symmetry than the input molecule while preserving the rotation equivariance of the charge density itself. Inspired by recent successes of Gaussian Splatting in representing densities in space, we are using Gaussian orbitals and predicting their weights and covariance matrices. Our method achieves a state-of-the-art balance between computational efficiency and predictive accuracy on established benchmarks. Furthermore, ELECTRA is able to lower the compute time required to arrive at converged DFT solutions - initializing calculations using our predicted densities yields an average 50.72 % reduction in self-consistent field (SCF) iterations on unseen molecules.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Probabilistic Dirichlet-to-Neumann Maps on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps enable the coupling of multiphysics simulations across computational subdomains by ensuring continuity of state variables and fluxes at artificial interfaces. We present a novel method for learning Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps on graphs using Gaussian processes, specifically for problems where the data obey a conservation constraint from an underlying partial differential equation. Our approach combines discrete exterior calculus and nonlinear optimal recovery to infer relationships between vertex and edge values. This framework yields data-driven predictions with uncertainty quantification across the entire graph, even when observations are limited to a subset of vertices and edges. By optimizing over the reproducing kernel Hilbert space norm while applying a maximum likelihood estimation penalty on kernel complexity, our method ensures that the resulting surrogate strictly enforces conservation laws without overfitting. We demonstrate our method on two representative applications: subsurface fracture networks and arterial blood flow. Our results show that the method maintains high accuracy and well-calibrated uncertainty estimates even under severe data scarcity, highlighting its potential for scientific applications where limited data and reliable uncertainty quantification are critical.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09948v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm is given for the case of a complex phase space weight, which applies generally in quantum statistical mechanics. Computer simulations using Lennard-Jones $^4$He near the $\lambda$-transition, including an expansion to third order of the Wigner-Kirkwood commutation function, give a saturation liquid density in agreement with measured values.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic modeling of Cherenkov emission from particle showers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00944v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Subatomic particles can interact with target nuclei in matter or decay in flight, and an individual high-energy particle can induce a particle shower composed of numerous, lower-energy secondaries. These particle showers broadly exhibit universality across diverse media, including air, water, ice, and other materials, with their development governed by the Standard Model. Full Monte Carlo simulation of particle showers, where each secondary is individually tracked and propagated, can be a computational challenge to perform at scale. Experiments thus resort to parametrized approximations when efficient simulation becomes necessary. Here, we construct distributions of parameters capable of describing the Cherenkov light yield from particle showers in ice, and extensible to other, similar media. Sampling from the distributions allows for a much improved description of event-to-event fluctuations, in amplitude and shape, along the shower axis. Including these effects is essential for a more accurate simulation of signal and background events in current and next-generation neutrino telescopes.</description>

      <title>Differential syntactic and semantic encoding in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04765v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study how syntactic and semantic information is encoded in inner layer representations of Large Language Models (LLMs), focusing on the very large DeepSeek-V3. We find that, by averaging hidden-representation vectors of sentences sharing syntactic structure or meaning, we obtain vectors that capture a significant proportion of the syntactic and semantic information contained in the representations. In particular, subtracting these syntactic and semantic ``centroids'' from sentence vectors strongly affects their similarity with syntactically and semantically matched sentences, respectively, suggesting that syntax and semantics are, at least partially, linearly encoded. We also find that the cross-layer encoding profiles of syntax and semantics are different, and that the two signals can to some extent be decoupled, suggesting differential encoding of these two types of linguistic information in LLM representations.</description>
