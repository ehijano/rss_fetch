      <title>Microbial assessment in a rare Norwegian book collection: a One Health approach to cultural heritage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microbial contamination poses a threat to both the preservation of library and archival collections and the health of staff and users. This study investigated the microbial communities and potential health risks associated with the UNESCO-classified Norwegian Sea Trade Archive (NSTA) collection exhibiting visible microbial colonization and staff health concerns. Dust samples from book surfaces and the storage environment were analysed using culturing methods, qPCR, Next Generation Sequencing, and mycotoxin, cytotoxicity and azole resistance assays. Penicillium sp., Aspergillus sp., and Cladosporium sp. were the most common fungi identified, with some potentially toxic species like Stachybotrys sp., Toxicladosporium sp. and Aspergillus section Fumigati. Fungal resistance to azoles was not detected. Only one mycotoxin, sterigmatocystin, was found in a heavily contaminated book. Dust extracts from books exhibited moderate to high cytotoxicity on human lung cells, suggesting a potential respiratory risk. The collection had higher contamination levels compared to the storage environment, likely due to improved storage conditions. Even though, overall low contamination levels were obtained, which might be underestimated due to the presence of salt (from cod preservation) that could have interfered with the analyses. This study underlines the importance of monitoring microbial communities and implementing proper storage measures to safeguard cultural heritage and staff well-being.</description>

      <title>An age-distributed immuno-epidemiological model with information-based vaccination decision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new age-distributed immuno-epidemiological model with information-based vaccine uptake suggested in this work represents a system of integro-differential equations for the numbers of susceptible individuals, infected individuals, vaccinated individuals and recovered individuals. This model describes the influence of vaccination decision on epidemic progression in different age groups. We prove the existence and uniqueness of a positive solution using the fixed point theory. In a particular case of age-independent model, we determine the final size of epidemic, that is, the limiting number of susceptible individuals at asymptotically large time. Numerical simulations show that the information-based vaccine acceptance can significantly influence the epidemic progression. Though the initial stage of epidemic progression is the same for all memory kernels, as the epidemic progresses and more information about the disease becomes available, further epidemic progression strongly depends on the memory effect. Short-range memory kernel appears to be more effective in restraining the epidemic outbreaks because it allows for more responsive and adaptive vaccination decisions based on the most recent information about the disease.</description>

      <title>Impact of heterogeneity on infection probability: Insights from single-hit dose-response models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The process of infection of a host is complex, influenced by factors such as microbial variation within and between hosts as well as differences in dose across hosts. This study uses dose-response and microbial growth models to delve into the impact of these factors on infection probability. It is rigorously demonstrated that within-host heterogeneity in microbial infectivity enhances the probability of infection. The effect of infectivity and dose variation between hosts is studied in terms of the expected value of the probability of infection. General analytical findings, derived under the assumption of small infectivity, reveal that both types of heterogeneity reduce the expected infection probability. Interestingly, this trend appears consistent across specific dose-response models, suggesting a limited role for the small infectivity condition. Additionally, the vital dynamics behind heterogeneous infectivity are investigated with a microbial growth model which enhances the biological significance of single-hit dose-response models. Testing these mathematical predictions inspire new and challenging laboratory experiments that could deepen our understanding of infections.</description>

      <title>Imitation dynamics and the replicator equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evolutionary game theory has impacted many fields of research by providing a mathematical framework for studying the evolution and maintenance of social and moral behaviors. This success is owed in large part to the demonstration that the central equation of this theory - the replicator equation - is the deterministic limit of a stochastic imitation (social learning) dynamics. Here we offer an alternative elementary proof of this result, which holds for the scenario where players compare their instantaneous (not average) payoffs to decide whether to maintain or change their strategies, and only more successful individuals can be imitated.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear trend of COVID-19 infection time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have developed a nonlinear method of time series analysis that allows us to obtain multiple nonlinear trends without harmonics from a given set of numerical data. We propose to apply the method to recognize the ongoing status of COVID-19 infection with an analytical equation for nonlinear trends. We found that there is only a single nonlinear trend, and this result justifies the use of a week-based infection growth rate. In addition, the fit with the obtained analytical equation for the nonlinear trend holds for a duration of more than three months for the Delta variant infection time series. The fitting also visualizes the transition to the Omicron variant.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic dissipation does not bound replicator growth and decay rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a well-known paper, Jeremy England derived a bound on the free energy dissipated by a self-replicating system [England, "Statistical physics of self-replication", The Journal of Chemical Physics, 2013]. This bound is usually interpreted as a universal relationship that links thermodynamic dissipation to the replicator's per-capita decay and growth rates. Contrary to this interpretation, we argue from thermodynamic principles that such a relationship cannot exist. In particular, we show that it is impossible for a system to undergo both replication and per-capita decay back into reactants. While it is possible for a system to undergo replication and decay into separate waste products, in that case replication and decay are two independent physical processes, and there is no universal relationship between their thermodynamic and dynamical properties.</description>

      <title>Enhancing biodiversity through intraspecific suppression in large ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.12341v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The competitive exclusion principle (CEP) is a fundamental concept in the niche theory, which posits that the number of available resources constrains the coexistence of species. While the CEP offers an intuitive explanation on coexistence, it has been challenged by counterexamples observed in nature. One prominent counterexample is the phytoplankton community, known as the paradox of the plankton. Diverse phytoplankton species coexist in the ocean even though they demand a limited number of resources. To shed light on this remarkable biodiversity in large ecosystems quantitatively, we consider \textit{intraspecific suppression} into the generalized MacArthur's consumer-resource model and study the relative diversity, the number ratio between coexisting consumers and resource kinds. By employing the cavity method and generating functional analysis, we demonstrate that, under intraspecific suppression, the number of consumer species can surpass the available resources. This phenomenon stems from the fact that intraspecific suppression prevents the emergence of dominant species, thereby fostering high biodiversity. Furthermore, our study highlights that the impact of this competition on biodiversity is contingent upon environmental conditions. Our work presents a comprehensive framework that encompasses the CEP and its counterexamples by introducing intraspecific suppression.</description>

      <title>Mean-field interacting multi-type birth-death processes with a view to applications in phylodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06010v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-type birth-death processes underlie approaches for inferring evolutionary dynamics from phylogenetic trees across biological scales, ranging from deep-time species macroevolution to rapid viral evolution and somatic cellular proliferation. A limitation of current phylogenetic birth-death models is that they require restrictive linearity assumptions that yield tractable message-passing likelihoods, but that also preclude interactions between individuals. Many fundamental evolutionary processes -- such as environmental carrying capacity or frequency-dependent selection -- entail interactions, and may strongly influence the dynamics in some systems. Here, we introduce a multi-type birth-death process in mean-field interaction with an ensemble of replicas of the focal process. We prove that, under quite general conditions, the ensemble's stochastically evolving interaction field converges to a deterministic trajectory in the limit of an infinite ensemble. In this limit, the replicas effectively decouple, and self-consistent interactions appear as nonlinearities in the infinitesimal generator of the focal process. We investigate a special case that is rich enough to model both carrying capacity and frequency-dependent selection while yielding tractable message-passing likelihoods in the context of a phylogenetic birth-death model.</description>
