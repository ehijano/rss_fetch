      <title>Hierarchical Placement Learning for Network Slice Provisioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we aim to address the challenge of slice provisioning in edge-based mobile networks. We propose a solution that learns a service function chain placement policy for Network Slice Requests, to maximize the request acceptance rate, while minimizing the average node resource utilization. To do this, we consider a Hierarchical Multi-Armed Bandit problem and propose a two-level hierarchical bandit solution which aims to learn a scalable placement policy that optimizes the stated objectives in an online manner. Simulations on two real network topologies show that our proposed approach achieves 5% average node resource utilization while admitting over 25% more slice requests in certain scenarios, compared to baseline methods.</description>

      <title>An Online Multi-dimensional Knapsack Approach for Slice Admission Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network Slicing has emerged as a powerful technique to enable cost-effective, multi-tenant communications and services over a shared physical mobile network infrastructure. One major challenge of service provisioning in slice-enabled networks is the uncertainty in the demand for the limited network resources that must be shared among existing slices and potentially new Network Slice Requests. In this paper, we consider admission control of Network Slice Requests in an online setting, with the goal of maximizing the long-term revenue received from admitted requests. We model the Slice Admission Control problem as an Online Multidimensional Knapsack Problem and present two reservation-based policies and their algorithms, which have a competitive performance for Online Multidimensional Knapsack Problems. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we evaluate the performance of our online admission control method in terms of average revenue gained by the Infrastructure Provider, system resource utilization, and the ratio of accepted slice requests. We compare our approach with those of the online First Come First Serve greedy policy. The simulation's results prove that our proposed online policies increase revenues for Infrastructure Providers by up to 12.9 % while reducing the average resource consumption by up to 1.7% In particular, when the tenants' economic inequality increases, an Infrastructure Provider who adopts our proposed online admission policies gains higher revenues compared to an Infrastructure Provider who adopts First Come First Serve.</description>

      <title>Blockchain-Based Decentralized Domain Name System</title>

Abstract: The current Domain Name System (DNS) infrastructure faces critical vulnerabilities including poisoning attacks, censorship mechanisms, and centralized points of failure that compromise internet freedom and security. Recent incidents such as DNS poisoning attacks on ISP customers highlight the urgent need for resilient alternatives. This paper presents a novel blockchain-based Decentralized Domain Name System (DDNS). We designed a specialized Proof-of-Work blockchain to maximize support for DNS-related protocols and achieve node decentralization. The system integrates our blockchain with IPFS for distributed storage, implements cryptographic primitives for end-to-end trust signatures, and achieves Never Trust, Always Verify zero-trust verification. Our implementation achieves 15-second domain record propagation times, supports 20 standard DNS record types, and provides perpetual free .ddns domains. The system has been deployed across distributed infrastructure in San Jose, Los Angeles, and Orange County, demonstrating practical scalability and resistance to traditional DNS manipulation techniques. Performance evaluation shows the system can handle up to Max Theor. TPS 1,111.1 tx/s (minimal transactions) and Max Theor. TPS 266.7 tx/s (regular transactions) for domain operations while maintaining sub-second query resolution through intelligent caching mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Confidence Driven Classification of Application Types in the Presence of Background Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately classifying the application types of network traffic using deep learning models has recently gained popularity. However, we find that these classifiers do not perform well on real-world traffic data due to the presence of non-application-specific generic background traffic originating from advertisements, analytics, shared APIs, and trackers. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art application classifiers overlook such traffic in curated datasets and only classify relevant application traffic. To address this issue, when we label and train using an additional class for background traffic, it leads to additional confusion between application and background traffic, as the latter is heterogeneous and encompasses all traffic that is not relevant to the application sessions. To avoid falsely classifying background traffic as one of the relevant application types, a reliable confidence measure is warranted, such that we can refrain from classifying uncertain samples. Therefore, we design a Gaussian Mixture Model-based classification framework that improves the indication of the deep learning classifier's confidence to allow more reliable classification.</description>

      <title>Entanglement-Based Artificial Topology: Neighboring Remote Network Nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16204v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement is unanimously recognized as the key communication resource of the Quantum Internet. Yet, the possibility of implementing novel network functionalities by exploiting the marvels of entanglement has been poorly investigated so far, by mainly restricting the attention to bipartite entanglement. Conversely, in this paper, we aim at exploiting multipartite entanglement as inter-network resource. Specifically, we consider the interconnection of different Quantum Local Area Networks (QLANs), and we show that multipartite entanglement allows to dynamically generate an inter-QLAN artificial topology, by means of local operations only, that overcomes the limitations of the physical QLAN topologies. To this aim, we first design the multipartite entangled state to be distributed within each QLAN. Then, we show how such a state can be engineered to: i) interconnect nodes belonging to different QLANs, and ii) dynamically adapt to different inter-QLAN traffic patterns. Our contribution aims at providing the network engineering community with a hands-on guideline towards the concept of artificial topology and artificial neighborhood.</description>
