      <title>Scalable Systems and Software Architectures for High-Performance Computing on cloud platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-performance computing (HPC) is essential for tackling complex computational problems across various domains. As the scale and complexity of HPC applications continue to grow, the need for scalable systems and software architectures becomes paramount. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of architecture for HPC on premise focusing on both hardware and software aspects and details the associated challenges in building the HPC cluster on premise. It explores design principles, challenges, and emerging trends in building scalable HPC systems and software, addressing issues such as parallelism, memory hierarchy, communication overhead, and fault tolerance on various cloud platforms. By synthesizing research findings and technological advancements, this paper aims to provide insights into scalable solutions for meeting the evolving demands of HPC applications on cloud.</description>

      <title>A Closer Look at Data Augmentation Strategies for Finetuning-Based Low/Few-Shot Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current methods for low- and few-shot object detection have primarily focused on enhancing model performance for detecting objects. One common approach to achieve this is by combining model finetuning with data augmentation strategies. However, little attention has been given to the energy efficiency of these approaches in data-scarce regimes. This paper seeks to conduct a comprehensive empirical study that examines both model performance and energy efficiency of custom data augmentations and automated data augmentation selection strategies when combined with a lightweight object detector. The methods are evaluated in three different benchmark datasets in terms of their performance and energy consumption, and the Efficiency Factor is employed to gain insights into their effectiveness considering both performance and efficiency. Consequently, it is shown that in many cases, the performance gains of data augmentation strategies are overshadowed by their increased energy usage, necessitating the development of more energy efficient data augmentation strategies to address data scarcity.</description>
