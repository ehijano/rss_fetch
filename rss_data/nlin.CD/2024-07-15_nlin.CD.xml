      <title>Weak Chaos, Anomalous Diffusion, and Weak Ergodicity Breaking in Systems with Delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that standard delay systems with a linear instantaneous and a delayed nonlinear term show weak chaos, asymptotically subdiffusive behavior, and weak ergodicity breaking if the nonlinearity is chosen from a specific class of functions. In the limit of large constant delay times, anomalous behavior may not be observable due to exponentially large crossover times. A periodic modulation of the delay causes a strong reduction of the effective dimension of the chaotic phases, leads to hitherto unknown types of solutions, and the occurrence of anomalous diffusion already at short times. The observed anomalous behavior is caused by non-hyperbolic fixed points in function space.</description>

      <title>Effects of stickiness on the quantum states of strongly chaotic open systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of classical stickiness (orbits temporarily confined to a region of the chaotic phase space) to the structures of the quantum states of an open system. We consider the standard map of the kicked rotor and verify that regions of stickiness survive in the strong chaotic regime of the closed classical map. By scanning the system's phase space with a leak, we analyze how stickiness affects the degree of localization of the states of the quantum system. We find an excellent correspondence between the classical dwell time and finite-time Lyapunov exponents with the quantum dwell time and Wehrl entropy of the quantum states. Our approach suggests that knowledge of the structure of the classically chaotic trajectories can be used to determine where to place the leak to enhance or decrease the degree of delocalization of the quantum states.</description>

      <title>Parameter inference from a non-stationary unknown process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-stationary systems are found throughout the world, from climate patterns under the influence of variation in carbon dioxide concentration, to brain dynamics driven by ascending neuromodulation. Accordingly, there is a need for methods to analyze non-stationary processes, and yet most time-series analysis methods that are used in practice, on important problems across science and industry, make the simplifying assumption of stationarity. One important problem in the analysis of non-stationary systems is the problem class that we refer to as Parameter Inference from a Non-stationary Unknown Process (PINUP). Given an observed time series, this involves inferring the parameters that drive non-stationarity of the time series, without requiring knowledge or inference of a mathematical model of the underlying system. Here we review and unify a diverse literature of algorithms for PINUP. We formulate the problem, and categorize the various algorithmic contributions. This synthesis will allow researchers to identify gaps in the literature and will enable systematic comparisons of different methods. We also demonstrate that the most common systems that existing methods are tested on - notably the non-stationary Lorenz process and logistic map - are surprisingly easy to perform well on using simple statistical features like windowed mean and variance, undermining the practice of using good performance on these systems as evidence of algorithmic performance. We then identify more challenging problems that many existing methods perform poorly on and which can be used to drive methodological advances in the field. Our results unify disjoint scientific contributions to analyzing non-stationary systems and suggest new directions for progress on the PINUP problem and the broader study of non-stationary phenomena.</description>

      <title>Decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm using a cluster-synchronized laser network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) studies crucial principles that are applicable to a variety of fields, including wireless networking and autonomous driving. We propose a photonic-based decision-making algorithm to address one of the most fundamental problems in MARL, called the competitive multi-armed bandit (CMAB) problem. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that chaotic oscillations and cluster synchronization of optically coupled lasers, along with our proposed decentralized coupling adjustment, efficiently balance exploration and exploitation while facilitating cooperative decision-making without explicitly sharing information among agents. Our study demonstrates how decentralized reinforcement learning can be achieved by exploiting complex physical processes controlled by simple algorithms.</description>

      <title>Tensor networks enable the calculation of turbulence probability distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting the dynamics of turbulent fluid flows has long been a central goal of science and engineering. Yet, even with modern computing technology, accurate simulation of all but the simplest turbulent flow-fields remains impossible: the fields are too chaotic and multi-scaled to directly store them in memory and perform time-evolution. An alternative is to treat turbulence $\textit{probabilistically}$, viewing flow properties as random variables distributed according to joint probability density functions (PDFs). Turbulence PDFs are neither chaotic nor multi-scale, but are still challenging to simulate due to their high dimensionality. Here we show how to overcome the dimensionality problem by parameterising turbulence PDFs into an extremely compressed format known as a "tensor network" (TN). The TN paradigm enables simulations on single CPU cores that would otherwise be impractical even with supercomputers: for a $5+1$ dimensional PDF of a chemically reactive turbulent flow, we achieve reductions in memory and computational costs by factors of $\mathcal{O}(10^6)$ and $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$, respectively, compared to standard finite difference algorithms. A future path is opened towards something heretofore regarded as infeasible: directly simulating high-dimensional PDFs of both turbulent flows and other chaotic systems that are useful to describe probabilistically.</description>
