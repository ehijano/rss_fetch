      <title>Degree bounds for linear differential equations and recurrences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear differential equations and recurrences reveal many properties about their solutions. Therefore, these equations are well-suited for representing solutions and computing with special functions. We identify a large class of existing algorithms that compute such representations as a linear relation between the iterates of an elementary operator known as a \emph{pseudo-linear map}. Algorithms of this form have been designed and used for solving various computational problems, in different contexts, including effective closure properties for linear differential or recurrence equations, the computation of a differential equation satisfied by an algebraic function, and many others. We propose a unified approach for establishing precise degree bounds on the solutions of all these problems. This approach relies on a common structure shared by all the specific instances of the class. For each problem, the obtained bound is tight. It either improves or recovers the previous best known bound that was derived by \emph{ad hoc} methods.</description>

      <title>A Qualitative Model to Reason about Object Rotations (QOR) applied to solve the Cube Comparison Test (CCT)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a Qualitative model for Reasoning about Object Rotations (QOR) which is applied to solve the Cube Comparison Test (CCT) by Ekstrom et al. (1976). A conceptual neighborhood graph relating the Rotation movement to the Location change and the Orientation change (CNGRLO) of the features on the cube sides has been built and it produces composition tables to calculate inferences for reasoning about rotations.</description>
