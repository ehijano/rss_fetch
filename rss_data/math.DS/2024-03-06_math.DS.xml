      <title>Approximation of the Koopman operator via Bernstein polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Koopman operator approach provides a powerful linear description of nonlinear dynamical systems in terms of the evolution of observables. While the operator is typically infinite-dimensional, it is crucial to develop finite-dimensional approximation methods and characterize the related approximation errors with upper bounds, preferably expressed in the uniform norm. In this paper, we depart from the traditional use of orthogonal projection or truncation, and propose a novel method based on Bernstein polynomial approximation. Considering a basis of Bernstein polynomials, we construct a matrix approximation of the Koopman operator in a computationally effective way. Building on results of approximation theory, we characterize the rates of convergence and the upper bounds of the error in various contexts including the cases of univariate and multivariate systems, and continuous and differentiable observables. The obtained bounds are expressed in the uniform norm in terms of the modulus of continuity of the observables. Finally, the method is extended to a data-driven setting through a proper change of coordinates, where it is shown to demonstrate good performance for trajectory prediction.</description>

      <title>Koopman operators with intrinsic observables in rigged reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for estimating the Koopman operator defined on a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and its spectra. We propose an estimation method, what we call Jet Dynamic Mode Decomposition (JetDMD), leveraging the intrinsic structure of RKHS and the geometric notion known as jets to enhance the estimation of the Koopman operator. This method refines the traditional Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) in accuracy, especially in the numerical estimation of eigenvalues. This paper proves JetDMD's superiority through explicit error bounds and convergence rate for special positive definite kernels, offering a solid theoretical foundation for its performance. We also delve into the spectral analysis of the Koopman operator, proposing the notion of extended Koopman operator within a framework of rigged Hilbert space. This notion leads to a deeper understanding of estimated Koopman eigenfunctions and capturing them outside the original function space. Through the theory of rigged Hilbert space, our study provides a principled methodology to analyze the estimated spectrum and eigenfunctions of Koopman operators, and enables eigendecomposition within a rigged RKHS. We also propose a new effective method for reconstructing the dynamical system from temporally-sampled trajectory data of the dynamical system with solid theoretical guarantee. We conduct several numerical simulations using the van der Pol oscillator, the Duffing oscillator, the H\'enon map, and the Lorenz attractor, and illustrate the performance of JetDMD with clear numerical computations of eigenvalues and accurate predictions of the dynamical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we establish large deviation estimates related to the Darling--Kac theorem and generalized arcsine laws for occupation and waiting times of ergodic transformations preserving an infinite measure, such as interval maps with indifferent fixed points. For the proof we imitate the study of generalized arcsine laws for occupation times of one-dimensional diffusion processes and adopt a method of double Laplace transform.</description>

      <title>Generalized Hyperbolicity, Stability and Expansivity for Operators on Locally Convex Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study the notions of (generalized) hyperbolicity, topological stability and (uniform) topological expansivity for operators on locally convex spaces. We prove that every generalized hyperbolic operator on a locally convex space has the finite shadowing property. Contrary to what happens in the Banach space setting, hyperbolic operators on Fr\'echet spaces may fail to have the shadowing property, but we find additional conditions that ensure the validity of the shadowing property. Assuming that the space is sequentially complete, we prove that generalized hyperbolicity implies the strict periodic shadowing property, but we also show that the hypothesis of sequential completeness is essential. We show that operators with the periodic shadowing property on topological vector spaces have other interesting dynamical behaviors, including the fact that the restriction of such an operator to its chain recurrent set is topologically mixing and Devaney chaotic. We prove that topologically stable operators on locally convex spaces have the finite shadowing property and the strict periodic shadowing property. As a consequence, topologically stable operators on Banach spaces have the shadowing property. Moreover, we prove that generalized hyperbolicity implies topological stability for operators on Banach spaces. We prove that uniformly topologically expansive operators on locally convex spaces are neither Li-Yorke chaotic nor topologically transitive. Finally, we characterize the notion of topological expansivity for weighted shifts on Fr\'echet sequence spaces. Several examples are provided.</description>

      <title>Classification of 2-node Excitatory-Inhibitory Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify connected 2-node excitatory-inhibitory networks under various conditions. We assume that, as well as for connections, there are two distinct node-types, excitatory and inhibitory. In our classification we consider four different types of excitatory-inhibitory networks: restricted, partially restricted, unrestricted and completely unrestricted. For each type we give two different classifications. Using results on ODE-equivalence and minimality, we classify the ODE-classes and present a minimal representative for each ODE-class. We also classify all the networks with valence $\le 2$. These classifications are up to renumbering of nodes and the interchange of `excitatory' and `inhibitory' on nodes and arrows.These classifications constitute a first step towards analysing dynamics and bifurcations of excitatory-inhibitory networks. The results have potential applications to biological network models, especially neuronal networks, gene regulatory networks, and synthetic gene networks.</description>

      <title>Radial amplitude equations for fully localised planar patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Isolated patches of spatially oscillating pattern have been found to emerge near a pattern-forming instability in a wide variety of experiments and mathematical models. However, there is currently no mathematical theory to explain this emergence or characterise the structure of these patches. We provide a method for formally deriving radial amplitude equations to planar patterns via non-autonomous multiple-scale analysis and convolutional sums of products of Bessel functions. Our novel approach introduces nonautonomous differential operators, which allow for the systematic manipulation of Bessel functions, as well as previously unseen identities involving infinite sums of Bessel functions. Solutions of the amplitude equations describe fully localised patterns with non-trivial angular dependence, where localisation occurs in a purely radial direction. Amplitude equations are derived for multiple examples of patterns with dihedral symmetry, including fully localised hexagons and quasipatterns with twelve-fold rotational symmetry. In particular, we show how to apply the asymptotic method to the Swift--Hohenberg equation and general reaction-diffusion systems.</description>

      <title>Metallic mean Wang tiles II: the dynamics of an aperiodic computer chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a new family $(\mathcal{T}_n)_{n\geq1}$ of aperiodic sets of Wang tiles and we describe the dynamical properties of the set $\Omega_n$ of valid configurations $\mathbb{Z}^2\to\mathcal{T}_n$. The tiles can be defined as the different instances of a square shape computer chip whose inputs and outputs are 3-dimensional integer vectors. The family include the Ammann aperiodic set of 16 Wang tiles and gathers the hallmarks of other small aperiodic sets of Wang tiles. Notably, the tiles satisfy additive versions of equations verified by the Kari--Culik aperiodic sets of 14 and 13 Wang tiles. Also configurations in $\Omega_n$ are the codings of a $\mathbb{Z}^2$-action on a 2-dimensional torus like the Jeandel--Rao aperiodic set of 11 Wang tiles. The family broadens the relation between quadratic integers and aperiodic tilings beyond the omnipresent golden ratio as the dynamics of $\Omega_n$ involves the positive root $\beta$ of the polynomial $x^2-nx-1$, also known as the $n$-th metallic mean. We show the existence of an almost one-to-one factor map $\Omega_n\to\mathbb{T}^2$ which commutes the shift action on $\Omega_n$ with horizontal and vertical translations by $\beta$ on $\mathbb{T}^2$. The factor map can be explicitely defined by the average of the top labels from the same row of tiles as in Kari and Culik examples. The proofs are based on the minimality of $\Omega_n$ (proved in a previous article) and a polygonal partition of $\mathbb{T}^2$ which we show is a Markov partition for the toral $\mathbb{Z}^2$-action. The partition and the sets of Wang tiles are symmetric which makes them, like Penrose tilings, worthy of investigation.</description>

      <title>An "Opinion Reproduction Number" for Infodemics in a Bounded-Confidence Content-Spreading Process on Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the spreading dynamics of content on networks. To do this, we use a model in which content spreads through a bounded-confidence mechanism. In a bounded-confidence model (BCM) of opinion dynamics, the agents of a network have continuous-valued opinions, which they adjust when they interact with agents whose opinions are sufficiently close to theirs. The employed content-spread model introduces a twist into BCMs by using bounded confidence for the content spread itself. To study the spread of content, we define an analogue of the basic reproduction number from disease dynamics that we call an \emph{opinion reproduction number}. A critical value of the opinion reproduction number indicates whether or not there is an ``infodemic'' (i.e., a large content-spreading cascade) of content that reflects a particular opinion. By determining this critical value, one can determine whether or not an opinion will die off or propagate widely as a cascade in a population of agents. Using configuration-model networks, we quantify the size and shape of content dissemination using a variety of summary statistics, and we illustrate how network structure and spreading model parameters affect these statistics. We find that content spreads most widely when the agents have large expected mean degree or large receptiveness to content. When the amount of content spread only slightly exceeds the critical opinion reproduction number (i.e., the infodemic threshold), there can be longer dissemination trees than when the expected mean degree or receptiveness is larger, even though the total number of content shares is smaller.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Floer homology groups for asymptotically linear Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms on standard symplectic space. Our main application is the proof of a theorem resembling the classical Poincar\'e-Birkhoff theorem: we show that if an asymptotically linear Hamiltonian diffeomorphism, non-degenerate and unitary at infinity, admits a homologically visible fixed point whose mean Conley-Zehnder index is different from the mean Conley-Zehnder index at infinity, then it has infinitely many periodic orbits.</description>

      <title>Collision Avoidance and Geofencing for Fixed-wing Aircraft with Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safety-critical failures often have fatal consequences in aerospace control. Control systems on aircraft, therefore, must ensure the strict satisfaction of safety constraints, preferably with formal guarantees of safe behavior. This paper establishes the safety-critical control of fixed-wing aircraft in collision avoidance and geofencing tasks. A control framework is developed wherein a run-time assurance (RTA) system modulates the nominal flight controller of the aircraft whenever necessary to prevent it from colliding with other aircraft or crossing a boundary (geofence) in space. The RTA is formulated as a safety filter using control barrier functions (CBFs) with formal guarantees of safe behavior. CBFs are constructed and compared for a nonlinear kinematic fixed-wing aircraft model. The proposed CBF-based controllers showcase the capability of safely executing simultaneous collision avoidance and geofencing, as demonstrated by simulations on the kinematic model and a high-fidelity dynamical model.</description>

      <title>Hierarchy of the echo state property in quantum reservoir computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The echo state property (ESP) represents a fundamental concept in the reservoir computing (RC) framework that ensures output-only training of reservoir networks by being agnostic to the initial states and far past inputs. However, the traditional definition of ESP does not describe possible non-stationary systems in which statistical properties evolve. To address this issue, we introduce two new categories of ESP: \textit{non-stationary ESP}, designed for potentially non-stationary systems, and \textit{subspace/subset ESP}, designed for systems whose subsystems have ESP. Following the definitions, we numerically demonstrate the correspondence between non-stationary ESP in the quantum reservoir computer (QRC) framework with typical Hamiltonian dynamics and input encoding methods using non-linear autoregressive moving-average (NARMA) tasks. We also confirm the correspondence by computing linear/non-linear memory capacities that quantify input-dependent components within reservoir states. Our study presents a new understanding of the practical design of QRC and other possibly non-stationary RC systems in which non-stationary systems and subsystems are exploited.</description>

      <title>On the computation of stable coupled state-space models for dynamic substructuring applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper aims at introducing a methodology to compute stable coupled state-space models for dynamic substructuring applications by introducing two novel approaches targeted to accomplish this task: a) a procedure to impose Newtons's second law without relying on the use of undamped RCMs (residual compensation modes) and b) a novel approach to impose stability on unstable coupled state-space models. The enforcement of stability is performed by dividing the unstable model into two different models, one composed by the stable poles (stable model) and the other composed by the unstable ones (unstable model). Then, the poles of the unstable state-space model are forced to be stable, leading to the computation of a stabilized state-space model. Afterwards, to make sure that the Frequency Response Functions (FRFs) of the stabilized model well match the FRFs of the unstable model, the Least-Squares Frequency Domain (LSFD) method is exploited to update the modal parameters of the stabilized model composed by the pairs of complex conjugate poles. The validity of the proposed methodologies is presented and discussed by exploiting experimental data. Indeed, by exploiting the FRFs of a real system, accurate state-space models respecting Newton's second law are computed. Then, decoupling and coupling operations are performed with the identified state-space models, no matter the models resultant from the decoupling/coupling operations are unstable. Stability is then imposed on the computed unstable coupled model by following the approach proposed in this paper. The methodology proved to work well on these data. Moreover, the paper also shows that the coupled state-space models obtained using this methodology are suitable to be exploited in time-domain analyses and simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2103.01215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Poncelet polygons inscribed in a circle and circumscribed about conics from a confocal family naturally arise in the analysis of the numerical range and Blaschke products. We examine the behaviour of such polygons when the inscribed conic varies through a confocal pencil and discover cases when each conic from the confocal family is inscribed in an $n$-polygon, which is inscribed in the circle, with the same $n$. Complete geometric characterization of such cases for $n\in\{4,6\}$ is given and proved that this cannot happen for other values of $n$. We establish a relationship of such families of Poncelet quadrangles and hexagons to solutions of a Painlev\'e VI equation.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider random iterations of polynomial maps $z^2 +c_n$ where $c_n$ are complex-valued independent random variables following the uniform distribution on the closed disk with center $c$ and radius $r$. The aim of this paper is twofold. First, we study the (dis)connectedness of random Julia sets. Here, we reveal the relationships between the bifurcation radius and connectedness of random Julia sets. Second, we investigate the bifurcation of our random iterations and give quantitative estimates of bifurcation parameters. In particular, we prove that for the central parameter $c = -1$, almost every random Julia set is totally disconnected with much smaller radial parameters $r$ than expected. We also introduce several open questions worth discussing.</description>

      <title>Uniform global stability of switched nonlinear systems in the Koopman operator framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.05529v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a novel solution to an open problem on the global uniform stability of switched nonlinear systems. Our results are based on the Koopman operator approach and, to our knowledge, this is the first theoretical contribution to an open problem within that framework. By focusing on the adjoint of the Koopman generator in the Hardy space on the polydisk (or on the real hypercube), we define equivalent linear (but infinite-dimensional) switched systems and we construct a common Lyapunov functional for those systems, under a solvability condition of the Lie algebra generated by the linearized vector fields. A common Lyapunov function for the original switched nonlinear systems is derived from the Lyapunov functional by exploiting the reproducing kernel property of the Hardy space. The Lyapunov function is shown to converge in a bounded region of the state space, which proves global uniform stability of specific switched nonlinear systems on bounded invariant sets.</description>

Abstract: The Koopman operator provides a linear perspective on non-linear dynamics by focusing on the evolution of observables in an invariant subspace. Observables of interest are typically linearly reconstructed from the Koopman eigenfunctions. Despite the broad use of Koopman operators over the past few years, there exist some misconceptions about the applicability of Koopman operators to dynamical systems with more than one disjoint invariant sets (e.g., basins of attractions from isolated fixed points). In this work, we first provide a simple explanation for the mechanism of linear reconstruction-based Koopman operators of nonlinear systems with multiple disjoint invariant sets. Next, we discuss the use of discrete symmetry among such invariant sets to construct Koopman eigenfunctions in a data efficient manner. Finally, several numerical examples are provided to illustrate the benefits of exploiting symmetry for learning the Koopman operator.</description>

      <title>The dynamical degree of billiards in an algebraic curve</title>

Abstract: We introduce an algebraic formulation of billiards on plane curves over algebraically closed fields, extending Glutsyuk's complex billiards. For any smooth algebraic curve $C$ of degree $d \geq 2$, algebraic billiards is a rational $(d-1)$-to-$(d-1)$ surface correspondence on the space of unit cotangent vectors based on $C$. We prove that the dynamical degree of the billiards correspondence is at most an explicit cubic algebraic integer $\rho_d &lt; 2d^2 - d - 3$, depending only on the degree $d$ of $C$. As a corollary, for smooth real algebraic curves, the topological entropy of the classical billiards map is at most $\log \rho_d$. We further show that the billiards correspondence satisfies the singularity confinement property and preserves a natural $2$-form. To prove our bounds, we construct a birational model that partially resolves the indeterminacy of algebraic billiards.</description>

      <title>Metallic mean Wang tiles I: self-similarity, aperiodicity and minimality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For every positive integer $n$, we introduce a set $\mathcal{T}_n$ made of $(n+3)^2$ Wang tiles (unit squares with labeled edges). We represent a tiling by translates of these tiles as a configuration $\mathbb{Z}^2\to\mathcal{T}_n$. A configuration is valid if the common edge of adjacent tiles have the same label. For every $n\geq1$, we show that the Wang shift $\Omega_n$ defined as the set of valid configurations over the tiles $\mathcal{T}_n$ is self-similar, aperiodic and minimal for the shift action. We say that $\{\Omega_n\}_{n\geq1}$ is a family of metallic mean Wang shifts since the inflation factor of the self-similarity of $\Omega_n$ is the positive root of the polynomial $x^2-nx-1$. This root is sometimes called the $n$-th metallic mean, and in particular, the golden mean when $n=1$ and the silver mean when $n=2$. When $n=1$, the set of Wang tiles $\mathcal{T}_1$ is equivalent to the Ammann aperiodic set of 16 Wang tiles.</description>

      <title>Linking numbers of modular knots</title>

Abstract: The modular group PSL(2;Z) acts on the hyperbolic plane HP with quotient the modular surface M, whose unit tangent bundle U is a 3-manifold homeomorphic to the complement of the trefoil knot in the 3-sphere. The hyperbolic conjugacy classes of PSL(2;Z) correspond to the closed oriented geodesics in M. Those lift to the periodic orbits for the geodesic flow in U, which define the modular knots. The linking numbers between modular knots and the trefoil is well understood. Indeed, Etienne Ghys showed in 2006 that they are given by the Rademacher invariant of the corresponding conjugacy classes. The Rademacher function is a homogeneous quasi-morphism of PSL(2;Z) which he had recognised with Jean Barge in 1992 as half the primitive of the bounded euler class. This shed light on the 1987 work of Michael Atiyah concerning the logarithm of the Dedekind eta function which identified it with no less than that six other important functions appearing in diverse areas of mathematics. We are concerned with the linking numbers between modular knots and derive several formulae with arithmetical, combinatorial, topological and group theoretical flavours. In particular we associate to a pair of modular knots a function defined on the character variety of PSL(2;Z), whose limit at the boundary point recovers their linking number. Moreover, we show that the linking number with a modular knot minus that with its inverse yields a homogeneous quasi-morphism on the modular group, and how to extract a free basis out of these. For this we prove that the linking pairing is non degenerate.</description>

      <title>Mercury's chaotic secular evolution as a subdiffusive process</title>

Abstract: Mercury's orbit can destabilize, generally resulting in a collision with either Venus or the Sun. Chaotic evolution can cause g1 to decrease to the approximately constant value of g5 and create a resonance. Previous work has approximated the variation in g1 as stochastic diffusion, which leads to a phenomological model that can reproduce the Mercury instability statistics of secular and N-body models on timescales longer than 10 Gyr. Here we show that the diffusive model underpredicts the Mercury instability probability by a factor of 3-10,000 on timescales less than 5 Gyr, the remaining lifespan of the Solar System. This is because g1 exhibits larger variations on short timescales than the diffusive model would suggest. To better model the variations on short timescales, we build a new subdiffusive phenomological model for g1. Subdiffusion is similar to diffusion but exhibits larger displacements on short timescales and smaller displacements on long timescales. We choose model parameters based on the behavior of the g1 trajectories in the N-body simulations, leading to a tuned model that can reproduce Mercury instability statistics from 1-40 Gyr. This work motivates fundamental questions in Solar System dynamics: Why does subdiffusion better approximate the variation in g1 than standard diffusion? Why is there an upper bound on g1, but not a lower bound that would prevent it from reaching g5?</description>

      <title>Unstable Cores are the source of instability in chemical reaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11486</link>

Abstract: In biochemical networks, complex dynamical features such as superlinear growth and oscillations are classically considered a consequence of autocatalysis. For the large class of parameter-rich kinetic models, which includes Generalized Mass Action kinetics and Michaelis-Menten kinetics, we show that certain submatrices of the stoichiometric matrix, so-called unstable cores, are sufficient for a reaction network to admit instability and potentially give rise to such complex dynamical behavior. The determinant of the submatrix distinguishes unstable-positive feedbacks, with a single real-positive eigenvalue, and unstable-negative feedbacks without real-positive eigenvalues. Autocatalytic cores turn out to be exactly the unstable-positive feedbacks that are Metzler matrices. Thus there are sources of dynamical instability in chemical networks that are unrelated to autocatalysis. We use such intuition to design non-autocatalytic biochemical networks with superlinear growth and oscillations.</description>
