      <title>Strain-induced multiferroicity in Cr1/3NbS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiferroic materials, in which electric polarization and magnetic order coexist and couple, offer rich opportunities for both fundamental discovery and technology. However, multiferroicity remains rare due to conflicting electronic requirements for ferroelectricity and magnetism. One route to circumvent this challenge is to exploit the noncollinear ordering of spin cycloids, whose symmetry permits the emergence of polar order. In this work, we introduce another pathway to multiferroic order in which strain generates polarization in materials that host nonpolar spin spirals. To demonstrate this phenomenon, we chose the spin spiral in the well-studied helimagnet Cr1/3NbS2. To detect the induced polarization, we introduce the technique of magnetoelectric birefringence (MEB), an optical probe that enables spatially-resolved and unambiguous detection of polar order. By combining MEB imaging with strain engineering, we confirm the onset of a polar vector at the magnetic transition, establishing strained Cr1/3NbS2 as a type-II multiferroic.</description>

      <title>Spinon Mediation of Witness-Spin Dynamics and Ground State in Herbertsmithite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The kagome lattice of spin-1/2 Cu atoms in herbertsmithite (ZnCu3(OH)6Cl2) may sustain a quantum spin liquid (QSL) state with spinon quasiparticles. Each kagome plane is separated from its homologues by a layer of spinless Zn atoms. Providentially, however, some spin-1/2 Cu atoms substitute randomly onto these inter-kagome Zn sites. We reconceptualize these 'impurity' atoms as quantum 'witness-spins', an exceptional new interrogative of the conjectured Z2-gauge-symmetric QSL state. Thus we introduce spin-noise spectroscopy to explore herbertsmithite witness-spin dynamics for QSL studies. It reveals the existence, slowing and intensification of spin noise, prefatory to a sharp transition at T* {\approx} 260 mK. Below T* the spin-noise power spectral density S_M({\omega},T) {\propto} {\omega}^{-{\alpha}(T)} stabilizes at {\alpha} {\approx} 1; the spin noise variance {\sigma}_M^2(T) diminishes precipitously; the ultra-low-field magnetic susceptibility {\chi}(T) undergoes a sharp transition into a phase exhibiting an Edwards-Anderson order-parameter and ultra-slow spin-state relaxation. A Z2 QSL theory of spinon-mediated witness-spin interactions corresponds best to all these experimental observations, predicting slowing and intensification of witness-spin fluctuations and noise spectrum S_M({\omega},T) with cooling, with a transition into a unique spinon-mediated phase signified by rapidly diminishing spin noise, with S_M({\omega},T) {\propto} {\omega}^{-1}, a sharp cusp in the DC magnetic susceptibility {\chi}(T), and the appearance of an Edwards-Anderson order-parameter. We rule out numerous other mechanisms for these effects, so that only spinon-mediation by either a Z2 or U(1) QSL is consistent with all present herbertsmithite empirics, with the former model providing a closer match to data.</description>

      <title>Spin Symmetry Criteria for Odd-parity Magnets</title>

Abstract: Inspired by the discovery of altermagnets, which exhibit even-parity nonrelativistic spin splitting, odd-parity magnets (OPMs) have been proposed and emerged as a novel research frontier. In this study, we perform a comprehensive spin group symmetry analysis to establish symmetry criteria for the emergence of OPMs. We identify eight distinct symmetry-driven cases that support OPMs, enabling their realization in collinear, coplanar, and noncoplanar magnetic orders. These OPMs are categorized into three types based on their spin textures for Bloch states: collinear (type-I), coplanar (type-II), and noncoplanar (type-III). For type-I OPMs, we further delineate additional symmetry requirements for $p$-wave and $f$-wave spin splitting. We identify 48 candidate materials in the Magndata database that satisfy these symmetry criteria. Additionally, we construct two theoretical models to validate the effectiveness of the established symmetry criteria. Finally, we show that OPMs can exhibit an intrinsic $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topology and construct a theoretical model to realize this phase.</description>

      <title>Fighting Exponentially Small Gaps by Counterdiabatic Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02520v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the efficiency of approximate counterdiabatic driving (CD) in accelerating adiabatic passage through exponentially small gaps. First, we analyze a minimal spin-glass bottleneck model that is analytically tractable and exhibits both an exponentially small gap at the transition point and a change in the ground state that involves a macroscopic rearrangement of spins. Using the variational Floquet-Krylov expansion to construct CD terms, we find that while the formation of excitations is significantly suppressed, achieving a fully adiabatic evolution remains challenging. Extending our investigation to realistic NP-hard spin-glass problems -- specifically, the $3$-regular \textsc{Max Cut} and $3$-\textsc{XORSAT} -- we find again that local CD expansions lead to negligible improvements in the final ground state fidelity. These results highlight the limited impact of local CD methods in overcoming the bottlenecks associated with first-order quantum phase transitions. To address this limitation, we propose an alternative method, termed quantum brachistochrone counterdiabatic driving (QBCD), which employs the approximate full CD connecting the ground state and the first excited state at a single parameter value close to the critical point. In the minimal spin-glass model, QBCD enables exponentially faster adiabatic evolution than the local strategies. To alleviate the challenges of its experimental and classical implementation for realistic \textsc{NP}-hard problems, we exponentially reduce the non-locality of the QBCD Hamiltonian by sparsifying its matrix elements to the density of the local expansions. Despite this drastic simplification, sparsified QBCD maintains finite ground-state fidelity at driving times exponentially shorter than in local strategies and counterdiabatic optimized local driving (COLD).</description>

      <title>Optimal spatial searches with long-range tunneling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A quantum walk on a lattice is a paradigm of a quantum search in a database. The database qubit strings are the lattice sites, qubit rotations are tunneling events, and the target site is tagged by an energy shift. For quantum walks on a continuous time, the walker diffuses across the lattice and the search ends when it localizes at the target site. The search time $T$ can exhibit Grover's optimal scaling with the lattice size $N$, namely, $T\sim \sqrt{N}$, on an all-connected, complete lattice. For finite-range tunneling between sites, instead, Grover's optimal scaling is warranted when the lattice is a hypercube of $d&gt;4$ dimensions. Here, we show that Grover's optimum can be reached in lower dimensions on lattices of long-range interacting particles, when the interaction strength scales algebraically with the distance $r$ as $1/r^{\alpha}$ and $0&lt;\alpha&lt;3d/2$. For $\alpha&lt;d$ the dynamics mimics the one of a globally connected graph. For $d&lt;\alpha&lt;d+2$, the quantum search on the graph can be mapped to a short-range model on a hypercube with spatial dimension $d_s=2d/(\alpha-d)$, indicating that the search is optimal for $d_s&gt;4$. Our work identifies an exact relation between criticality of long-range and short-range systems, it provides a quantitative demonstration of the resources that long-range interactions provide for quantum technologies, and indicates when existing experimental platforms can implement efficient analog quantum search algorithms.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian band topology in twisted bilayer graphene aligned with hexagonal boron nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Utilizing the established Bistritzer-MacDonald model for twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG), we theoretically investigate the non-Hermitian (NH) topological properties of this in the presence of non-reciprocal (NR) hopping on both layers and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) induced mass term incorporated only on the top layer of the tBLG system. It is well known that the hBN mass term breaks the \(C_{2}\) symmetry of tBLG and gaps out the Dirac cones inducing a valley Hall insulating phase. However, when NR hopping is introduced, this system transits into a NH valley Hall insulator (NH-VHI). Our analysis reveals that, in the chiral limit, the bandwidth of the system vanishes under NH effects for a wide range of twist angles. Such range can be visibly expanded as we enhance the degree of non-Hermiticity (\(\beta\)). At the magic angle, we observe that enhancement of \(\beta\) inflates the robustness of the gapless Dirac points, requiring a progressively larger mass term to induce a gap in the NH tBLG system. Additionally, for a fixed NH parameter, we identify a range of twist angles where gap formation is significantly obstructed. To explore the topological aspects of the NH tBLG, we analyze the direct band gap in the Moir\'e Brillouin zone (mBZ) and compute the Chern number for the NH system. We find that the corresponding topological phase transitions are associated with corresponding direct band gap closings in the mBZ.</description>
