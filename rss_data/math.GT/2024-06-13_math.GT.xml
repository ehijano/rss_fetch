      <title>Immersibility of manifolds is decidable in odd codimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a smooth map $f:M\rightarrow N$ of closed oriented smooth manifolds, is there an immersion homotopic to $f$? We provide an algorithm that decides this when the codimension of the manifolds is odd.</description>

      <title>The Mock Alexander Polynomial for Knotoids and Linkoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mock Alexander polynomial is an extension of the classical Alexander polynomial, defined and studied for (virtual) knots and knotoids by the second and third authors. In this paper we consider the mock Alexander polynomial for generalizations of knotoids. We prove a conjecture on the mock Alexander polynomial for knotoids, which generalizes to uni-linkoids. Afterwards we give constructions for canonical invariants of linkoids derived from the mock Alexander polynomial, using the formalism of generalized knotoids due to Adams et al.</description>

      <title>Hidden symmetries and Dehn surgery on tetrahedral links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by a question of Neumann and Reid, we study whether Dehn fillings on all but one cusp of a hyperbolic link complement can produce infinite families of knot complements with hidden symmetries which geometrically converge to the original link complement. We prove several results relating the existence of such an infinite family of knot complements with hidden symmetries to the existence of certain symmetries of the horoball packings associated to the original link. Using these results, we develop an algorithm which when run on SnapPy can test when such symmetries do not exist. We then use this SnapPy code and two utilities from \cite{orbcenpract} to show that for any given link in the tetrahedral census of Fominykh-Garoufalidis-Goerner-Tarkaev-Vesnin, no such family of Dehn fillings exists. We establish the same result for two infinite families of cyclic covers of the Berge manifold and the $6^2_2$-complement as well.</description>

      <title>The $L^1$-$L^\infty$-geometry of Teichm\"uller space -- Second order infinitesimal structures --</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $L^1$-$L^\infty$ geometry is the Finsler geometry of the Teichm\"uller space by the Teichm\"uller metric and the $L^1$-norm function of holomorphic quadratic differentials. In this paper, aiming to develop the $L^1$-$L^\infty$-geometry and the differential geometry on the Teichm\"uller space, we formulate the second order infinitesimal structures (the infinitesimal structures on the (co)tangent bundles) over the Teichm\"uller space. We will give model spaces of the second order infinitesimal spaces.
  By applying our formulation, we give affirmative answers to two folklore. We first show that the map from the space of holomorphic quadratic differentials to the tangent bundle defined by Teichm\"uller Beltrami differentials is a real-analytic diffeomorphism on every stratum in the space of holomorphic quadratic differentials. Second, we show that the Teichm\"uller metric is real-analytic on the image of each stratum. We also observe a new duality between the Teichm\"uller metric and the $L^1$-norm function at the infinitesimal level.</description>

      <title>Tautological classes and higher signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a bundle of oriented closed smooth $n$-manifolds $\pi: E \to X$, the tautological class $\kappa_{\mathcal{L}_k} (E) \in H^{4k-n}(X;\mathbb{Q})$ is defined by fibre integration of the Hirzebruch class $\mathcal{L}_k (T_v E)$ of the vertical tangent bundle. More generally, given a discrete group $G$, a class $u \in H^p(B G;\mathbb{Q})$ and a map $f:E \to B G$, one has tautological classes $\kappa_{\mathcal{L}_k ,u}(E,f) \in H^{4k+p-n}(X;\mathbb{Q})$ associated to the Novikov higher signatures.
  For odd $n$, it is well-known that $\kappa_{\mathcal{L}_k}(E)=0$ for all bundles with $n$-dimensional fibres. The aim of this note is to show that the question whether more generally $\kappa_{\mathcal{L}_k,u}(E,f)=0$ (for odd $n$) depends sensitively on the group $G$ and the class $u$.
  For example, given a nonzero cohomology class $u \in H^2 (B \pi_1 (\Sigma_g);\mathbb{Q})$ of a surface group, we show that always $\kappa_{\mathcal{L}_k,u}(E,f)=0$ if $g \geq 2$, whereas sometimes $\kappa_{\mathcal{L}_k,u}(E,f)\neq 0$ if $g=1$.
  The vanishing theorem is obtained by a generalization of the index-theoretic proof that $\kappa_{\mathcal{L}_k}(E)=0$, while the nontriviality theorem follows with little effort from the work of Galatius and Randal-Williams on diffeomorphism groups of even-dimensional manifolds.</description>

      <title>On spherical Deligne complexes of type $D_n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11374v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Delta$ be the Artin complex of the Artin group of type $D_n$. This complex is also called the spherical Deligne complex of type $D_n$. We show certain types of 6-cycles in the 1-skeleton of $\Delta$ either have a center, which is a vertex adjacent to each vertex of the 6-cycle, or a quasi-center, which is a vertex adjacent to three of the alternating vertices of the 6-cycle. This will be a key ingredient in proving $K(\pi,1)$-conjecture for several classes of Artin groups in a companion article.
  As a consequence, we also deduce that certain 2-dimensional relative Artin complex inside the $D_n$-type Artin complex, endowed with the induced Moussong metric, is CAT$(1)$.</description>

      <title>Cycles in spherical Deligne complexes and application to $K(\pi,1)$-conjecture for Artin groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show the $K(\pi,1)$-conjecture holds for Artin groups whose Dynkin diagrams are complete bipartite (edge labels are allowed to be arbitrary), answering a question of J. McCammond. Along the way, we treat several related families of hyperbolic type Artin groups, namely the $K(\pi,1)$-conjecture holds for all 3-dimensional hyperbolic type Artin groups, except one single example with Dynkin diagram $[3,5,3]$; and the conjecture holds for all quasi-Lann\'er hyperbolic type Artin groups up to dimension 4. We also treat several higher dimensional families.
  Most of the article is about developing new methods of understanding combinatorial minimal fillings of certain types of cycles in spherical Deligne complexes or relative Artin complexes, via non-positive curvature geometry. Then we combine this with an approached to the $K(\pi,1)$-conjecture introduced by a previous article of the author to settle new cases of $K(\pi,1)$-conjecture.
  In the appendix we list some related open questions and conjectures.</description>
