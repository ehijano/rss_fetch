      <title>Investigating DNA words and their distributions across the tree of life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The frequency distributions of DNA k-mers are shaped by fundamental biological processes and offer a window into genome structure and evolution. Inspired by analogies to natural language, prior studies have attempted to model genomic k-mer usage using Zipf's law, a rank-frequency law originally formulated for words in human language. However, the extent to which this law accurately captures the distribution of k-mers across diverse species remains unclear. Here, we systematically analyze k-mer frequency spectra across more than 225,000 genome assemblies spanning all three domains of life and viruses. We demonstrate that Zipf's law consistently underperforms in modeling k-mer distributions. In contrast, we propose the truncated power law and Zipf-Mandelbrot distributions, which provide substantially improved fits across taxonomic groups. We show that genome size and GC content influence model performance, with larger and GC-content imbalanced genomes yielding better adherence. Additionally, we perform an extensive analysis on vocabulary expansion and exhaustion across the same organisms using Heaps' law. We apply our modeling framework to evaluate simulated genomes generated by k-let preserving shuffling and deep generative language models. Our results reveal substantial differences between organismal genomes and their synthetic or shuffled counterparts, offering a novel approach to benchmark the biological plausibility of artificial genomes. Collectively, this work establishes new standards for modeling genomic k-mer distributions and provides insights relevant to synthetic biology, and evolutionary sequence analysis.</description>

      <title>Minimum-Cost Synthetic Genome Planning: An Algorithmic Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As synthetic genomics scales toward the construction of increasingly larger genomes, computational strategies are needed to address technical feasibility. We introduce an algorithmic framework for the Minimum-Cost Synthetic Genome Planning problem, aiming to identify the most cost-effective strategy to assemble a target genome from a source genome through a combination of reuse, synthesis, and join operations. By comparing dynamic programming and greedy heuristic strategies under diverse cost regimes, we demonstrate how algorithmic choices influence the cost-efficiency of large-scale genome construction. In parallel, solving the Minimum-Cost Synthetic Genome Planning problem can help us better understand genome architecture and evolution. We applied our framework in case studies on viral genomes, including SARS-CoV-2, to examine how source-target genome similarity shapes construction costs. Our analyses revealed that conserved regions such as ORF1ab can be reconstructed cost-effectively from related templates, while highly variable regions such as the S (spike) gene are more reliant on DNA synthesis, highlighting the biological and economic trade-offs of genome design.</description>

      <title>Toward a Team of AI-made Scientists for Scientific Discovery from Gene Expression Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12391v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool for scientific discovery, enabling researchers to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets. For instance, it has facilitated the identification of disease-predictive genes from gene expression data, significantly advancing healthcare. However, the traditional process for analyzing such datasets demands substantial human effort and expertise for the data selection, processing, and analysis. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel framework, a Team of AI-made Scientists (TAIS), designed to streamline the scientific discovery pipeline. TAIS comprises simulated roles, including a project manager, data engineer, and domain expert, each represented by a Large Language Model (LLM). These roles collaborate to replicate the tasks typically performed by data scientists, with a specific focus on identifying disease-predictive genes. Furthermore, we have curated a benchmark dataset to assess TAIS's effectiveness in gene identification, demonstrating our system's potential to significantly enhance the efficiency and scope of scientific exploration. Our findings represent a solid step towards automating scientific discovery through large language models.</description>
