      <title>Invariant Measures in Time-Delay Coordinates for Unique Dynamical System Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Invariant measures are widely used to compare chaotic dynamical systems, as they offer robustness to noisy data, uncertain initial conditions, and irregular sampling. However, large classes of systems with distinct transient dynamics can still exhibit the same asymptotic statistical behavior, which poses challenges when invariant measures alone are used to perform system identification. Motivated by Takens' seminal embedding theory, we propose studying invariant measures in time-delay coordinates, which exhibit enhanced sensitivity to the underlying dynamics. Our first result demonstrates that a single invariant measure in time-delay coordinates can be used to perform system identification up to a topological conjugacy. This result already surpasses the capabilities of invariant measures in the original state coordinate. Continuing to explore the power of delay-coordinates, we eliminate all ambiguity from the conjugacy relation by showing that unique system identification can be achieved using additional invariant measures in time-delay coordinates constructed from different observables. Our findings improve the effectiveness of invariant measures in system identification and broaden the scope of measure-theoretic approaches to modeling dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>On the independence of shifts defined on $\mathbb{N}^d$ and trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the independence of shifts defined on $\mathbb{N}^d$ ($\mathbb{N}^d$ shift) and trees (tree-shift). Firstly, for the completeness of the article, we provide a proof that an $\mathbb{N}^d$ shift has positive (topological) entropy if and only if it has an independence set with positive upper density. Secondly, we obtain that when the base shift $X$ is a hereditary shift, then the associated tree-shift $\mathcal{T}_X$ on an unexpandable tree has positive entropy if and only if it has an independence set with positive density. However, the independence of the tree-shift on an expandable tree differs from that of $\mathbb{N}^d$ shifts or tree-shifts on unexpandable trees. The boundary independence property is introduced and we prove that it is equivalent to the positive entropy of a tree-shift on an expandable tree.</description>

      <title>Long-time Behaviour of the Non-autonomous Stochastic FitzHugh-Nagumo Systems on Thin Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the long-time behavior of non-autonomous stochastic FitzHugh-Nagumo systems on thin domains. As the (n+ 1)-dimensional thin domains collapses onto an n-dimensional domain, an n-dimensional limiting FitzHugh-Nagumo system is derived. This n-dimensional limit?ing system encodes the defining geometry of the (n+1)-dimensional system. To justify this limiting process, we show that the pullback measure attractors of the FitzHugh-Nagumo systems on thin domains are upper semi-continuous as the height of thin direction tends to zero.</description>

      <title>Optional participation only provides a narrow scope for sustaining cooperation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how cooperation emerges in public goods games is crucial for addressing societal challenges. While optional participation can establish cooperation without identifying cooperators, it relies on specific assumptions -- that individuals abstain and receive a non-negative payoff, or that non-participants cause damage to public goods -- which limits our understanding of its broader role. We generalize this mechanism by considering non-participants' payoffs and their potential direct influence on public goods, allowing us to examine how various strategic motives for non-participation affect cooperation. Using replicator dynamics, we find that cooperation thrives only when non-participants are motivated by individualistic or prosocial values, with individualistic motivations yielding optimal cooperation. These findings are robust to mutation, which slightly enlarges the region where cooperation can be maintained through cyclic dominance among strategies. Our results suggest that while optional participation can benefit cooperation, its effectiveness is limited and highlights the limitations of bottom-up schemes in supporting public goods.</description>

      <title>Maximal equicontinuous factor and minimal map on finitely suslinean continua</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f:X\to X$ be a hereditarily locally connected continuum homeomorphism and denote respectively by $P(f)$, $AP(f)$ and $\Omega(f)$, the sets of periodic points, almost periodic points and the non-wandering points of $f$. We show that any $\omega$-limit set (resp. $\alpha$-limit set) is minimal. Moreover, we show that $\Omega(f)=AP(f)$. We also prove that if $P(f)=\emptyset$, then there exists a unique minimal set. On the other hand, if $P(f)\neq\emptyset$ then we prove that any infinite minimal set has the adding machine structure and the absence of Li-Yorke pairs. Consequently, we partially solve the positive entropy conjecture which remains open even in the case of hereditarily locally connected continuum.</description>

      <title>On a countable sequence of homoclinic orbits arising near a saddle-center point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exponential small splitting of separatrices in the singular perturbation theory leads generally to nonvanishing oscillations near a saddle--center point and to nonexistence of a true homoclinic orbit. It was conjectured long ago that the oscillations may vanish at a countable set of small parameter values if there exist a quadruplet of singularities in the complex analytic extension of the limiting homoclinic orbit. The present paper gives a rigorous proof of this conjecture for a particular fourth-order equation relevant to the traveling wave reduction of the modified Korteweg--de Vries equation with the fifth-order dispersion term.</description>

      <title>An inverse problem in P\'olya--Schur theory. II. Exactly solvable operators and complex dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper, being the sequel of [An inverse problem in Polya-Schur theory. I. Non-genegerate and degenerate operators], studies a class of linear ordinary differential operators with polynomial coefficients called \emph{exactly solvable}; such an operator sends every polynomial of sufficiently large degree to a polynomial of the same degree. We focus on invariant subsets of the complex plane for such operators when their action is restricted to polynomials of a fixed degree and discover a connection between this topic and classical complex dynamics and its multi-valued counterpart. As a very special case of invariant sets we recover the Julia sets of rational functions.</description>

      <title>H\'enon maps with many rational periodic points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on work of Doyle and Hyde on polynomial maps in one variable, we produce for each odd integer $d \geq 2$ a H\'enon map of degree $d$ defined over $\mathbb{Q}$ with at least $(d-4)^2$ integral periodic points. This provides a quadratic lower bound on any conjectural uniform bound for periodic rational points of H\'enon maps. In contrast with the work of Doyle and Hyde, our examples also admit integer cycles of large period.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The connections between Euler's equations on central extensions of Lie algebras and Euler's equations on the original, extended algebras are described. A special infinite sequence of central extensions of nilpotent Lie algebras constructed from the Lie algebra of formal vector fields on the line is considered, and the orbits of coadjoint representations for these algebras are described. By using the compact nilmanifolds constructed from these algebras by I.K. Babenko and the author, it is shown that covering Lie groups for symplectic nilmanifolds can have any rank as solvable Lie groups.</description>

      <title>Linear Simple Cycle Reservoirs at the edge of stability perform Fourier decomposition of the input driving signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the representational structure of linear Simple Cycle Reservoirs (SCR) operating at the edge of stability. We view SCR as providing in their state space feature representations of the input-driving time series. By endowing the state space with the canonical dot-product, we ``reverse engineer" the corresponding kernel (inner product) operating in the original time series space. The action of this time-series kernel is fully characterized by the eigenspace of the corresponding metric tensor. We demonstrate that when linear SCRs are constructed at the edge of stability, the eigenvectors of the time-series kernel align with the Fourier basis. This theoretical insight is supported by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Dynamics and Probability Analysis for a Generalized Epidemic Model with Environmental Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a stochastic SEIQR (susceptible-exposed-infected-quarantined-recovered) epidemic model with a generalized incidence function. Using the Lyapunov method, we establish the existence and uniqueness of a global positive solution to the model, ensuring that it remains well-defined over time. Through the application of Young's inequality and Chebyshev's inequality, we demonstrate the concepts of stochastic ultimate boundedness and stochastic permanence, providing insights into the long-term behavior of the epidemic dynamics under random perturbations. Furthermore, we derive conditions for stochastic extinction, which describe scenarios where the epidemic may eventually die out, and V-geometric ergodicity, which indicates the rate at which the system's state converges to its equilibrium. Finally, we perform numerical simulations to verify our theoretical results and assess the model's behavior under different parameters.</description>

      <title>Scalable nonlinear manifold reduced order model for dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The domain decomposition (DD) nonlinear-manifold reduced-order model (NM-ROM) represents a computationally efficient method for integrating underlying physics principles into a neural network-based, data-driven approach. Compared to linear subspace methods, NM-ROMs offer superior expressivity and enhanced reconstruction capabilities, while DD enables cost-effective, parallel training of autoencoders by partitioning the domain into algebraic subdomains. In this work, we investigate the scalability of this approach by implementing a "bottom-up" strategy: training NM-ROMs on smaller domains and subsequently deploying them on larger, composable ones. The application of this method to the two-dimensional time-dependent Burgers' equation shows that extrapolating from smaller to larger domains is both stable and effective. This approach achieves an accuracy of 1% in relative error and provides a remarkable speedup of nearly 700 times.</description>

      <title>Graph-Based Proofs of Indistinguishability of Linear Compartmental Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given experimental data, one of the main objectives of biological modeling is to construct a model which best represents the real world phenomena. In some cases, there could be multiple distinct models exhibiting the exact same dynamics, meaning from the modeling perspective it would be impossible to distinguish which model is ``correct.'' This is the study of indistinguishability of models, and in our case we focus on linear compartmental models which are often used to model pharmacokinetics, cell biology, ecology, and related fields. Specifically, we focus on a family of linear compartmental models called skeletal path models which have an underlying directed path, and have recently been shown to have the first recorded sufficient conditions for indistinguishability based on underlying graph structure. In this recent work, certain families of skeletal path models were proven to be indistinguishable, however the proofs relied heavily on linear algebra. In this work, we reprove several of these indistinguishability results instead using a graph theoretic framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish general conditions for stochastic evolution equations with locally monotone drift and degenerate additive L\'evy noise in variational formulation resulting in the existence of a unique invariant measure for the associated weakly ergodic Markovian Feller semigroup. We prove improved moment estimates for the solutions and the so-called $e$-property of the semigroup. Examples include the stochastic incompressible 2D Navier-Stokes equations, shear thickening stochastic power-law fluid equations, the stochastic heat equation, as well as, stochastic semilinear equations such as the 1D stochastic Burgers equation.</description>

Abstract: We determine the minimum dilatation $\delta_n$ among pseudo-Anosov braids with $n$ strands, for large enough values of $n$. This confirms a conjecture of Venzke that $\lim_{n \to \infty} \delta_n^n = (2+\sqrt{3})^2 \approx 13.928$. Together with previous work, this also solves the minimum dilatation problem on the $n$-punctured sphere, for all but $6$ values of $n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The set of badly approximable numbers, Bad, is known to be winning for Schmidt's game and hence has full Hausdorff dimension. It is also known that the set of inhomogeneously badly approximable numbers has full dimension. We prove that the set difference also has full dimension using a variant of the Schmidt game, which we call the rapid game, played on the space of unimodular grids.</description>

      <title>On closed characteristics of minimal action on a convex three-sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that every closed characteristic of minimal action on the boundary of a uniformly convex domain in $\R^4$ bounds a disk-like global surface of section. A corollary is that the cylindrical symplectic capacity of a convex body in $\R^4$ coincides with the minimal action of a closed generalized characteristic on its boundary.</description>

      <title>Illumination in Rational Billiards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09358</link>
      <description>arXiv:1905.09358v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that for a rational polygonal billiard, the set of pairs of points that do not illuminate each other (not connected by a billiard trajectory) is finite, and use the same method to extend the results of Leli\`evre, Monteil and Weiss, and of Apisa and Wright about the amount of pairs of points that are finitely blocked with a certain blocking cardinality. We rely on previous work about the blocking property in translation surfaces which ultimately stems from results of Eskin, Mirzakhani and Mohammadi on dynamics of moduli spaces of translation surfaces.</description>

      <title>Non-integrability of the axisymmetric Bianchi IX cosmological model via Differential Galois Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.10108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.10108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the integrability of an anisotropic universe with matter and cosmological constant formulated as Bianchi IX models. The presence of the cosmological constant causes the existence of a critical point in the finite part of the phase space. The separatrix associated to this Einstein's static universe is entirely contained in an invariant isotropic plane forgetting the singularity at the origin. This invariant plane of isotropy is an integrable sub-space of the Taub type. In this paper we analyse the differential Galois group of the second order variational equations to this plane in order to apply the integrability theorem of the second author with Ramis and Sim\' o. The main result is that the model is non-integrable by meromorphic functions.</description>

      <title>A geometric dynamical system with relation to billiards</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.02207v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a geometric dynamical system where iteration is defined as a cycling composition of different maps acting on a space composed of three or more lines in $\mathbb{R}^2$. This system is motivated by the dynamics of iterated function systems, as well as billiards with modified reflection laws. We provide conditions under which this dynamical system generates periodic orbits, and use this result to prove the existence of closed nonsmooth curves over $\mathbb{R}^2$ which satisfy particular structural constraints with respect to a space of intersecting lines in the plane.</description>

      <title>Deficiency of chemical reaction networks: The effect of operations that preserve multistationarity and periodic orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate six operations on chemical reaction networks, all of which have been proven to preserve important dynamical properties, namely, the capacity for nondegenerate multistationarity (multiple steady states) and periodic orbits. Both multistationarity and periodic orbits are properties that are known to be precluded when the deficiency (a nonnegative integer associated to a network) is zero. It is therefore natural to conjecture that the deficiency never decreases when any of the six aforementioned network operations are performed. We prove that this is indeed the case, and moreover, we characterize the numerical difference in deficiency after performing each network operation.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of homoclinic orbits to L3: Nonvanishing of the Stokes constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Restricted Planar Circular 3-Body Problem models the motion of a body of negligible mass under the gravitational influence of two massive bodies, called the primaries, which perform circular orbits coplanar with that of the massless body. In rotating coordinates, it can be modelled by a two degrees of freedom Hamiltonian system, which has five critical points called the Lagrange points. Among them, the point L3 is a saddle-center which is collinear with the primaries and beyond the largest of the two. The papers arXiv:2107.09942 and arXiv:2107.09941 provide an asymptotic formula for the distance between the one dimensional stable and unstable manifolds of L3 in a transverse section for small values of the mass ratio $\mu$. This distance is exponentially small with respect to $\mu$ and its first order depends on what is usually called a Stokes constant. The non-vanishing of this constant implies that the distance between the invariant manifolds at the section is not zero. In this paper, we prove that the Stokes constant is non-zero. The proof is computer assisted.</description>

      <title>Cusp bifurcations: numerical detection via two-parameter continuation and computer-assisted proofs of existence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel computer-assisted method for detecting and constructively proving the existence of cusp bifurcations in differential equations. The approach begins with a two-parameter continuation along which a tool based on the theory of Poincar\'e index is employed to identify the presence of a cusp bifurcation. Using the approximate cusp location, Newton's method is then applied to a given augmented system (the cusp map), yielding a more precise numerical approximation of the cusp. Through a successful application of a Newton-Kantorovich type theorem, we establish the existence of a non-degenerate zero of the cusp map in the vicinity of the numerical approximation. Employing a Gershgorin circles argument, we then prove that exactly one eigenvalue of the Jacobian matrix at the cusp candidate has zero real part, thus rigorously confirming the presence of a cusp bifurcation. Finally, by incorporating explicit control over the cusp's location, a rigorous enclosure for the normal form coefficient is obtained, providing the explicit dynamics on the center manifold at the cusp. We show the effectiveness of this method by applying it to four distinct models.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of distal actions of automorphisms on the space of one-parameter subgroups of Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a connected Lie group $G$ and an automorphism $T$ of $G$, we consider the action of $T$ on Sub$_G$, the compact space of closed subgroups of $G$ endowed with the Chabauty topology. We study the action of $T$ on Sub$^p_G$, the closure in Sub$_G$ of the set of closed one-parameter subgroups of $G$. We relate the distality of the $T$-action on Sub$^p_G$ with that of the $T$-action on $G$ and characterise the same in terms of compactness of the closed subgroup generated by $T$ in Aut$(G)$ when $T$ acts distally on the maximal central torus and $G$ is not a vector group. We extend these results to the action of subgroups ${\mathcal H}$ of Aut$(G)$ and equate the distal action of any closed subgroup ${\mathcal H}$ on Sub$^p_G$ with that of every element in ${\mathcal H}$. Moreover, we show that a connected Lie group $G$ acts distally on Sub$^p_G$ by conjugation if and only if $G$ is either compact or it is isomorphic to a direct product of a compact group and a vector group. Some of our results extend those of Shah and Yadav.</description>

      <title>On the stability of the logit dynamics in population games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03507v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic stability of the logit evolutionary dynamics in population games, possibly with multiple heterogenous populations. For general population games, we prove that, on the one hand, strict Nash equilibria are asymptotically stable under the logit dynamics for low enough noise levels, on the other hand, a globally exponentially stable logit equilibrium exists for sufficiently large noise levels. This suggests the emergence of bifurcations in population games admitting multiple strict Nash equilibria, as observed in numerous examples. We then provide sufficient conditions on the population game structure for the existence of globally asymptotically stable logit equilibria for every noise level. The considered class of monotone separable games finds applications, e.g., in routing games on series compositions of networks with parallel routes when there are multiple populations of users that differ in the reward functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03601v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate and compare applications of the Zilber-Pink conjecture and dynamical methods to rigidity problems for arithmetic real and complex hyperbolic lattices. Along the way we obtain new general results about reconstructing a variation of Hodge structure from its typical Hodge locus that may be of independent interest. Applications to Siu's immersion problem are also discussed, the most general of which only requires the hypothesis that infinitely many closed geodesics map to proper totally geodesic subvarieties under the immersion.</description>

      <title>Competition between group interactions and nonlinearity in voter dynamics on hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social dynamics are often driven by both pairwise (i.e., dyadic) relationships and higher-order (i.e., polyadic) group relationships, which one can describe using hypergraphs. To gain insight into the impact of polyadic relationships on dynamical processes on networks, we formulate and study a polyadic voter process, which we call the group-driven voter model (GVM), that incorporates the effect of group interactions by nonlinear interactions that are subject to a group (i.e., hyperedge) constraint. By examining the competition between nonlinearity and group sizes, we show that the GVM achieves consensus faster than standard voter-model dynamics, with an optimal minimizing exit time. We substantiate this finding by using mean-field theory on annealed uniform hypergraphs with $N$ nodes, for which the exit time scales as ${\cal A}\ln N$, where the prefactor ${\cal A}$ depends both on the nonlinearity and on group-constraint factors. Our results reveal how competition between group interactions and nonlinearity shapes GVM dynamics. We thereby highlight the importance of such competing effects in complex systems with polyadic interactions.</description>
