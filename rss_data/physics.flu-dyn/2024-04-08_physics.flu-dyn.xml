      <title>From an obliquely falling rod in a viscous fluid to the motion of suspended magnetic bead chains that are driven by a gradient magnetic field and that make an arbitrary angle with the magnetic force vector: A Stokes flow study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In view of the growing role of magnetic particles under magnetic field influence in medical and other applications, and perforce the bead chaining, it is important to understand more generally the chain dynamics. As is well known, in the presence of a magnetic field, magnetic beads tend to form chains that are aligned with the magnetic field vector. In addition, if there is a magnetic field gradient, there will be a magnetic force acting on this chain. The main goal of the present research is to study the motion of a magnetic bead chain that makes an arbitrary angle with the magnetic force vector in the Stokes flow limit, that is, in the limit of zero Reynolds number. We used the public-domain computer program HYDRO++ to calculate the mobility matrix, which relates the magnetic force acting on the chain to the velocity of the chain, for a chain of N beads making an arbitrary angle with the magnetic force vector. Because of the presence of off-diagonal elements of the mobility matrix, as the chain is drawn in the direction of the magnetic force, it is also deflected to the side. We derived analytic solutions for this motion. Also, for bead chains moving in directions both parallel and perpendicular to their lengths, we fit three-parameter functions to solutions from HYDRO++. We found the fits to be excellent. Combining these results with the analytic solutions, we obtained expressions for the velocity components for the bead chains that provide excellent fits to HYDRO++ solutions for arbitrary angles. Finally, we apply the methodology used for the bead chain studies to the study of an obliquely falling rod in a viscous fluid and derive analytic solutions for the velocity components of the obliquely falling rod.</description>

      <title>Ups and downs: Copepods reverse the near-body flow to cruise in the water column</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Copepods participate in large-scale diel vertical migrations (DVM) as primary consumers in marine ecosystems. Given that they are negatively buoyant, gravity facilitates their downward cruising but impedes their upward relocation. In principle, overcoming this retarding force using drag-based propulsion during upward swimming incurs extra energy costs that neutrally buoyant or gravity-assisted downward swimmers fundamentally avoid. This added power requirement seemingly renders upward swimming disproportionally less efficient than downward swimming. However, we found a compensatory mechanism enhancing thrust in upward-swimming copepods. Using experimentally derived velocity and pressure fields, we observed that copepods pull water to the anterior, generating sub-ambient pressure gradients when cruising upwards, thereby inducing an upstream suction force to complement the thrust produced by the legs. Contrary to expectations that drag forces always dominate the leg recovery phase, the results show that the upstream suction generates net thrust for about a third of the recovery stroke. Such a suction-thrust mechanism promotes cost-effective swimming in larger animals like fish and jellyfish. However, it has never been reported at small scales. We compare these results with downward-swimming copepods that push rather than pull on water and demonstrate they do not benefit from thrust-enhancing suction effects during the recovery stroke. Instead, downward cruisers leverage gravitational effects to swim faster. `Puller' and `pusher' behaviors are driven by alterations of the leg kinematics, indicating a response to the body orientation rather than a fixed organism trait. These results offer insights into an essential swimming mechanism that can inform us about the role of mesozooplankton in driving biogenic hydrodynamic transport and its effects on marine biogeochemistry.</description>

      <title>PointSAGE: Mesh-independent superresolution approach to fluid flow predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) serves as a powerful tool for simulating fluid flow across diverse industries. High-resolution CFD simulations offer valuable insights into fluid behavior and flow patterns, aiding in optimizing design features or enhancing system performance. However, as resolution increases, computational data requirements and time increase proportionately. This presents a persistent challenge in CFD. Recently, efforts have been directed towards accurately predicting fine-mesh simulations using coarse-mesh simulations, with geometry and boundary conditions as input. Drawing inspiration from models designed for super-resolution, deep learning techniques like UNets have been applied to address this challenge. However, these existing methods are limited to structured data and fail if the mesh is unstructured due to its inability to convolute. Additionally, incorporating geometry/mesh information in the training process introduces drawbacks such as increased data requirements, challenges in generalizing to unseen geometries for the same physical phenomena, and issues with robustness to mesh distortions. To address these concerns, we propose a novel framework, PointSAGE a mesh-independent network that leverages the unordered, mesh-less nature of Pointcloud to learn the complex fluid flow and directly predict fine simulations, completely neglecting mesh information. Utilizing an adaptable framework, the model accurately predicts the fine data across diverse point cloud sizes, regardless of the training dataset's dimension. We have evaluated the effectiveness of PointSAGE on diverse datasets in different scenarios, demonstrating notable results and a significant acceleration in computational time in generating fine simulations compared to standard CFD techniques.</description>

      <title>Exact and Approximate Solutions for Magnetohydrodynamic Flow Control in Hele-Shaw Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the motion of a thin layer of electrically conducting fluid, between two closely spaced parallel plates, in a classical Hele-Shaw geometry. Furthermore, let the system be immersed in a uniform external magnetic field (normal to the plates) and let electrical current be driven between conducting probes immersed in the fluid layer. In the present paper, we analyse the ensuing fluid flow at low Hartmann numbers. We first elucidate the mechanism of flow generation both physically and mathematically. We proceed by presenting mathematical solutions for a class of canonical multiply-connected geometries, in terms of the prime function developed by Crowdy (2020). Notably, those solutions can be written explicitly as series, and are thus exact, in doubly-connected geometries. Note that in higher connectivities, the prime function must be evaluated numerically. We then demonstrate how recently developed fast numerical methods may be applied to accurately determine the flow-field in arbitrary geometries when exact solutions are inaccessible.</description>

      <title>Turbulence-induced oscillation on particle detachment from a wall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle resuspension is a ubiquitous phenomenon with pivotal relevance in numerous natural and industrial contexts. In this study, we present findings on the resuspension of individual micro-sized particles, captured through high-speed camera experiments. Our observations reveal a universal behavior whereby a particle undergoes oscillatory motion due to turbulent excitation prior to its detachment from the surface. This motion is characterized by dimensionless number Ad and S. The frequency of particles oscillation is analyzed and it shows the frequency of particle oscillations increased with decreasing particle size. We establish a new model that the particle is a linear oscillator driven by stochastic torque from turbulence. It is shown that the stochastic oscillation is the key mechanism for particle detachment from a wall within a certain range of friction velocities.</description>

      <title>A Thermodynamically Consistent Phase-Field Model and an Entropy Stable Numerical Method for Simulating Two-Phase Flows with Thermocapillary Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we have derived a thermodynamically consistent phase-field model for two-phase flows with thermocapillary effects. This model accommodates variations in physical properties such as density, viscosity, heat capacity, and thermal conductivity between the two components. The model equations encompass a Cahn-Hilliard equation with the volume fraction as the phase variable, a Navier-Stokes equation, and a heat equation, and meanwhile maintains mass conservation, energy conservation, and entropy increase simultaneously. Given the highly coupled and nonlinear nature of the model equations, we developed a semi-decoupled, mass-preserving, and entropy-stable time-discrete numerical method. We conducted several numerical tests to validate both our model and numerical method. Additionally, we have investigated the merging process of two bubbles under non-isothermal conditions and compared the results with those under isothermal conditions. Our findings reveal that temperature gradients influence bubble morphology and lead to earlier merging. Moreover, we have observed that the merging of bubbles slows down with increasing heat Peclect number PeT when the initial temperature field increases linearly along the channel, while bubbles merge faster with heat Peclect number PeT when the initial temperature field decreases linearly along the channel.</description>

      <title>On the relevance of lift force modelling in turbulent wall flows with small inertial particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In particle-laden turbulent wall flows, lift forces can influence the near-wall turbulence. This has been recently observed in particle-resolved simulations, which, however, are too expensive to be used in upscaled models. Instead, point-particle simulations have been the method of choice to simulate the dynamics of these flows during the last decades. While this approach is simpler, cheaper, and physically sound for small inertial particles in turbulence, some issues remain. In the present work, we address challenges associated with lift force modelling in turbulent wall flows and the impact of lift forces in the near-wall flow. We performed direct numerical simulations (DNS) of small inertial point particles in turbulent channel flow for fixed Stokes number and mass loading while varying the particle size. Our results show that the particle dynamics in the buffer region, causing the apparent particle-to-fluid slip velocity to vanish, raise major challenges for accurately modelling lift forces. While our results confirm that lift forces have little influence on particle dynamics for sufficiently small particle sizes, for inner-scaled diameters of order one and beyond, lift forces become quite important near the wall. The different particle dynamics under lift forces result in the modulation of streamwise momentum transport in the near-wall region. We analyze this lift-induced turbulence modulation for different lift force models, and the results indicate that realistic models are critical for particle-modeled simulations to correctly predict turbulence modulation by particles in the near-wall region.</description>

      <title>Wall-modeled large-eddy simulation based on spectral-element discretization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article analyses the simulation methodology for wall-modeled large-eddy simulations using solvers based on the spectral-element method (SEM). To that end, algebraic wall modeling is implemented in the popular SEM solver Nek5000. It is combined with explicit subgrid-scale (SGS) modeling, which is shown to perform better than the high-frequency filtering traditionally used with the SEM. In particular, the Vreman model exhibits a good balance in terms stabilizing the simulations, yet retaining good resolution of the turbulent scales. Some difficulties associated with SEM simulations on relatively coarse grids are also revealed: jumps in derivatives across element boundaries, lack of convergence for weakly formulated boundary conditions, and the necessity for the SGS model as a damper for high-frequency modes. In spite of these, state-of-the-art accuracy is achieved for turbulent channel flow and flat-plate turbulent boundary layer flow cases, proving the SEM to be a an excellent numerical framework for massively-parallel high-order WMLES.</description>

      <title>Complex network approach to the turbulent velocity gradient dynamics: High- and low-probability Lagrangian paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of the turbulent velocity gradient tensor (VGT) is essential to gain insights into the Navier-Stokes equations and improve small-scale turbulence modeling. However, characterizing the VGT dynamics conditional on all its relevant invariants in a continuous fashion is extremely difficult. In this paper, we represent the VGT Lagrangian dynamics using a network where each node represents a unique flow state. This approach enables us to discern how the VGT transitions from one state to another in a simplified fashion. Our analysis reveals intriguing features of the resulting network, such as the clustering of the commonly visited nodes where the eigenvalues of the VGT are real, in the proximity of the Vieillefosse tail. We then relate our complex network approach to the well-established VGT discretization based on the sign of its principal invariants, $Q$ and $R$, and its discriminant, $\Delta$. To this end, we separate the shortest paths on the network (geodesics) based on the $Q$-$R$ region to which their starting and arrival nodes belong. The distribution of the length of intra-region geodesics, with starting and arrival nodes belonging to the same $Q$-$R$ region, exhibits a distinct bimodality in two regions of the $Q$-$R$ plane, those in which the deviatoric part of the pressure Hessian introduces complexity to the VGT dynamics. Such bimodality is associated with infrequently visited nodes having to follow a long, low probability path to drastically change the state of the VGT compared to other flow states that can acquire the necessary characteristics without changing their sign for $Q$ or $R$. We complement the geodesics approach by examining random walks on the network, showing how the VGT non-normality and the associated production terms distinguish the shortest commuting paths between different $Q$-$R$ regions.</description>

      <title>A free boundary problem for an immersed filament in 3D Stokes flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a simplified extensible version of a dynamic free boundary problem for a thin filament with radius $\epsilon&gt;0$ immersed in 3D Stokes flow. The 3D fluid is coupled to the quasi-1D filament dynamics via a novel type of angle-averaged Neumann-to-Dirichlet operator for the Stokes equations, and much of the difficulty in the analysis lies in understanding this operator. Here we show that the main part of this angle-averaged NtD map about a closed, curved filament is the corresponding operator about a straight filament, for which we can derive an explicit symbol. Remainder terms due to curvature are lower order with respect to regularity or size in $\epsilon$. Using this operator decomposition, it is then possible to show that the simplified free boundary evolution is a third-order parabolic equation and is locally well posed. This establishes a more complete mathematical foundation for the myriad computational results based on slender body approximations for thin immersed elastic structures.</description>

      <title>Selecting active matter according to motility in an acoustofluidic setup: Self-propelled particles and sperm cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active systems -- including sperm cells, living organisms like bacteria, fish, birds, or active soft matter systems like synthetic ''microswimmers'' -- are characterized by motility, i.e., the ability to propel using their own ''engine''. Motility is the key feature that distinguishes active systems from passive or externally driven systems. In a large ensemble, motility of individual species can vary in a wide range. Selecting active species according to their motility represents an exciting and challenging problem. We propose a new method for selecting active species based on their motility using an acoustofluidic setup where highly motile species escape from the acoustic trap. This is demonstrated in simulations and in experiments with self-propelled Janus particles and human sperm. The immediate application of this method is selecting highly motile sperm for medically assisted reproduction (MAR). Due to the tunable acoustic trap, the proposed method is more flexible than the existing passive microfluidic methods. The proposed selection method based on motility can also be applied to other active systems that require selecting highly motile species or removing immotile species.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a sedimenting suspension in a Stokes flow, in the presence of a vertical wall. We study the effect of a particle-depleted fluid layer near the wall on the bulk dynamics of the suspension. We show that this effect can be captured by an appropriate wall law of Navier type. We provide in this way a rigorous justification of the apparent slip observed in many experiments. We also discuss the phenomenon of intrinsic convection predicted in some physics articles.</description>

      <title>Negative APE dissipation as the fundamental criterion for double diffusive instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12536v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The background potential energy (BPE) is the only reservoir that double diffusive instabilities can tap their energy from when developing from an unforced motionless state with no available potential energy (APE). Recently, Middleton and Taylor linked the extraction of BPE into APE to the sign of the diapycnal component of the buoyancy flux, but their criterion can only predict diffusive convection instability, not salt finger instability. Here, we show that the problem can be corrected if the sign of the APE dissipation rate is used instead, making it emerge as the most fundamental criterion for double diffusive instabilities. A theory for the APE dissipation rate for a two-component fluid relative to its single-component counterpart is developed as a function of three parameters: the diffusivity ratio, the density ratio, and a spiciness parameter. The theory correctly predicts the occurrence of both salt finger and diffusive convection instabilities in the laminar unforced regime, while more generally predicting that the APE dissipation rate for a two-component fluid can be enhanced, suppressed, or even have the opposite sign compared to that for a single-component fluid, with important implications for the study of ocean mixing. Because negative APE dissipation can also occur in stably stratified single-component and doubly stable two-component stratified fluids, we speculate that only the thermodynamic theory of exergy can explain its physics; however, this necessitates accepting that APE dissipation is a conversion between APE and the internal energy component of BPE, in contrast to prevailing assumptions.</description>

      <title>Efficient survival strategy for zooplankton in turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Zooplankton in a quiescent environment can detect predators by hydrodynamic sensing, triggering powerful escape responses. Since turbulent strain tends to mask the hydrodynamic signal, the organisms should avoid such regions, but it is not known how they accomplish this. We found a simple, robust, and highly efficient strategy, that relies on measuring the sign of gradients of squared strain. Plankton following this strategy show very strong spatial clustering, and align against the local flow velocity, facilitating mate finding and feeding. The strategy has the potential to reconcile competing fitness pressures.</description>

      <title>Flow cross-overs under surface fluctuations in cylindrical nano-channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse surface-fluctuations-driven fluid flow through nano-channels to investigate the interplay between boundary layer flow structures and the bulk flow of fluid under a pressure-head. Surface fluctuations of a wide range of frequencies (up to several thousands of Hertz) in a nano-channel keep the flow in the low Reynolds number regime. Using this advantage of low Reynolds number flow, we develop a perturbation analysis of the fluid flow that clearly distinguishes the bulk flow under a pressure head around the axis of a nano-tube from its surface flow structure induced by fluctuations. In terms of particle transport under such flow conditions, there exists the opportunity to drag particles near the periphery of the nano-tube in a direction opposite to the bulk flow near the axis. This can potentially find applications in the separation, trapping, and filtration of particles under surface-driven flow through nano-tubes under widely varying conditions.</description>

      <title>Accuracy and Performance Evaluation of Low Density Internal and External Flow Predictions using CFD and DSMC</title>

Abstract: The Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method was widely used to simulate low density gas flows with large Knudsen numbers. However, DSMC encounters limitations in the regime of lower Knudsen numbers (Kn&lt;0.1). In such cases, approaches from classical computational fluid dynamics (CFD) relying on the continuum assumption are preferred, offering accurate solutions at acceptable computational costs. In experiments aimed at imaging aerosolized nanoparticles in vacuo a wide range of Knudsen numbers occur, which motivated the present study on the analysis of the advantages and drawbacks of DSMC and CFD simulations of rarefied flows in terms of accuracy and computational effort. Furthermore, the potential of hybrid methods is evaluated. For this purpose, DSMC and CFD simulations of the flow inside a convergent-divergent nozzle (internal expanding flow) and the flow around a conical body (external shock generating flow) were carried out. CFD simulations utilize the software OpenFOAM and the DSMC solution is obtained using the software SPARTA. The results of these simulation techniques are evaluated by comparing them with experimental data (1), evaluating the time-to-solution (2) and the energy consumption (3), and assessing the feasibility of hybrid CFD-DSMC approaches (4).

      <title>On the early stages of vapor bubble growth: From the surface-tension to the inertial regime</title>

Abstract: This paper presents a new analytical model for the early stages of vapor bubble growth in superheated liquids. The model bridges a gap in current knowledge by focusing on the surface tension-controlled, near-equilibrium growth regime and its transition to an inertia-controlled regime. A unified analytical model is derived by combining a perturbation method for the initial growth regime with a complementary outer solution to model the subsequent bubble growth rate. The model successfully predicts the initial delay in bubble growth due to surface tension effects. Two non-dimensional parameters govern this delay period: the initial perturbation from the equilibrium radius and the Ohnesorge number at the onset of nucleation. The Ohnesorge number encapsulates the interplay between viscous damping and surface tension forces acting on the bubble during its early growth stages. The analytical solutions presented here allow for quantifying the surface-tension, inertial, and transitional regimes while establishing a simple criterion for estimating the influence of thermal effects on early-stage growth. Our findings emphasize the significance of considering the surface tension delay, particularly for short timescales. The derived analytical solutions and the obtained correlation for surface-tension-induced delay may prove a practical tool and could be integrated into existing models of vapor bubble growth.</description>

      <title>Pattern formation by turbulent cascades</title>

Abstract: Fully developed turbulence is a universal and scale-invariant chaotic state characterized by an energy cascade from large to small scales where the cascade is eventually arrested by dissipation. In this article, we show how to harness these seemingly structureless turbulent cascades to generate patterns. Pattern formation entails a process of wavelength selection, which can usually be traced to the linear instability of a homogeneous state. By contrast, the mechanism we propose here is fully non-linear. It is triggered by a non-dissipative arrest of turbulent cascades: energy piles up at an intermediate scale, which is neither the system size nor the smallest scales at which energy is usually dissipated. Using a combination of theory and large-scale simulations, we show that the tunable wavelength of these cascade-induced patterns can be set by a non-dissipative transport coefficient called odd viscosity, ubiquitous in chiral fluids ranging from bio-active to quantum systems. Odd viscosity, which acts as a scale-dependent Coriolis-like force, leads to a two-dimensionalization of the flow at small scales, in contrast with rotating fluids where a two-dimensionalization occurs at large scales. Beyond odd-viscosity fluids, we discuss how cascade-induced patterns can arise in natural systems including atmospheric flows, stellar plasma such as the solar wind~, or the pulverization and coagulation of objects or droplets where mass rather than energy cascades.</description>

      <title>Reduced-order models of wall shear stress patterns in the left atrial appendage from a data-augmented atrial database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05443</link>

Abstract: Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, affecting over 1% of the population. It is usually triggered by irregular electrical impulses that cause the atria to contract irregularly and ineffectively. It increases blood stasis and the risk of thrombus formation within the left atrial appendage (LAA) and aggravates adverse atrial remodeling. Despite recent efforts, LAA flow patterns representative of AF conditions and their association with LAA stasis remain poorly characterized.
  Aim: To develop reduced-order data-driven models of LAA flow patterns during atrial remodeling in order to uncover flow disturbances concurrent with LAA stasis that could add granularity to clinical decision criteria.
  Methods: We combined a geometric data augmentation process with projection of results from 180 CFD atrial simulations on a universal LAA coordinate (ULAAC) system. The projection approach enhances data visualization and facilitates direct comparison between different anatomical and functional states. ULAAC projections were used as input for a proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) algorithm to build reduced-order models of hemodynamic metrics, extracting flow characteristics associated with AF and non-AF anatomies.
  Results: We verified that the ULAAC system provides an adequate representation to visualize data distributions on the LAA surface and to build POD-based reduced-order models. These models revealed significant differences in LAA flow patterns for atrial geometries that underwent adverse atrial remodeling and experienced elevated blood stasis. Together with anatomical morphing-based patient-specific data augmentation, this approach could facilitate data-driven analyses to identify flow features associated with thrombosis risk due to atrial remodeling.</description>
