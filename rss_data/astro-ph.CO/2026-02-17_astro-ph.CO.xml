      <title>CMB Spectral Distortions from Resonant Conversions in Atomic Dark Sectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark sectors consisting of atomic constituents (electrons, protons, and photons) offer a well-motivated extension to the Standard Model while providing multiple avenues for phenomenological study. In this work, we explore the impact of conversions between the dark and Standard Model photons in the primordial CMB spectral distortion epoch ($10^3 \lesssim z \lesssim 10^6$). These conversions are resonantly enhanced when the induced thermal masses of both photonic species are equal, thus leading to the possibility that sizeable distortions can be produced. To this end, we solve the Boltzmann equation at early times to determine the (irreducible) freeze-in or freeze-out abundance of dark photons. This procedure also allows us to update the limits on generic milli-charged dark sectors using the ACT DR6 bound on the number of effective radiative degrees of freedom ($N_{\rm eff}$). By then modeling the evolution of the thermal masses in both sectors, we compute the primordial CMB distortion using the Landau-Zener formalism. We find that when the dark electron and proton are roughly similar in mass (the positronium limit), current spectral distortion data from the COBE/FIRAS instrument is able to rule out novel regions of parameter space. We also forecast bounds from the proposed FOSSIL satellite, finding that spectral distortions can also be used to probe the ultra-low dark electric charge regions of parameter space, which are difficult to investigate by other means.</description>

      <title>The Signature of Strong High-Redshift Radio Backgrounds on the Cosmic Dawn 21-cm Bispectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurements from the Absolute Radiometer for Cosmology, Astrophysics, and Diffuse Emission 2 (ARCADE-2) reveal a strong radio background in the GHz frequency range. Since the cosmological 21-cm signal is measured relative to the background radiation temperature, the presence of a radio excess can significantly alter its characteristics. Previous studies have explored the impact of an inhomogeneous radio background on the global 21-cm signal and 21-cm power spectrum. This non-uniform radio background is also expected to introduce substantial non-Gaussianity. In this work, using the bispectrum, we analyze the non-Gaussianity in the 21-cm signal in the presence of an excess galactic radio background and investigate how line-of-sight radio fluctuations from early galaxies influence its nature. We find that even a moderate enhancement in radio efficiency in early galaxies significantly affects the small-scale 21-cm bispectrum. Furthermore, the delayed heating transition caused by a galactic radio background shifts the sign change in the squeezed-limit bispectrum to lower redshifts ($z\sim11$), providing a potential observational signature for distinguishing different radio background models. These results demonstrate that the 21-cm bispectrum, particularly in the squeezed limit, is highly sensitive to radio background fluctuations, making it a powerful tool for probing high-redshift radio-loud sources and the physics of the early cosmic epoch.</description>

      <title>Constraining Lorentz Violation using 21cm and CMB Cross Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lorentz symmetry is a fundamental pillar of modern Physics, yet high-energy theories often predict its violation. One potential signature of such a violation is cosmic birefringence - rotation of the polarization plane of photons due to Chern-Simons coupling in Maxwell's electrodynamics. This rotation angle, aka birefringence angle, depends upon the distance travelled by the photon and is thus different for CMB and 21cm photons. While the rotation angle in CMB, i.e., $\alpha_\mathrm{CMB}$, has been tightly constrained by CMB experiments, the potential of the 21cm cosmological signal to constrain this parameter, as well as constrain $\alpha_\mathrm{21cm}$, remains largely unexplored. In this work, we provide constraints on both these angles by cross-correlating 21cm and CMB signals. Using the Fisher matrix formalism, we give our forecasts for 21cm experiments, including SKA, HIRAX, and PUMA, and Planck like CMB experiment. We find that best constraints $\sigma_{\alpha_\mathrm{CMB}} \sim 4.4^\circ$ and $\sigma_{\alpha_\mathrm{21cm}} \sim 100^\circ$ are found using $C_\ell^{T_{21} B_\mathrm{CMB}}$ and $C_\ell^{T_{21} B_{21}}$ respectively. Since birefringence hasn't yet been detected in 21cm, we choose the fiducial value $\alpha_\mathrm{21cm}^\mathrm{fid}=0$ assuming the null hypothesis.</description>

      <title>VENUS: Strong-lensing model of MACS J1931.8-2635 -- revealing the farthest multiply imaged supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a parametric strong-lensing model for the galaxy cluster MACS J1931.8-2635 ($z_l = 0.35$), accompanying the detection of the spectroscopically confirmed SN Eos at $z = 5.13$ (Coulter et al. 2026). We identify 10 new multiple-image systems in recent VENUS JWST/NIRCam imaging, so that the model is constrained with a total of 19 robust multiple-image systems -- nine of which also have a spectroscopic redshift. For the point-like source corresponding to SN Eos, our model predicts a total of five images, with the observed radial image pair having a similar magnification of $\mu \simeq 25 - 30$ and a small time delay of $&lt; 5$ days, in agreement with their simultaneous observation. According to the model, the other three predicted images arrived earlier, with time delays of $3.7 \pm 0.7$, $3.5 \pm 0.7$ and $54.0 \pm 10.8$ years prior to the two observed images, and with magnifications of $12.9 \pm 2.6$, $13.0 \pm 2.9$ and $2.2 \pm 0.4$, respectively. The absence of detections at the predicted positions, where the host galaxy's images are also visible, confirms the transient nature of the source. SN Eos and its host galaxy are studied in separate articles, and we here focus on the lens model. The final model reaches a very good $r.m.s.$ distance between model and observations of $0.44''$. We present the lens-modeling results, including newly identified systems such as a triply imaged, grand-design spiral galaxy candidate at $z \simeq 3.65_{-0.09}^{+0.04}$, and briefly discuss the potential of using high-redshift lensed SNe for cosmography.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from supercooled phase transitions and pulsar timing array signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent detection of a gravitational wave background in the nano-Hertz frequency range by Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) collaborations, including NANOGrav, EPTA, and PPTA, has opened a new avenue for exploring fundamental physics in the early universe. In this work, we analyze a supercooled first-order phase transition in a hidden sector with a spontaneously broken $U(1)_X$ gauge symmetry as a source for this signal. We demonstrate that the thermal history of the hidden and visible sectors plays a crucial role in the gravitational wave power spectrum analysis. Our analysis shows that supercooled phase transitions can generate gravitational waves strong enough to explain the PTA observations while satisfying cosmological constraints from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis.</description>

      <title>Quintessence with tachyonic resonance and late-time cosmic-microwave-background and gravitational-wave signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combinations of recent cosmological observations, including Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), show hints of a dynamical nature for dark energy. While the data suggest the possibility of the phantom crossing, it is worth thoroughly exploring quintessence models. Given that phenomenological parametrisations of the equation-of-state parameter $w(a)$ with a sharp transitional feature fit the data well, we study the realisation of such models in quintessence. In the late Universe, the quintessence field begins to oscillate abruptly, changing the behaviour of $w$. Naturally, such a model entails tachyonic instability, and particle production modifies $w$. We perform numerical lattice simulations to study the time dependence of $w$. In addition, the violent particle production produces significant density perturbations and the stochastic gravitational-wave background, whose characteristic scale depends on the mass scale of the quintessence around the minimum of the potential. We discuss the observability of these late-time cosmological signals through cosmic microwave background, quasar astrometry, pulsar timing arrays, and other observational probes.</description>

      <title>Zel'dovich smearing approximation of the BAO feature for model-agnostic cosmological inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A model-agnostic description of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) feature in redshift space requires a number of ingredients. Physically, one must describe the impact of cosmological bulk flows which progressively and anisotropically smear out the feature over time. One must also model the effects of the scale dependence of tracer bias and the mode coupling between short and long scales. All of these can be incorporated using the Zel'dovich approximation alone, without reference to any particular cosmological model. On the technical front, one needs a robust, complete and cosmology-independent basis to describe the shape of the real space BAO feature in linear theory, which can then be propagated to the nonlinearly evolved, measured feature in redshift space. In this work, we describe how these ingredients -- which we have systematically constructed in recent work -- come together in an accurate framework capable of describing the BAO-scale pairwise measurements of state-of-the-art galaxy surveys. Using mock observations and $N$-body simulations, we show that our template-free framework can produce unbiased and precise cosmological constraints for samples with realistic levels of nonlinearity. This work represents one of the final steps in constructing a data-ready analysis framework for model-agnostic cosmological inference from the BAO feature.</description>

      <title>Multiscale feature integration network for inpainting of full-sky CMB $B$-modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foreground masking and incomplete sky coverage complicate CMB polarization analyses by inducing mode coupling and imperfect E/B separation, with particularly strong impact on searches for primordial $B$-modes. We present SkyReconNet-P, a convolutional neural network for inpainting CMB polarization maps that extends the SkyReconNet framework to jointly reconstruct the polarization $(Q,U)$ maps from partial-sky observations. The method combines regional processing with a hybrid design, utilizing standard convolution and dilated convolution to do a multiscale feature integration. We evaluate performance at both the map and power spectrum level using two masking scenarios: a generated random mask and the Planck 2018 common polarization inpainting mask. For both masking scenarios, SkyReconNet-P reproduces the large-scale morphology of the target maps. In power-spectrum space, we find that the reconstructed $E$-mode spectrum closely tracks the target at low multipoles, while small biases emerge at higher $\ell$. For $B$-mode, the raw reconstructed spectra exhibit a larger multipole-dependent bias, which we mitigate using a simulation-based linear calibration. We show that the calibrated $B$-mode spectrum preserve more information by comparing it with spectrum estimation using pseudo-$C_\ell$. Finally, we demonstrate cosmological parameter inference from calibrated reconstructed spectra by fitting $(r, A_{\rm lens})$ with a Gaussian bandpower likelihood, recovering posteriors consistent with injected parameters across three test ensembles down to $r \sim 10^{-3}$. These results support inpainting as a complementary route to cut-sky approaches when downstream pipelines can greatly benefit from statistically well-characterized, gap-filled polarization maps.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Cosmic Void Finding with Graph Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic voids contain higher-order cosmological information and are of interest for astroparticle physics. Finding genuine matter underdensities in sparse galaxy surveys is, however, an underconstrained problem. Traditional void finding algorithms produce deterministic void catalogs, neglecting the probabilistic nature of the problem. We present a method to sample from the stochastic mapping from galaxy catalogs to arbitrary void definitions. Our algorithm uses a deep graph neural network to evolve "test particles" according to a flow-matching objective. We demonstrate the method in a simplified example setting but outline steps to generalize it towards practically usable void finders. Trained on a deterministic teacher, the model performs well but has considerable stochasticity which we interpret as regularization. Cosmological information in the predicted void catalogs outperforms the teacher. On the one hand, our method can cheaply emulate existing void finders with apparently useful regularization. More importantly, it also allows us to find the Bayes-optimal mapping between observed galaxies and any void definition. This includes definitions operating at the level of simulated matter density and velocity fields.</description>

      <title>Exploring Non-minimal coupling using ultra-diffuse galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate whether a non-minimal coupling between dark matter and gravity can influence the internal dynamics of ultra-diffuse galaxies. Within this framework, the gravitational potential is modified by an additional term that captures the interaction between spacetime curvature and the dark matter with a coupling constant determined by a length scale $L$. Using spherical Jeans modeling, we analyze the kinematic data of three ultra-diffuse galaxies namely: NGC\;1052-DF2, NGC\;1052-DF4, and Dragonfly\;44, which span the observational extremes from dark matter deficient to dark matter dominated systems. For each galaxy we explore several dark matter halo profiles, two orbital anisotropy models, and both with and without Stellar-to-Halo Mass Relation scenarios, and we perform a Bayesian parameter inference. Our results show that across all the considered configurations, the constrained astrophysical parameters are consistent with standard ones from General Relativity. The posterior distributions of $L$ show no preference for non-zero values and result only in upper limits, suggesting that any non-minimal coupling contribution must be small and perturbative on this scales. Future high precision velocity measurements will be essential to determine whether non-minimal coupling effects can become observationally distinguishable in low-acceleration systems.</description>

      <title>The impact of the formation channel on gravitational-wave-galaxy cross-correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The angular, harmonic cross-correlation between gravitational wave (GW) events and galaxy catalogues contains rich information on the large-scale structure and the origin of compact binary mergers. In this work, we study how uncertainties in the binary formation channel affect the predicted cross-correlation signal for both current-generation and next-generation networks of detectors. We generate five mock GW catalogues for which we vary the progenitor-to-remnant mass-transfer function and the time-delay probability distribution between progenitor and remnant. We then cross-correlate these catalogues with galaxy samples modelled on the 2MASS Photometric Redshift catalogue (2MPZ) and the Gaia-unWISE quasar catalogue (Quaia). We find that the mass-transfer function has negligible effect on the cross-correlation signal, with differences remaining within redshift uncertainties. In contrast, the time-delay distribution dramatically affects the redshift distribution of the GW events and, with it, the cross-correlation signal, particularly for shallow galaxy catalogues. In particular, current-generation facilities can achieve significant detections only for the longest time delays when cross-correlated with 2MPZ, whilst all cross-correlations with the deeper Quaia catalogue are marginally detectable or consistent with zero. Our exploratory results thus demonstrate that forecasts on cosmological or astrophysical parameters derived from GW-galaxy cross-correlations are, as expected, strongly sensitive to the assumed binary formation history.</description>

      <title>Multiwavelength Characterization of a Dynamically Relaxed Cool Core Galaxy Cluster at $z=1.5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present imaging and spectroscopic analyses of Chandra and XMM-Newton observations of ACT-CL J0123.5$-$0428, one of the most massive, highest redshift galaxy clusters detected within the survey fields of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope. The Chandra data are sufficient to characterize the morphology of this cluster and constrain the geometrically deprojected temperature in 2 spatial bins out to $r_{2500}$, revealing a dynamically relaxed system whose temperature drops to $kT = 1.8\pm0.6$ keV in the inner $\sim40$kpc. Within this same inner radius, the surface brightness and density of the ICM is sharply peaked, and the cooling time falls to $t_\mathrm{cool}=280^{+150}_{-120}$ Myr. A novel forward-modeling analysis of the XMM data extends imaging and spectroscopic measurements of this system out to $r_{500}$, constraining the redshift to $z=1.50\pm0.03$, with a mean temperature of $kT = 7.3\pm1.1$ keV and an emission-weighted mean metallicity of $Z/Z_\odot = 0.43^{+0.46}_{-0.25}$. We also utilize the limited optical/IR photometric coverage of the cluster to characterize the properties of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), which is coincident with the X-ray peak. Despite the high redshift and strong cool core, the BCG exhibits no signs of recent or ongoing star formation, suggesting AGN feedback has been acting persistently to stem star formation since $z\sim 2.5$. These measurements identify ACT-CL J0123.5$-$0428 as the highest redshift, dynamically relaxed, cool core galaxy cluster discovered to date, making it a premier target for future astrophysical and cosmological studies.</description>

      <title>Improved frequency hierarchy treatment for anisotropic spectral distortions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectral distortion anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) provide a new probe of the early Universe that can be accessed using traditional CMB imaging techniques. It is possible to compute the creation and evolution of anisotropic signals for various scenarios using the frequency hierarchy method recently developed for CosmoTherm. However, the current treatment is not perfect and some approximations had to be made. Here, we carefully construct a modified form for the evolution equations that has the full equilibrium solutions built into the formulation. We improve the formalism to account for i) additional stimulated scattering effects, ii) kinematic corrections to the thermalization terms, iii) corrections to the standard perturbation variables and iv) direct photon sources. These effect could not be captured with the original formulation of the frequency hierarchy method but are indeed important for cleanly separating real distortions from temperature signals. However, we show that previous results are not altered significantly when compared to the improved formulation presented here. As a new worked example, which could indeed not be treated before, we also illustrate how possible changes in the temperature-redshift relation would create spectral distortion anisotropies in the pre-recombination era. The theoretical methods presented here are also an important step towards being able to consistently predict the CMB spectral distortion anisotropies in photon-dark photon and photon-axion conversion scenarios.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Echoes of the First Order Phase Transition in a Kination-Induced Big Bang</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) produced during first-order phase transitions (FOPTs) in the early universe provide a powerful probe of nonstandard cosmological histories. We study GW production from a FOPT ending a kination-dominated epoch in the Kination-Induced Big Bang scenario, in which a period of kination domination terminates through a phase transition that reheats the universe into radiation domination. A rolling scalar field drives the kination epoch. In the specific model we consider, its derivative coupling to a second scalar (tunneling field) dynamically traps the latter in a false vacuum, with the phase transition triggered as the kination field slows due to Hubble friction. We compute the resulting stochastic GW background from bubble nucleation and collisions, presenting analytic estimates and numerical results for the peak amplitude and frequency. In all cases we find an upper bound $\Omega_{\rm GW} h^2\lesssim 2\times10^{-7}$ from the bubble percolation condition. In the case where the false vacuum energy dominates at the transition (yet the kination field drives the FOPT), we find $\Omega_{\rm GW}h^2\gtrsim 10^{-12}$. We further find that the Hubble scale during the phase transition across a broad set of model parameters is bounded by $\mathscr{O}(10^{-13})M^2/M_{\rm Pl}\lesssim H_* \lesssim \mathscr{O}(0.1)M^2/M_{\rm Pl}$, where $M$ is the mass-scale controlling the strength of the interaction between the kination and tunneling fields. The predicted signal spans frequencies from nHz to MHz, allowing the model to explain the signal reported by Pulsar Timing Array experiments and to be constrained or probed by interferometers such as LISA, Advanced LIGO, Cosmic Explorer, and BBO. Interestingly, a FOPT can occur even if the bare tunneling potential has a single minimum, as metastability is generated dynamically by the coupling between the tunneling and the kination field.</description>

      <title>Prospects of Indirect Detection of Dark Matter via Primordial Black Hole Induced Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs), produced in the early Universe, can source a stochastic background of induced gravitational waves (GWs) and provide a non-thermal origin for dark matter (DM). We investigate DM production in a PBH-dominated cosmological framework, including contributions from PBH evaporation, gravitational production, and thermal freeze-in and freeze-out mechanisms, and determine the regions consistent with the observed DM relic abundance. We find that thermal freeze-in can compensate for the underabundance of PBH-sourced DM, while indirect detection remains largely insensitive due to the feeble interaction strength, making future GW observatories such as LISA and the Einstein Telescope (ET) unique probes of this scenario. For freeze-out DM, indirect detection experiments constrain regions with relatively large annihilation cross-sections, whereas GW observations probe complementary regions with heavier DM masses and smaller interaction strengths. Consequently, the same DM parameter space cannot be simultaneously probed by both indirect detection searches and GW missions. These results establish GW observations as a powerful and independent probe of DM production in PBH-dominated cosmologies, opening a new observational window into DM properties and the thermal history of the pre-BBN Universe.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Linear Perturbations under Time-Dependent Hubble Friction I: SR-USR-SR Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the linear perturbation (including the comoving curvature perturbation and field perturbation) dynamics in the SR-USR-SR inflation with instantaneous transitions. Using the junction method and asymptotic expansions of Hankel functions, we derive accurate asymptotic expressions for the time evolution of mode functions and the resulting power spectrum, based on three systematic rules for identifying the dominant terms across transitions. Our results reveal that a finite dip of the final power spectrum arises from the cancellation between two growing modes within the linear perturbation theory, rather than between constant and growing terms as previously suggested. We also provide analytical descriptions of the amplitude enhancement and oscillatory features in the linear power spectrum, in agreement with numerical computations. These simple, tractable formulas not only facilitate theoretical calculations but also yield testable predictions for future CMB observations.</description>

      <title>Holographic Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.13393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cold dark matter may be a fluid (or plasma) residing in a strongly-interacting hidden sector, rather than a population of weakly-coupled particles. Such a scenario admits a holographic description in terms of a cosmological braneworld embedded in the linear dilaton five-dimensional (5D) spacetime. In this framework, dark matter originates from the linear dilaton bulk black hole, whose phase we show to be thermodynamically favored at all temperatures. We present a natural freeze-in mechanism for the production of holographic dark matter, in which the bulk black hole is fed by energy leaking from the brane after inflation. Our model is characterized by two free parameters, one of which, the position of the black hole horizon, is fixed by the observed dark matter abundance. The remaining parameter, the 5D Planck scale $M_5$, is consistent with all current experimental bounds provided that $M_5\gtrsim 3\times 10^5$ TeV.</description>

      <title>Harmonic Analysis on Correlation for Gravitational-Wave Backgrounds of Arbitrary Polarization from Interfering Sources in Generic Dispersion Relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hellings-Downs (HD) correlation serves as the fundamental benchmark for detecting the gravitational-wave background (GWB) in pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) within General Relativity (GR). However, this canonical signature relies on the idealization of a continuum of sources without interference. In realistic astrophysical scenarios dominated by supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), interference between discrete sources induces intrinsic deviations in the spatial correlation, which may mimic or obscure signatures of modified gravity. In this work, we derive the closed-form spatial correlation functions for a GWB with arbitrary polarization and generic GW dispersion relations, in the presence of source interference. Through a rigorous harmonic analysis, we demonstrate that source interference modifies the correlation shape but strictly preserves the lowest non-vanishing multipole moment characteristic of each polarization, specifically the quadrupole for tensor, dipole for vector, and monopole for scalar modes. The truncation at higher-order multipoles is governed by the interplay between pulsar distances and dispersion effects. Furthermore, we quantify the statistical degeneracy between interference-induced variation and modified gravity signatures. We conclude that access to only a single realization of the Universe imposes a fundamental theoretical limit on distinguishing modified gravity from GR using spatial correlations alone.</description>

      <title>J-PAS: Semi-Supervised Sim-to-Obs Transfer for Robust Star--Galaxy--Quasar Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern studies in astrophysics and cosmology increasingly rely on simulations and cross-survey analyses, yet differences in data generation, instrumentation, calibration, and unmodeled physics introduce distribution mismatches between datasets (``domain shift''). In machine-learning pipelines, this occurs when the joint distribution of inputs and labels differs between the training (source) and application (target) domains, causing source-trained models to underperform on the target. Transfer learning and domain adaptation provide principled ways to mitigate this effect. We study a concrete simulation-to-observation case: semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) to transfer a four-class spectral classifier -- high-redshift quasars, low-redshift quasars, galaxies, and stars -- from J-PAS mock catalogs based on DESI spectra to real J-PAS observations. Our pipeline pretrains on abundant labeled DESI$\rightarrow$J-PAS mocks and adapts to the target domain using a small labeled J-PAS subset. We benchmark SSDA against two baselines: a J-PAS--only supervised model trained with the same target-label budget, and a mocks-only model evaluated on held-out J-PAS data. On this held-out J-PAS data, SSDA achieves a macro-F1 score (balancing precision and recall) of $0.82$ and an overall true positive rate of $0.89$, compared to $0.79/0.85$ for the J-PAS--only baseline and $0.73/0.87$ for the mocks-only model. The gains are driven primarily by improved quasar classification, especially in the high-redshift subclass ($\mathrm{F1}=0.66$ vs.\ $0.55/0.37$), yielding better-calibrated candidate lists for spectroscopic targeting (e.g., WEAVE-QSO) and AGN searches. This study shows how modest target supervision enables robust, data-efficient simulation-to-observation transfer when simulations are plentiful but target labels are scarce.</description>

      <title>The initial states of high frequency gravitons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: After distinguishing the role of classical and quantum inhomogeneities in cosmological backgrounds, we constrain the initial states of the relic gravitons as soon as the different wavelengths of the spectrum cross the comoving Hubble radius, without any reference to earlier timescales. According to this pragmatic perspective the quantum states with finite energy density at the crossing time consistently affect the two-point functions and the related power spectra. An initial state different from the vacuum turns out to be marginally permitted in the low frequency range (associated with the largest observable wavelengths that crossed the comoving Hubble radius) while the intermediate and high frequency domains of the spectrum are populated by the gravitons produced from the vacuum. The non classical correlations are expected to dominate between the kHz and the THz since in this region gravitons are produced quantum mechanically with a negligible contribution from the initial state.</description>

      <title>A reassessment of LVE method and hemispherical power asymmetry in CMB temperature data from Planck PR4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15786v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We undertake a reassessment of one of the large angular scale anomalies observed in cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature signal referred to as Hemispherical Power Asymmetry (HPA). For the present analysis we use \texttt{SEVEM} cleaned CMB maps from \emph{Planck}'s 2020 final data release (public release 4/PR4). To probe HPA, we employed the local variance estimator (LVE) method with different disc radii ranging from $0.5^\circ$ to $90^\circ$. Our emphasis here is to revalidate the LVE method in various ways for its optimal usage and probe the hemispherical power asymmetry in the form of a dipole modulation field underlying CMB sky. By and large, our results are in agreement with earlier reported ones with more detailed presentation of explicit and not-so-explicit assumptions involved in the estimation process. It is reaffirmed that HPA is confined to low multipoles or large angular scales of the CMB sky. A dipole like anisotropy was found in the LVE maps with anomalous power for disc radii of $2^\circ$ and upward up to $36^\circ$ at $\gtrsim2\sigma$ level. In the range $4^\circ$ to $10^\circ$ none of the 600 \sevem\ CMB simulations were found to have a dipole amplitude higher than the data when using LVE method as originally proposed. The above reported values fall in the reliability range of LVE method after this extensive re-evaluation. We also observe a scale dependence of the HPA dipole amplitude and model it as a power-law. We conclude that the hemispherical power asymmetry still remains as a challenge to the standard model.</description>

      <title>Cool-Core Destruction in Merging Clusters with AGN Feedback and Radiative Cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of cool-core (CC) and non-cool-core (NCC) dichotomy of galaxy clusters remains uncertain. Previous simulations have found that cluster mergers are effective in destroying CCs but fail to prevent overcooling in cluster cores when radiative cooling is included. Feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) is a promising mechanism for balancing cooling in CCs; however, the role of AGN feedback in CC/NCC transitions remains elusive. In this work, we perform three-dimensional binary cluster merger simulations incorporating AGN feedback and radiative cooling, aiming to investigate the heating effects from mergers and AGN feedback on CC destruction. We vary the mass ratio and impact parameter to examine the entropy evolution of different merger scenarios. We find that AGN feedback is essential in regulating the merging clusters, and that CC destruction depends on the merger parameters. Our results suggest three scenarios regarding CC/NCC transitions: (1) CCs are preserved in minor mergers or mergers that do not trigger sufficient heating, in which cases AGN feedback is crucial for preventing the cooling catastrophe; (2) CCs are transformed into NCCs by major mergers during the first core passage, and AGN feedback is subdominant; (3) in major mergers with a large impact parameter, mergers and AGN feedback operate in concert to destroy the CCs.</description>

      <title>Free Cosmic Density Bispectrum on Small Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17386v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behaviour of the free, cold-dark matter density fluctuation bispectrum in the limit of small scales. From an initially Gaussian random field, we draw phase-space positions of test particles which then propagate along Zel'dovich trajectories. Only initial momentum-momentum correlation are considered, making the formulas identical to the typical Zel'dovich approximation. A suitable expansion of the initial momentum auto-correlations of these particles leads to an asymptotic series whose lower-order power-law exponents we calculate. The dominant contribution has an exponent of $-11/2$. For triangle configurations with zero surface area, this exponent is even enhanced to $-9/2$. These power laws can only be revealed by a non-perturbative calculation with respect to the initial power spectrum. They are valid for a general class of initial power spectra with a cut-off function, required to enforce convergence of its moments. We then confirm our analytic results numerically. Finally, we use this asymptotic behaviour to investigate the shape dependence of the bispectrum in the small-scale limit, and to show how different shapes grow over cosmic time. These confirm the usual model of gravitational collapse within the Zel'dovich picture.</description>

Abstract: The superfluid dark matter model offers an elegant solution to reconcile discrepancies between the predictions of the cold dark matter paradigm and observations on galactic scales. In this scenario, dark matter is composed of ultralight bosons with self-interactions that can undergo a superfluid phase transition in galactic environments. In this review, we explore the theoretical foundations of dark matter superfluidity, detailing the conditions required for the formation and stability of superfluid cores of astrophysical size. We examine the phenomenological consequences for galactic dynamics, including the impact on galaxy mergers, the formation of vortices, the behavior near supermassive black holes, modifications to dynamical friction, and the emergence of long-range interactions. By synthesizing theoretical developments with observational constraints, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the current status and future prospects of dark matter superfluidity as a viable extension of the standard cosmological model.</description>

      <title>Forecast constraints on null tests of the $\Lambda$CDM model with SPHEREx</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we quantify the ability of the upcoming SPHEREx survey to constrain cosmological observables and test the internal consistency of the cosmological constant and cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model. Using Fisher matrix forecasting, we assess the expected precision on Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) observables, such as the angular diameter distance $D_\mathrm{A}(z)$ and the Hubble parameter $H(z)$. We further explore SPHEREx's potential to probe some of the fundamental assumptions of large-scale spatial homogeneity and isotropy, through model-independent reconstructions of several consistency tests of the $\Lambda$CDM model. In addition, we also examine the effect of the model dependence of the resulting Fisher and covariance matrices, using a neural network (NN) classification approach. We find that, while it is commonly assumed the covariance matrix depends weakly on the model, in fact the NN can very accurately ($\sim 98\%$) detect the underlying fiducial cosmological model based solely on the covariance matrix of the data, thus challenging this assumption. This model dependence, often neglected in standard analyses, can be naturally incorporated within simulation-based inference frameworks, which offer a flexible alternative for capturing such effects.</description>

Abstract: The dipole in the angular distribution of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) is attributed to the Doppler effect and our motion relative to the CMB rest frame. It is expected that observations of large-scale structures (LSSs) would also exhibit a related kinematic dipole. However, numerous studies of the LSS dipole have shown significant discrepancies with predictions based on the CMB. In this work, we investigate how considering the clustering dipole affects the LSSs distribution dipole using the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) Very Large Array (VLA) Sky Survey (NVSS) and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), and examine the nonlinear regime to calculate the correlation between the clustering and the kinematic dipole. Our results show up to $\lesssim28\%$ enhancement in the clustering dipole amplitude compared to previous studies, with increases of up to $\lesssim 22\%$ in $\Lambda$CDM and $\lesssim 28\%$ in modified gravity scenarios. Additionally, we explore a model in which the distribution of matter on LSS could be intrinsically anisotropic by a long-mode modulation. Using the remnant discrepancy between the observed and predicted dipole, we derive an upper limit for the amplitude of intrinsic dimensionless anisotropy $\lesssim 0.22$. Furthermore, we investigate these results within the framework of the $f(R)$ modified gravity model. We conclude that nonlinear clustering and local structure correlations partially alleviate the dipole tension within $\Lambda$CDM, yet, this anomaly remains a challenge. Two alternative models are in the direction of relaxing the tension. However, further investigation and more accurate data are needed to support a stronger argument.</description>

      <title>Star-forming galaxies in the cosmic web in the last 11 Gyr</title>

Abstract: We investigate how the star formation activity of galaxies depends on their position within the cosmic web using the SIMBA cosmological simulation from redshift $z=3$ to $z=0$. While previous studies found that galaxies closer to filaments tend to be more massive and quenched, it remained unclear whether these trends reflect intrinsic environmental effects or changes in the galaxy population mix. To address this, we focus exclusively on star-forming galaxies, robustly selected using both the specific star formation rate (sSFR) and gas depletion timescale criteria, in order to isolate the direct impact of the cosmic web on star-forming galaxies. We reconstruct the 3D cosmic web skeleton using DisPerSE and compute each galaxy's distance to its nearest filament. After removing mass dependencies, we examine deviations in star formation rate (SFR), sSFR, molecular and atomic gas depletion timescales, and gas fractions as a function of this distance. We find a clear and redshift-dependent modulation of star formation with filament proximity: at high redshift ($z \gtrsim 2$), galaxies closer to filaments show enhanced SFR and gas accretion, reflecting efficient filament-fed growth. At $z=0$, we observe a V-shaped trend in the sSFR and depletion timescales, with minima at intermediate distances ($\sim 0.25$ cMpc) and a surprising upturn very close to the filament cores, suggesting a resumed accretion in the densest environments. These effects are not driven by mergers and are primarily associated with satellite galaxies at low redshift. Our results demonstrate that large-scale cosmic web proximity modulates star formation in star-forming galaxies through a combination of gas supply regulation and environmental processing, with different mechanisms dominating across cosmic time.</description>

      <title>SymBoltz.jl: A symbolic-numeric, approximation-free, and differentiable linear Einstein-Boltzmann solver</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24740v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: SymBoltz is a new Julia package for solving the linear Einstein-Boltzmann equations in cosmology. It features a symbolic-numeric interface for specifying equations, is free of approximation switching schemes, and is compatible with automatic differentiation. Cosmological models are built from replaceable physical components in a way that scales well to extended models, or alternatively written as one compact system of equations. The modeler provides their equations, and SymBoltz solves them while reducing friction in the modeling process. Symbolic knowledge enables powerful automation of tasks, such as separating computational stages (e.g., background and perturbations), generating analytical and sparse Jacobian matrices, and interpolating arbitrary variables from the solution. Implicit solvers integrate the full stiff equations at all times without approximations, which greatly simplifies the code. Performance remains comparable to existing approximation-based codes due to efficient high-order implicit methods, fast generated code, optimal handling of the Jacobian, and sparse matrix methods. Automatic differentiation gives exact derivatives of any output with respect to any input, which is important for gradient-based Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling in large parameter spaces, Fisher forecasting, emulator training, and sensitivity analyses. The main features form a synergy that reinforces the design of the code. Output spectra agree with established codes up to 0.1% with standard precision levels. More work is needed to implement additional features and for fast reverse-mode automatic differentiation of scalar loss functions. SymBoltz is publicly available with single-command installation and extensive documentation. We welcome all contributions to the code from the community.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical uncertainties challenge 21-cm forecasts: A primordial black hole case study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The 21-cm signal is a powerful probe of the early Universe's thermal history and could provide a unique avenue for constraining exotic physics. Previous studies have forecasted stringent constraints on energy injections from exotic sources that heat, excite, and ionize the background gas and thereby modify the 21-cm signal. In this work, we quantify the substantial impact that astrophysical uncertainties have on the projected sensitivity to exotic energy injection. In particular, there are significant uncertainties in the minimum star-forming dark matter halo mass, the Lyman-$\alpha$ emission, and the X-ray emission, whose values characterize the fiducial astrophysical model when projecting bounds. As a case study, we investigate the energy injection of accreting primordial black holes of mass $\sim 1~M_\odot-10^3~M_\odot$, also taking into account uncertainties in the accretion model. We show that, depending on the chosen fiducial model and accretion uncertainties, the sensitivity of future 21-cm data could constrain the abundance of primordial black holes to be either slightly stronger, or significantly weaker, than current limits from the Cosmic Microwave Background.</description>

      <title>The DESI DR1 peculiar velocity survey: growth rate measurements from the galaxy power spectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The large-scale structure of the Universe and its evolution encapsulate a wealth of cosmological information. A powerful means of unlocking this knowledge lies in measuring the auto-power spectrum and/or the cross-power spectrum of the galaxy density and momentum fields, followed by the estimation of cosmological parameters based on these spectrum measurements. In this study, we generalize the cross-power spectrum model to accommodate scenarios where the density and momentum fields are derived from distinct galaxy surveys. The growth rate of the large-scale structures of the Universe, commonly represented as $f\sigma_8$, is extracted by jointly fitting the monopole and quadrupole moments of the auto-density power spectrum, the monopole of the auto-momentum power spectrum, and the dipole of the cross-power spectrum. Our estimators, theoretical models and parameter-fitting framework have been tested using mocks, confirming their robustness and accuracy in retrieving the fiducial growth rate from simulation. These techniques are then applied to analyze the power spectrum of the DESI Bright Galaxy Survey and Peculiar Velocity Survey, and the fit result of the growth rate is $f\sigma_8=0.440^{+0.080}_{-0.096}$ at effective redshift $z_{\rm eff}=0.07$. By synthesizing the fitting outcomes from correlation functions, maximum likelihood estimation and power spectrum, yields a consensus value of $f\sigma_8(z_{\rm eff}=0.07) = 0.450 ^{+0.055}_{-0.055}$, and correspondingly we obtain $\gamma=0.580^{+0.110}_{-0.110}$, $\Omega_\mathrm{m}=0.301^{+0.011}_{-0.011}$ and $\sigma_8=0.834^{+0.032}_{-0.032}$. The measured $f\sigma_8$ and $\gamma$ are consistent with the prediction of the $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter Model and General Relativity.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Great Attractor: The Local Group's streamline trajectory, cosmic velocity and dynamical fate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the Great Attractor using the Manticore-Local suite of digital twins of the nearby Universe. The Great Attractor concept has been proposed as an answer to three distinct questions: what sources the Local Group velocity in the cosmic microwave background frame, where present-day velocity streamlines converge, and where the Local Group is moving to. Addressing the original motivation of the Great Attractor -- explaining the Local Group cosmic velocity -- we find that mass within $155~h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$ accounts for only ${\sim}72\%$ of that velocity magnitude with ${\sim}38\,\deg$ directional offset. We show that even in the purely linear regime convergence within this volume is not guaranteed, particularly when also accounting for small-scale contributions to the observer velocity; no single structure, including the proposed Great Attractor, would be expected to dominate the velocity budget. Streamline convergence is smoothing-scale-dependent, transitioning from Virgo at small scales through the Hydra--Centaurus region at intermediate scales to Shapley at large scales; at intermediate smoothing the convergence point lies near Abell 3565 with an asymmetric basin of mass $\log( M / (h^{-1} \mathrm{M}_\odot)) = 16.4 \pm 0.1$ that excludes Norma. To address the third question, we evolve the Manticore-Local realisations to scale factor $a = 10$ in a new Beyond-Present-Time simulation suite and identify the asymptotic future location of the Local Group. We find that the dominant motion is towards Virgo, but even it contributes at most one third of the Local Group velocity. Our results demonstrate that the classical Great Attractor is not a dynamically dominant structure but an artefact of the instantaneous velocity field, and that no single attractor is likely to account for the Local Group motion in the cosmic rest frame.</description>

      <title>Constraining Quintessence Models with ISW-tSZ Cross-Correlations: A Comparative Analysis of Thawing, Tracker, and Scaling-Freezing Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present constraints on quintessence dark energy models using the observational detection of the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW)--thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) cross-correlation dataset. Our analysis compares three classes of quintessence dynamics: thawing, tracker, and scaling-freezing with the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Through a comprehensive likelihood analysis, we derive best-fit values and 68\% confidence intervals for key cosmological parameters, finding $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.322^{+0.027}_{-0.030}$ and $\sigma_8 = 0.735^{+0.045}_{-0.035}$ for $\Lambda$CDM, with deviations in alternative models consistent within $1\sigma$. For the thawing model, we consider an exponential potential with slope $\lambda = 0.736^{+0.270}_{-0.227}$, while for the tracker and scaling-freezing models, we use inverse axion-like and double exponential potentials, respectively. Observationally, the tracker model yields $n = 5.651^{+1.625}_{-1.604}$ and $f = 0.258^{+0.149}_{-0.096}$, and the scaling-freezing model gives $\lambda_1 = 0.405^{+0.293}_{-0.322}$ and $\lambda_2 = 23.226^{+7.975}_{-7.258}$. The dimensionless tSZ amplitude ($\widetilde{W}^{\rm SZ}$) and cosmic infrared background (CIB) parameters are tightly constrained across all models, providing additional insights into astrophysical foregrounds. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of ISW--tSZ cross-correlations as a probe of dark energy dynamics, with the Thawing quintessence model yielding the lowest $\chi^2_{\rm min}$ among the tested scenarios, and highlight the need for future high-precision measurements to distinguish between quintessence models and $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>The FLAMINGO Project: Exploring the X-ray--cosmic-shear cross-correlation as a probe of large-scale structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02484v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Baryonic feedback processes associated with galaxy formation directly influence the large-scale structure by redistributing gas. Recent measurements of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect and stacks of X-ray emission from optically selected galaxy clusters suggest that feedback from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) is more efficient at expelling gas from low-mass clusters than previously thought. The measurement of the cross-correlation between cosmic shear and diffuse X-ray emission provides a new probe of the distribution of gas in groups and clusters. We use the FLAMINGO cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations to examine the X-ray--cosmic-shear cross-correlation. The cross-correlation is most sensitive to the distribution of gas in haloes with masses $10^{14}\leq M_{200\mathrm{c}}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot}\leq10^{15}$. It is sensitive to the strength of feedback, but the effects of variations in cosmology and baryonic physics are largely degenerate. We compare the FLAMINGO predictions with the cross-correlation between cosmic shear from the Dark Energy Survey and ROSAT all-sky X-ray maps. We find that, if we neglect the X-ray emission from AGN that would remain unresolved by ROSAT, then the fiducial FLAMINGO model is in excellent agreement with the data, while models with stronger or weaker feedback are ruled out. However, if we account for unresolved AGN, either using the direct FLAMINGO predictions or by abundance matching to the observed (extrapolated) AGN luminosity function, then models with stronger feedback are preferred. We conclude that to exploit the potential of the X-ray--lensing cross-correlation, it will be necessary to resolve fainter AGN, and to use external constraints to break the degeneracy between baryonic feedback and cosmology.</description>

      <title>The local void model for the Hubble and BAO tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The inconsistency between the locally inferred Hubble constant and the value inferred from the cosmic microwave background assuming the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model has persisted, turning into an important problem. An emergent underlying trend is that this Hubble tension is driven by data confined to the very low-redshift Universe (typically $z &lt; 0.15$). Most intermediate-redshift measurements remain mutually consistent with $H_0^\mathrm{CMB}$, the $\Lambda$CDM expectation anchored by the CMB. This Perspective examines if a large local void can explain the Hubble tension and its appearance only at low $z$. For an observer residing within a large underdensity, such as the Milky Way inside the claimed KBC void, gravitationally induced outflows and redshift can inflate the locally inferred recession scale $cz'$ despite having $H_0 = H_0^\mathrm{CMB}$. We summarise evidence suggestive of a local underdensity from multi-wavelength galaxy number counts, discuss the dynamical requirements implied by the amplitude of inferred bulk flows, and connect the solution to the emerging low-redshift BAO distance anomaly ($\alpha_{\mathrm{iso}} &lt; 1$). Previously published semi-analytic void models anticipated the observed redshift dependence of BAO deviations and predict a rapid convergence to CMB-consistent expansion for $z \gtrsim 0.2$, aligning with reconstructions of $H_0(z)$ from BAO plus uncalibrated Type Ia supernovae. We conclude by looking to future tests, including improved mapping of the local density and velocity field, fits to galaxy distance catalogues at the field level, kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich constraints on coherent outflows, fast radio bursts, and the long-term prospect of redshift drift measurements as a direct probe of time-varying non-cosmological redshift contributions.</description>

      <title>Statistical isotropy of the universe and the look-elsewhere effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.10178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Jones et al. [arXiv:2310.12859] claimed strong evidence for the statistical anisotropy of the universe. The claim is based on a joint analysis of four different anomaly tests of the cosmic microwave background data, each of which is known to be anomalous, with a lower level of significance. They reported a combined $p$-value of about $3\times 10^{-8}$, which is more than a $5\sigma$ level of significance. We observe that statistical anisotropy is not even relevant for two of the four considered tests, which seems sufficient to invalidate the authors' claim. Furthermore, even if one reinterprets the claim as evidence against $\Lambda$CDM rather than statistical anisotropy, we argue that this result significantly suffers from the look-elsewhere effect. Assuming a set of independent (i.e., uncorrelated) tests, we show that if the four tests with the smallest $p$-values are cherry-picked from 10 independent tests, the $p$-value reported by Jones et al. corresponds to only $3\sigma$ significance. If there are 27 independent tests, the significance falls to $2\sigma$. These numbers, however, overstate our argument, since the four tests used by Jones et al. are slightly correlated. Determining the correlation of Jones et al.'s tests by comparing their joint $p$-value with the product of the four separate $p$-values, we find that about 16 or 50 tests are sufficient to reduce the significance of Jones et al.'s results to 3$\sigma$ or 2$\sigma$ significance, respectively. We also provide a list of anomaly tests discussed in the literature (and propose a few generalizations), suggesting that very plausibly 16 (or even 50) independent tests have been published, and possibly many more have been considered but not published. We conclude that the current data is consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM model and, in particular, with statistical isotropy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.09965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recent analysis of the false-vacuum decay in non-perturbative regimes is here extended in the presence of Einstein gravity, computing the corresponding effective potential and decay rate. We consider a $\lambda \phi^4$ scalar field theory and we observe that, in comparison to the usual perturbative decay rate, the higher the coupling $\lambda$, the greater the decay probability. We evaluate the running of the self-interaction coupling and obtain a weakly coupled theory at lower energies, proving that Einstein gravity grants an even more reliable weak coupling approximation with the universe cooling down. We also provide an extended study of a non-minimal coupling $\xi$ of the scalar field with gravity showing how this term makes the false-vacuum decay more difficult. Minima can also disappear at large coupling $\xi$. We discuss possible applications of these results to cosmological phase transitions, gravitational-wave astronomy, and condensed matter systems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21509v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We summarise the physics of first-order phase transitions in the early universe, and the possible ways in which they might come about. We then focus on gravitational waves, emphasising general qualitative features of stochastic backgrounds produced by early universe phase transitions and the cosmology of their present-day appearance. Finally, we conclude by discussing some of the ways in which a stochastic background might be detected.</description>

      <title>Non-minimally coupled scalar field dark sector of the universe: in-depth (Einstein frame) case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07456v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, motivated by recent results from DESI DR2 suggesting the existence of evolving/interacting dark energy, we analyze spatially flat FLRW interacting scalar-tensor cosmological models with non-minimal coupling (NMC) between the scalar field (SF) and matter/cosmological dust in the Einstein conformal frame. By using modified expansion normalized variables that account for negative values of the scalar field potential, we derive cosmological dynamical system equations and expressions for physical variables. Five specific scalar field models (axions/ALPs, cyclic ekpyrotic, exponential with a constant, quintessence, and SFDM) are examined in depth to determine how they evolve, as they are thought to represent evolving dark energy in the late Universe. Using appropriate mathematical methods (e.g. linear stability, center manifold and Poincar\'e sphere), we present critical points along with their character and physical interpretation with respect to the possible evolution of the Universe. Considering both positive and negative values of the coupling parameter allows us to examine the transfer of energy from the scalar sector to dust and from matter to the scalar field. Considering four different values of this parameter provides a comprehensive analysis that incorporates all significant types of dynamical system evolution (from mathematical and physical perspectives). The initial conditions for the in-depth numerical analysis were calculated analytically from Planck 2018 and DESI DR2 CPL parametrizations.</description>

      <title>About electroweak domain walls in Majoron models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02910v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Some time ago it was claimed in "Spontaneous Breaking of Lepton Number and Cosmological Domain Wall Problem" (Phys. Rev. Lett. 122, 151301 (2019)) that non perturbative instantons of the weak interaction $\text{SU}(2)_\text{W}$ lead to the formation of domain walls in Majoron models owing to the anomaly of the spontaneously broken global lepton number $L$ symmetry $\text{U}(1)_L$ with respect to $\text{SU}(2)_\text{W}$. We point out that it has long been known, that this effect can be completely rotated away unless there is a source of explicit $B+L$ breaking present, where $B$ denotes baryon number. We further estimate the tiny instanton induced Majoron mass from $B+L$ breaking and analyze the cosmological impact of such domain walls including possible finite temperature effects. In general this scenario does not lead to a cosmological catastrophe and we demonstrate that the tiny instanton induced mass can act as a bias term to collapse walls induced by a larger source of lepton number breaking. Alternatively this electroweak Majoron could act as dynamical dark energy.</description>

      <title>Maximal parameter space of sterile neutrino dark matter with lepton asymmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We delineate the maximal parameter space of sterile neutrino dark matter in the presence of lepton flavor asymmetries. We focus on large flavor asymmetries with vanishing total lepton asymmetry, which are washed out by neutrino oscillations at MeV temperatures and hence are consistent with BBN and CMB constraints. We derive a semi-classical Boltzmann equation for sterile neutrinos applicable in this regime and validate it against quantum kinetic equations. For sterile neutrino masses up to 60 keV, the viable range of mixing angles extends by up to two orders of magnitude, with broad prospects for tests in forthcoming X-ray, CMB, and structure formation observations. We also release a public framework to compute the production of sterile neutrinos, and in particular their momentum distribution, enabling dedicated structure formation analyses.</description>

      <title>Affleck-Dine Leptoflavorgenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08175v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a scenario to produce large primordial lepton flavor asymmetries with vanishing total lepton asymmetry, based on the Affleck-Dine mechanism with Q-ball formation. This scenario can produce large lepton flavor asymmetries while automatically maintaining the vanishing total lepton number without fine-tuning, evading the current BBN and the CMB constraints by neutrino oscillations at MeV temperature. The asymmetries can be produced at cosmic temperatures of $T\gtrsim 1\ {\rm GeV}$, early enough to have broad impacts from the early Universe to the present cosmology. This scenario could affect various aspects of early Universe cosmology simultaneously or separately: (i) explaining the observed baryon asymmetry by the same origin as the lepton flavor asymmetries, (ii) affecting the nature of the QCD transition, (iii) opening up a new parameter space of sterile neutrino dark matter by enhancing their production, and (iv) altering the abundance of the light elements, in particular, resolving the recently reported helium-4 anomaly.</description>

      <title>Spectral Properties of Anomalous Microwave Emission in 144 Galactic Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anomalous Microwave Emission (AME) is a diffuse microwave component thought to arise from spinning dust grains, yet remains poorly understood. We analyze AME in 144 Galactic clouds by combining low-frequency maps from S-PASS (2.3 GHz), C-BASS (4.76 GHz), and QUIJOTE (10-20 GHz) with 21 ancillary maps. Using aperture photometry and parametric SED fitting via MCMC methods without informative priors, we measure AME emissivity, peak frequency, and spectral width. We achieve peak frequency constraints nearly three times tighter than previous work and identify 83 new AME sources. AME spectra are generally broader than predicted by spinning dust models for a single phase of the interstellar medium, suggesting either multiple spinning dust components along the line of sight or incomplete representation of the grain size distribution in current models. However, the narrowest observed widths match theoretical predictions, supporting the spinning dust hypothesis. The AME amplitude correlates most strongly with the thermal dust peak flux and radiance, showing $\sim30$% scatter and sublinear scaling, which suggests reduced AME efficiency in regions with brighter thermal dust emission. AME peak frequency increases with thermal dust temperature in a trend current theoretical models do not reproduce, indicating that spinning dust models must incorporate dust evolution and radiative transfer in a self-consistent framework where environmental parameters and grain properties are interdependent. PAH tracers correlate with AME emissivity, supporting a physical link to small dust grains. Finally, a log-Gaussian function provides a good empirical description of the AME spectrum across the sample, given current data quality and frequency coverage.</description>

      <title>Resonant Loop Interferometers for High-Frequency Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves at kilohertz and higher frequencies offer a unique probe of the early Universe at temperatures well beyond the reach of the cosmic microwave background, corresponding to energy scales $\gtrsim 10^9$GeV. Existing detector concepts fall many orders of magnitude short of the big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) bound on the stochastic background in this regime. We propose a new interferometric architecture based on closed optical loops, in which the gravitational-wave-induced phase shift accumulates coherently over many traversals. This produces sharp, narrowband resonances whose predictable comb structure provides a distinct experimental signature. For a folded loop with parameters compatible with the Einstein Telescope infrastructure, and finesse values of order 500, we project sensitivity that approaches and even surpasses the BBN bound up to tens of kilohertz after one year of integration. Such loop interferometers thus open a realistic and distinctive path toward exploring high-frequency stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Tracing Inflationary Imprints Through the Dark Ages: Implications for Early Stars and Galaxies Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore how inflationary features shape the early stages of cosmic structure formation. Using the transfer function formalism, we trace the evolution of primordial perturbations, showing how causal physics and oscillatory signatures from inflation influence the matter power spectrum. The variance of smoothed density fields is then applied to model the collapse of overdense regions and predict dark matter halo abundances through the Press-Schechter framework. Extending to the baryonic sector, we analyze primordial gas collapse in minihalos, emphasizing molecular hydrogen cooling and the thermochemical pathways leading to Population III star formation. Finally, we examine primordial black holes as potential seeds for early galaxies, connecting their accretion-driven growth to the stellar masses and disk properties of high-redshift systems. Our results indicate that oscillatory features from inflation can leave measurable imprints on halo abundances and early galaxy properties, providing a testable link between high-energy physics and astrophysical observations with JWST</description>

      <title>Ginnungagap -- a massively parallel cosmological initial conditions generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10353v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ginnungagap is a fully parallel (MPI+OpenMP) code designed to generate cosmological initial conditions for simulations involving very large numbers of particles. It operates in several modes, including the creation of initial conditions with either uniform or spatially varying resolution (for "zoom-in" simulations). The initial conditions can be fully random or derived by extending the resolution of existing ones while preserving the large-scale structures. Ginnungagap is open source and modular, consisting of a collection of independent tools that can be used for a variety of tasks. In this paper, we describe the main features of Ginnungagap and present test results for different types of simulations prepared with it.</description>

      <title>Multi-Resonant-Line Radiative Transfer: Lyman-Alpha Fine Structure and Deuterium Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20580v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Resonance lines encode rich information about astrophysical sources and their environments, yet fully analytic treatments of multi-line radiative transfer remain almost entirely unexplored. We present exact, closed-form solutions for steady-state resonant-line radiative transfer in "V-shaped" atomic networks, where a single ground state couples to multiple transitions. Starting from the full angle-dependent transfer equation, we generalize absorption and emission coefficients to an arbitrary number of lines, derive a modified Fokker-Planck expansion of the frequency-redistribution COLT Monte Carlo radiative transfer code and find excellent agreement with the analytic predictions across a wide range of line separations, optical depths, and damping parameters, establishing our solutions as stringent validation benchmarks. For concrete applications related to the Lyman-alpha transition of neutral hydrogen, we examine how fine-structure splitting and deuterium injection modify the emergent spectra, internal radiation field, and radiative force multiplier. We show that these effects leave previous conclusions about Lyman-alpha feedback in the early universe essentially unchanged. Even when direct observational diagnostics are subtle, our framework provides novel analytic and numerical insights into coupled resonance-line transport and facilitates progress in general modeling of multi-line radiative transfer in diverse astrophysical settings.</description>

      <title>Kinematic Anisotropies in PTA Observations: Analytical Toolkit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24055v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The reported evidence for an isotropic gravitational-wave background (GWB) from pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations has motivated searches for extrinsic and intrinsic anisotropies. Kinematic anisotropies may arise as a consequence of a boosted observer moving with respect to the frame in which the GWB appears isotropic. In this work, we present an analytical toolbox to describe the effects of kinematic anisotropies on the overlap reduction function. Our analytical results differ from previous findings at the quadrupole order and are detailed in three appendices. For the first time, we also derive the corresponding auto-correlation using two approaches, taking the pulsar distances to be infinite or finite, respectively. Our formulas can be used in forecasts or Bayesian analysis pipelines.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Simulation with Population III Stellar Feedback and Metal Enrichment I: Model Description And Convergence Test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new Pop III + Pop II subgrid framework implemented in the moving-mesh code {\sc arepo}, designed to study the impact of Pop III feedback on star formation in the early universe. The framework combines primordial non-equilibrium chemistry, metal-line cooling, IMF-sampled stellar evolution with SN feedback, and approximate Lyman-Werner (LW) and ionizing radiation transport. We run a suite of $1c{\rm Mpc}/h$ box simulations with different initial conditions and resolutions from $z=127$ to $z=10$. The highest gas mass and spatial resolution in the fiducial simulation reach $\sim10\,{\rm M_{\odot}}$ and $\sim4\,{\rm pc}$, respectively. The model successfully reproduces the UV-inferred Pop II star formation rate density (SFRD) from recent JWST observations across all initial conditions, with only minor variation driven by local halo interactions and LW irradiation. We find that the volume filling factor of metal-enriched gas converges to $\sim1\%$ at $z=10$. Convergence is achieved once subhalos with $M_{\rm subhalo}\gtrsim 10^{6.5}\,{\rm M_{\odot}}$ are resolved, and the total stellar mass at $z=10$ is largely insensitive to initial conditions or the resolution considered in this work. A fiducial simulation requires $\sim 10^4$ CPU hours, making the framework computationally tractable for larger box simulations and enabling future large parameter studies of stellar physics or environment effects such as Pop III IMF variations, X-ray radiation, or the streaming velocity at high redshift.</description>
