      <title>Rethinking Pipe Flow Stability: Insights from a Meshless Global Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite extensive experimental evidence of turbulence in Hagen Poiseuille flow, linear stability analysis has not yet confirmed its instability. One challenge is the singularity introduced by the term 1/r in the center of the pipe, which complicates traditional stability approaches. In this study, we explore a global stability analysis using a meshless framework. Although this approach did not recover the expected unstable modes, it revealed a new set of modes with distinct characteristics from those observed in local stability analysis. We analyze these modes and their impact on transient energy growth, demonstrating the effectiveness of the global approach in capturing localized instabilities without requiring multiple simulations.</description>

      <title>Simulating Turbulent Wakes without the Upstream Body</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a simplified framework for simulating three-dimensional turbulent wakes without the upstream body that generates them. Instead of resolving the geometry, the incompressible Navier Stokes equations are solved in a rectangular domain on which the inflow boundary condition is prescribed as either phase-averaged or time-averaged velocity profiles obtained from experimental measurements and direct numerical simulations. Remarkably, prescribing the inflow at a single downstream location is sufficient to reconstruct the entire wake, including coherent vortex shedding, Reynolds-stress distributions, and spectral content, for the two Reynolds numbers we investigate here: Re=500 and 5,000. Comparisons with corresponding full-body DNS and experiments show good agreement in mean velocity fields and turbulence statistics. Our results demonstrate that the essential dynamics of bluff-body wakes are induced by the instability of the near-wake profile, and do not require the explicit presence of the bluff body. This body-free simulation paradigm enables physically interpretable wake reconstruction from mean profiles that can be easily obtained from measurements or simple 2D simulations. Our approach reduces the computational cost of DNS by an order of magnitude, hence offering a new route for reduced-complexity modeling and control of turbulent separated flows.</description>

      <title>Exploratory Study of Chaotic Behavior in Walking Droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction of 'walking droplets' and capillary waves in a weakly subcritical Faraday wave experiment has been studied as a hydrodynamic analog to Bohmian quantum mechanics (see "Hydrodynamic Quantum Analogs", J. Bush and A. Oza, Rep. Prog. Physics (2021)). We report here experimental results of walking droplets interacting with supercritical Faraday waves with dimensionless acceleration of approximately 8.4, where the onset of Faraday instability occurs at dimensionless acceleration 6.3, in flat bath topography. Our working fluid is silicone oil with a kinematic viscosity of 20 cst that is placed as a 4.2 mm horizontal liquid layer in an intermediate-aspect-ratio circular bath with a radius to Faraday wavelength ratio of 5.8. We also use different 3D-printed subsurfaces that act as slit structures with local oil depth of 0.7 mm. We confirm expected behavior for walking droplets in the supercritical Faraday regime, such as erratic trajectories, droplets clustering together due to capillary effects, and spontaneous drop creation. We note a special case of walking-droplet behavior when the bath only partially displays Faraday waves. We discuss the influence of the lateral boundaries and slits on droplet trajectory in this chaotic regime and compare the measured trajectories found here to those single and double slit experiments previously studied in the subcritical Faraday regime.</description>

      <title>Shear-layer effects on the dynamics of unsteady premixed laminar counterflow flames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The influence of flow non-uniformity and unsteadiness on premixed flames is of considerable interest due to its direct relevance to practical combustion systems. The steady counterflow flame has long served as a canonical configuration for investigating flame dynamics under controlled, spatially non-uniform conditions. A commonly studied variation, referred to as the unsteady counterflow, introduces a controlled temporal perturbation to the otherwise steady flow from the nozzles, thereby enabling the systematic examination of the coupled effects of unsteadiness and non-uniformity. Prior investigations have focused on flame dynamics along the line of symmetry, where the reduced dimensionality of the problem facilitates analysis. In the present study, we extend this perspective by experimentally examining flame behavior at off-center locations, where multi-dimensional effects of non-uniformity and unsteadiness are more pronounced. Results reveal markedly different dynamics away from the centerline, characterized by a dominant contribution from higher harmonic responses. Further analysis of the associated vortex dynamics in the shear layer demonstrates that the intensity of these vortical structures directly governs the strength of the observed higher harmonics, and thereby the altered flame behavior.</description>

      <title>Conditional neural field for spatial dimension reduction of turbulence data: a comparison study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate conditional neural fields (CNFs), mesh-agnostic, coordinate-based decoders conditioned on a low-dimensional latent, for spatial dimensionality reduction of turbulent flows. CNFs are benchmarked against Proper Orthogonal Decomposition and a convolutional autoencoder within a unified encoding-decoding framework and a common evaluation protocol that explicitly separates in-range (interpolative) from out-of-range (strict extrapolative) testing beyond the training horizon, with identical preprocessing, metrics, and fixed splits across all baselines. We examine three conditioning mechanisms: (i) activation-only modulation (often termed FiLM), (ii) low-rank weight and bias modulation (termed FP), and (iii) last-layer inner-product coupling, and introduce a novel domain-decomposed CNF that localizes complexities. Across representative turbulence datasets (WMLES channel inflow, DNS channel inflow, and wall pressure fluctuations over turbulent boundary layers), CNF-FP achieves the lowest training and in-range testing errors, while CNF-FiLM generalizes best for out-of-range scenarios once moderate latent capacity is available. Domain decomposition significantly improves out-of-range accuracy, especially for the more demanding datasets. The study provides a rigorous, physics-aware basis for selecting conditioning, capacity, and domain decomposition when using CNFs for turbulence compression and reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Sub-cavity Induced Passive Control of Confined Supersonic Cavity Flows Across Varying Freestream Mach Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The self-sustaining oscillations in cavity flows enhance fluid mixing and promote energy and momentum transport. However, the associated oscillation frequencies can amplify acoustic loading, potentially damaging surrounding structures. Hence, understanding cavity dynamics across geometries and freestream conditions and developing strategies to regulate these oscillations without compromising performance are essential. This study examines the influence of sub-cavities placed at the front and aft walls of a cavity confined by a top wall with a deflection angle of 2.29 degrees, under freestream Mach numbers 2 and 3. Large eddy simulations (LES) are performed using OpenFOAM, and unsteady pressure signals are analyzed through spectral methods. Results show that the aft-wall sub-cavity most effectively suppresses the dominant oscillation at Mach number 2, while the front-wall sub-cavity achieves greater suppression at Mach number 3. Density gradient (numerical Schlieren) and vorticity fields, normalized acoustic impedance, and global wavelet power reveal the mechanisms responsible for this attenuation. At Mach number 2, the aft-wall sub-cavity entrains mass and disrupts the convective feedback loop. At Mach number 3, the front-wall sub-cavity weakens the hydrodynamic-acoustic coupling near the leading edge, disrupting the compressibility-driven feedback. These configurations suppress dominant frequencies by 5.45 and 23.4 percent for Mach numbers 2 and 3, respectively. Cross-correlation between pressure probes and Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) further confirm the mechanisms behind the observed frequency suppression</description>

      <title>Model-Adaptive Simulation of Hierarchical Shallow Water Moment Equations in One Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shallow free surface flows are often characterized by both subdomains that require high modeling complexity and subdomains that can be sufficiently accurately modeled with low modeling complexity. Moreover, these subdomains may change in time as the water flows through the domain. This motivates the need for space and time adaptivity in the simulation of shallow free surface flows. In this paper, we develop the first adaptive simulations using the recently developed Shallow Water Moment Equations, which are an extension of the standard Shallow Water Equations that allow for vertically changing velocity profiles by including additional variables and equations. The model-specific modeling complexity of a shallow water moment model is determined by its order. The higher the order of the model, the more variables and equations are included in the model. Shallow water moment models are ideally suited for adaptivity because they are hierarchical such that low-order models and high-order models share the same structure. To enable adaptive simulations, we propose two approaches for the coupling of the varying-order shallow water moment equations at their boundary interfaces. The first approach dynamically updates padded state variables but cannot be written in conservative form, while the second approach uses fixed padded state variable values of zero and reduces to conservative form for conservative moment equations. The switching procedure between high-order models and low-order models is based on a new set of model error estimators, originating from a decomposition of the high-order models. Numerical results of the collision of a dam-break wave with a smooth wave yield accurate results, while achieving speedups up to 60 percent compared to a non-adaptive model with fixed modeling complexity.</description>

      <title>Confirming Wave Turbulence Predictions in Rotating Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Though highly impacting our lives, rotating turbulent flows are not well understood. These anisotropic three-dimensional disordered flows are governed by different nonlinear processes, each of which can be dominant in a different range of parameters. More than 20 years ago, Galtier used weak wave turbulence theory (WTT) to derive explicit predictions for the energy spectrum of rotating turbulence. The spectrum is an outcome of forward energy transfer by inertial waves, the linear modes of rotating fluid systems. This spectrum has not yet been observed in freely evolving flows. In this work, we show that the predicted WTT field does exist in steady rotating turbulence, alongside with the more energetic quasi two-dimensional turbulent field. By removing the 2D component from the steady state velocity field, we show that the remainder three-dimensional field consists of inertial waves and exactly obeys WTT predictions. Our analysis verifies the dependence of the energy spectrum on all four relevant parameters and provides limits, beyond which WTT predictions fail. These results provide a solid basis for new theoretical and experimental works focused on the coexistence of the quasi 2D field and the inertial waves field and on their interactions.</description>

      <title>Influence of surfactant kinetics on rapid interface creation via microjet impact on liquid pools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate the influence of surfactant adsorption kinetics on cavity dynamics during the rapid formation of interfaces. For this purpose, we use a submillimeter jet impacting onto a surfactant-laden liquid pool much larger than the jet dimensions. Cavity retraction and closure occur on a submillisecond timescale, posing a stringent test of the ability of surfactants to reduce surface tension dynamically. Our experiments reveal the difference between the effects of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), a surfactant with moderately fast adsorption kinetics, and Surfynol 465, a surfactant with ultrafast adsorption kinetics. For SDS, the collapse pathway is nearly indistinguishable from that of pure water, suggesting negligible dynamic surface tension reduction. In contrast, Surfynol allows the emergence of deeper cavities that persist longer in the liquid pool. The harmonic oscillator model accurately captures the cavity retraction in the deep seal regime. The fitted values of the damping ratios are consistent with the dynamic surface tensions.</description>

Abstract: We show that by embedding liquid-filled acoustofluidic cavities in a metamaterial, the quality factor of the cavity at selected acoustic resonance modes can be enhanced by 2 to 3 orders of magnitude relative to a comparable conventional cavity by matching the coarse-grained elastic moduli of the metamaterial to the acoustic properties of the liquid.</description>

      <title>Rush-to-equilibrium concept for minimizing reactive nitrogen emissions in ammonia combustion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ammonia (NH3) is a zero-carbon fuel that has been receiving increasing attention for power generation and even transportation. Compared to H2, NH3's volumetric energy density is higher, is not as explosive, and has well established transport and storage technologies. Yet, NH3 has poor flammability and flame stability characteristics and more reactive nitrogen (RN: NOx, N2O) emissions than hydrocarbon fuels, at least with traditional combustion processes. Partially cracking NH3 (into a NH3-H2-N2 mixture, AHN) addresses its flammability and stability issues. RN emissions remain a challenge, and mechanisms of their emissions are fundamentally different in NH3 and hydrocarbon combustion. While rich-quench-lean NH3 combustion strategies have shown promise, the largest contributions to RN emissions are the unrelaxed emissions in the fuel-rich stage due to overshoot of thermodynamic equilibrium within the reaction zone of premixed flames coupled with finite residence times available for relaxation to equilibrium. This work introduces a rush-to-equilibrium concept for AHN combustion, which aims to reduce the unrelaxed RN emissions in finite residence times by accelerating the approach to equilibrium. In the concept, a flow particle is subjected to a decaying mixing rate as it transits the premixed flame. This mitigates the mixing effects that prevents the particle approach to equilibrium, and promotes the chemistry effects to push the particle toward equilibrium, all while considering finite residence times. Evaluated with a state-of-the-art combustion model at gas turbine conditions, the concept shows the potential to reduce RN emissions by an order of magnitude, and that works irrespective of cracking extent, pressure, temperature, etc. A brief discussion of possible practical implementation reveals reasonable geometric and flow parameters characteristic of modern gas turbine combustors.</description>

      <title>HybriNet-Hybrid Neural Network-based framework for Multi-Parametric Database Generation, Enhancement, and Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce HybriNet an innovative and robust framework capable of enhancing spatial resolution, generating fluid dynamics databases for specific flow parameters, and predicting their temporal evolution. The methodology is based on the development of a reduced-order model (ROM) by integrating high-order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) with machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. The ROM enables the generation of multi-parametric fluid dynamics databases concerning varying flow conditions, increases the spatial resolution, and predicts the behaviour of the fluid dynamics problem in terms of time. This helps to accelerate numerical simulations and generate new data efficiently. The performance of the proposed approach has been validated using a collection of 30 two-dimensional laminar flow simulations over a square cylinder at different Reynolds numbers and angles of attack. The databases reconstructed using the proposed methodology exhibited a relative root mean square error below 2% when compared to ground-truth high-resolution data, demonstrating the robustness, accuracy, and efficiency of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Wettability Alters Methane Migration and Leakage in Shallow Aquifers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Capillary heterogeneity is increasingly recognized as a first-order control on gas plume migration and trapping in aquifers and storage formations. We show that spatial variability in the water-methane contact angle, determined by mineralogy and salinity, alters capillary entry pressures and migration pathways. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we estimate contact angles on quartz and kaolinite under fresh and saline conditions and incorporate these results into continuum-scale multiphase flow simulations via a contact-angle-informed Leverett J function, mapping wettability directly onto continuum-scale flow properties. Accounting for contact angle heterogeneity affects methane behavior: mobile and residually trapped methane in aquifers decrease by up to 10 percent, while leakage to the atmosphere increases by as much as 20 percent. The magnitude of this effect depends on permeability contrast, leakage rate, salinity, and facies proportions. By coupling molecular-scale wettability to continuum-scale flow and transport, this cross-scale framework provides a physically grounded basis for groundwater protection and risk assessment and yields more reliable emissions estimates. The approach can be generalized to other subsurface gas transport problems, including hydrogen and carbon dioxide storage, as well as natural releases such as methane from permafrost thaw.</description>

      <title>An efficient implementation of the bidirectional buffer: towards laminar and turbulent open-boundary flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To effectively handle flows characterized by strong backflow and multiple open boundaries within particle-based frameworks, this study introduces three enhancements to improve the consistency, independence, and accuracy of the buffer-based open boundary condition in SPHinXsys. First, to improve the buffer consistency, the continuum hypothesis is introduced to prevent the excessive particle addition induced by strong backflow. Secondly, the independence of the bidirectional buffer is enhanced through region-constrained and independent labeling schemes, which effectively eliminate buffer interference and erroneous particle deletion in complex open-boundary flows. Thirdly, the original zeroth-order consistent pressure boundary condition is upgraded to first-order consistency by introducing a mirror boundary treatment for the correction matrix. The implementation is based on the rigorously validated weakly compressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics coupled with Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (WCSPH-RANS) method, and both laminar and turbulent flow simulations are performed. Four test cases, including straight and U-shaped channel flows, a plane jet, and the flow in a 3D self-rotational micro-mixer, are conducted to comprehensively validate the proposed improvements. Among these cases, the turbulent plane jet is successfully simulated at a moderate resolution within a very compact computational domain involving strong backflow, a condition that is usually challenging for mesh-based methods.

      <title>Confined floating active carpets generate coherent vortical flows that enhance transport</title>

Abstract: Slicks are thin viscous films that can be found at the air--water interface of water bodies such as lakes, rivers and oceans. These micro-layers are enriched in surfactants, organic matter, and microorganisms, and exhibit steep physical and chemical gradients across only tens to hundreds of micrometers. In such geometrically confined environments, the hydrodynamics and transport of nutrients, pollutants, and microorganisms are constrained, yet they collectively sustain key biogenic processes. It remains however largely unexplored how the hydrodynamic flows and transport are affected by the vertical extent of slicks relative to the size of microbial colonies. Here, we study this question by combining analytical and numerical approaches to model a microbial colony as an active carpet: a two-dimensional distribution of micro-swimmers exerting dipolar forces. We show that there exists a ratio between the carpet size and the confinement height that is optimal for the enhancement of particle transport toward the colony edges through advective flows that recirculate in 3D vortex-ring-like patterns with a characteristic length comparable to the confinement height. Our results demonstrate that finite, coherent vortex-ring-like structures can arise solely from the geometrical confinement ratio of slick thickness to microbial colony size. These findings shed light on the interplay between collective activity and out-of-equilibrium transport, and on how microbial communities form, spread, and persist in geometrically constrained environments such as surface slicks.</description>

      <title>Impacting spheres: from liquid drops to elastic beads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A liquid drop impacting a non-wetting rigid substrate laterally spreads, then retracts, and finally jumps off again. An elastic solid, by contrast, undergoes a slight deformation, contacts briefly, and bounces. The impact force on the substrate - crucial for engineering and natural processes - is classically described by Wagner's (liquids) and Hertz's (solids) theories. This work bridges these limits by considering a generic viscoelastic medium. Using direct numerical simulations, we study a viscoelastic sphere impacting a rigid, non-contacting surface and quantify how the elasticity number ($El$, dimensionless elastic modulus) and the Weissenberg number ($Wi$, dimensionless relaxation time) dictate the impact force. We recover the Newtonian liquid response as either $El \to 0$ or $Wi \to 0$, and obtain elastic-solid behavior in the limit $Wi \to \infty$ and $El \ne 0$. In this elastic-memory limit, three regimes emerge - capillary-dominated, Wagner scaling, and Hertz scaling - with a smooth transition from the Wagner to the Hertz regime. Sweeping $Wi$ from 0 to $\infty$ reveals a continuous shift from materials with no memory to materials with permanent memory of deformation, providing an alternate, controlled route from liquid drops to elastic beads. The study unifies liquid and solid impact processes and offers a general framework for the liquid-to-elastic transition relevant across systems and applications.</description>

      <title>Solute dispersion boosts the phoretic removal of colloids from dead-end pores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting and controlling the transport of colloids in porous media is essential for a broad range of applications, from drug delivery to contaminant remediation. Chemical gradients are ubiquitous in these environments, arising from reactions, precipitation/dissolution, or salinity contrasts, and can drive particle motion via diffusiophoresis. Yet our current understanding mostly comes from idealized settings with sharply imposed solute gradients, whereas in porous media, flow disorder enhances solute dispersion, and leads to diffuse solute fronts. This raises a central question: does front dispersion suppress diffusiophoretic migration of colloids in dead-end pores, rendering the effect negligible at larger scales? We address this question using an idealized one-dimensional dead-end geometry. We derive an analytical model for the spatiotemporal evolution of colloids subjected to slowly varying solute fronts and validate it with numerical simulations and microfluidic experiments. Counterintuitively, we find that diffuseness of solute front enhances removal from dead-end pores: although smoothing reduces instantaneous gradient magnitude, it extends the temporal extent of phoretic forcing, yielding a larger cumulative drift and higher clearance efficiency than sharp fronts. Our results highlight that solute dispersion does not weaken the phoretic migration of colloids from dead-end pores, pointing to the potential relevance of diffusiophoresis at larger scales, with implications for filtration, remediation, and targeted delivery in porous media.</description>

      <title>Flow-Induced Phase Separation for Active Brownian Particles in Four-Roll-Mill Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the collective dynamics of active Brownian particles (ABPs) subjected to a steady two-dimensional four-roll-mill flow using numerical simulations. By varying the packing fraction ($\phi$), we uncover a novel flow-induced phase separation (FIPS) that emerges beyond a critical density ($\phi \geq 0.6$). The mean-square displacement (MSD) exhibits an intermediate bump between ballistic and diffusive regimes, indicating transient trapping and flow-guided clustering. The effective diffusivity decreases quadratically with $\phi$, while the drift velocity remains nearly constant, demonstrating that large-scale transport is primarily dictated by the background flow. Number fluctuations show a crossover from normal to giant scaling, signaling the onset of long-range density inhomogeneities in the FIPS regime. Our findings provide new insights into the coupling between activity, crowding, and flow, offering a unified framework for understanding phase behavior in driven active matter systems.</description>

      <title>Navigation in a Three-Dimensional Urban Flow using Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly populating urban areas for delivery and surveillance purposes. In this work, we develop an optimal navigation strategy based on Deep Reinforcement Learning. The environment is represented by a three-dimensional high-fidelity simulation of an urban flow, characterized by turbulence and recirculation zones. The algorithm presented here is a flow-aware Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) combined with a Gated Transformer eXtra Large (GTrXL) architecture, giving the agent richer information about the turbulent flow field in which it navigates. The results are compared with a PPO+GTrXL without the secondary prediction tasks, a PPO combined with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) cells and a traditional navigation algorithm. The obtained results show a significant increase in the success rate (SR) and a lower crash rate (CR) compared to a PPO+LSTM, PPO+GTrXL and the classical Zermelo's navigation algorithm, paving the way to a completely reimagined UAV landscape in complex urban environments.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of laminar acoustic streaming jets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work identifies the physical mechanisms at play in the different flow regions along an Eckart acoustic streaming jet by means of numerical simulation based on a novel modeling of the driving acoustic force including attenuation effects. The flow is forced by an axisymmetric beam of progressive sound waves attenuating over a significant part of a closed cylindrical vessel where the jet is confined. We focus on the steady, axisymmetric and laminar regime. The jet typically displays a strong acceleration close to the source before reaching a peak velocity. At further distances from the transducer, the on-axis jet velocity smoothly decays before reaching the opposite wall. For each of these flow regions along the jet, we derive scaling laws for the on-axis velocity with the magnitude of the acoustic force and the diffraction of the driving acoustic beam. These laws highlight the different flow regimes along the jet and establish a clear picture of its spatial structure, able to inform the design of experimental or industrial setups involving Eckart streaming jets.</description>

      <title>To jump or not to jump: Adhesion and viscous dissipation dictate the detachment of coalescing wall-attached bubbles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05532v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bubble coalescence can promote bubble departure at much smaller sizes compared to buoyancy. This can critically enhance the efficiency of gas-evolving electrochemical processes, such as water electrolysis. In this study, we integrate high-speed imaging experiments and direct numerical simulations to dissect how and under which conditions bubble coalescence on surfaces leads to detachment. Our transparent electrode experiments provide new insights into contact line dynamics, demonstrating that the bubble neck generally does not contact the surface during coalescence. We reveal that whether coalescence leads to bubble departure or not is determined by the balance between surface energy, adhesion forces, and viscous dissipation. For the previously unexplored regime at low effective Ohnesorge number, a measure of viscosity that incorporates the effect of asymmetry between the coalescing bubbles, we identify a critical dimensionless adhesion energy threshold of $\approx$15% of the released surface energy, below which bubbles typically detach. We develop a global energy balance model that successfully predicts coalescence outcomes across diverse experimental conditions.</description>

      <title>An Investigation of Flow and Interface Dynamics Near a Moving Contact Line at Obtuse Contact Angles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The flow near a moving contact line is primarily governed by three key parameters: viscosity ratio, dynamic contact angle, and inertia. While the behavior of dynamic contact angles has been extensively studied in earlier experimental and theoretical works, quantitative characterization of flow configurations remains limited. The present study reports detailed measurements of flow fields, interface shapes, and interfacial speeds in the low to moderate Reynolds number ($Re$) regimes using particle image velocimetry (PIV) and high-resolution image analysis. The investigation is restricted to dynamic contact angles greater than $90^{\circ}$. In the low-$Re$ regime, excellent agreement is observed between measured streamfunction contours and the modified viscous theory of Huh \&amp; Scriven \cite{huh1971hydrodynamic} that accounts for a curved interface. Theoretical models such as the DRG formulation, using a single fitting parameter, accurately predict interface shapes even at finite $Re$. The interfacial speed away from the contact line compares favorably with theoretical predictions, whereas a pronounced deceleration is observed close to the contact line. Complementary Volume-of-Fluid (VoF) based numerical simulations were performed using identical geometric and material parameters to validate and extend the experimental observations. The simulations successfully reproduce the interface topology, flow structure, and the deceleration of the interfacial velocity near the contact line, providing strong support to the experimental findings. We argue that this rapid reduction in speed, observed both in experiments and simulations, is critical to the resolution of the long-standing moving contact line singularity.</description>

      <title>Energy transfer and budget analysis for transient process with phase-averaged reduced-order model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20204v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a phase-averaged representation of transient flows based on the eigenmodes of a data-driven linear operator that approximates the Navier-Stokes dynamics. In performing phase averaging, it is assumed that, at each instant during the transient evolution, the eigenmode amplitude remains invariant, while only the complex phase angle differs among distinct realizations of the transient process. From this modal-phase perspective, the linear operator is defined as the best-fit operator that represents phase-different transient evolutions. By introducing a time-varying dynamic mode decomposition with a phase-control strategy formulated from this modal-phase perspective, time-varying eigenmodes are extracted from numerical simulations. In this formulation, the transient process is decomposed into time-varying eigenmodes, phase-shift angles, and amplitude coefficients. Furthermore, by averaging the Navier-Stokes equations over the phase-shift angle, a frequency-domain form of the equations can be derived at any given instant, assuming that the phase-shift angle is time-independent. This frequency-domain representation reveals the instantaneous energy budget and the presence of energy transfer through triadic interactions. The proposed analysis is demonstrated using a canonical example of two-dimensional flow around a circular cylinder transitioning from a steady to an unsteady state. The time-varying dynamic mode decomposition with phase control is shown to capture the transient evolution of the frequency components accurately. In addition, the temporal evolution of the energy budget and transfer distribution reveals that transient growth processes exhibit different time-dependent characteristics of energy transfer, even in cylinder flows at Reynolds numbers that eventually lead to a periodic state.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21124v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present UniFoil, a large publicly available universal airfoil dataset based on Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations. It contains over 500,000 samples spanning a wide range of Reynolds and Mach numbers, capturing both transitional and fully turbulent flows across incompressible to compressible regimes. UniFoil is designed to support machine learning research in fluid dynamics, particularly for modeling complex aerodynamic phenomena. Most existing datasets are limited to incompressible, fully turbulent flows with smooth field characteristics, overlooking the critical physics of laminar\-turbulent transition and shock\-wave interactions\-features that exhibit strong nonlinearity and sharp gradients. UniFoil addresses this limitation by offering a broad spectrum of realistic flow conditions. Turbulent simulations utilize the Spalart\-Allmaras (SA) model, while transitional flows are modeled using an e^N\-based transition prediction method coupled with the SA model. The dataset includes a comprehensive geometry set comprising over 4,800 natural laminar flow (NLF) airfoils and 30,000 fully turbulent (FT) airfoils, covering a diverse range of airfoil designs relevant to aerospace, wind energy, and marine applications. This dataset is also valuable for scientific machine learning, enabling the development of data-driven models that more accurately capture the transport processes associated with laminar-turbulent transition. UniFoil is freely available under a permissive CC\-BY\-SA license.</description>

      <title>Scaling Laws for Caudal Fin Swimmers Incorporating Hydrodynamics, Kinematics, Morphology, and Scale Effects</title>

Abstract: Many species of fish, as well as biorobotic underwater vehicles, employ body caudal fin propulsion, in which a wave-like body motion culminates in high-amplitude caudal fin oscillations to generate thrust. This study uses high fidelity simulations of a mackerel-inspired caudal fin swimmer across a wide range of Reynolds and Strouhal numbers to analyze the relationship between swimming kinematics and hydrodynamic forces. Central to this work is the derivation and use of a model for the leading edge vortex on the caudal fin. This vortex dominates the thrust production from the fin and the LEV model forms the basis for the derivation of scaling laws grounded in flow physics. Scaling laws are derived for thrust, power, efficiency, cost-of-transport, and swimming speed, and are parameterized using data from high fidelity simulations. These laws are validated against published simulation and experimental data, revealing several new kinematic and morphometric parameters that critically influence hydrodynamic performance. The results provide a mechanistic framework for understanding thrust generation, optimizing swimming performance, and assessing the effects of scale and morphology in aquatic locomotion of both fish and biorobotic underwater vehicles.</description>

      <title>A framework for realisable data-driven active flow control using model predictive control applied to a simplified truck wake</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an efficient and realisable active flow control framework with few non-intrusive sensors. The method builds upon data-driven, reduced-order predictive models based on Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and efficient gradient-based Model Predictive Control (MPC). The model uses only surface-mounted pressure probes to infer the wake state, and is trained entirely offline on a dataset built with open-loop actuations, thus avoiding the complexities of online learning. Sparsification of the sensors needed for control from an initially large set is achieved using SHapley Additive exPlanations. A parsimonious set of sensors is then deployed in closed-loop control with MPC. The framework is tested in numerical simulations of a 2D truck model at Reynolds number 500, with pulsed-jet actuators placed in the rear of the truck to control the wake. The parsimonious LSTM-MPC achieved a drag reduction of 12.8%.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Scale Separation and Stochastic Closure for Data-Driven Prediction of Chaotic Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulating turbulent fluid flows is a computationally prohibitive task, as it requires the resolution of fine-scale structures and the capture of complex nonlinear interactions across multiple scales. This is particularly the case in direct numerical simulation (DNS) applied to real-world turbulent applications. Consequently, extensive research has focused on analysing turbulent flows from a data-driven perspective. However, due to the complex and chaotic nature of these systems, traditional models often become unstable as they accumulate errors through autoregression, severely degrading even short-term predictions. To overcome these limitations, we propose a purely stochastic approach that separately addresses the evolution of large-scale coherent structures and the closure of high-fidelity statistical data. To this end, the dynamics of the filtered data (i.e. coherent motion) are learnt using an autoregressive model. This combines a VAE and Transformer architecture. The VAE projection is probabilistic, ensuring consistency between the model's stochasticity and the flow's statistical properties. To recover high-fidelity velocity fields from the filtered latent space, Gaussian Process (GP) regression is employed. This strategy has been tested in the context of a Kolmogorov flow exhibiting chaotic behaviour analogous to real-world turbulence. We compare the performance of our model with state-of-the-art probabilistic baselines, including a VAE and a diffusion model. We demonstrate that our Gaussian process-based closure outperforms these baselines in capturing first and second moment statistics in this particular test bed, providing robust and adaptive confidence intervals.</description>
