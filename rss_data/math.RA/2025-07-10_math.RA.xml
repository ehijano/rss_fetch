      <title>On Union of Regular Near-rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 'A semigroup is completely regular if and only if it is a union of groups'- an analogue of this structure theorem of completely regular semigroup has been obtained in the setting of seminearrings in [[16], Mukherjee (Pal) et al., Semigroup Forum (2018)]. In it, a class of seminearrings (called generalized left completely regular seminearrings, abbreviated as GLCR) has been characterized as a union of near-rings. This work has been extended in the present article to characterize the seminearrings which are union of various types (regular, completely regular, inverse, Clifford) of regular near-rings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we prove that any Jordan derivation on the generalized matrix ring $T_n(R,M)$ is a derivation. This extends some well-known results of this branch due to Bre\v{s}ar et al. in the cited literature.</description>

      <title>Log-ozone groups and centers of polynomial Poisson algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In previous work, the authors introduced the ozone group of an associative algebra as the subgroup of automorphisms which fix the center pointwise. The authors studied PI skew polynomial algebras, using the ozone group to understand their centers and to characterize them among graded algebras.
  In this work, we introduce and study the log-ozone group of a Poisson algebra over a field of positive characteristic. The log-ozone group is then used to characterize polynomial Poisson algebras with skew symmetric structure. We prove that unimodular Poisson algebras with skew symmetric structure have Gorenstein centers. A related result is proved for graded polynomial Poisson algebras of dimension three.</description>

      <title>Simple polynomial equations over (mxm)-matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $m$ be any integer $\geq 3$. We consider the polynomial equation $$X^n + a_{n-1}\cdot X^{n-1} + \dots + a_1 \cdot X + a_0 \cdot I = O,$$ over $(m \times m)$-matrices $X$ with the real entries, where $I$ is the identity matrix, $O$ is the null matrix, $a_i \in \mathbb R$ for each $i$ and $n \geq 1$. We discuss its solution set $S$ supplied with the natural Euclidean topology. In particular, we describe the solution set $S$ for $m=3$ and calculate its dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel original procedure of encryption/decryption based on the polyadic algebraic structures and on signal processing methods is proposed. First, we use signals with integer amplitudes to send information. Then we use polyadic techniques to transfer the plaintext into series of special integers. The receiver restores the plaintext using special rules and systems of equations.</description>

      <title>Hypermagmas and Colored Operads: Heads, Phases, and Theta Roles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that head functions on syntactic objects extend the magma structure to a hypermagma, with the c-command relation compatible with the magma operation and the m-command relation with the hypermagma. We then show that the structure of head and complement and specifier, additional modifier positions, and the structure of phases in the Extended Projection can be formulated as a bud generating system of a colored operad, in a form similar to the structure of theta roles. We also show that, due to the special form of the colored operad generators, the filtering of freely generated syntactic objects by these coloring rules can be equivalently formulated as a filtering in the course of structure formation via a colored Merge, which can in turn be related to the hypermagma structure. The rules on movement by Internal Merge with respect to phases, the Extended Projection Principle, Empty Category Principle, and Phase Impenetrability Condition are all subsumed into the form of the colored operad generators. Movement compatibilities between the phase structure and the theta roles assignments can then be formulated in terms of the respective colored operads and a transduction of colored operads.</description>

      <title>Maximal subgroups of free projection- and idempotent-generated semigroups with applications to partition monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the maximal subgroups of a free projection-generated regular $*$-semigroup $PG(P)$ over a projection algebra $P$, and their relationship to the maximal subgroups of the free idempotent-generated semigroup $IG(E)$ over the corresponding biordered set $E = E(P)$. In the first part of the paper we obtain a number of general presentations by generators and defining relations, in each case reflecting salient combinatorial/topological properties of the groups. In the second part we apply these to explicitly compute the groups when $P = P(P_n)$ and $E = E(P_n)$ arise from the partition monoid $P_n$. Specifically, we show that the maximal subgroup of $PG(P(P_n))$ corresponding to a projection of rank $r\leq n-2$ is (isomorphic to) the symmetric group $S_r$. In $IG(E(P_n))$, the corresponding subgroup is the direct product $Z \times S_r$. The appearance of the infinite cyclic group $Z$ is explained by a connection to a certain twisted partition monoid $P_n^\Phi$, which has the same biordered set as $P_n$.</description>

      <title>Singular varieties and infinitesimal non-commutative Witt vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a projective variety $X$ over an algebraically closed field $k$, M. V. Nori introduced in 1976 a group scheme $\pi(X)$ which accounts for principal bundles $P\to X$ with finite structure, obtaining in this way an amplification the etale fundamental group. One drawback of this theory is that it is quite difficult to arrive at an explicit description of $\pi(X)$, whenever it does not vanish altogether. To wit, there are no known non-trivial examples in the literature where $\pi(X)$ is local, or local of some given height, etc. In this paper we obtain a description of $\pi(X)$ through amalgamated products of certain non-commutative local group schemes - we called them infinitesimal non-commutative Witt group schemes - in the case where $X$ is a non-normal variety obtained by pinching a simply connected one.</description>

      <title>Classifying integral Grothendieck rings up to rank 5 and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we define a Grothendieck ring as a fusion ring categorifiable into a fusion category over the complex field. An integral fusion ring is called Drinfeld if all its formal codegrees are integers dividing the global Frobenius--Perron dimension. Every integral Grothendieck ring is necessarily Drinfeld. Using the fact that the formal codegrees of integral Drinfeld rings form an Egyptian fraction summing to 1, we derive a finite list of possible global FPdims for small ranks. Applying Normaliz, we classify all fusion rings with these candidate FPdims, retaining only those admitting a Drinfeld structure. To exclude Drinfeld rings that are not Grothendieck rings, we analyze induction matrices to the Drinfeld center, classified via our new Normaliz feature. Further exclusions and constructions involve group-theoretical fusion categories and Schur multipliers.
  Our main result is a complete classification of integral Grothendieck rings up to rank 5, extended to rank 7 in odd-dimensional and noncommutative cases using Frobenius--Schur indicators and Galois theory. Moreover, we show that any noncommutative, odd-dimensional, integral Grothendieck ring of rank at most 22 is pointed of rank 21. We also classify all integral 1-Frobenius Drinfeld rings of rank 6, identify the first known non-Isaacs integral fusion category (which turns out to be group-theoretical), classify integral noncommutative Drinfeld rings of rank 8, and integral 1-Frobenius MNSD Drinfeld rings of rank 9. Finally, we determine the smallest-rank exotic simple integral fusion rings: rank 4 in general, rank 6 in the Drinfeld case, and rank 7 in the 1-Frobenius Drinfeld case.</description>

      <title>Additive subgroups of a module that are saturated with respect to a subset of the ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11575v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $T$ be a subset of a ring $A$, and let $M$ be an $A$-module. We study the additive subgroups $F$ of $M$ such that, for all $x \in M$, if $tx \in F$ for some $t \in T$, then $x \in F$. We call any such subset $F$ of $M$ a $T$-factroid of $M$, which is a kind of dual to the notion of a $T$-submodule of $M$. We connect the notion with the zero-divisors on $M$, various classes of primary and prime ideals of $A$, Euclidean domains, and the recent concepts of unit-additive commutative rings and of Egyptian fractions with respect to a multiplicative subset of a commutative ring. We also introduce a common generalization of local rings and unit-additive rings, called *sublocalizable* rings, and relate them to $T$-factroids.</description>
