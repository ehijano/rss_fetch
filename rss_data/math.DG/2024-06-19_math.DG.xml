Abstract: In this paper we discuss the geometry of homogeneous spaces witch are almost Hermitian submanifolds of flag manifolds. We prove that such spaces are necessarily minimal submanifolds and in the case where these submanifolds are also flag manifolds, they are totally geodesic.</description>

      <title>Weyl Law and convergence in the classical limit for min-max nonlocal minimal surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In \cite{CFS}, the author and collaborators construct infinitely many nonlocal $s$-minimal hypersurfaces (via min-max methods) on any closed $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold $M$, obtaining an analogue of Yau's conjecture for $s\in(0,1)$. The present article proves a Weyl Law for the fractional perimeters of these hypersurfaces, and it shows their convergence as $s\to 1$ (for $n=3$) to smooth classical minimal surfaces. Our results are used in particular to give a novel proof of the density and equidistribution of classical minimal surfaces for generic metrics in three dimensions, showcasing nonlocal minimal surfaces also as a new approximation theory for the area functional.</description>

      <title>Minimal reflection surfaces in $\mathbb S^3.$ Combinatorics of curvature lines and minimal surfaces based on fundamental pentagons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study compact minimal surfaces in the 3-sphere which are constructed by successive reflections from a minimal $n$-gon -- so-called minimal reflection surfaces. The minimal $n$-gon solves a free boundary problem in a fundamental piece of the respective reflection group. We investigate the combinatorics of the curvature lines of reflection surfaces, and construct new examples of minimal reflection surfaces based on pentagons. We end the paper by discussing the area of these minimal surfaces.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of $3$-manifolds with diagonal metrics as almost $\eta$-Ricci solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize the $3$-dimensional manifold $\mathbb R^3$ with a diagonal Riemannian metric as an almost $\eta$-Ricci soliton from the following points of view: under certain assumptions, we determine the potential vector field if $\eta$ is given; we get obstructions on the metric when the potential vector field has a particular expression; and we compute the defining functions of the soliton when both the potential vector field and the $1$-form are prescribed. Moreover, we find conditions for the manifold to be flat or Ricci-flat. Based on the theoretical results we provide many examples.</description>

      <title>Cheeger type inequalities associated with isocapacitary constants on graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Cheeger type constants via isocapacitary constants introduced by May'za to estimate first Dirichlet, Neumann and Steklov eigenvalues on a finite subgraph of a graph. Moreover, we estimate the bottom of the spectrum of the Laplace operator and the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator for an infinite subgraph. Estimates for higher-order Steklov eigenvalues on a finite or infinite subgraph are also proved.</description>

      <title>Minimal surfaces with low genus in lens spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a Riemannian $\mathbb{RP}^3$ with a bumpy metric or a metric of positive Ricci curvature, we show that there either exist four distinct minimal real projective planes, or exist one minimal real projective plane together with two distinct minimal $2$-spheres. Our proof is based on a variant multiplicity one theorem for the Simon-Smith min-max theory under certain equivariant settings. In particular, we show under the positive Ricci assumption that $\mathbb{RP}^3$ contains at least four distinct minimal real projective planes and four distinct minimal tori. Additionally, the number of minimal tori can be improved to five for a generic positive Ricci metric on $\mathbb{RP}^3$ by the degree method. Moreover, using the same strategy, we show that in the lens space $L(4m,2m\pm 1)$, $m\geq 1$, with a bumpy metric or a metric of positive Ricci curvature, there either exist $N(m)$ numbers of distinct minimal Klein bottles, or exist one minimal Klein bottle and three distinct minimal $2$-spheres, where $N(1)=4$, $N(m)=2$ for $m\geq 2$, and the first case happens under the positive Ricci assumption.</description>

      <title>K-contact manifolds with minimal closed Reeb orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the Boothby-Wang fibration to construct certain simply connected K-contact manifolds and we give sufficient and necessary conditions on when such K-contact manifolds are homeomorphic to the odd dimensional spheres. For the symplectic base manifold of the fibration which admits a Hamiltonian torus action, we show that the total space of the fibration admits other than the above K-contact structures whose closed Reeb orbits correspond exactly to the fixed points of the Hamiltonian circle action on the base manifold. Then we give a collection of examples of compact simply connected K-contact manifolds with minimal number of closed Reeb orbits which are not homeomorphic to the odd dimensional spheres, while having the real cohomology ring of the spheres. Finally, we give a family of examples of simply connected K-contact manifolds which have one more than the minimal number of closed Reeb orbits and which do not have the real cohomology ring of the spheres.</description>

      <title>Reflection Positivity and Chern-Simons Functional Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a mathematical version of the formal Chern-Simons functional integral of Witten for manifolds equipped with a reflection may be constructed in terms of a reflection positive functional, associated to the quadratic term in the Chern-Simons Lagrangian, on an algebra of functions on a Banach space ${\bf A}$ of connections on the underlying 3-manifold. This construction yields a Hilbert space associated to a surface preserved by the reflection. A version of the cubic Bosonic interaction term in the Chern-Simons Lagrangian gives a self-adjoint operator on this Hilbert space, and by exponentiation, a unitary one parameter subgroup of operators. The vacuum expectation value of this one parameter subgroup is combined with an additional term associated to the ghost fields and their interaction, and an appropriate weak limit gives a partition function for the quantum field theory. This construction is nonperturbative. The theory is finite and does not require renormalization, as may be expected from perturbation theory. It is natural to ask whether the resulting partition function is related to the manifold invariants of Witten and Reshetikhin-Turaev, or whether a more elaborate construction may be needed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study periodic tessellations of the Euclidean space with unequal cells arising from the minimization of perimeter functionals. Existence results and qualitative properties of minimizers are discussed for different classes of problems, involving local and non-local perimeters. Regularity is then addressed in the general case under volume penalization, and in the planar case with the standard perimeter, prescribing the volumes of each cell. Finally, we show the optimality of hexagonal tilings among partitions with almost equal areas.</description>

Abstract: The purpose of this article is study rigidity of free boundary minimal two-disks that locally maximize the modified Hawking mass on a Riemannian three-manifold with positive lower bound on its scalar curvature and mean convex boundary. Assuming the strict stability of {\Sigma}, we prove that a neighborhood of it in M is isometric to one of the half de Sitter-Schwarzschild space.</description>

      <title>Newton's method for nonlinear mappings into vector bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider Newton's method for finding zeros of mappings from a manifold $\mathcal{X}$ into a vector bundle $\mathcal{E}$. In this setting a connection on $\mathcal{E}$ is required to render the Newton equation well defined, and a retraction on $\mathcal{X}$ is needed to compute a Newton update. We discuss local convergence in terms of suitable differentiability concepts, using a Banach space variant of a Riemannian distance. We also carry over an affine covariant damping strategy to our setting. Finally, we will discuss some applications of our approach, namely, finding fixed points of vector fields, variational problems on manifolds and finding critical points of functionals.</description>

Abstract: Length bounded sweepouts give a way to bound the length of the shortest closed geodesic of a closed manifold. In this paper, we generalized to the case of compact 2-dimensional orbifolds homeomorphic to $S^2$ as well as compact 2-dimensional orbifolds with finite orbifold fundamental groups. We proved an inequality for the length of the shortest closed orbifold geodesic in terms of the diameter.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we show that symmetries, which are known in the theory of integrable systems, naturally appeared in the classical linear theory of deformations of thin shells. Our result shows that if the middle surface of a shell becomes `integrable', infinitely many deformations exist that have no shear strains and twisting of the coordinate lines.</description>

      <title>A new spin on Hurwitz theory and ELSV via theta characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.05697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.05697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study spin Hurwitz numbers, which count ramified covers of the Riemann sphere with a sign coming from a theta characteristic. These numbers are known to be related to Gromov-Witten theory of K\"ahler surfaces and to representation theory of the Sergeev group, and are generated by BKP tau-functions. We use the latter interpretation to give polynomiality properties of these numbers and we derive a spectral curve which we conjecture computes spin Hurwitz numbers via a new type of topological recursion. We prove that this conjectural topological recursion is equivalent to an ELSV-type formula, expressing spin Hurwitz numbers in terms of the Chiodo class twisted by the $2$-spin Witten class.</description>

      <title>From Volterra dislocations to strain-gradient plasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.02368v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We rigorously derive a strain-gradient model of plasticity as a $\Gamma$-limit of continuum bodies containing finitely-many edge-dislocations (in two dimensions). The key difference from previous such derivations is the elemental notion of a dislocation: we work in a continuum framework in which the lattice structure is represented by a smooth frame field, and the presence of a dislocation manifests in a circulation condition on that frame field; the resulting model is a Lagrangian approach with a multiplicative strain decomposition. The multiplicative nature of the geometric incompatibility generates many technical challenges, which require a systematic study of the geometry of bodies containing multiple dislocations, the definition of new notions of convergence, and the derivation of new geometric rigidity estimates pertinent to dislocated bodies. Our approach places the strain-gradient limit in a unified framework with other models of dislocations, which cannot be addressed within the "admissible strain" approach used in previous works.</description>
