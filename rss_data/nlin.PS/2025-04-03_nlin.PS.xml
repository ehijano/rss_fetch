      <title>Dynamics of ring solitons in an expanding cloud of a Bose-Einstein condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive equations for the dynamics of ring dark solitons in an expanding cloud of a two-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate. Assuming that the soliton's width is much smaller than its radius, we obtain the Hamilton equations for its evolution. Then they are transformed into the Newton equation, which is more convenient for applications. The general theory is illustrated by the solution of the Newton equation for the case of the axially symmetric condensate cloud, which expands after switching off a harmonic trap. The validity of our approximate analytical approach is confirmed by comparison with the results of numerical simulations of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic plugging of airways by sliding mucus films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When do mucus films plug lung airways? Using reduced-order simulations of a large ensemble of randomly perturbed films, we show that the answer is not determined by just the film's volume. While very thin films always stay open and very thick films always plug, we find a range of intermediate films for which plugging is uncertain. The fastest-growing linear mode of the Rayleigh-Plateau instability ensures that the film's volume is divided among multiple humps. However, the nonlinear growth of these humps can occur unevenly, due to spontaneous axial sliding -- a lucky hump can sweep up a disproportionate share of the film's volume and so form a plug. This sliding-induced plugging is robust and prevails with or without gravitational and ciliary transport.</description>

      <title>Triangular rogue clusters associated with multiple roots of Adler--Moser polynomials in integrable systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rogue patterns associated with multiple roots of Adler--Moser polynomials under general multiple large parameters are studied in integrable systems. It is first shown that the multiplicity of any multiple root in any Adler--Moser polynomial is a triangular number (i.e., its multiplicity is equal to $n(n+1)/2$ for a certain integer $n$). Then, it is shown that corresponding to a nonzero multiple root of the Adler--Moser polynomial, a triangular rogue cluster would appear on the spatial-temporal plane. This triangular rogue cluster comprises $n(n+1)/2$ fundamental rogue waves forming a triangular shape, and space-time locations of fundamental rogue waves in this triangle are a linear transformation of the Yablonskii--Vorob'ev polynomial $Q_{n}(z)$'s root structure. In the special case where this multiple root of the Adler--Moser polynomial is zero, the associated rogue pattern is found to be a $n$-th order rogue wave in the $O(1)$ neighborhood of the spatial-temporal origin. These general results are demonstrated on two integrable systems: the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation and the generalized derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. For these equations, asymptotic predictions of rogue patterns are compared with true rogue solutions and good agreement between them is illustrated.</description>
