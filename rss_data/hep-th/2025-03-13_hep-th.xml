      <title>Non-equilibrium charge-vortex duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditionally applied within equilibrium states, the charge-vortex dualities are expanded to address the complex dynamics of superfluids and ideal fluids under non-static conditions. We have constructed explicit mappings of finite temperature fluid dynamics to gauge theories, enabling a dual description where vortices in both superfluids and ideal fluids are interpreted as charges within these theories. We found that vortices in the normal component naturally exhibit mobility restrictions, as manifested by the symmetries and conservation laws. Next, we formulated the Li\'enard-Wiechert problem for the ideal fluid at finite temperature and extracted the wave dynamics in the system along with the speed of sound corrections for both fluid components. Finally, we computed the correlation functions for the gauge potentials, particularly elucidating explicit cross-correlations between the normal and superfluid components.</description>

      <title>Scalar Thermal Field Theory for a Rotating Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper it is initiated the systematic study of thermal field theory for generic equilibrium density matrices, which feature arbitrary values not only of temperature and chemical potentials, but also of average angular momentum. The focus here is on scalar fields, although some results also apply to fields with arbitrary spins. A general technique to compute ensemble averages is provided. Moreover, path-integral methods are developed to study thermal Green's functions (with an arbitrary number of points) in generic theories, which cover both the real-time and imaginary-time formalism. It is shown that, while the average angular momentum, like the chemical potentials, does not contribute positively to the Euclidean action, its negative contributions can be compensated by some other contributions that are instead positive, at least in some cases. As an application of the developed general formalism, it is shown that the production of particles weakly coupled to a rotating plasma can be significantly enhanced compared to the non-rotating case. These finding can be useful, for example, to investigate the physics of rotating stars, ordinary and primordial black holes and more exotic compact objects.</description>

      <title>On observers in holographic maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A straightforward gravitational path integral calculation implies that closed universes are trivial, described by a one dimensional Hilbert space. Two recent papers by Harlow-Usatyuk-Zhao and Abdalla-Antonini-Iliesiu-Levine have sought to ameliorate this issue by defining special rules to incorporate observers into the path integral. However, the proposed rules are different, leading to differing results for the Hilbert space dimension. Moreover, the former work offers a holographic map realized using a non-isometric code construction to complement their path integral result and clarify its physics. In this work, we propose a non-isometric code that implements the second construction, allowing thorough comparison. Our prescription may be thought of as simply removing the portion of the map that acts on the observer, while preserving the rest, creating an effective holographic boundary at the observer-environment interface. This proposal can be directly applied to general holographic maps for both open and closed universes of any dimension.</description>

      <title>Solving Superconformal Ward Identities in Mellin Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study four-point correlators in superconformal theories in various dimensions. We develop an efficient method to solve the superconformal Ward identities in Mellin space. For 4d $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM and the 6d $\mathcal{N}=(2,0)$ theory, our method reproduces the known solutions. As novel applications of this method, we also derive solutions in 3d $\mathcal{N} = 8$ ABJM, and in 4d $\mathcal{N} = 4$ SYM with line defects.</description>

      <title>Renormalising the Field-Space Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of one-loop quantum corrections in scalar effective field theories from a geometric viewpoint, emphasizing the role of field-space curvature and its renormalisation. By treating the scalar fields as coordinates on a Riemannian manifold, we exploit field redefinition invariance to maintain manifest coordinate independence of physical observables. Focusing on the non-linear sigma model (NLSM) and \(\phi^4\) theory, we demonstrate how loop corrections induce momentum- and scale-dependent shifts in the curvature of the field-space manifold. These corrections can be elegantly captured through the recently proposed geometry-kinematics duality, which generalizes the colour-kinematics duality in gauge theories to curved field-space backgrounds. Our results highlight a universal structure emerging in the contractions of Riemann tensors that contribute to renormalisation of the field-space curvature. In particular, we find explicit expressions and a universal structure for the running curvature and Ricci scalar in simple models, illustrating how quantum effects reshape the underlying geometry. This geometric formulation unifies a broad class of scalar EFTs, providing insight into the interplay of curvature, scattering amplitudes, and renormalisation.</description>

      <title>Restricting One-Loop radiative effects in quantum gravity: Demonstrating 4D GR as an EFT and its consistent unification with the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In "On Restricting to One-Loop Order the Radiative Effects in Quantum Gravity" (Brandt, Frenkel, and McKeon, 2020), a Lagrange multiplier (LM) field is introduced into the Einstein-Hilbert action, removing all multi-loop graviton diagrams and confining quantum-gravity corrections to just one loop. The resulting one-loop effective action carries a term proportional to $\ln(\mu/\Lambda)$, which they suggest could be experimentally determined, hinting at direct measurements of quantum-gravity effects. We show, however, that $\mu$ and $\Lambda$ emerge from a chosen \emph{renormalization scheme}, not from physical observables, implying that $\ln(\mu/\Lambda)$ signals a finite UV cutoff in this ``LM renormalization scheme.'' Although Newton's constant remains fixed (no running of $G_N$, the resulting logarithmic dependence encodes a limited domain of validity for General Relativity (GR) in four dimensions, thereby demonstrating explicitly that 4D GR behaves as an effective field theory (EFT) for energies below the cutoff. We then illustrate how this truncated, renormalized gravity sector can be consistently unified with the Standard Model (SM), yielding a finite and renormalized EFT encompassing both gravity and particle physics up to a scale $\Lambda_{\text{grav}}$.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Boltzmann equation for weakly coupled quantum fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the kinetic theory of a weakly interacting quantum field. Assuming a state that is close to homogeneous and stationary, we derive a closed kinetic equation for the rate of change of the occupation numbers, perturbatively in the coupling. For a dilute gas, this reproduces the quantum Boltzmann equation, which only accounts for two-to-two scattering processes. Our expression goes beyond this, with terms accounting for multi-particle scattering processes, which are higher order in the density.</description>

      <title>Integrability and Conformal Blocks for Surface Defects in $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study various aspects of half-BPS surface defect operators in $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM. For defects on generic points on the moduli space we use superconformal symmetry to fix the form of one-point and two-point functions of half-BPS operators and solve the superconformal Ward identities in terms of superconformal blocks, emphasizing the role of the broken rotational symmetry transverse of the defect in the superconformal block expansion. We verify this expansion by the leading-order perturbative calculation for the two-point functions. We also investigate the integrability of the defect CFT in the planar limit and argue that the integrability is broken at generic points of the defect moduli. The integrability is expected to be restored in the singular point of this moduli space where another "rigid" branch appears, and we provide evidence for this by showing that the defect one-point functions in this case can be mapped to a class of known integrable quenches.</description>

      <title>Higher Form and Higher Group Symmetries via Mirror Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we uncover a connection that relates the 1-form and the 2-group symmetries of 5D SCFTs derived from geometric engineering methods to monodromies of the corresponding B-models via mirror symmetry. Viewing defects as branes wrapping relative cycles in a non-compact CY3, we find that the defect groups can be read off from the VEVs of the corresponding line operators at the leading order. Via mirror map, we find that both the 1-form and the 2-group symmetries of the SCFT are related to the monodromy at the large radius point in the B-model. Additionally, we recursively obtain closed-form expressions of instanton expansions of the VEV of Wilson lines of certain 5D theories among which some have not been obtained so far using localization methods. We further conjecture that the 2-group symmetry is given by the Mordell-Weil torsion of the universal special geometry associated to the theory, generalizing the conjecture for rank-1 theories.</description>

      <title>$T\overline{T}$ Deformation: Introduction and Some Recent Advances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review explores recent advances in the theory of $T\bar{T}$ deformation, an irrelevant yet solvable deformation of quantum field theories defined via the quadratic form of the energy-momentum tensor. It addresses classical and quantum aspects, highlighting significant developments across various fields, including field theory, holography, and string theory. Classically, $T\bar{T}$ deformation manifests through multiple geometric interpretations, notably random geometry, Jackiw-Teitelboim-like gravity, and uniform light-cone gauge frameworks. For quantum aspects, the deformation introduces notable features such as non-locality, UV-IR mixing, solvable renormalization structures, and intriguing modifications to correlation functions and entanglement properties. Furthermore, the paper examines the profound relationship between $T\bar{T}$ deformation and holography, particularly within the mixed boundary conditions/cutoff AdS holography proposal and holographic entanglement entropy. Connections to string theory through single-trace deformations and their holographic duals further reveal the deformed structure of the worldsheet. This review synthesizes recent developments and outlines potential directions for future research in the study of $T\bar{T}$-like deformation.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions in a holographic s+d model from the 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the phase structure of a holographic s+d model with quartic potential terms from the 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity is studied in the probe limit. We first show the $q_d-\mu$ phase diagram with a very small value of the Gauss-Bonnet coefficient $\alpha=1\times10^{-7}$ and in absence of the quartic terms to locate the suitable choice of the value of $q_d$, where the system admits coexistent s+d solutions. Then we consider various values of the Gauss-Bonnet coefficient $\alpha$ and present the $\alpha-\mu$ phase diagram to show the influence of the Gauss-Bonnet term on the phase structure. We also give an example of the reentrant phase transition which is also realized in the holographic s+s and s+p models. After that we confirm the universality of the influence of the quartic term with coefficient $\lambda_d$ on the d-wave solutions, which is similar to the case of s-wave and p-wave solutions previously studied in the s+p model. Finally we give the dependence of the special values of the quartic term coefficient $\lambda_d$ on the Gauss-Bonnet coefficient $\alpha$, below which the d-wave condensate grows to an opposite direction at the (quasi-)critical point, which is useful in realizing 1st order phase transitions in further studies of the holographic d-wave superfluids.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen Atom in a Fuzzy Spherical Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fuzzy onion model formed by connecting a set of concentric fuzzy spheres of increasing radius is motivated by studies of quantum space but can also be used to study standard physics. The main feature of the model is that functions in three-dimensional space, for example, scalar fields or wavefunctions, are expressed in terms of Hermitian matrices of a certain form. Relevant equations are then matrix equations, and some problems, such as searching for energy spectrum for fixed angular momentum quantum numbers $(l,m)$, can be expressed as an eigenvalue problem. We show how this simple approach can reproduce the results of other studies analyzing the hydrogen atom in a spherical cavity. We also test the effect of short distance quantum structure of the space on these solutions -- not looking for the phenomenological consequences, as the scale of quantum space is many orders below the order of the Bohr radius, but to understand the effect quantum space in general. We observe a set of solutions with no classical counterpart that has been described in a former theoretical study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel machine learning based framework for discovering integrable models. Our approach first employs a synchronized ensemble of neural networks to find high-precision numerical solution to the Yang-Baxter equation within a specified class. Then, using an auxiliary system of algebraic equations, [Q_2, Q_3] = 0, and the numerical value of the Hamiltonian obtained via deep learning as a seed, we reconstruct the entire Hamiltonian family, forming an algebraic variety. We illustrate our presentation with three- and four-dimensional spin chains of difference form with local interactions. Remarkably, all discovered Hamiltonian families form rational varieties.</description>

      <title>Holographic study of shear viscosity and butterfly velocity for magnetic field-driven quantum criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the shear viscosity and butterfly velocity of a magnetic field-induced quantum phase transition in five dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory, which is holographically dual to a class of strongly coupled quantum field theories with chiral anomalies. Our analysis reveals that the ratio of longitudinal shear viscosity to entropy density $\eta_\parallel/s$ exhibits a pronounced non-monotonic dependence on temperature $T$ when the magnetic field $B$ is slightly below the critical value $B_c$ of the quantum phase transition. In particular, it can develop a distinct minimum at an intermediate temperature. This contrasts sharply with the monotonic temperature scaling observed at and above $B_c$, where $\eta_\parallel/s$ follows the scaling $T^{2/3}$ at $B=B_c$ and transitions to $T^2$ for $B&gt;B_c$ as $T\to0$. The non-vanishing of $\eta_\parallel/s$ for $B&lt;B_c$ in the zero temperature limit suggests that it could serve as a good order parameter of the quantum phase transition. We also find that all butterfly velocities change dramatically near the quantum phase transition, and thus their derivatives with respect to $B$ can be independently used to detect the quantum critical point.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Dressing Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The basic observables in cosmology are known as in-in correlators. Recent calculations have revealed that in-in correlators in four dimensional de Sitter space exhibit hidden simplicity stemming from a close relation to scattering amplitudes in flat space. In this paper we explain how to make this property manifest by dressing flat space Feynman diagrams with certain auxiliary propagators. These dressing rules hold for any order in perturbation theory and can be derived for a broad range of scalar theories, including those with infrared divergences. In the latter case we show that they reproduce the same infrared divergences predicted by the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism.</description>

Abstract: We analyze pure Coulomb high-energy elastic scattering of charged particles (hadrons or nuclei), discarding their strong interactions. We distinguish three scattering modes, determined by the magnitude of the momentum transfer, in which particles behave as point-like, structureless extended, and structured composite objects. The results are compared in the potential and QFT approaches of the eikonal model. In the case of proton Coulomb scattering at the LHC the difference between these two approaches is significant. This indicates the unsuitability of the potential approach. However, in the case of Coulomb scattering of heavy nuclei, the leading one is the optical approximation, which formally reproduces the prescription of the potential approach.</description>

      <title>Can synchrotron radiation reveal the presence of {\it dark sector} around black hole?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We studied synchrotron radiation of a massive charged under visible and hidden sector groups, moving in equatorial plane around spherically symmetric weakly magnetized black hole. As a model of dark matter we choose the one, in which Maxwell field is coupled to the additional $U(1)$-gauge field envisaging the dark sector, the so-called dark photon model. Magnetization of a black hole also stems from Maxwell-dark photon electrodynamics. One found the radiation power and energy loss of the particle and looked for the imprints of dark matter on those phenomena.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on generalised axion-like potentials for the late Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axions have emerged as compelling candidates for describing the dark sector of the Universe. In this work, we explore quintessence models inspired by axion-like potentials as a dynamical alternative to the cosmological constant. These models naturally exhibit a tracking behaviour, reducing the need for fine-tuned initial conditions. We perform a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis on a complete cosmological dataset of Planck PR4 cosmic microwave background (CMB), DESI DR1 baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO), Pantheon+ type Ia supernovae, low-$z$ Cepheid anchors, and DES Y1 large scale structure measurement. Unfortunately, neither the Hubble tension nor the $S_8$ tension is eased. The model does reach parity with $\Lambda$CDM model statistically according to DIC, WAIC and Bayesian ratio, suggesting that a quintessence model may still help with the cosmic tension by further extending the model we have investigated.</description>

      <title>A Majorana Relativistic Quantum Spectral Approach to the Riemann Hypothesis in (1+1)-Dimensional Rindler Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a spectral realization of the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function $\zeta(z)$ from a Mellin-Barnes integral that explicitly contains it in the critical strip for which $0&lt;\Re z &lt; 1$ for the Hilbert-P\'olya approach to the Riemann Hypothesis. This spectrum corresponds to the real-valued energy eigenvalues of a Majorana particle with Hermitian Hamiltonian $H_M$ in a domain $\mathcal{D_M}$ of the $(1+1)$-dimensional Rindler spacetime, or to equivalent Kaluza-Klein reductions of $(n+1)$-dimensional geometries, corresponding to the critical strip. We show that, under these assumptions, all nontrivial zeros have real part $\Re z =1/2$, the critical line, and are infinite in number in agreement with Hardy-Littlewood's theorem from number theory. This result is consistent with the Hilbert-P\'olya conjecture, which provides a framework for proving the Riemann Hypothesis through spectral analysis. We establish a spectral realization of the nontrivial zeta zeros using $H_M$ and confirm its essential self-adjointness also via deficiency index analysis, boundary triplet theory, and Krein's extension theorem. Extending this framework to noncommutative geometry, we interpret $H_M$ as a Dirac operator $D$ in a spectral triple, linking our results to Connes' program and reinforcing our approach as another viable pathway to the Riemann Hypothesis from our premises. This formulation constructs a noncommutative spectral triple $(\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{H}, D)$, where the algebra $\mathcal{A}$ encodes the modular symmetries underlying the spectral realization of $\zeta$ in the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ of Majorana wavefunctions, integrating concepts from quantum mechanics, general relativity, and number theory.</description>

      <title>Dominance of gluonic scale anomaly in confining pressure inside nucleon and D-term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the confining pressure inside the nucleon and the related gravitational form factor referred to as the D-term, using the skyrmion approach based on the scale-invariant chiral perturbation theory, where the skyrmion is described as the nucleon and a scalar meson couples to the scale anomaly through the low energy theorem. Within this model framework, the current quark mass and gluonic quantum contributions to the scale anomaly can be described by the pion and scalar meson masses, respectively, through matching with the underlying QCD. By considering the decomposition of the energy momentum tensor of nucleon, we examine the role of the scale anomaly contributions in the pressure inside the nucleon. As a result, the gluonic scale anomaly is found to dominate the confining pressure. Compared to the result based on the conventional chiral perturbation theory in the chiral limit, our result for the total pressure is capable of qualitatively improving the alignment with lattice QCD observations. Moreover, the pressure from the gluonic scale anomaly is widely distributed in position space, leading to its substantial contribution to the D-term.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We clarify the lore that anomaly-free symmetries are either on-site or can be transformed into on-site symmetries. We prove that any finite, internal, anomaly-free symmetry in a 1+1d lattice Hamiltonian system can be disentangled into an on-site symmetry by introducing ancillas and applying conjugation via a finite-depth quantum circuit. We provide an explicit construction of the disentangling circuit using Gauss's law operators and emphasize the necessity of adding ancillas. Our result establishes the converse to a generalized Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem by demonstrating that any anomaly-free symmetry admits a trivially gapped Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Leptogenesis During an Era of Early SU(2) Confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore leptogenesis during a cosmological epoch during which the electroweak $SU(2)_L$ force is confined. During weak confinement, there is only one conserved non-anomalous global charge, $r$, which is a linear combination of lepton-number, baryon-number, and hypercharge. The inclusion of heavy Majorana neutrinos leads to an $r$-charge and $CP$-violating interaction, allowing for the generation of an $r$-charge asymmetry, which translates into a baryon asymmetry post $SU(2)_L$ deconfinement. Determining the resulting baryon asymmetry as a function of the model parameters, we find that the predicted baryon-asymmetry can match observations for a wide swath of parameter space. While leptogenesis under the assumption of a standard cosmology relies on the complex phase of the neutrino Yukawa couplings, the asymmetry generated in this novel background cosmology primarily depends on a strong phase from $SU(2)_L$ confinement and favors negligible $CP$-violation in the right-handed neutrino decays.</description>

      <title>Principaloid bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel generalisation of principal bundles -- principaloid bundles: These are fibre bundles $\pi:P\to B$ where the typical fibre is the arrow manifold $G$ of a Lie groupoid $G\rightrightarrows M$ and the structure group is reduced to the latter's group of bisections. Each such bundle canonically comes with a bundle map $D:P\to F$ to another fibre bundle $F$ over the base $B$, with typical fibre $M$. Examples of principaloid bundles include ordinary principal $\underline G$-bundles, obtained for $G:=\underline G\rightrightarrows\bullet$, bundles associated to them, obtained for action groupoids $G:=\underline G\ltimes M$, and general fibre bundles if $G$ is a pair groupoid.
  While $\pi$ is far from being a principal $G$-bundle, we prove that $D$ is one. Connections on the principaloid bundle $\pi$ are thus required to be $G$-invariant Ehresmann connections. In the three examples mentioned above, this reproduces the usual types of connection for each of them. In a local description over a trivialising cover $\{O_i\}$ of $B$, the connection gives rise to Lie algebroid-valued objects living over bundle trivialisations $\{O_i\times M\}$ of $F$. Their behaviour under bundle automorphisms, including gauge transformations, is studied in detail.
  Finally, we construct the Atiyah-Ehresmann groupoid ${\rm At}(P)\rightrightarrows F$ which governs symmetries of $P$, this time mapping distinct $D$-fibres to one another in general. It is a fibre-bundle object in the category of Lie groupoids, with typical fibre $G\rightrightarrows M$ and base $B\times B\rightrightarrows B$. We show that those of its bisections which project to bisections of its base are in a one-to-one correspondence with automorphisms of $\pi$.</description>

      <title>Korteweg-de Vries Integrals for Modified Black Hole Potentials: Instabilities and other Questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasi-normal modes (QNMs) and greybody factors are some of the most characteristic features of the dynamics of black holes (BHs) and represent the basis for a number of fundamental physics tests with gravitational wave observations. It is therefore important to understand the properties of these quantities, naturally introduced within BH perturbation theory, in particular the stability properties under modifications of the BH potential. Instabilities in the QNMs have been recently shown to appear in the BH pseudospectrum under certain circumstances. In this work, we give a novel point of view based on the existence of some recently discovered hidden symmetries in BH dynamics and the associated infinite series of conserved quantities, the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) integrals. We provide different motivations to use the KdV integrals as indicators of some crucial BH spectral properties. In particular, by studying them in different scenarios described by modified BH barriers, we find strong evidence that the KdV conserved quantities represent a useful tool to look for instabilities in the BH spectrum of QNMs and in their greybody factors.</description>

Abstract: We study the coupling selection rules associated with non-group symmetries, i.e., $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauging of $\mathbb{Z}_M$ symmetries. We clarify which Yukawa textures can be derived by our selection rules for $M=3, 4$, and 5, and obtain various textures including the the nearest neighbor interaction type and its extension. Some of them cannot be realized by a conventional group-like symmetry. They lead to interesting phenomenology such as a solution to the strong CP problem without axion.</description>

      <title>Basis light-front quantization for the $\Lambda_b$ and $\Sigma_b$ baryons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the basis light-front quantization framework, we compute the masses and light-front wave functions of the $\Lambda_b$ baryon and its isospin triplet counterparts $\Sigma_b^+$, $\Sigma_b^0$, and $\Sigma_b^-$ using a light-front effective Hamiltonian in the leading Fock sector. These wave functions are obtained as eigenstates of the effective Hamiltonian, which incorporates the one-gluon exchange interaction with fixed coupling and a three-dimensional confinement potential. With the quark masses and the couplings as adjustable parameters, the computed masses are set within the experimental range. The resulting predictions for their electromagnetic properties align well with other theoretical calculations. Additionally, the parton distribution functions (PDFs) of these baryons are obtained for the first time, with gluon and sea quark distributions dynamically generated through QCD evolution of the valence quark PDFs.</description>

      <title>Model-independent $H_0$ within FLRW: Joint constraints from GWTC-3 standard sirens and strong lensing time delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hubble tension has emerged as a critical crisis in cosmology, with the cause remaining unclear. Determining the Hubble constant ($H_0$) independently of cosmological models and distance ladders will help resolve this crisis. In this letter, we for the first time use 47 gravitational-wave (GW) standard sirens from the third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog to calibrate distances in the strong lensing system, RXJ1131-1231, and constrain $H_0$ through the distance-sum rule, with minimal cosmological assumptions. We assume that light propagation over long distances is described by the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker metric and that geometrical optics holds, but we do not need to assume the universe's contents or the theory of gravity on cosmological scales. Fixing $\Omega_K=0$, we obtain $H_0=73.22^{+5.95}_{-5.43}$ ${\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1}~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ and $H_0=70.40^{+8.03}_{-5.60}$ ${\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1}~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ by using the deflector galaxy's mass model and kinematic measurements to break mass-sheet transform, respectively. When $\Omega_K$ is not fixed, the central value of $H_0$ increases further. We find that our results are still dominated by statistical errors, and at the same time, we notice the great potential of using GW dark sirens to provide calibration, owing to their higher redshifts. When using 42 binary black holes and RXJ1131-1231, we obtain a $8.46 \%$ $H_0$ constraint precision, which is better than that from the bright siren GW170817 using the Hubble law by about $40\%$. In the future, as the redshift range of GW dark sirens increases, more and more SGLTDs can be included, and we can achieve high-precision, model-independent measurements of $H_0$ without the need for GW bright sirens.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fact that quantum theory is non-differentiable, while general relativity is built on the assumption of differentiability sources an incompatibility between quantum theory and gravity. Higher order geometry addresses this issue directly by extending differential geometry, such that it can be applied to theories that are non-differentiable, but have a certain degree of H\"older regularity. As this includes the path integral formulation of quantum theory, it provides a natural mathematical framework for describing the interplay between gravity and quantum theory. In this article, we review the motivation for and the basic features of this framework and point towards future developments.</description>

      <title>The stochastic gravitational wave background from cosmic superstrings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the stochastic gravitational wave background sourced by a network of cosmic superstrings and demonstrate that incorporating higher-mass string species, beyond the fundamental string, is crucial for accurately modeling the resulting gravitational wave spectrum across frequencies ranging from nanohertz to kilohertz. Using the multi-tension velocity-dependent one-scale model to evolve the cosmic superstring network, we perform several fits to the NANOGrav 15-year dataset and obtain expectation values for the fundamental string tension, string coupling and effective size of compact extra dimensions. We find that the cosmic superstring best-fits are comparable in likelihood to Supermassive Black Hole models, thought by many to be the leading candidate explanation of the signal. The implications of the best-fit spectra are discussed within the context of future gravitational wave experiments. We obtain expectation values for the fundamental string tension of $\log_{10}(G\mu_1)=-11.5^{+0.3}_{-0.3}$($-11.6^{+0.2}_{-0.3}$) for gravitational waves originating from large cuspy (kinky) cosmic superstring loops and $\log_{10}(G\mu_1)=-9.7^{+0.7}_{-0.7}$($-9.9^{+1.0}_{-0.5}$) for small cuspy (kinky) loops. We also place $2\sigma$ upper bounds on the string coupling, finding $g_s&lt;0.65$ in all cases, and comment on the implication of our results for the effective size of the compact extra dimensions.</description>

      <title>Does thermal leptogenesis in a canonical seesaw rely on initial memory?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is a common lore that in the thermal leptogenesis in the type-1 seesaw scenario with the conventional hierarchy of heavy right-handed neutrinos (RHNs), the CP violating, out-of-equilibrium decay of the lightest RHN ($N_1$) is the only relevant source of $B-L$ asymmetry. Any asymmetry produced by the heavier RHNs ($N_2$ and $N_3$) gets washed out by the lepton number violating processes mediated by $N_1$. In this paper, we examine this assumption comprehensively, considering decay and inverse decay processes as well as the inclusion of scatterings. We find that the above said assumption is true only if all the RHNs ($N_1, N_2$ and $N_3$) are in strong washout regime. However, we saw that, to satisfy the neutrino masses and mixing given by the low energy neutrino oscillation data, at most one of the RHNs can be in the weak washout regime. This leads to, if $N_1$ is in the weak washout regime, then the washout parameters of $N_2$ and $N_3$ can be chosen in such a way that the impact of $N_2$ and $N_3$ on the final $B-L$ asymmetry is relatively small. On the other hand, if $N_2$ or $N_3$ is in weak washout regime, then the asymmetry produced by them can affect the final $B-L$ asymmetry even if $N_1$ is in the strong washout regime, which we call the memory effect. We delineated the parameter space where the memory effect is significant.</description>

      <title>No-go theorem for environment-assisted invariance in non-unitary dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We elucidate the requirements for quantum operations that achieve environment-assisted invariance (envariance), a symmetry of entanglement. While envariance has traditionally been studied within the framework of local unitary operations, we extend the analysis to consider non-unitary local operations. First, we investigate the conditions imposed on operators acting on pure bipartite entanglement to attain envariance. We show that the local operations must take a direct-sum form in their Kraus operator representations, establishing decoherence-free subspaces. Furthermore, we prove that the unitary operation on the system's subspace uniquely determines the corresponding unitary operator on the environment's subspace. As an immediate consequence, we demonstrate that environment-assisted shortcuts to adiabaticity cannot be achieved through non-unitary operations. In addition, we identify the requirements that local operations must satisfy to ensure that the eternal black hole states remain static in AdS/CFT.</description>

      <title>A search for sterile neutrinos in interacting dark energy models using DESI baryon acoustic oscillations and DES supernovae data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sterile neutrinos can influence the evolution of the universe, and thus cosmological observations can be used to search for sterile neutrinos. In this study, we utilized the latest baryon acoustic oscillations data from DESI, combined with the cosmic microwave background data from Planck and the five-year supernova data from DES, to constrain the interacting dark energy (IDE) models involving both cases of massless and massive sterile neutrinos. We consider four typical forms of the interaction term $Q=\beta H \rho_{\rm de}$, $Q=\beta H \rho_{\rm c}$, $Q=\beta H_{0} \rho_{\rm de}$, and $Q=\beta H_{0} \rho_{\rm c}$, respectively. Our analysis indicates that the current data provide only a hint of the existence of massless sterile neutrinos (as dark radiation) at about the $1\sigma$ level. In contrast, no evidence supports the existence of massive sterile neutrinos. Furthermore, in IDE models, the inclusion of (massless/massive) sterile neutrinos has a negligible impact on the constraint of the coupling parameter $\beta$. The IDE model of $Q=\beta H \rho_{\rm c}$ with sterile neutrinos does not favor an interaction. However, the other three IDE models with sterile neutrinos support an interaction in which dark energy decays into dark matter.</description>

      <title>Physical Interpretations of Integration Constants in the Solutions of Einstein Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As in other partial differential equations, one ends up with some arbitrary constants or arbitrary functions when one integrates Einstein's equations, or more generally field equations of any other gravity. Interpretation of these arbitrary constants and functions as some physical quantities that can in principle be measured is a non-trivial matter. Concentrating on the case of constants, one usually identifies them as conserved mass, momentum, angular momentum, center of mass, or some other hairs of the solution. This can be done via the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM)-type construction based on pure geometry; and the solution is typically a black hole. Hence, one talks about the black hole mass and angular momentum etc. Here we show that there are several misunderstandings: First of all, the physical interpretation of the constants of a given geometry depends not only on pure geometry, i.e. the metric, but also on the theory under-consideration. This becomes quite important especially when there is a cosmological constant. Secondly, one usually assigns the maximally symmetric spacetime, say the flat or the (anti)-de Sitter spacetime, to have a zero mass and angular momentum and linear momentum. This declares the maximally symmetric spacetime to be the vacuum of the theory, but such an assignment depends on the coordinates in the ADM-type constructions and their extensions: in fact, one can introduce large gauge transformations (new coordinates) which map, say, the flat spacetime to flat spacetime but the resultant flat spacetime can have a nontrivial mass and angular momentum, if the new coordinates are such that the metric components do not decay properly. These issues, which are often overlooked, will be examined in detail, and a resolution, via the use of a divergence-free rank $(0,4)$-tensor will be shown for the case of anti-de Sitter spacetimes.</description>

      <title>A Simple Description of the Hyperk\"{a}hler Structure of the Cotangent Bundle of Projective Space via Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantization identifies the cotangent bundle of projective space with the (non-Hermitian) rank-$1$ projections of a Hilbert space. We use this identification to study the natural geometric structures of these cotangent bundles and those of Grassmanians. In particular, we show that the quantization map is an isometric and complex embedding $T^*\mathbb{P}\mathcal{H}\hookrightarrow\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H})\backslash\{0\}.$ Here, the metric on the domain is the hyperk\"{a}hler metric and the metric on the codomain is the one whose K\"{a}hler potential is the Hilbert-Schmidt norm. The K\"{a}hler potential pulled back to $T^*\mathbb{P}\mathcal{H}$ equals the trace-class norm. Using this, we give a complete, simple and explicit description of the hyperk\"{a}hler structure. Our constructions are functorial, coordinate-free and reduction-free.</description>

Abstract: We extend previous holographic studies of the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) by incorporating a time-dependent magnetic field. Various magnetic field profiles proposed in the literature are implemented, and their impact on the CME signal is analyzed in both static and expanding backgrounds. Interestingly, the integrated chiral magnetic current can exhibit a non-monotonic dependence on the collision energy. Our results suggest that the CME signal is enhanced at collision energies below $\sqrt{s}=200$ GeV. In addition, we derive a quasi-equilibrium formula for the chiral magnetic effect in the expanding background that is valid at late times.</description>

      <title>Compact Two-Loop QCD Corrections for $Vjj$ Production in Proton Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present compact two-loop QCD corrections in the leading-color approximation for the production of an electroweak vector boson, $V = \{W^{\pm}, Z,\gamma^\star\}$, in association with two light jets ($Vjj$) at hadron colliders. Leptonic decays of the electroweak boson are included at the amplitude level. Working in the analytic-reconstruction approach, we develop two techniques to build compact partial-fraction forms for individual rational functions. One approach exploits their analytic structure. In the other, we iteratively construct subtraction terms that match the rational functions in singular limits. Moreover, we show how the singular behavior of the rational functions can be systematically used to find a more compact basis of the space that they span. We apply our techniques to the $Vjj$ amplitudes, yielding a representation that is three orders of magnitude smaller than previous results. We then use these compact expressions to provide an efficient and stable C++ numerical implementation suitable for phenomenological applications.</description>

Abstract: We study the quantum effects of big bang and black hole singularities on massive conformal gravity. We do this by analyzing the behavior of the on-shell effective action of the theory at these singularities. The result is that such singularities are harmless in MCG because the on-shell effective action of the theory does not diverge at them.</description>

      <title>The Origin of Calabi-Yau Crystals in BPS States Counting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02792v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the counting problem of BPS D-branes wrapping holomorphic cycles of a general toric Calabi-Yau manifold. We evaluate the Jeffrey-Kirwan residues for the flavoured Witten index for the supersymmetric quiver quantum mechanics on the worldvolume of the D-branes, and find that BPS degeneracies are described by a statistical mechanical model of crystal melting. For Calabi-Yau threefolds, we reproduce the crystal melting models long known in the literature. For Calabi-Yau fourfolds, however, we find that the crystal does not contain the full information for the BPS degeneracy and we need to explicitly evaluate non-trivial weights assigned to the crystal configurations. Our discussions treat Calabi-Yau threefolds and fourfolds on equal footing, and include discussions on elliptic and rational generalizations of the BPS states counting, connections to the mathematical definition of generalized Donaldson-Thomas invariants, examples of wall crossings, and of trialities in quiver gauge theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03715v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The distance conjecture states that for theories with moduli coupled to gravity a tower of states becomes light exponentially in the geodesic distance in moduli space. This specifies how effective field theories break down for large field values. However, phenomenological field theories have no moduli, but a scalar potential that deforms dynamical trajectories away from geodesic curves. In this note we speculate on how one should generalise the distance conjecture, in asymptotic field regimes, to include a scalar potential. We test the generalised distance conjecture in a few cases, demonstrate a link with pseudo-/fake supersymmetry and apply it to the ekpyrotic scenario in cosmology. For the latter we observe that the pre-uplift KKLT potential could provide a stringy embedding of ekpyrosis away from the asymptotic regimes in field space.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we compute the WQFT partition function, specifically the eikonal phase in a black hole scattering event in the dynamical Chern-Simons theory, using the techniques of spinning worldline quantum field theory. We consider the scattering of spinning black holes and highlight the necessary details for the calculation of the partition function. We present the $\epsilon$-expansion of the essential two-loop integrals using Integration-by-Parts (IBP) reduction and differential equation techniques, which we then utilize to compute the linear-in-order spin eikonal phase up to 3PM. Additionally, we discuss the dependence of the phase on the spin orientations of the black holes.</description>

      <title>Non-extremal Island in de Sitter Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21617v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the challenges and resolutions in computing the entanglement entropy for the quantum field theory coupled to de Sitter (dS) gravity along a timelike boundary. The conventional island formula, originally designed to calculate the fine-grained entropy for a non-gravitational system coupled to anti-de Sitter (AdS) gravity, encounters difficulties in de Sitter gravitational spacetime, failing to provide a physically plausible extremal island. To overcome these problems, we introduce a doubly holographic model by embedding a dS$_2$ braneworld in an AdS$_3$ bulk spacetime. This approach facilitates the computation of entanglement entropy through holographic correlation functions, effectively circumventing the constraints of the island formula. We demonstrate that the correct recipe for calculating entanglement entropy with dS gravity involves the non-extremal island, whose boundary is instead defined at the edge of the dS gravitational region. Our findings indicate that, during the island phase, the entanglement wedge of the non-gravitational bath includes the entire dS gravitational space. Using the second variation formula, we further show that the existence of a locally minimal surface anchored on the gravitational brane is intrinsically linked to the extrinsic curvature of the brane.</description>

Abstract: The gravitational Cheshire effect refers to the possibility of turning off the gravitational field while still leaving an imprint of the nonminimal coupling of matter to gravity. This allows nontrivial solutions in flat spacetime for which no backreaction is possible. The effect was originally shown to manifest itself for standard nonminimal couplings, such as those allowing conventional conformally invariant scalar fields. Recently, the most general scalar field action yielding a conformally invariant second-order equation was constructed, and entails a more involved nonminimal coupling explicitly breaking the conformal invariance of the action without spoiling it in the equation. We have succeeded in fully describing the spherically symmetric stealth solutions on flat spacetime supporting the Cheshire effect within this general non-Noetherian conformal theory. The allowed configurations are divided into two branches: The first one essentially corresponds to an extension of the solutions already known for the standard Noetherian conformal theory. The second branch is only possible due to the non-Noetherian conformal contribution of the action. The complete characterization of this branch is expressed by a nonlinear first-order partial differential equation. We have found the general solution of this equation using both seemingly new and well-established mathematical tools.</description>

Abstract: Landau Yang theorem is well known for the past several decades. It prohibits the decay of a massive spin 1 particle to two photons. This emerges simply from the representation theory of the Poincare group and Bose Statistics. It does not require any action or Lagrangian. We generalize this theorem to theories with supersymmetry (SUSY) which disallows even decay to two photinos (Majorana fermions) as well as the decay of a zino to a photon and a photino. We will prove that if the photon has a mass, howsoever small, this theorem can be evaded. We also show that the supersymmetric selection rule above can also be evaded through the Stueckelberg mass term. Further interesting implications are also pointed out.</description>

      <title>Particle creation from non-geodesic trajectories in multifield inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Particle production in de Sitter spacetime arises from the exponential expansion of space, rendering the Bunch-Davies vacuum perceived as a particle-containing state by late-time observers. For states defined as eigenstates of both momentum and the Hamiltonian, the Bunch-Davies vacuum exhibits a constant particle density per physical momentum. We explore particle production beyond this baseline, focusing on deviations from exact de Sitter conditions and non-gravitational interactions, such as slow-roll inflation or interactions arising from the coupling of inflation to other fields. Using Bogoliubov transformations, we calculate the number density of energy/momentum eigenstates. In single-field inflation, this density captures the observed spectral index of the primordial power spectrum, while in two-field models, it reflects the non-gravitational coupling driving background trajectory turning. We present analytical results applicable to various scenarios involving particle production from non-adiabatic processes during inflation.</description>

      <title>Multivariate hypergeometric solutions of cosmological (dS) correlators by $\text{d} \log$-form differential equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we give the analytic expression for the homogeneous part of solutions of arbitrary tree-level cosmological correlators, including massive propagators and time-derivative interaction cases. The solutions are given in the form of multivariate hypergeometric functions. It is achieved by two steps. Firstly, we indicate the factorization of the homogeneous part of solutions, i.e., the homogeneous part of solutions of multiple vertices is the product of the solutions of the single vertex. Secondly, we give the solution to the $\text{d} \log$-form differential equations of arbitrary single vertex integral family. We also show how to determine the boundary conditions for the differential equations. There are two techniques we developed for the computation. Firstly, we analytically solve $\text{d} \log$-form differential equations via power series expansion. Secondly, we handle degenerate multivariate poles in power series expansion of differential equations by blow-up. They could also be useful in the evaluation of multi-loop Feynman integrals in flat spacetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04043v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study $\frac{1}{4}$-BPS Wilson loops in four-dimensional SU$(N$) $\mathcal {N}=2$ super-Yang-Mills theories with conformal matter in an arbitrary representation $\mathcal{R}$. These operators correspond to loops on a two-sphere formed by two meridians separated by an arbitrary opening angle. We conjecture that these observables are encoded in Pestun's matrix model. The matrix representation of these operators resembles that of the $\frac12$-BPS circular Wilson loop, differing only for a rescaling in the phase factor. We support our conjecture with an explicit three-loop calculation in flat space, which shows that the observable coincides with the $\mathcal{N}=4$ counterpart up to two loops, as expected by the conformality condition. Finally, exploiting the matrix model representation of these Wilson loops, we study the large-$N$ limit at strong coupling of $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal QCD, finding a surprising transition in the vacuum expectation value for a critical opening angle.</description>

      <title>Topological Constraints on Defect Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extended objects (defects) in Quantum Field Theory exhibit rich, nontrivial dynamics describing a variety of physical phenomena. These systems often involve strong coupling at long distances, where the bulk and defects interact, making analytical studies challenging. By carefully analyzing the behavior of bulk symmetries in the presence of defects, we uncover robust topological constraints on defect RG flows. Specifically, we introduce the notions of $\textit{defect anomalies}$ and $\textit{symmetry reflecting defects}$, both of which are RG-invariant. Several known notions, such as higher-form symmetries, fractionalization, and projective lines, are revealed to be manifestations of defect anomalies, which also encompass novel phenomena and forbid trivial defect dynamics in the IR. Meanwhile, symmetry reflecting defects are shown to remain coupled at low energies, imposing powerful dynamical constraints. We verify our findings through concrete examples: exactly solvable defect RG flows in (1+1)d Conformal Field Theories with symmetry reflecting lines and a surface defect in (2+1)d scalar QED.</description>

      <title>Useful trick to compute correlation functions of composite operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In general, in gauge field theories, physical observables are represented by gauge-invariant composite operators, such as the electromagnetic current. As we recently demonstrated in the context of the $U\left(1\right)$ and $SU\left(2\right)$ Higgs models \cite{Dudal:2019pyg,Dudal:2020uwb,Maas:2020kda}, correlation functions of gauge-invariant operators exhibit very nice properties. Besides the well-known gauge independence, they do not present unphysical cuts, and their K\"{a}ll\'{e}n-Lehmann representations are positive, at least perturbatively. Despite all these interesting features, they are not employed as much as elementary fields, mainly due to the additional complexities involved in their computation and renormalization. In this article, we present a useful trick to compute loop corrections to correlation functions of composite operators. This trick consists of introducing an additional field with no dynamics, coupled to the composite operator of interest. By using this approach, we can employ the traditional algorithms used to compute correlation functions of elementary fields.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative Overlaps in JT Gravity: From Spectral Form Factor to Generating Functions of Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interplay between black hole interior dynamics and quantum chaos provides a crucial framework for probing quantum effects in quantum gravity. In this work, we investigate non-perturbative overlaps in Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity to uncover universal signatures of quantum chaos and quantum complexity. Taking advantage of universal spectral correlators from random matrix theory, we compute the overlaps between the thermofield double (TFD) state and two distinct classes of states: fixed-length states, which encode maximal volume slices, and time-shifted TFD states. The squared overlaps naturally define probability distributions that quantify the expectation values of gravitational observables. Central to our results is the introduction of generating functions for quantum complexity measures, such as $\langle e^{-\alpha \ell} \rangle$. The time evolution of these generating functions exhibits the universal slope-ramp-plateau structure, mirroring the behavior of the spectral form factor (SFF). Using generating functions, we further demonstrate that the universal time evolution of complexity for chaotic systems, which is characterized by a linear growth followed by a late-time plateau, arises from the disappearance of the linear ramp as the regularization parameter $\alpha$ decreases. With regard to the time-shifted TFD state, we derive a surprising result: the expectation value of the time shift, which classically grows linearly, vanishes when non-perturbative quantum corrections are incorporated. This cancellation highlights a fundamental distinction between semiclassical and quantum gravitational descriptions of the black hole interior. All our findings establish generating functions as powerful probes of quantum complexity and chaos in gravitational and quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Chemistry Knows Extra Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: : In this note, we study an extra dimension effect on the black hole chemistry in the 8-dimensional Einstein-Yang-Mills-Maxwell theory. The base spacetime contains 4- dimensional compact manifolds and an instanton on top of those. We demonstrate how the extra dimensions affect the phase transition and viable black hole sizes in the 4-dimensional Einstein frame through the black hole chemistry. We focus on asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetimes for the effective 4-dimensional model obtained by a dimensional reduction. The extra-dimension size determines thermodynamic pressure, and the thermodynamic volume is roughly the horizon size of black holes. Thus, the extra dimension and black hole sizes are related as a conjugate pair of thermodynamic variables. In addition, we discuss the zeroth-order phase transition of the 4-dimensional Kerr-AdS black hole.</description>

      <title>What happens due to the baby universe effect in JT gravity? -- Analysis of correlation functions and ERB length at late time using three approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the correlation function in JT gravity using three approaches: by summing over all geodesics connecting boundary operators, integrating over the region of moduli space determined by the ``no-shortcut condition'' introduced by D.Stanford and Z.Yang, and using the formula for the universal spectral density correlation in the $\tau$-scaling limit. We find that the behaviors of the three results coincide at late times: they all exhibit a ``ramp'' instead of permanent decay. Using the third approach we also confirm that the ``plateau'' appears after $T_H=2\pi e^{S_0}\hat{\rho}_0(E)$. Overall, our results are consistent with the SFF analysis.
  We also calculate the ERB length $\langle \ell(T) \rangle$ using the three approaches and find that the results are in good agreement with each other. We also find that the $\langle \ell(T) \rangle$ grows as a cubic function in $T$ due to the contribution from geometry including one observable baby universe, and converges to a constant after $T=T_H$. For the geometry with one baby universe, we compute the size $\langle b(T) \rangle$ of the baby universe and find that it is of the same order as $\langle \ell(T) \rangle$. This result is consistent with the baby universe emission mechanism claimed by P.Saad.</description>

      <title>Diophantine equations with sum of cubes and cube of sum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.04139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.04139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We solve Diophantine equations of the type $ a \, (x^3 \!+ \! y^3 \!+ \! z^3 ) = (x \! + \! y \! + \! z)^3$, where $x,y,z$ are integer variables, and the coefficient $a\neq 0$ is rational. We show that there are infinite families of such equations, including those where $a$ is any cube or certain rational fractions, that have nontrivial solutions. There are also infinite families of equations that do not have any nontrivial solution, including those where $1/a = 1- 24/m$ with restrictions on the integer $m$. The equations can be represented by elliptic curves unless $a = 9$ or 1, and any elliptic curve of nonzero $j$-invariant and torsion group $\mathbb{Z}/3k\mathbb{Z}$ for $k = 2,3,4$, or $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}/6\mathbb{Z} $ corresponds to a particular $a$. We prove that for any $a$ the number of nontrivial solutions is at most 3 or is infinite, and for integer $a$ it is either 0 or $\infty$. For $a = 9$, we find the general solution, which depends on two integer parameters. These cubic equations are important in particle physics, because they determine the fermion charges under the $U(1)$ gauge group.</description>

      <title>Field analogue of the Ruijsenaars-Schneider model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.01697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.01697v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We suggest a field extension of the classical elliptic Ruijsenaars-Schneider model. The model is defined in two different ways which lead to the same result. The first one is via the trace of a chain product of $L$-matrices which allows one to introduce the Hamiltonian of the model and to show that the model is gauge equivalent to a classical elliptic spin chain. In this way, one obtains a lattice field analogue of the Ruijsenaars-Schneider model with continuous time. The second method is based on investigation of general elliptic families of solutions to the 2D Toda equation. We derive equations of motion for their poles, which turn out to be difference equations in space with a lattice spacing $\eta$, together with a zero curvature representation for them. We also show that the equations of motion are Hamiltonian. The obtained system of equations can be naturally regarded as a field generalization of the Ruijsenaars-Schneider system. Its lattice version coincides with the model introduced via the first method. The limit $\eta \to 0$ is shown to give the field extension of the Calogero-Moser model known in the literature. The fully discrete version of this construction is also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.06343v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the behaviour of head-to-head high energy Compton scattering in the $\theta$-exact noncommutative (NC) quantum electrodynamics (QED) on the Moyal space (NCQED) in the amid its unresolved forward scattering singularity. We model the effect of the currently unknown resolution to this unavoidable collinear singularity by cut-offs which are functions of the control variable $s/\Lambda_{\rm NC}^2$, and find that such cut-off functions can suppress NC corrections to the inverse Compton scattering to negligible. Discussed cut-offs leave the unpolarised integral cross section of the forward region larger than the backward region all the time, making the former potentially easier to observe. Our estimations indicate that such an effect may be visible in the future collider experiments when the NC scale $\Lambda_{\rm NC}\gtrsim1$ TeV.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present a theory for gravity coupled with scalar, SU$(n)$ and spinor fields on manifolds with null-boundary. We perform the symplectic reduction of the space of boundary fields and give the constraints of the theory in terms of local functionals of boundary vielbein and connection. For the three different couplings, the analysis of the constraint algebra shows that the set of constraints does not form a first class system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03906v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider two simple criteria for when a physical theory should be said to be "generally covariant", and we argue that these criteria are not met by Yang-Mills theory, even on geometric formulations of that theory. The reason, we show, is that the bundles encountered in Yang-Mills theory are not natural bundles; instead, they are gauge-natural. We then show how these observations relate to previous arguments about the significance of solder forms in assessing disanalogies between general relativity and Yang-Mills theory. We conclude by suggesting that general covariance is really about functoriality.</description>

      <title>Spectral Flow for the Riemann zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01828v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, with Mussardo we defined a quantum mechanical problem of a single particle scattering with impurities wherein the quantized energy levels $E_n (\sigma)$ are exactly equal to the zeros of the Riemann $\zeta (s)$ where $\sigma = \Re (s)$ in the limit $\sigma \to 1/2$. The S-matrix is based on the Euler product and is unitary by construction, thus the underlying hamiltonian is hermitian and all eigenvalues must be real. Motivated by the Hilbert-P\'olya idea we study the spectral flows for $\{ E_n (\sigma) \}$. This leads to a simple criterion for the validity of the Riemann Hypothesis. The spectral flow arguments are simple enough that we present analogous results for the Generalized and Grand Riemann Hypotheses. We also illustrate our results for a counter example where the Riemann Hypothesis is violated since there is no underlying unitary S-matrix due to the lack of an Euler product.</description>

Abstract: So far, no one has studied regular black holes using the Parikh-Wilczek method. In this paper, we calculated the emission rate of magnetized particles passing through the event horizon of the Bardeen black hole by using the Parikh-Wilczek method. The emission spectrum deviates from the pure thermal spectrum, but conforms to the unitary principle of quantum mechanics. Our results support the conservation of information.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of high order correction for Schwarzschild-AdS black hole in non-commutative geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16799v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Under the premise that quantum gravity becomes non-negligible, higher-order corrections of non-commutative geometry dominate. In this paper, we studied the thermodynamics of high-order corrections for Schwarzschild-AdS black hole with Lorentz distribution in the framework of non-commutative geometry. Our results indicate that when high-order corrections dominate, the thermodynamic behavior of Schwarzschild-AdS black hole in non-commutative geometry will gradually approach that of ordinary Schwarzschild-AdS black hole. In addition, we also studied the Joule-Thomson effect of Schwarzschild-AdS black hole under high-order corrections.</description>

      <title>Measuring the boson mass of fuzzy dark matter with stellar proper motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) is among the most suitable candidates to replace WIMPs and to resolve the puzzling mystery of dark matter. A galactic dark matter halo made of these ultralight bosonic particles leads to the formation of a solitonic core surrounded by quantum interference patterns that, on average, reproduce a Navarro-Frenk-White-like mass density profile in the outskirts of the halo. The structure of such a core is determined once the boson mass and the total mass of the halo are set. We investigated the capability of future astrometric Theia-like missions to detect the properties of such a halo within the FDM model, namely the boson mass and the core radius. To this aim, we built mock catalogs containing three-dimensional positions and velocities of stars within a target dwarf galaxy. We exploited these catalogs using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm and found that measuring the proper motion of at least 2000 stars within the target galaxy, with uncertainty $\sigma_v \leq 3$ km/s on the velocity components, will constrain the boson mass and the core radius with 3\% accuracy. Furthermore, the transition between the solitonic core and the outermost NFW-like density profile could be detected with an uncertainty of 7\%. Such results would not only help to confirm the existence of FDM, but they would also be useful for alleviating the current tension between galactic and cosmological estimations of the boson mass, or demonstrating the need for multiple particles with a broad mass spectrum as naturally arise String Axiverse.</description>

      <title>Quantum dust collapse with cosmological constant and methods for constructing conformal diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22605v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The loop quantum gravitational collapse of the dust ball in presence of positive cosmological constant is investigated within the Oppenheimer-Snyder collapse scenario. The dust ball interior is described within the framework of loop quantum cosmology, while its exterior geometry is determined by the differentiability of the spacetime metric at the dust ball surface and the assumption of the (vacuum) exterior to be stationary. In order to determine the global causal structure of the investigated spacetime a robust (numerical) method of constructing Penrose-Carter diagrams is built. Unfortunately the presence of cosmological constant does not cure the problems already present in the case of it vanishing -- the exterior geometry resembles that of Reissner-Nordstr\"om-de Sitter black hole, in particular featuring timelike singularties.</description>

      <title>Causal structure of nonhomogeneous dust collapse in effective loop quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the causal structure for spherically symmetric dust collapse within a model of effective loop quantum gravity. We develop a general strategy (working beyond the dynamical model of our consideration) for constructing double null coordinates, allowing the extraction of conformal diagrams within single coordinate charts. With the methods introduced, we confirm that the homogeneous Oppenheimer-Snyder collapse scenario resembles the Reissner-Nordstr\"om-like picture. For the nonhomogenous collapse scenario, we construct the conformal diagrams, subsequently, we study its relevant properties, in particular, dust particles' trajectories, apparent horizons and shell-crossing singularities. We conclude that a significant region of spacetime remains inaccessible to the model's dynamics due to the formation of the shell-crossing singularities. The question of whether a timelike singularity, similar to that in the homogeneous dust ball collapse scenario, arises in the nonhomogeneous case remains unresolved. Furthermore, we find that phenomena such as black hole explosions or gravitational shock waves cannot be witnessed by an external observer who does not cross any horizon. Indeed, the collapse cannot take place within single asymptotic region.</description>

      <title>Non-Invertible Peccei-Quinn Symmetry, Natural 2HDM Alignment, and the Visible Axion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify $m_{12}^2$ as a spurion of non-invertible Peccei-Quinn symmetry in the type II 2HDM with gauged quark flavor. Thus a UV theory which introduces quark color-flavor monopoles can naturally realize alignment without decoupling and can furthermore revive the Weinberg-Wilczek axion. As an example we consider the $SU(9)$ theory of color-flavor unification, which needs no new fermions. This is the first model-building use of non-invertible symmetry to find a Dirac natural explanation for a small $\textit{relevant}$ parameter.</description>

      <title>Full-colour double-virtual amplitudes for associated production of a Higgs boson with a bottom-quark pair at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the double-virtual amplitudes contributing to the production of a Higgs boson in association with a $b\bar{b}$ pair at the Large Hadron Collider. We perform the computation within the five-flavour scheme, which employs massless bottom quarks and finite bottom-Yukawa coupling, taking into account all the colour structures. We derive the analytic form of the helicity amplitudes through finite-field reconstruction techniques. The analytic expressions have been implemented in a public C++ library, and we demonstrate that evaluations are sufficiently stable and efficient for use in phenomenological studies.</description>

      <title>Numerical evaluation of two-loop QCD helicity amplitudes for $gg\to t \bar{t} g$ at leading colour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first benchmark evaluation of the two-loop finite remainders for the production of a top-quark pair in association with a jet at hadron colliders in the gluon channel. We work in the leading colour approximation, and perform the numerical evaluation in the physical phase space. To achieve this result, we develop a new method for expressing the master integrals in terms of a (over-complete) basis of special functions that enables the infrared and ultraviolet poles to be cancelled analytically despite the presence of elliptic Feynman integrals. The special function basis makes it manifest that the elliptic functions appear solely in the finite remainder, and can be evaluated numerically through generalised series expansions. The helicity amplitudes are constructed using four dimensional projectors combined with finite-field techniques to perform integration-by-parts reduction, mapping to special functions and Laurent expansion in the dimensional regularisation parameter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the case-(1) multi-indexed orthogonal polynomials of a discrete variable for 8 types ((dual)($q$-)Hahn, three kinds of $q$-Krawtchouk and $q$-Meixner). Based on them and the case-(1) multi-indexed orthogonal polynomials of Racah, $q$-Racah, Meixner, little $q$-Jacobi and little $q$-Laguerre types, exactly solvable continuous time birth and death processes are obtained. Their discrete time versions (Markov chains) are also obtained for finite types.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Ultraviolet Freeze-in in General Reheating Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of cosmic reheating, that is, on how the energy stored in the inflaton is transferred to the standard model (SM) thermal bath, is largely unknown. In this work, we show that the phenomenology of the nonbaryonic dark matter (DM) ultraviolet freeze-in production strongly depends on the dynamics of the cosmic-reheating era. Using a general parametrization for the Hubble expansion rate and SM temperature, we thoroughly investigate DM production during reheating, not only recovering earlier findings that focused on specific cases, but also exploring alternative scenarios. Additionally, we derive a generalized framework for DM production via inflaton decays and identify the viable parameter space, while simultaneously addressing constraints from CMB observations. As illustrative examples, we explore gravitational DM production through scatterings of SM particles or inflatons, deriving well-defined parameter regions for these scenarios.</description>

      <title>Rotating and swirling binary black hole system balanced by its gravitational spin-spin interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08706v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first exact and analytical solution representing an equilibrium configuration of two stationary black holes, in general relativity, is presented. The metric models two collinear extremal Kerr black holes immersed into an external and back-reacting rotating tidal drag. The gravitational attraction is balanced by the repulsive gravitational spin-spin interaction generated by the interplay between black holes angular momenta with the rotational background. The new solution is built by embedding the double Kerr metric into a swirling universe by means of the Ehlers transformation. The geometry is completely regular outside the event horizons. Thermodynamic properties of the binary black hole system are studied, the Smarr law, the first law and the Christodoulou-Ruffini formulas are verified. Microscopic degrees of freedom of the entropy are computed from the dual CFT living on the boundary of the near horizon geometries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13975v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We express Kitaev's exact solution of spin models on the honeycomb lattice as a special case of a higher dimensional duality between staggered Majorana fermions and Pauli spins. General models with bilinear nearest neighbor couplings of spins and external magnetic fields are soluble in this way. Each model gives rise to an infinite number of single particle fermion Schrodinger equations, depending on the choice of discrete gauge field flux.</description>
