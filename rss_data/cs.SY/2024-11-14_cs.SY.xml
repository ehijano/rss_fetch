      <title>Optimal Constant Climb Airspeed with Variable Cost Index for All-electric Aircraft</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents for the first time an approach to minimize direct operational costs (DOC) for all-electric aircraft during the climb phase, introducing a time-varying cost index (CI). The CI is modeled as a dynamic parameter commanded by Air Traffic Control (ATC), allowing the aircraft to maintain a constant airspeed throughout the climb, while respecting the air traffic regulations. This paper also explores the implications of a time-varying CI on the determination of optimal airspeed and climbing time for all-electric aircraft. Additionally, it provides the necessary equations to calculate both the optimal climb airspeed and climb duration. The proposed methodology has been validated through a simulated scenario that reflects actual operational procedures. As a result, optimal values for climb airspeed, climbing time, and energy consumption have been established, paving the way for future applications of this methodology to advanced air mobility all-electric vehicles.</description>

      <title>Shaping Frequency Dynamics in Modern Power Systems with Grid-forming Converters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, frequency dynamics in modern power systems with a high penetration of converter-based generation is analysed. A fundamental analysis of the frequency dynamics is performed to identify the limitations and challenges when the converter penetration is increased. The voltage-source behaviour is found as an essential characteristic of converters to improve the initial frequency derivative of Synchronous Generators (SGs). A detailed small-signal analysis, based on the system's eigenvalues, participation factors and mode shapes, is then performed in a reduced system for different converter penetrations, showing that the flexibility of grid-forming (GFOR) converters as well as the system's inertia reduction may lead to have a more controllable system frequency. First-order frequency responses can be programmed for high converter penetrations, when GFOR operation can impose their dominance over SGs. These results have been validated in the IEEE 118-bus system simulated in PSCAD.</description>

      <title>Collision-Free Multi-Agent Coverage Control for Non-Cooperating Swarms: Preliminary Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main contribution of this paper is a methodology for multiple non-cooperating swarms of unmanned aerial vehicles to independently cover a common area. In contrast to previous research on coverage control involving more than one swarm, this paper does not assume cooperation between distinct groups but considers them as entirely independent units following their own objectives. Using Voronoi tesselation, collision-free motion of agents within the same swarm has been proved before. However, as is shown in Example 1 of this paper, in the case of multiple swarms with inter-swarm but without intra-swarm collaboration, these guarantees do not hold. We address this issue by proposing an algorithm to achieve maximum coverage with multiple swarms while avoiding collisions between agents. Thus, the Optimal Reciprocal Collision Avoidance method used for safe navigation in multi-agent scenarios is adapted to suit the needs of Voronoi-based coverage control with more than one swarm. The functionality of the proposed technique is validated through Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>System-Level Analysis for mm-Wave Full-Duplex Transceivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper conducts a comprehensive system-level analysis of mm-Wave full-duplex transceivers, focusing on a receiver employing a four-stage self-interference cancellation (SIC) process. The analysis aims to optimize the noise and linearity performance requirements of each transceiver block, ensuring that the self-interference (SI) signal does not compromise the receiver's error vector magnitude (EVM) for an OFDM 64-QAM signal. Additionally, the necessary SIC for each stage is calculated to establish feasible noise and linearity specifications for a CMOS-based implementation. The resulting specifications are subsequently validated within a MATLAB Simulink environment, confirming the accuracy of the computed requirements for each block.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Certification Informed Power System Transient Stability Preventive Control with Renewable Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing machine learning-based surrogate modeling methods for transient stability constrained-optimal power flow (TSC-OPF) lack certifications in the presence of unseen disturbances or uncertainties. This may lead to divergence of TSC-OPF or insecure control strategies. This paper proposes a neural network certification-informed power system transient stability preventive control method considering the impacts of various uncertainty resources, such as errors from measurements, fluctuations in renewable energy sources (RESs) and loads, etc. A deep belief network (DBN) is trained to estimate the transient stability, replacing the time-consuming time-domain simulation-based calculations. Then, DBN is embedded into the iterations of the primal-dual interior-point method to solve TSC-OPF. To guarantee the robustness of the solutions, the neural network verifier $\alpha, \beta$-CROWN to deal with uncertainties from RESs and loads is proposed. The yielded certification results allow us to further adjust the transient stability safety margin under the iterated TSC-OPF solution process, balancing system security and economics. Numerical results on a modified western South Carolina 500-bus system demonstrate that the proposed method can efficiently and quickly obtain the safety-verified preventive control strategy through RES curtailment and generator dispatch with only a slight increase in cost.</description>

      <title>Inference-Aware State Reconstruction for Industrial Metaverse under Synchronous/Asynchronous Short-Packet Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a real-time state reconstruction system for industrial metaverse. The time-varying physical process states in real space are captured by multiple sensors via wireless links, and then reconstructed in virtual space. In this paper, we use the spatial-temporal correlation of the sensor data of interest to infer the real-time data of the target sensor to reduce the mean squared error (MSE) of reconstruction for industrial metaverse under short-packet transmission (SPT). Both synchronous and asynchronous transmission modes for multiple sensors are considered. It is proved that the average MSE of reconstruction and average block error probability (BLEP) have a positive correlation under inference with synchronous transmission scheme, and they have a negative correlation in some conditions under inference with asynchronous transmission scheme. Also, it is proved that the average MSE of reconstruction with inference can be significantly lower than that without inference, even under weak mean squared spatial correlation (MSSC). In addition, closed-form MSSC thresholds are derived for the superiority regions of the inference with synchronous transmission and inference with asynchronous transmission schemes, respectively. Adaptations of blocklength and time shift of asynchronous transmission are conducted to minimize the average MSE of reconstruction. Simulation results show that the two schemes significantly outperform the no inference case, with an average MSE reduction of more than 50%.</description>

      <title>Robust performance for switched systems with constrained switching and its application to weakly hard real-time control systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many cyber-physical systems can naturally be formulated as switched systems with constrained switching. This includes systems where one of the signals in the feedback loop may be lost. Possible sources for losses are shared or unreliable communication media in networked control systems, or signals which are discarded, e.g., when using a shared computation device such as a processor in real-time control applications. The use of switched systems with constrained switching is not limited to cyber-physical systems but, includes many other relevant applications such as power systems and modeling virus mutations. In this chapter, we introduce a framework for analyzing and designing controllers which guarantee robust quadratic performance for switched systems with constrained switching. The possible switching sequences are described by the language of a labeled graph where the labels are linked to the different subsystems. The subsystems are allowed to have different input and output dimensions, and their state-space representations can be affected by a broad class of uncertainties in a rational way. The proposed framework exploits ideas from dissipativity-based linear control theory to derive analysis and synthesis inequalities given by linear matrix inequalities. We demonstrate how the proposed framework can be applied to the design of controllers for uncertain weakly hard real-time control systems - a system class naturally appearing in networked and real-time control.</description>

      <title>Future state prediction based on observer for missile system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Guided missile accuracy and precision is negatively impacted by seeker delay, more specifically by the delay introduced by a mechanical seeker gimbal and the computational time taken to process the raw data. To meet the demands and expectations of modern missiles systems, the impact of this hardware limitation must be reduced. This paper presents a new observer design that predicts the future state of a seeker signal, augmenting the guidance system to mitigate the effects of this delay. The design is based on a novel two-step differentiator, which produces the estimated future time derivatives of the signal. The input signal can be nonlinear and provides for simple integration into existing systems. A bespoke numerical guided missile simulation is used to demonstrate the performance of the observer within a missile guidance system. Both non-manoeuvring and randomly manoeuvring target engagement scenarios are considered.</description>

      <title>Robust Optimal Power Flow Against Adversarial Attacks: A Tri-Level Optimization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In power systems, unpredictable events like extreme weather, equipment failures, and cyberattacks present significant challenges to ensuring safety and reliability. Ensuring resilience in the face of these uncertainties is crucial for reliable and efficient operations. This paper presents a tri-level optimization approach for robust power system operations that effectively address worst-case attacks. The first stage focuses on optimizing economic dispatch under normal operating conditions, aiming to minimize generation costs while maintaining the supply-demand balance. The second stage introduces an adversarial attack model, identifying worst-case scenarios that maximize the system's vulnerability by targeting distributed generation (DG). In the third stage, mitigation strategies are developed using fast-response energy storage systems (ESS) to minimize disruptions caused by these attacks. By integrating economic dispatch, vulnerability assessment, and mitigation into a unified framework, this approach provides a robust solution for enhancing power system resilience and safety against evolving adversarial threats. The approach is validated using the IEEE-33 node distribution system to demonstrate its effectiveness in achieving both cost efficiency and system resilience.</description>

      <title>On the Application of Model Predictive Control to a Weighted Coverage Path Planning Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the application of Model Predictive Control (MPC) to a weighted coverage path planning (WCPP) problem. The problem appears in a wide range of practical applications, such as search and rescue (SAR) missions. The basic setup is that one (or multiple) agents can move around a given search space and collect rewards from a given spatial distribution. Unlike an artificial potential field, each reward can only be collected once. In contrast to a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), the agent moves in a continuous space. Moreover, he is not obliged to cover all locations and/or may return to previously visited locations. The WCPP problem is tackled by a new Model Predictive Control (MPC) formulation with so-called Coverage Constraints (CCs). It is shown that the solution becomes more effective if the solver is initialized with a TSP-based heuristic. With and without this initialization, the proposed MPC approach clearly outperforms a naive MPC formulation, as demonstrated in a small simulation study.</description>

      <title>Identification of Power Systems with Droop-Controlled Units Using Neural Ordinary Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In future power systems, the detailed structure and dynamics may not always be fully known. This is due to an increasing number of distributed energy resources, such as photovoltaic generators, battery storage systems, heat pumps and electric vehicles, as well as a shift towards active distribution grids. Obtaining physically-based models for simulation and control synthesis can therefore become challenging. Differential equations, where the right-hand side is represented by a neural network, i.e., neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), have a great potential to serve as a data-driven black-box model to overcome this challenge. This paper explores their use in identifying the dynamics of droop-controlled grid-forming units based on inputs and state measurements. In numerical studies, various NODE structures used with different numerical solvers are trained and evaluated. Moreover, they are compared to the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) method. The results demonstrate that even though SINDy yields more accurate models, NODEs achieve good prediction performance without prior knowledge about the system's nonlinearities which SINDy requires to work best.</description>

      <title>Recommender systems and reinforcement learning for building control and occupant interaction: A text-mining driven review of scientific literature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The indoor environment greatly affects health and well-being; enhancing health and reducing energy use in these settings is a key research focus. With advancing Information and Communication Technology (ICT), recommendation systems and reinforcement learning have emerged as promising methods to induce behavioral changes that improve indoor environments and building energy efficiency. This study employs text-mining and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to examine these approaches in building control and occupant interaction. Analyzing approximately 27,000 articles from the ScienceDirect database, we found extensive use of recommendation systems and reinforcement learning for space optimization, location recommendations, and personalized control suggestions. Despite broad applications, their use in optimizing indoor environments and energy efficiency is limited. Traditional recommendation algorithms are commonly used, but optimizing indoor conditions and energy efficiency often requires advanced machine learning techniques like reinforcement and deep learning. This review highlights the potential for expanding recommender systems and reinforcement learning applications in buildings and indoor environments. Areas for innovation include predictive maintenance, building-related product recommendations, and optimizing environments for specific needs like sleep and productivity enhancements based on user feedback.</description>

      <title>Logic-based Knowledge Awareness for Autonomous Agents in Continuous Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a step towards a formal controller design method for autonomous agents based on knowledge awareness to improve decision-making. Our approach is to first create an organized repository of information (a knowledge base) for autonomous agents which can be accessed and then translated into temporal specifications. Secondly, to develop a controller with formal guarantees that meets a combination of mission-specific objective and the specification from the knowledge base, we utilize an abstraction-based controller design (ABCD) approach, capable of managing both nonlinear dynamics and temporal requirements. Unlike the conventional offline ABCD approach, our method dynamically updates the controller whenever the knowledge base prompts changes in the specifications. A three-dimensional nonlinear car model navigating an urban road scenario with traffic signs and obstacles is considered for validation. Results show the effectiveness of the method in guiding the autonomous agents to the target while complying with the knowledge base and the mission-specific objective.</description>

      <title>AI-Enhanced Inverter Fault and Anomaly Detection System for Distributed Energy Resources in Microgrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) into power distribution systems has made microgrids foundational to grid modernization. These DERs, connected through power electronic inverters, create power electronics dominated grid architecture, introducing unique challenges for fault detection. While external line faults are widely studied, inverter faults remain a critical yet underexplored issue. This paper proposes various data mining techniques for the effective detection and localization of inverter faults-essential for preventing catastrophic grid failures. Furthermore, the difficulty of differentiating between system anomalies and internal inverter faults within Power Electronics-Driven Grids (PEDGs) is addressed. To enhance grid resilience, this work applies advanced artificial intelligence methods to distinguish anomalies from true internal faults, identifying the specific malfunctioning switch. The proposed FaultNet-ML methodology is validated on a 9-bus system dominated by inverters, illustrating its robustness in a PEDG environment.</description>

      <title>Segmentized quarantine policy for managing a tradeoff between containment of infectious disease and social cost of quarantine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By the end of 2021, COVID-19 had spread to over 230 countries, with over 5.4 million deaths. To contain its spread, many countries implemented non-pharmaceutical interventions, notably contact tracing and self-quarantine policies. However, these measures came with significant social costs, highlighting the need for more sustainable approaches that minimize disruptions to economic and societal activities. This research explores a segmentized quarantine policy, applying different quarantine measures for various population segments to better balance the benefits and costs of containment. Different groups, like students versus working adults, have distinct societal activity patterns, posing varied risks for disease spread. We define segmentized quarantine policy across two dimensions-contact tracing range and quarantine period-and optimize these parameters for each segment to minimize total infection cases and quarantine days. Using an Agent-Based Epidemic Simulation and an Evolutionary Algorithm to derive the Pareto front, we demonstrate that segmentized policies can be more effective than uniform policies, with specific segments benefiting from tailored measures. The findings support segmentized quarantine as a viable, efficient, and sustainable approach, offering a valuable framework for public health policy in future pandemics.</description>

      <title>Visual Tracking with Intermittent Visibility: Switched Control Design and Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of visual target tracking in scenarios where a pursuer may experience intermittent loss of visibility of the target. The design of a Switched Visual Tracker (SVT) is presented which aims to meet the competing requirements of maintaining both proximity and visibility. SVT alternates between a visual tracking mode for following the target, and a recovery mode for regaining visual contact when the target falls out of sight. We establish the stability of SVT by extending the average dwell time theorem from switched systems theory, which may be of independent interest. Our implementation of SVT on an Agilicious drone [1] illustrates its effectiveness on tracking various target trajectories: it reduces the average tracking error by up to 45% and significantly improves visibility duration compared to a baseline algorithm. The results show that our approach effectively handles intermittent vision loss, offering enhanced robustness and adaptability for real-world autonomous missions. Additionally, we demonstrate how the stability analysis provides valuable guidance for selecting parameters, such as tracking speed and recovery distance, to optimize the SVT's performance.</description>

      <title>Clutter-Aware Target Detection for ISAC in a Millimeter-Wave Cell-Free Massive MIMO System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the performance of an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system within a cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system. Each access point (AP) operates in the millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequency band. The APs jointly serve the user equipments (UEs) in the downlink while simultaneously detecting a target through dedicated sensing beams, which are directed toward a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). Although the AP-RIS, RIS-target, and AP-target channels have both line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) parts, it is assumed only knowledge of the LoS paths is available. A key contribution of this study is the consideration of clutter, which degrades the target detection if not handled. We propose an algorithm to alternatively optimize the transmit power allocation and the RIS phase-shift matrix, maximizing the target signal-to-clutter-plus-noise ratio (SCNR) while ensuring a minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for the UEs. Numerical results demonstrate that exploiting clutter subspace significantly enhances detection probability, particularly at high clutter-to-noise ratios, and reveal that an increased number of transmit side clusters impair detection performance. Finally, we highlight the performance gains achieved using a dedicated sensing stream.</description>

      <title>Goal-oriented Semantic Communication for Robot Arm Reconstruction in Digital Twin: Feature and Temporal Selections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As one of the most promising technologies in industry, the Digital Twin (DT) facilitates real-time monitoring and predictive analysis for real-world systems by precisely reconstructing virtual replicas of physical entities. However, this reconstruction faces unprecedented challenges due to the everincreasing communication overhead, especially for digital robot arm reconstruction. To this end, we propose a novel goal-oriented semantic communication (GSC) framework to extract the GSC information for the robot arm reconstruction task in the DT, with the aim of minimising the communication load under the strict and relaxed reconstruction error constraints. Unlike the traditional reconstruction framework that periodically transmits a reconstruction message for real-time DT reconstruction, our framework implements a feature selection (FS) algorithm to extract the semantic information from the reconstruction message, and a deep reinforcement learning-based temporal selection algorithm to selectively transmit the semantic information over time. We validate our proposed GSC framework through both Pybullet simulations and lab experiments based on the Franka Research 3 robot arm. For a range of distinct robotic tasks, simulation results show that our framework can reduce the communication load by at least 59.5% under strict reconstruction error constraints and 80% under relaxed reconstruction error constraints, compared with traditional communication framework. Also, experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our framework, where the communication load is reduced by 53% in strict constraint case and 74% in relaxed constraint case.

      <title>A Link-Based Flow Model with Turn-Level Queue Transmission and Time-Varying Free-Flow Speed for Urban Road Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Macroscopic link-based flow models are efficient for simulating flow propagation in urban road networks. Existing link-based flow models described traffic states of a link with two state variables of link inflow and outflow and assumed homogeneous traffic states within a whole link. Consequently, the turn-level queue length change within the link can not be captured, resulting in underrepresented queue spillback. Moreover, a constant link free-flow speed was assumed to formulate models, restricting their applicability in modeling phenomena involving time-varying free-flow speed. This study proposed a new link-based flow model by introducing an additional state variable of link queue inflow and adapting the link outflow to be free-flow speed-dependent. In our model, the vehicle propagation within each link is described by the link inflow, queue inflow, and outflow, which depends on the link free-flow speed changes. A node model is further defined to capture the presence of signal control and potential queue spillback, which estimates the constrained flow propagation between adjacent road segments. Simulation experiments were conducted on a single intersection and a network with consecutive intersections to verify the proposed model performance. Results demonstrate the predictive power of the proposed model in predicting traffic operations of intersections with multiple turning movements and time-varying free-flow speed. Our model outperforms the baseline link-based flow model and preserves the computational tractability property of link-based flow models.</description>

      <title>Multi-Objective Complementary Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09521v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel multi-objective control framework for linear time-invariant systems in which performance and robustness can be achieved in a complementary way instead of a trade-off. In particular, a state-space solution is first established for a new stabilizing control structure consisting of two independently designed controllers coordinated with a Youla-type operator ${\bm Q}$. It is then shown by performance analysis that these two independently designed controllers operate in a naturally complementary way for a tracking control system, due to the coordination function of ${\bm Q}$ driven by the residual signal of a Luenberger observer. Moreover, it is pointed out that ${\bm Q}$ could be further optimized with an additional gain factor to achieve improved performance, through a data-driven methodology for a measured cost function.</description>

      <title>On-demand Cold Start Frequency Reduction with Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning in Serverless Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) is a cloud computing paradigm offering an event-driven execution model to applications. It features serverless attributes by eliminating resource management responsibilities from developers, and offers transparent and on-demand scalability of applications. To provide seamless on-demand scalability, new function instances are prepared to serve the incoming workload in the absence or unavailability of function instances. However, FaaS platforms are known to suffer from cold starts, where this function provisioning process introduces a non-negligible delay in function response and reduces the end-user experience. Therefore, the presented work focuses on reducing the frequent, on-demand cold starts on the platform by using Reinforcement Learning(RL). The proposed approach uses model-free Q-learning that consider function metrics such as CPU utilization, existing function instances, and response failure rate, to proactively initialize functions, in advance, based on the expected demand. The proposed solution is implemented on Kubeless and evaluated using an open-source function invocation trace applied to a matrix multiplication function. The evaluation results demonstrate a favourable performance of the RL-based agent when compared to Kubeless' default policy and a function keep-alive policy by improving throughput by up to 8.81% and reducing computation load and resource wastage by up to 55% and 37%, respectively, that is a direct outcome of reduced cold starts.</description>

      <title>Controlling Large Electric Vehicle Charging Stations via User Behavior Modeling and Stochastic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13224v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an Electric Vehicle Charging Station (EVCS) model that incorporates real-world constraints, such as slot power limitations, contract threshold overruns penalties, or early disconnections of electric vehicles (EVs). We propose a formulation of the problem of EVCS control under uncertainty, and implement two Multi-Stage Stochastic Programming approaches that leverage user-provided information, namely, Model Predictive Control and Two-Stage Stochastic Programming. The model addresses uncertainties in charging session start and end times, as well as in energy demand. A user's behavior model based on a sojourn-time-dependent stochastic process enhances cost reduction while maintaining customer satisfaction. The benefits of the two proposed methods are showcased against two baselines over a 22-day simulation using a real-world dataset. The two-stage approach demonstrates robustness against early disconnections by considering a wider range of uncertainty scenarios for optimization. The algorithm prioritizing user satisfaction over electricity cost achieves a 20% and 36% improvement in two user satisfaction metrics compared to an industry-standard baseline. Additionally, the algorithm striking the best balance between cost and user satisfaction exhibits a mere 3% relative cost increase compared to the theoretically optimal baseline - for which the nonanticipativity constraint is relaxed - while attaining 94% and 84% of the user satisfaction performance in the two used satisfaction metrics.</description>

      <title>Morphological Symmetries in Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15552v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive framework for studying and leveraging morphological symmetries in robotic systems. These are intrinsic properties of the robot's morphology, frequently observed in animal biology and robotics, which stem from the replication of kinematic structures and the symmetrical distribution of mass. We illustrate how these symmetries extend to the robot's state space and both proprioceptive and exteroceptive sensor measurements, resulting in the equivariance of the robot's equations of motion and optimal control policies. Thus, we recognize morphological symmetries as a relevant and previously unexplored physics-informed geometric prior, with significant implications for both data-driven and analytical methods used in modeling, control, estimation and design in robotics. For data-driven methods, we demonstrate that morphological symmetries can enhance the sample efficiency and generalization of machine learning models through data augmentation, or by applying equivariant/invariant constraints on the model's architecture. In the context of analytical methods, we employ abstract harmonic analysis to decompose the robot's dynamics into a superposition of lower-dimensional, independent dynamics. We substantiate our claims with both synthetic and real-world experiments conducted on bipedal and quadrupedal robots. Lastly, we introduce the repository MorphoSymm to facilitate the practical use of the theory and applications outlined in this work.</description>
