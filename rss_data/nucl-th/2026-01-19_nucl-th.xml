      <title>Fine-tunings in radiative $\alpha$-particle capture on $^{12}$C at astrophysical energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the fine-tuning of radiative alpha-particle capture on carbon, $\alpha(^{12}{\rm C},^{16}{\rm O})\gamma$, at astrophysical energies. Utilizing results from cluster effective field theory for this reaction, we find that the low-energy data of the astrophysical S-factor allow for only very small variations in the electromagnetic fine-structure constant $\alpha$, namely $|\delta \alpha/\alpha| \leq 0.2\,$ per mille, in both the $E1$ and the $E2$ radiative capture.</description>

      <title>Elliptic flow of charm quarks produced in the early stage of pA collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the build-up of elliptic flow of charm quarks produced in the early pre-equilibrium stage of high-energy proton--nucleus collisions. The initial stage is modeled within the Color Glass Condensate framework as an evolving glasma, initialized through the McLerran--Venugopalan model. Subnucleonic fluctuations have been implemented as constituent-quark hotspots for both the proton and the nuclear participants. Charm quarks are propagated in the evolving non-Abelian background by solving the relativistic Wong equations for their coordinates, momenta, and color charges. First, we compute the nuclear modification factor of charm quarks, finding a slight migration towards higher $p_T$ states in agreement with previous results in the literature. Then, we focus on the azimuthal anisotropies acquired through the interaction with glasma fields. We find that glasma-induced momentum anisotropies are efficiently transmitted to heavy quarks within $\tau \sim 0.4~\mathrm{fm/c}$, leading to a sizeable charm-quark $v_2$, with a magnitude that increases with the strength of the initial fields and with the number of nuclear participants. Remarkably, we show that the early-stage contribution alone can account for a significant fraction of the experimentally observed $J/\psi$ elliptic flow in p-Pb collisions, indicating that pre-hydrodynamic dynamics can play a non-negligible role in the final-state heavy-flavor collectivity, especially in small systems.</description>

      <title>From three-body resonances to bound states in a continuum: pole trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of three-body bound states in the continuum by tracing pole trajectories in the complex energy plane under variation of system parameters. Using a one-dimensional model of two identical bosons and a distinguishable particle interacting via Gaussian potentials, we systematically vary the interaction strength, interaction range, and mass ratio. Our results confirm the parametric nature of few-body bound states in a continuum (BIC) and extend this characterization to a broader set of system parameters. Specifically, we find that variations of both interaction parameters and the mass ratio can lead to the formation of at least one three-body BIC. However, the exact shape of trajectories differs, and for the mass ratio variation we find a more regular pattern with multiple BIC locations. These results suggest that the mechanism of few-body BIC formation is more sensitive to the kinematic structure of the problem than to the specific details of the two-body interaction.</description>

      <title>The unfinished picture of low-energy antineutron interactions: open issues and hints for future research possibilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This report examines the open questions that remain unsolved following the measurements with antineutrons ($\bar n$) as probes conducted up to the 1990s at the LEAR facility at CERN. It also presents suggestions for possible new experiments at a future, upgraded AD complex, which can potentially provide access to new areas of physics.</description>

      <title>Role of $\Sigma^*(1385)$ on $\Lambda$ hyperon polarization in relativistic heavy ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effect of $\Sigma^*(1385)$ baryon resonance on the time evolution of the $\Lambda$ hyperon polarization in hadronic matter is studied using a kinetic approach. This approach explicitly includes the production of the $\Sigma^*$ resonance from the $\Lambda-\pi$ and $\Sigma(1192)-\pi$ scatterings as well as its decay into $\Lambda+\pi$ or $\Sigma+\pi$. The resulting coupled kinetic equations governing the time evolution of $\Lambda$, $\Sigma$ and $\Sigma^*$ numbers and polarizations are solved for Au-Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=7.7$ GeV and 20-50\% centrality, using initial values determined by thermal yields and the thermal vorticity at chemical freeze-out temperature. As the hadronic matter expands and cools, the $\Lambda$ polarization is found to increase slightly during early times and then decreases very slowly afterwards, while the $\Sigma$ polarization remains nearly constant and the $\Sigma^*$ polarization continuously decreases. Including feed-down contributions to the $\Lambda$ polarization from the decays of partially polarized $\Sigma^0$, $\Sigma^*$, and $\Xi(1322)$ hyperons, where the $\Xi$ polarization is obtained by solving coupled kinetic equations for the $\Xi$ and $\Xi^*(1532)$ system, the resulting $\Lambda$ polarization becomes smaller and decreases over time. In both cases, however, the time variation of the $\Lambda$ polarization is sufficiently small to support the assumption of an early freeze-out of $\Lambda$ spin degree of freedom in relativistic heavy ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Achieving angular-momentum conservation with physics-informed neural networks in computational relativistic spin hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) as a numerical solver for relativistic spin hydrodynamics and demonstrate that the total angular momentum, i.e., the sum of orbital and spin angular momentum, is accurately conserved throughout the fluid evolution by imposing the conservation law directly in the loss function as a training target. This enables controlled numerical studies of the mutual conversion between spin and orbital angular momentum, a central feature of relativistic spin hydrodynamics driven by the rotational viscous effect. We present two physical scenarios with a rotating fluid confined in a cylindrical container: one case in which initial orbital angular momentum is converted into spin angular momentum in analogy with the Barnett effect, and the opposite case in which initial spin angular momentum is converted into orbital angular momentum in analogy with the Einstein-de Haas effect. We investigate these conversion processes governed by the rotational viscous effect by analyzing the spacetime profiles of thermal vorticity and spin potential. Our PINNs-based framework provides the first numerical evidence for spin-orbit angular momentum conversion with fully nonlinear computational relativistic spin hydrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Total Gluon Helicity Contribution to the Proton Spin from Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a state-of-the-art lattice QCD calculation of the total gluon helicity contribution to the proton spin, $\Delta G$. The calculation is done on ensembles with three different lattice spacings $a=\{0.08, 0.09, 0.11\}$ fm. By employing distillation and momentum smearing for proton external states, we extract the bare matrix elements of the topological current $K^\mu$ using 5-HYP smeared Coulomb gauge fixing configurations. Furthermore, we apply a non-perturbative $\mathrm{RI/MOM}$ renormalization scheme augmented by the Cluster Decomposition Error Reduction (CDER) technique to determine the renormalization constants of $K^\mu$. The results obtained from different components $K^{t,i}$ (with $i$ being the direction of proton momentum or polarization) are consistent with Lorentz covariance within uncertainties. After extrapolating to the continuum limit, $\Delta G$ is found to be $\Delta G = 0.231(17)^{\mathrm{sta.}}(44)^{\mathrm{sym.}}$ at the $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ scale ${\mu}^2=10\ \mathrm{GeV}^2$, which constitutes approximately $46(9)\%$ of the proton spin.</description>
