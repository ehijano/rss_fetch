      <title>The potential of Brillouin Spectroscopy for investigating the mechanical properties of hydrogels during dehydration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrogels are attractive and versatile gel-based structures consisting of three-dimensional networks of hydrophilic polymers with unique properties that can retain a large amount of water and be tailor-designed according to specific requirements, and thus, suitable for numerous commercial areas (i.e., medicine, agriculture, electronics, cosmetics, etc.). However, since these materials can be very soft and flexible, mechanical characterization is challenging. This study explores the mechanical properties of a cellulose-based hydrogel using the optical, non-contact technique Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy (BLS). Two differently dried hydrogel samples were investigated and pre-characterized for their morphology by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and their mechanical performance by tensile testing. Then, BLS spectra were recorded to characterize the material's stiffness, indicating that the structural arrangement of the material due to the drying procedure (the density) is the main factor limiting the material's strength. By further analyzing the effect of moisture and the changes during drying, we characterize the mechanical behavior of organic hydrogel films and sponges and their dehydration evolution to understand the liquid-solid transition.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear van der Waals metasurfaces with resonantly enhanced light generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient nonlinear wave mixing is of paramount importance for a wide range of applications. However, weak optical nonlinearities pose significant challenges for accessing nonlinear light-matter interaction in compact systems. Here, we experimentally study second harmonic generation in deeply subwavelength 3R-MoS2 metasurfaces (&lt;\lambda/13 thick). Our measurements, supported by theoretical analysis, reveal a complex interplay and coupling between geometric resonances, optical extinction, and strong nonlinear susceptibility dispersion near excitons. We further demonstrate &gt;150-fold enhancement in second harmonic signal at 740 nm driven by the A exciton resonance. Additionally, our theoretical studies predict an enhancement of more than 10^6 in second harmonic generation in &lt;100 nm thick structures exhibiting bound states in the continuum resonance. These findings provide insight into accessing and harnessing the unprecedented 3R-MoS2 nonlinearities at a subwavelength scale, paving the way for ultracompact nonlinear photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient Cryogenic Ternary Content Addressable Memory using Ferroelectric SQUID</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ternary content addressable memories (TCAMs) are useful for certain computing tasks since they allow us to compare a search query with a whole dataset stored in the memory array. They can also unlock unique advantages for cryogenic applications like quantum computing, high-performance computing, and space exploration by improving speed and energy efficiency through parallel searching. This paper explores the design and implementation of a cryogenic ternary content addressable memory based on ferroelectric superconducting quantum interference devices (FeSQUIDs). The use of FeSQUID for designing the TCAM provides several unique advantages. First, we can get binary decisions (zero or non-zero voltage) for matching and mismatching conditions without using any peripheral circuitry. Moreover, the proposed TCAM needs ultra-low energy (1.36 aJ and 26.5 aJ average energy consumption for 1-bit binary and ternary search, respectively), thanks to the use of energy-efficient SQUIDs. Finally, we show the efficiency of FeSQUID through the brain-inspired application of Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC). Here, the FeSQUID-based TCAM implements the associative memory to support the highly parallel search needed in the inference step. We estimate an energy consumption of 89.4 fJ per vector comparison using a vector size of 10,000 bits. We also compare the FeSQUID-based TCAM array with the 5nm FinFET-based cryogenic SRAM-based TCAM array and observe that the proposed FeSQUID-based TCAM array consumes over one order of magnitude lower energy while performing the same task.</description>

      <title>Hole Capture-Structural Relaxation Mechanism of Defect Generation in Ionizing-irradiated $a$-SiO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The permanent ionization damage of semiconductor devices in harsh radiation environments stems from $E'_\gamma$ defect centers generation in the $a$-SiO$_2$ dielectric or isolation layers, but the long-standing "hole transport-trapping" generation mechanism encounters dilemmas to explain recent experiments. In this work, we propose a new "hole capture-structural relaxation" (HCSR) mechanism, based on spin-polarized first-principles calculations of oxygen vacancies ($V_{\rm O}$'s) in $a$-SiO$_2$. It is found that due to an electronic metastability caused by the localization of defect electronic states, the previously suggested puckered precursor, $V_{O\gamma}$, cannot exist in $a$-SiO$_2$, and the $E'_\gamma$ centers can arise from a structural relaxation of dimer $V_{O\delta}$ after nonradiative capture of irradiation-induced valence band holes. We demonstrate that, such an HCSR mechanism can consistently explain the basic but puzzling temperature and electric-field dependences in recent experiments. Moreover, by using reaction rate theory, we derive an analytical formula to uniformly describe the sublinear experimental data over a wide dose and temperature range. This work not only provides a rationale for defect generation in ionizing-irradiated $a$-SiO$_2$, but also offer a general approach to understanding the irradiation physics in alternative dielectrics and wide-band gap semiconductors with intrinsic electronic metastability.</description>

      <title>An experimental demonstration of neuromorphic sensing of chemical species using electro-optical reservoir computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A chemical discrimination system based on photonic reservoir computing is demonstrated experimentally for the first time. The system is inspired by the way humans perceive and process visual sensory information. The electro-optical reservoir computing system is a photonic analogue of the human nervous system with the read-out layer acting as the 'brain', and the sensor that of the human eye. A task-specific optimisation of the system is implemented, and the performance of the system for the discrimination between three chemicals is presented. The results are compared to the previously published numerical simulation. This publication provides a feasibility assessment and a demonstration of a practical realisation of photonic reservoir computing for a new neuromorphic sensing system - the next generation sensor with a built-in 'intelligence' which can be trained to 'understand' and to make a real time sensing decision based on the training data.</description>

      <title>Disruptive Forces in Metamaterial Tweezers for Trapping 20 nm Nanoparticles Based on Molecular Graphene Quantum Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17307v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, plasmonic optical tweezers have been used to trap nanoparticles and study interactions with their environment. An unavoidable challenge is the plasmonic heating due to resonant excitation and the resulting temperature rise in the surrounding environment. In this work, we demonstrate trapping of custom-synthesized 20 nm nanoparticles based on molecular graphene quantum dots using metamaterial plasmonic tweezers. Superior trap stiffness values as high as 8.8 (fN/nm)/(mW/$\mu\mbox{m}^2$) were achieved with optical intensities lower than 1 mW/$\mu\mbox{m}^2$. By gradually increasing the laser intensity we identified a critical value beyond which the stiffness values dropped significantly. This value corresponded to a temperature rise of about 16$^o$C, evidently sufficient to create thermal flows and disrupt the trapping performance. We, therefore, identified a safe intensity regime for trapping nanoparticles without unwanted heat. Our platform can be used for efficient nanopositioning of fluorescent particles and quantum emitters in an array configuration, potentially acting as a single-photon source configuration.</description>
