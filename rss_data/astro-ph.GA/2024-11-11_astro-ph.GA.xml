      <title>Prograde and retrograde stars in nuclear cluster mergers. Evolution of the supermassive black hole binary and the host galactic nucleus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the orbital distribution of stars in merging nuclear star clusters (NSCs) and the subsequent effects on supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) evolution. We ran direct-summation $N$-body simulations with different initial conditions to do a detailed study of the resulting NSC after their progenitors had merged. Our findings reveal that prograde stars form a flattened structure, while retrograde stars have a more spherical distribution. The axial ratios of the prograde component vary based on the presence and mass ratio of the SMBHs. The fraction of prograde and retrograde stars depends on the merger orbital properties and the SMBH mass ratio. The interactions of retrograde stars with the SMBHB affect the eccentricity and separation evolution of the binary. Our analysis reveals a strong correlation between the angular momentum and eccentricity of the SMBH binary. This relationship could serve as a means to infer information about the stellar dynamics surrounding the binary. We find that prograde orbits are particularly close to the binary of SMBHs, a promising fact regarding extreme mass ratio inspiral (EMRI) production. Moreover, prograde and retrograde stars have different kinematic structures, with the prograde stars typically rotating faster than the retrograde ones. The line-of-sight velocity and velocity dispersion, as well as the velocity anisotropy of each NSC, depend on the initial merger orbital properties and SMBH mass ratios. The prograde and retrograde stars always show different behaviours. The distribution of stellar orbits and the dynamical properties of each kinematic population can potentially be used as a way to tell the properties of the parent nuclei apart, and has an important impact on expected rates of EMRIs, which will be detected by future gravitational wave observatories such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA).

      <title>A hidden Active Galactic Nuclei population: the first radio luminosity functions constructed by physical process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Both star formation (SF) and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) play an important role in galaxy evolution. Statistically quantifying their relative importance can be done using radio luminosity functions. Until now these relied on galaxy classifications, where sources with a mixture of radio emission from SF and AGN are labelled as either a star-forming galaxy or an AGN. This can cause the misestimation of the relevance of AGN. Brightness temperature measurements at 144 MHz with the International LOFAR telescope can separate radio emission from AGN and SF. We use the combination of sub-arcsec and arcsec resolution imaging of 7,497 sources in the Lockman Hole and ELAIS-N1 fields to identify AGN components in the sub-arcsec resolution images and subtract them from the total flux density, leaving flux density from SF only. We construct, for the first time, radio luminosity functions by physical process, either SF or AGN activity, revealing a hidden AGN population at $L_{\textrm{144MHz}}$$&lt;10^{24}$ W$\,$Hz$^{-1}$ . This population is 1.56$\pm$0.06 more than expected for $0.5&lt;z&lt;2.0$ when comparing to RLFs by galaxy classification. The star forming population has only 0.90$\pm$0.02 of the expected SF. These 'hidden' AGN can have significant implications for the cosmic star formation rate and kinetic luminosity densities.</description>

      <title>Can AGN activity be enhanced by ram pressure stripping? -- X-ray perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ram pressure stripping (RPS) is an important process that plays a significant role in shaping the evolution of cluster galaxies and their surrounding environment. Despite its recognized significance, the potential connection between RPS and AGN activity in cluster galaxies remains poorly understood. Recent claims, based on optical emission line diagnostics, have suggested such a connection. Here, we investigate this relationship from an X-ray perspective using a sample of galaxies undergoing RPS in four nearby galaxy clusters - A1656, A1367, A426, and A3627. This study is the first to test such a connection from an X-ray standpoint. Our analysis reveals no signs of enhanced X-ray AGN activity in our sample, with most RPS galaxies ($\sim$ $90\%$) showing X-ray luminosities below $10^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in their central point sources. Moreover, there is no noticeable difference in X-ray AGN activity among RPS galaxies compared to a control sample of non-RPS galaxies, as demonstrated by similar X-ray luminosities observed in their central point sources. While the most luminous X-ray AGN in our sample is found in ESO 137-002, a galaxy undergoing RPS in A3627, there is no evidence for a widespread enhancement of X-ray AGN activity due to RPS. Given the limited sample size of our study, this could also indicate that either the X-ray AGN enhancement from RPS is at most weak, or the timescale for the X-ray AGN enhancement is short. This emphasizes the need for further investigations with larger X-ray samples to better understand the impact of RPS on AGN activity in cluster galaxies.</description>

      <title>Are Models of Strong Gravitational Lensing by Clusters Converging or Diverging?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasingly large numbers of multiple images in cluster-scale gravitational lenses have allowed for tighter constraints on the mass distributions of these systems. Most lens models have progressed alongside this increase in image number. The general assumption is that these improvements would result in lens models converging to a common solution, suggesting that models are approaching the true mass distribution. To test whether or not this is occurring, we examine a sample of lens models of MACS J0416.1$-$2403 containing varying number of images as input. Splitting the sample into two bins (those including $&lt;150$ and $&gt;150$ images), we quantify the similarity of models in each bin using three comparison metrics, two of which are novel: Median Percent Difference, Frechet Distance, and Wasserstein Distance. In addition to quantifying similarity, the Frechet distance metric seems to also be an indicator of the mass sheet degeneracy. Each metric indicates that models with a greater number of input images are no more similar between one another than models with fewer input images. This suggests that lens models are neither converging nor diverging to a common solution for this system, regardless of method. With this result, we suggest that future models more carefully investigate lensing degeneracies and anomalous mass clumps (mass features significantly displaced from baryonic counterparts) to rigorously evaluate their model's validity. We also recommend further study into alternative, underutilized lens model priors (e.g. flux ratios) as an additional input constraint to image positions in hopes of breaking existing degeneracies.</description>

      <title>Dark-matter central density, annihilation J-factor and decay D-factor of the Fornax, Sculptor and Leo I dwarf spheroidal galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) satellites of the Milky Way (MW) are nearby astrophysical laboratories to study the nature of dark matter (DM). We present some properties of the DM halos of the three classical dSphs Fornax, Sculptor and Leo I, obtained using dynamical models based on distribution functions depending on the action integrals. In particular, we report accurate estimates of their central DM density rho150 (measured at a distance of 150 pc from the galaxy centre), which is relevant for galaxy formation studies and for models of self-interacting DM, and their DM annihilation J-factor and decay D-factor, which are key tools for indirect DM detection experiments. Among these three galaxies, Fornax has the highest J- and D- factors (but the lowest rho150), while Leo I has the highest rho150 (but the lowest J- and D- factors).</description>

      <title>Strong progenitor age bias in supernova cosmology. I. Robust and ubiquitous evidence from a larger sample of host galaxies in a broader redshift range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) serve as the most crucial standardizable candles in cosmology, providing direct measurements of the universe's expansion history. However, it is well-known that the post-standardization brightness of SNe Ia is influenced by the properties of their host galaxies, such as mass and star formation rate, both of which are closely related to progenitor age. In this study, we reaffirm the ubiquitous and robust correlation between SN Ia luminosity and host age, showing that this host property dependence arises primarily from stellar population age of the host galaxy. This analysis was conducted using an expanded sample of over 300 hosts across a broad redshift range up to $z \sim 0.4$, ensuring sufficient statistical significance of the result. To quantify the relationship between host age and Hubble residual (HR), we employed two linear regression techniques: LINMIX, which assumes a Gaussian error, and Bayesian hierarchical linear regression, which utilizes a full posterior for the age error. Both models demonstrate a robust correlation between host age and HR, with high statistical significance approaching $5.5 \sigma$. While our new regression analyses yield the slopes that are similar or slightly shallower compared to our previous results, the significance of these slopes has notably increased. These findings robustly validate our previous suggestions that post-standardization SN Ia luminosity varies with progenitor age, which is currently not properly accounted for in SN cosmology.</description>

      <title>Self-gravitating isothermal sphere in an expanding background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatially homogeneous thermal equilibria of self-gravitating gas, being impossible otherwise, are nevertheless allowed in an expanding background accounting for Universe's expansion. Furthermore, a fixed density at the boundary of a perturbation is a natural boundary condition keeping the mass finite inside without the need to invoke any unphysical walls.These facts allow us to develop a consistent gravitational thermodynamics of isothermal spheres inside an expanding Universe. In the canonical and grand canonical ensembles we identify an instability for both homogeneous and inhomogeneous equilibria. We discuss a potential astrophysical application. If such an instability is triggered on baryonic gas at high redshift $z &gt; 137$ when the primary baryonic component, namely atomic hydrogen, was still thermally locked to the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation, then the corresponding destabilized gaseous clouds have baryonic mass $\geq 0.8\cdot 10^5 {\rm M}_\odot$ and radius $\geq 15{\rm pc}$.</description>

      <title>Probing the He II re-Ionization ERa via Absorbing C IV Historical Yield (HIERACHY) II: Project Design, Current Status, and Examples of Initial Data Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The He II reionization epoch is expected to take place at $z\sim3-5$. In this stage, the helium and metals in the inter-galactic medium (IGM) are further ionized with additional contributions from harder non-stellar sources, and some large-scale gravitationally bound systems approach virialization. The "Probing the He II re-Ionization ERa via Absorbing C IV Historical Yield (HIERACHY)" program utilizes high- and medium-resolution spectra of bright background quasars at $z\approx3.9-5.2$ to investigate Ly$\alpha$, C IV, and other metal absorption lines during this epoch. Additionally, we employ narrow-band imaging to search for Ly$\alpha$ emitters associated with C IV absorbers, alongside multi-wavelength observations to identify and study particularly intriguing cases. In this paper, we present the design of the HIERACHY program, its current status, major scientific goals, and examples of initial data products from completed Magellan/MIKE, MagE spectroscopy, and MDM imaging observations. We also provide a brief outlook on future multi-wavelength observations that may significantly impact the related science.</description>

      <title>Fate and detectability of rare gas hydride ions in Novae ejecta: A case study with Nova templates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HeH$^+$ was the first heteronuclear molecule to form in the metal-free Universe after the Big Bang. The molecule gained significant attention following its first circumstellar detection in the young and dense planetary nebula NGC 7027. We target some hydride ions associated with the noble gases (HeH$^+$, ArH$^+$, and NeH$^+$) to investigate their formation in a harsh environment like the novae outburst region. We use a photoionization modeling (based on the earlier published best-fitted physical parameters) of the moderately fast ONe type nova: QU Vulpeculae 1984 and CO type novae: RS Ophiuchi and V1716 Scorpii. Our steady-state modeling reveals a convincing amount of HeH$^+$, especially in the dense clump of RS Ophiuchi and V1716 Scorpii. The calculated upper limit of the surface brightness of HeH$^+$ transitions suggests that the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) could detect some of them, particularly in sources like RS Ophiuchi and V1716 Scorpii with similar physical and chemical conditions and evolution. It is to be clearly noted that the sources studied are used as templates, not as targets for observations. The detection of these lines could be useful for determining physical conditions in similar types of systems and validating our predictions based on new electron-impact rovibrational collisional data at temperatures up to 20,000 K.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Chemistry in the envelope of HOt CorinoS (ECHOS) II. The puzzling chemistry of isomers as revealed by the HNCS/HSCN ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observational detection of some metastable isomers in the interstellar medium with abundances comparable to those of the most stable isomer, or even when the stable isomer is not detected, highlights the importance of non-equilibrium chemistry. This challenges our understanding of the interstellar chemistry. We present a chemical study of isomers through the sulphur isomer pair HNCS and HSCN, since HSCN has been observed in regions where its stable isomer has not been detected, and the observed HNCS/HSCN ratio seems to significantly vary from cold to warm regions. We have used the Nautilus chemical code to model the formation and destruction paths of HNCS and HSCN in different astrochemical scenarios, and the time evolution of the HNCS/HSCN ratio. We have also analysed the influence of the environmental conditions on their chemical abundances. We present an observational detection of the metastable isomer HSCN in the Class I object B1-a, but not of the stable isomer HNCS, despite HNCS lying 3200 K lower in energy than HSCN. Our results show an HNCS/HSCN ratio sensitive to the gas temperature and the evolutionary time, with the highest values obtained at early stages (t&lt;10^4 yr) and low (Tg&lt;20 K) temperatures. The results suggest a different efficiency of the isomerisation processes depending on the source temperature. The progressive decrease of HNCS/HSCN with gas temperature at early evolutionary times indicates that this ratio may be used as a tracer of cold young objects. This work also demonstrates the key role of grain surface chemistry in the formation of the isomer pair HNCS and HSCN in cold regions, and the importance of the ions H2NCS+ and HNCSH+ in warm/hot regions. Since most of the interstellar regions where HSCN is detected are cold regions, a larger sample including sources characterised by high temperatures are needed to corroborate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Emission Line Velocity, Metallicity and Extinction Maps of the Small Magellanic Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical emission lines across the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) have been measured from multiple fields using the Australian National University (ANU) 2.3m telescope with the Wide-Field Spectrograph (WiFeS). Interpolated maps of the gas-phase metallicity, extinction, H$\alpha$ radial velocity and H$\alpha$ velocity dispersion have been made from these measurements. There is a metallicity gradient from the centre to the north of the galaxy of ~-0.095 dex/kpc with a shallower metallicity gradient from the centre to the south of the galaxy of ~-0.013 dex/kpc. There is an extinction gradient of ~-0.086 E(B-V)/kpc from the centre going north and shallower going from the centre to the south of ~-0.0089 E(B-V)/kpc. The SMC eastern arm has lower extinction than the main body. The radial velocity of the gas from the H$\alpha$ line and the HI line have been compared across the SMC. In general there is good agreement between the two measurements, though there are a few notable exceptions. Both show a region that has different radial velocity to the bulk motion of the SMC in the southern western corner by at least 16 kms$^{-1}$. The velocity dispersion from H$\alpha$ and HI across the SMC have also been compared, with the H$\alpha$ velocity dispersion usually the higher of the two. The eastern arm of the SMC generally has lower velocity dispersion than the SMC's main body. These measurements enable a detailed examination of the SMC, highlighting its nature as a disrupted satellite galaxy.</description>

      <title>Emergence of high-mass stars in complex fiber networks (EMERGE) V. From filaments to spheroids: the origin of the hub-filament systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identified as parsec-size, gas clumps at the junction of multiple filaments, hub-filament systems (HFS) play a crucial role during the formation of young clusters and high-mass stars. These HFS appear nevertheless to be detached from most galactic filaments when compared in the mass-length (M-L) phase-space. We aim to characterize the early evolution of HFS as part of the filamentary description of the interstellar medium. Combining previous scaling relations with new analytic calculations, we created a toy model to explore the different physical regimes described by the M-L diagram. Despite its simplicity, our model accurately reproduces several observational properties reported for filaments and HFS such as their expected typical aspect ratio ($A$), mean surface density ($\Sigma$), and gas accretion rate ($\dot{m}$). Moreover, this model naturally explains the different mass and length regimes populated by filaments and HFS, respectively. Our model predicts a dichotomy between filamentary ($A\geq 3$) and spheroidal ($A&lt;3$) structures connected to the relative importance of their fragmentation, accretion, and collapse timescales. Individual filaments with low accretion rates are dominated by an efficient internal fragmentation. In contrast, the formation of compact HFS at the intersection of filaments triggers a geometric phase-transition leading to the gravitational collapse of these structures at parsec-scales in $\sim$1Myr also inducing higher accretion rates.</description>

      <title>Studying Binary Systems in Omega Centauri with MUSE. I. Detection of Spectroscopic Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NGC 5139 ($\omega$ Cen), is the closest candidate of a Nuclear Star Cluster that has been stripped of its host galaxy in the Milky Way. Despite extensive studies through the last decades, many open questions about the cluster remain, including the properties of the binary population. In this study we use MUSE multi-epoch spectroscopy to identify binary systems in $\omega$ Cen. The observations span 8 years, with a total of 312 248 radial velocity measurements for 37 225 stars. Following the removal of known photometric variables, we identify 275 stars that show RV variations, corresponding to a discovery fraction of 1.4$\pm$0.1%. Using dedicated simulations, we find that our data is sensitive to 70$\pm$10% of the binaries expected in the sample, resulting in a completeness-corrected binary fraction of 2.1$\pm$0.4% in the central region of $\omega$ Cen. We find similar binary fractions for all stellar evolutionary stages covered by our data, the only notable exception being the blue straggler stars, which show an enhanced binary fraction. We also find no distinct correlation with distance from the cluster centre, indicating a limited amount of mass segregation within the half-light radius of $\omega$ Cen.</description>

      <title>Gas Dynamics in the Central Molecular Zone and its connection with the Galactic Bar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The innermost region of the Milky Way harbors the central molecular zone (CMZ). This region contains a large amount of molecular gas but a poor star formation rate considering the densities achieved by the gas in this region. We used the arepo code to perform a hydrodynamic and star formation simulation of the Galaxy, where a Ferrers bar was adiabatically introduced. During the stage of bar imposition, the bar strength excites density waves close to the inner Lindblad resonance guiding material toward the inner Galaxy, driving the formation of a ring that we qualitatively associate with the CMZ. During the simulation, we identified that the ring passes three main phases, namely: formation, instability, and quasi-stationary stages. During the whole evolution, and particularly in the quasi-stationary stage, we observe that the ring is associated with the x2 family of periodic orbits. Additionally, we found that most of the star formation occurs during the ring formation stage, while it drastically decreases in the instability stage. Finally, we found that when the gas has settled in a stable x2 orbit, the star formation takes place mostly after the dense gas passes the apocenter, triggering the conveyor-belt mechanism described in previous studies.</description>

      <title>First Identification and Chemical Modeling of New Thiol ($-$SH) Bearing Molecule in the Interstellar Medium: Dithioformic Acid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of complex organic molecules containing thiol ($-$SH) groups is essential in interstellar media because $-$SH plays an important role in the polymerization of amino acids (R-CH(NH$_{2}$)-COOH). Some quantum chemical studies have shown that there is a high chance of detecting the emission lines of dithioformic acid (HC(S)SH) in the highly dense and warm-inner regions of hot molecular cores and hot corinos. Therefore, we attempted to search for the emission lines of HC(S)SH toward the highly dense hot corino object NGC 1333 IRAS 4A using the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) band 7. We present the first detection of the rotational emission lines of the trans-conformer of dithioformic acid (t-HC(S)SH) toward the NGC 1333 IRAS 4A2. The column density and excitation temperature of the t-HC(S)SH toward NGC 1333 IRAS 4A2 are (2.63$\pm$0.32)$\times$10$^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ and 255$\pm$32 K, respectively. The fractional abundance of t-HC(S)SH with respect to H$_{2}$ is (2.53$\pm$0.68)$\times$10$^{-9}$. The column density ratio of t-HC(S)SH and t-HCOOH toward NGC 1333 IRAS 4A2 is 0.36$\pm$0.02. To understand the possible formation pathways of HC(S)SH, we computed a two-phase warm-up chemical model abundance of HC(S)SH using the gas-grain chemical code UCLCHEM. After chemical modeling, we claim that HC(S)SH is formed in NGC 1333 IRAS 4A2 via barrierless radical--radical reactions between CSSH and H on the grain surfaces.</description>

      <title>Strong Scatterings Invalidate Proposed Models of Enhanced TDE Rates in Post-Starburst Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stars wandering too close to supermassive black holes (SMBHs) can be ripped apart by the tidal forces of the black hole. Recent optical surveys have revealed that E+A galaxies are overrepresented by a factor $\sim $ 30, while green galaxies are overrepresented in both optical and infrared surveys. Different stellar models have been proposed to explain this Tidal Disruption Event (TDE) preference: ultra-steep stellar densities in the nuclear cluster, radial velocity anisotropies, and top-heavy Initial Mass Function (IMF). Here we explore these hypotheses in the framework of our revised loss cone theory that accounts for both weak and strong scattering, i.e., a scattering strong enough to eject a star from the nuclear cluster. We find that, when accounting for weak and strong scatterings, both ultra-steep densities and radial velocity anisotropies fail to explain the post-starburst preference of TDEs except when considering a high anisotropy factor together with a high SMBH mass and a shallow density profile of stellar mass black holes $\gamma_{\rm bh} =7/4$. Our findings hold when combining either model with top-heavy IMFs. Hence, new models to explain the post-starburst preference of TDEs are needed.</description>

      <title>KMT-2024-BLG-1044L: A sub-Uranus microlensing planet around a host at the star-brown dwarf mass boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analysed microlensing data to uncover the nature of the anomaly that appeared near the peak of the short-timescale microlensing event KMT-2024-BLG-1044. Despite the anomaly's brief duration of less than a day, it was densely observed through high-cadence monitoring conducted by the KMTNet survey. Detailed modelling of the light curve confirmed the planetary origin of the anomaly and revealed two possible solutions, due to an inner--outer degeneracy. The two solutions provide different measured planet parameters: $(s, q)_{\rm inner} = [1.0883 \pm 0.0027, (3.125 \pm 0.248)\times 10^{-4}]$ for the inner solutions and $(s, q)_{\rm outer} = [1.0327 \pm 0.0054, (3.350 \pm 0.316)\times 10^{-4}]$ for the outer solutions. Using Bayesian analysis with constraints provided by the short event timescale ($t_{\rm E} \sim 9.1$~day) and the small angular Einstein radius ($\theta_{\rm E}\sim 0.16$~mas for the inner solution and $\sim 0.10$~mas for the outer solutio), we determined that the lens is a planetary system consisting of a host near the boundary between a star and a brown dwarf and a planet with a mass lower than that of Uranus. The discovery of the planetary system highlights the crucial role of the microlensing technique in detecting planets that orbit substellar brown dwarfs or very low-mass stars.</description>

      <title>Microlensing Events in Five Years of Photometry from the Zwicky Transient Facility</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Microlensing has a unique advantage for detecting dark objects in the Milky Way, such as free-floating planets, neutron stars, and stellar-mass black holes. Most microlensing surveys focus on the Galactic bulge, where higher stellar density leads to a higher event rate. However, microlensing events in the Galactic plane have closer lenses and longer timescales, which leads to a greater chance of measuring microlens parallax, providing an additional constraint on the mass of the lens. This work searches for microlensing events in Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) Data Release 17 from 2018--2023 in the Galactic plane region. We find 124 high-confidence microlensing events and 54 possible events, all available online\footref{online_resources}. Thus, with two years of additional ZTF data in DR17, we have more than doubled the number of microlensing events (60) found in the previous three-year DR5 search. In the event selection, we use the efficient \texttt{EventFinder} algorithm to detect microlensing signals, which could be used for large datasets such as future ZTF data releases or data from the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). Using detection efficiencies of ZTF fields obtained from catalog-level simulations, we calculate the mean Einstein timescale to be $\langle t_\mathrm{E}\rangle=51.7\pm3.3$ days, smaller than previous results of the Galactic plane but within 1.5$\sigma$. We also calculate optical depths and event rates, although some caution is needed due to the use of visual inspection when creating our final sample. Spectroscopy of three possible candidates confirms their microlensing nature.</description>

      <title>JADES: Primaeval Lyman-$\mathrm{\alpha}$ emitting galaxies reveal early sites of reionisation out to redshift $z \sim 9$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $\require{mediawiki-texvc}$Given the sensitivity of the resonant Lyman-$\mathrm{\alpha}$ (Ly$\mathrm{\alpha}$) transition to absorption by neutral hydrogen, observations of Ly$\mathrm{\alpha}$ emitting galaxies (LAEs) have been widely used to probe the ionising capabilities of reionisation-era galaxies and their impact on the intergalactic medium (IGM). However, prior to JWST our understanding of the contribution of fainter sources and of ionised `bubbles' at earlier stages of reionisation remained uncertain. Here, we present the characterisation of three exceptionally distant LAEs at $z&gt;8$, newly discovered by JWST/NIRSpec in the JADES survey. These three similarly bright ($M_\text{UV} \approx -20\,\mathrm{mag}$) LAEs exhibit small Ly$\mathrm{\alpha}$ velocity offsets from the systemic redshift, $\Delta v_\mathrm{Ly\alpha} \lesssim 200\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, yet span a range of Ly$\mathrm{\alpha}$ equivalent widths ($15\,\AA$, $31\,\AA$, and $132\,\AA$). The former two show moderate Ly$\mathrm{\alpha}$ escape fractions ($f_\mathrm{esc,Ly\alpha} \approx 10\%$), whereas Ly$\mathrm{\alpha}$ escapes remarkably efficiently from the third ($f_\mathrm{esc,Ly\alpha} \approx 72\%$), which moreover is very compact (half-light radius of $90\pm10\,\mathrm{pc}$). We find these LAEs are low-mass galaxies dominated by very recent, vigorous bursts of star formation accompanied by strong nebular emission from metal-poor gas. We infer the two LAEs with modest $f_\mathrm{esc,Ly\alpha}$, one of which reveals evidence for ionisation by an active galactic nucleus, may have reasonably produced small ionised bubbles preventing complete IGM absorption of Ly$\mathrm{\alpha}$. The third, however, requires a $\sim 3\,\text{physical Mpc}$ bubble, indicating faint galaxies have contributed significantly. The most distant LAEs thus continue to be powerful observational probes into the earlier stages of reionisation.</description>

      <title>Dissecting the Interstellar Media of A Wolf-Rayet Galaxy at $z=2.76$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report JWST/NIRSpec observations of a star-forming galaxy at $z=2.76$, MACSJ1149-WR1. We securely detect two temperature-sensitive auroral lines, [SIII]6312 (7.4$\sigma$) and [OII]7320+7331 doublets (10$\sigma$), and tentatively [NII]5755 ($2.3\sigma$) for the first time in an individual galaxy at $z&gt;1$. We perform a detailed analysis of its interstellar media (ISM), and derive electron temperatures, various heavy element abundances (O/H, N/O, S/O, and Ar/O) in the hot ionized region, and the neutral fraction in the warm ionized region. MACSJ1149-WR1 shows a broad feature at the wavelength of HeII 4686, which consists of a broad ($\sim1000$km/s), blue-shifted ($\sim-110$km/s) line component. Taken together with its mildly elevated N/O abundance, we conclude that MACSJ1149-WR1 is experiencing a young starburst ($&lt;10$Myr), likely hosting a large number of Wolf-Rayet stars. None of its spectral features support the presence of AGN, including: $(i)$ the absence of broad components and velocity shifts in Hydrogen recombination lines, $(ii)$ low [FeII]${\rm 1.257 \mu m}$/Pa$\beta$ ratio, and $(iii)$ the absence of high-ionization lines. Our analysis using HeI lines reveals a higher electron temperature and a higher attenuation value, indicating that HeI may probe a smaller spatial scale than HI, presumably the region dominated by the aforementioned Wolf-Rayet stars. The star formation rates derived from various HeI lines broadly agree with those from Hydrogen recombination lines. We thus advocate that HeI can be an excellent, independent probe of multi-phase ISM in the era of JWST.</description>

      <title>Open Cluster Dynamics under the Influence of Outflow-Ambient Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13809v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stars with outflows impinging on ambient gas experience accelerations due to the gravitational feedback from the interaction morphology between the outflow and the ambient gas. Such ``negative dynamical friction'' (NDF), in contrast to the conventional ``dynamical friction'' (DF), is studied for its impact on the dynamics of open clusters (OCs) immersed in a uniform ambient gas. We modify the $N$-body integration code \rebound\ with both NDF and DF implemented according to the outflow conditions of each star in a consistently constructed OC. The evolution of stars is also involved in determining the gas-star interactions throughout their stellar lives. Compared to DF-only and gas-free models with identical initial conditions, the NDF-affected cluster is puffier and evaporates faster, as indicated by various diagnostics, including lower velocity dispersions and larger half-mass and half-light radii. Neutron stars with fast winds are expelled from the cluster due to their intensive NDF effect, even without the ``kicks'' by asymmetric supernovae. Exploration of parameter space confirms that the NDF effect is generally enhanced with higher ambient gas densities, in qualitative agreement with the expression of acceleration. Outflow-ambient interactions should be considered for the proper interpretation of the stellar dynamics evolution in clusters.</description>

      <title>Astrometric Jitter as a Detection Diagnostic for Recoiling and Slingshot Supermassive Black Hole Candidates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) can be ejected from their galactic centers due to gravitational wave recoil or the slingshot mechanism following a galaxy merger. If an ejected SMBH retains its inner accretion disk, it may be visible as an off-nuclear active galactic nucleus (AGN). At present, only a handful of offset AGNs that are recoil or slingshot candidates have been found, and none have been robustly confirmed. Compiling a large sample of runaway SMBHs would enable us to constrain the mass and spin evolution of binary SMBHs and study feedback effects of displaced AGNs. We adapt the method of varstrometry -- which was developed for Gaia observations to identify off-center, dual, and lensed AGNs -- in order to quickly identify off-nuclear AGNs in optical survey data by looking for an excess of blue versus red astrometric jitter. We apply this to the Pan-STARRS1 3$\pi$ Survey and report on five new runaway AGN candidates. We focus on ZTF18aajyzfv: a luminous quasar offset by 6.7 $\pm$ 0.2 kpc from an adjacent galaxy at $z$=0.224, and conclude after Keck LRIS spectroscopy and comparison to ASTRID simulation analogs that it is likely a dual AGN. This selection method can be easily adapted to work with data from the soon-to-be commissioned Vera C. Rubin Telescope Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). LSST will have a higher cadence and deeper magnitude limit than Pan-STARRS1, and should permit detection of many more runaway SMBH candidates.</description>

Abstract: Dynamical friction and stellar orbital motion in spiral galaxies with dark matter composed of ultralight bosons in the state of rotating Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) are studied. It is found that the dynamical friction force is significantly affected by the topological charge of the vortex structure of the BEC core with the strongest effect at distances near the galactic center. It is also shown that the ultralight dark matter self-interaction plays an important role in studying the dynamical friction.</description>

      <title>Ionising properties of galaxies in JADES for a stellar mass complete sample: resolving the cosmic ionising photon budget crisis at the Epoch of Reionisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use NIRCam imaging from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) to study the ionising properties of a sample of 15721 galaxies at $3 \leq z_{\rm{phot}} \leq 9$, 90\% complete in stellar mass down to log(M$_{\star}$/[M$_{\odot}$])$\approx 7.5$. Out of the full sample, 1620 of the galaxies have spectroscopic redshift measurements from the literature. We use the spectral energy distribution fitting code \texttt{Prospector} to fit all available photometry and infer galaxy properties. We find a significantly milder evolution of the ionising photon production efficiency (\xion\/) with redshift and UV magnitude than previously reported. Interestingly, we observe two distinct populations in \xion\/, distinguished by their burstiness (given by SFR$_{10}$/SFR$_{100}$). Both populations show the same evolution with $z$ and M$_{\rm{UV}}$, but have a different \xion\/ normalisation. We convolve the more representative $\log(\xi_{\rm{ion}} (z,\text{M}_{\rm{UV}}))$ relations (accounting for $\sim96$\% of the sample), with luminosity functions from literature, to place constraints on the cosmic ionising photon budget. By combining our results, we find that one of our models can match the observational constraints from the \lya\/ forest at $z\lesssim6$. We conclude that galaxies with M$_{\rm{UV}}$ between $-16$ and $-20$, adopting a reasonable escape fraction, can produce enough ionising photons to ionise the Universe, without exceeding the required ionising photon budget.</description>

      <title>A-SLOTH reveals the nature of the first stars</title>

Abstract: The first generation of stars (PopIII) are too dim to be observed directly and probably too short-lived to have survived for local observations. Hence, we rely on simulations and indirect observations to constrain the nature of the first stars. In this study, we calibrate the semi-analytical model A-SLOTH (Ancient Stars and Local Observables by Tracing Halos), designed for simulating star formation in the early Universe, using a likelihood function based on nine independent observables. These observables span Milky Way-specific and cosmologically representative variables, ensuring a comprehensive calibration process. This calibration methodology ensures that A-SLOTH provides a robust representation of the early Universe's star formation processes, aligning simulated values with observed benchmarks across a diverse set of parameters. The outcome of this calibration process is best-fit values and their uncertainties for 11 important parameters that describe star formation in the early Universe, such as the shape of the initial mass function (IMF) of PopIII stars or escape fractions of ionizing photons. Our best-fitting model has a PopIII IMF with a steeper slope, d$N$/d$M \propto M^{-1.77}$, than the log-flat models often proposed in the literature, and also relatively high minimum and maximum masses, $M_{\rm min} = 13.6$Msun and $M_{\rm max} = 197$Msun. However, we emphasize that the IMF-generating parameters are poorly constrained and, e.g., the IMF slope could vary from log-flat to Salpeter. We also provide data products, such as delay time distribution, bubble size distributions for ionizing and metal-enriched bubbles at high redshift, and correlation plots between all 11 input parameters. Our study contributes to understanding the formation of early stars through A-SLOTH and provides valuable insights into the intricate processes involved in the early Universe's star formation.</description>

      <title>Effects of Cloud Geometry and Metallicity on Shattering and Coagulation of Cold Gas, and Implications for Cold Streams Penetrating Virial Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Theory and observations reveal that the circumgalactic medium (CGM) and the cosmic web at high redshifts are multiphase, with small clouds of cold gas embedded in a hot, diffuse medium. A proposed mechanism is `shattering' of large, thermally unstable clouds into tiny cloudlets of size lshatter~min(cs*tcool). We study these processes using idealized numerical simulations of thermally unstable gas clouds. We expand upon previous works by exploring the effects of cloud geometry (spheres, streams, and sheets), metallicity, and the inclusion of an ionizing UV background. We find that `shattering' is triggered by clouds losing sonic contact and rapidly imploding, leading to a reflected shock which causes the cloud to re-expand and induces Richtmyer-Meshkov instabilities at its interface. After fragmentation the cloudlets experience a drag force from the surrounding hot gas, leading to recoagulation into larger clouds. We distinguish between `fast' and `slow' coagulation regimes, showing that sheets are always in the `fast' coagulation regime while streams and spheres have a maximum overdensity for rapid coagulation. The critical overdensity for spheres is smaller than for streams, such that the coagulation efficiency increases from spheres to streams to sheets. Surprisingly, lshatter does not appear to be a characteristic clump size even if it is well resolved. Rather, fragmentation continues until the grid scale with a mass distribution of N(&gt;m)~m^{-1}. We apply our results to the case of cold streams feeding massive (Mv&gt;10^{12}Msun) high-z (z&gt;2) galaxies from the cosmic web, finding that streams are likely to shatter upon entering the CGM through the virial shock. This could explain the large clumping factors and covering fractions of cold gas in the CGM around such galaxies, and may be related to galaxy quenching by preventing cold streams from reaching the central galaxy.

      <title>Symmetry in Hyper Suprime-Cam galaxy spin directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18884v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a Bayesian analysis of anisotropy in binary galaxy spin directions in the Hyper-Suprime Cam Data Release 3 catalogue, in response to a recent claim that it exhibits a dipole (Shamir 2024). We find no significant evidence for anisotropy, or for a direction-independent spin probability that differs from 0.5. These results are unchanged allowing for a quadrupole or simply searching for a fixed anisotropy between any two hemispheres, and the Bayes factor indicates decisive evidence for the isotropic model. Our principled method contrasts with the statistic employed by Shamir 2024, which lacks a strong theoretical foundation.</description>

      <title>The first catalog of candidate white dwarf-main sequence binaries in open star clusters: A new window into common envelope evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Close binary systems are the progenitors to both Type Ia supernovae and the compact object mergers that can be detected via gravitational waves. To achieve a binary with a small radial separation, it is believed that the system likely undergoes common envelope (CE) evolution. Despite its importance, CE evolution may be one of the largest uncertainties in binary evolution due to a combination of computational challenges and a lack of observed benchmarks where both the post-CE and pre-CE conditions are known. Identifying post-CE systems in star clusters can partially circumvent this second issue by providing an independent age constraint on the system. For the first time, we conduct a systematic search for white dwarf (WD) and main-sequence (MS) binary systems in 299 Milky Way open star clusters. Coupling Gaia DR3 photometry and kinematics with multi-band photometry from Pan-STARRS1 and 2MASS, we apply a machine learning based approach and find 52 high-probability candidates in 38 open clusters. For a subset of our systems, we present follow-up spectroscopy from the Gemini and Lick Observatories and archival light curves from TESS, Kepler/K2 and the Zwicky Transient Facility. Examples of M-dwarfs with hot companions are spectroscopically observed, along with regular system variability. While the kinematics of our candidates are consistent with their host clusters, some systems have spatial positions offset relative to their hosts, potentially indicative of natal kicks. Ultimately, this catalogue is a first step to obtaining a set of observational benchmarks to better link post-CE systems to their pre-CE progenitors.</description>

      <title>First Resolution of Microlensed Images of a Binary-Lens Event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13015v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We resolve the multiple images of the binary-lens microlensing event ASASSN-22av using the GRAVITY instrument of the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI). The light curves show weak binary perturbations, complicating the analysis, but the joint modeling with the VLTI data breaks several degeneracies, arriving at a strongly favored solution. Thanks to precise measurements of angular Einstein radius \theta_E = 0.724 +/- 0.002 mas and microlens parallax, we determine that the lens system consists of two M dwarfs with masses of M_1 = 0.258 +/- 0.008 M_sun and M_2 = 0.130 +/- 0.007 M_sun, a projected separation of r_\perp = 6.83 +/- 0.31 AU and a distance of D_L = 2.29 +/- 0.08 kpc. The successful VLTI observations of ASASSN-22av open up a new path for studying intermediate-separation (i.e., a few AUs) stellar-mass binaries, including those containing dark compact objects such as neutron stars and stellar-mass black holes.</description>

      <title>New Cold Subdwarf Discoveries from Backyard Worlds and a Metallicity Classification System for T Subdwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01378v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the results of a spectroscopic survey of candidate T subdwarfs identified by the Backyard Worlds: Planet 9 program. Near-infrared spectra of 31 sources with red $J-W2$ colors and large $J$-band reduced proper motions show varying signatures of subsolar metallicity, including strong collision-induced H$_2$ absorption, obscured methane and water features, and weak K I absorption. These metallicity signatures are supported by spectral model fits and 3D velocities, indicating thick disk and halo population membership for several sources. We identify three new metal-poor T subdwarfs ([M/H] $\lesssim$ $-$0.5), CWISE J062316.19+071505.6, WISEA J152443.14$-$262001.8, and CWISE J211250.11-052925.2; and 19 new "mild" subdwarfs with modest metal deficiency ([M/H] $\lesssim$ $-$0.25). We also identify three metal-rich brown dwarfs with thick disk kinematics. We provide kinematic evidence that the extreme L subdwarf 2MASS J053253.46+824646.5 and the mild T subdwarf CWISE J113010.07+313944.7 may be part of the Thamnos population, while the T subdwarf CWISE J155349.96+693355.2 may be part of the Helmi stream. We define a metallicity classification system for T dwarfs that adds mild subdwarfs (d/sdT), subdwarfs (sdT), and extreme subdwarfs (esdT) to the existing dwarf sequence. We also define a metallicity spectral index that correlates with metallicities inferred from spectral model fits and iron abundances from stellar primaries of benchmark T dwarf companions. This expansion of the T dwarf classification system supports investigations of ancient, metal-poor brown dwarfs now being uncovered in deep imaging and spectroscopic surveys.</description>
