      <title>Jordan-Wigner mapping between quantum-spin and fermionic Casimir effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Jordan-Wigner transformation connects spin operators in one-dimensional spin systems and fermionic operators. In this work, we elucidate the relationship between the finite-size corrections in the spin representation and the fermionic Casimir effect in the corresponding fermion representation. In particular, we focus on the ground-state energy of one-dimensional transverse-field Ising and XY models, and show that all finite-size corrections can be interpreted as lattice fermionic Casimir effects. We further find several types of Casimir phenomena, such as the conventional Casimir energy from massless fields, damping behavior from massive fields, vanishing behavior from flat or nonrelativistic bands, and oscillating behavior from the finite-density effect. Our findings establish a dictionary between finite-size corrections in spin chains and fermionic Casimir effects, and provide experimentally relevant platforms for the fermionic Casimir phenomena.</description>

      <title>Stacked quantum Ising systems and quantum Ashkin-Teller model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the quantum states of an isolated composite system consisting of two stacked quantum Ising (SQI) subsystems, coupled by a local Hamiltonian term that preserves the $Z_2$ symmetry of each subsystem. The coupling strength is controlled by an intercoupling parameter $w$, with $w=0$ corresponding to decoupled quantum Ising systems. We focus on the quantum correlations of one of the two SQI subsystems, $S$, in the ground state of the global system, and study their dependence on both the state of the weakly-coupled complementary part $E$ and the intercoupling strength. We concentrate on regimes in which $S$ develops critical long-range correlations. The most interesting physical scenario arises when both SQI subsystems are critical. In particular, for identical SQI subsystems, the global system is equivalent to the quantum Ashkin-Teller model, characterized by an additional $Z_2$ interchange symmetry between the two subsystem operators. In this limit, one-dimensional SQI systems exhibit a peculiar critical line along which the length-scale critical exponent $\nu$ varies continuously with $w$, while two-dimensional systems develop quantum multicritical behaviors characterized by an effective enlargement of the symmetry of the critical modes, from the actual $Z_2\oplus Z_2$ symmetry to a continuous O(2) symmetry.</description>

      <title>Moir\'e magnetism in a bilayer Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18955v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moir\'e patterns in magnetic bilayers generate spatially modulated interlayer exchange interactions that can give rise to nonuniform magnetic textures. We study a minimal classical bilayer Ising model with a moir\'e-modulated interlayer coupling, generated either by relative twist or differential strain between the layers. Using large-scale classical Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the ordering transition remains in the conventional two-dimensional Ising universality class, even when the low-temperature state is domain-textured. At low temperatures, we find a smooth crossover between a uniform ferromagnet and domain-textured state, in which the spins locally follow the sign of the interlayer exchange. We demonstrate that there is no breaking of layer symmetry for twisted bilayers. The location of the crossover is determined by a simple geometric energy balance between bulk interlayer exchange and intralayer domain-wall costs. Our results provide a minimal framework for understanding how moir\'e-modulated magnetic textures can emerge from geometric energetics without requiring a thermodynamic phase transition.</description>

      <title>Detecting the finer structure of the P vs NP problem with statistical mechanics: the case of the Wang tiling problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the idea that the P vs NP problem can have a finer structure. Given the NP complete problem of interest, the configurations space of the problem can be divided in (at least) two regions. In one region, polynomial algorithms to solve the NP complete problem of interest are available (and we discuss one possible realization inspire by the games of chess and go). In the second region the problem to find polynomial time algorithms is very similar to the problem to find polynomial time algorithms to determine the asymptotic behavior of discrete dynamical systems in the chaotic regime. We cannot exclude the existence of a third region which separates the first two: this region would have the characteristics of the edge of chaos. We focuss on the Wang tiling problem of an N X N square (with N large): here a Wang tiles set Gamma is an alphabet. We construct a statistical-physics inspired heuristic which allows to define good alphabets as the ones with a good thermodynamical behavior. For (a suitable subclass of) good alphabets we construct an algortihm which, in polynomial time, determines how to tile the N x N square. On the other hand, for bad alphabets, we observe a chaotic behavior. The Cook-Levin theorem advocate a similar pattern for all the NP-complete problems.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Multicanonical Sampling with Irreversibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flat-histogram Monte Carlo simulations are well-established, robust methods to perform random walks in a physical observable or parameter space, making them suitable for finding ground states or studying phase transitions in complex systems in statistical physics. However, their efficiency can be limited by the time to attain the desired flat distribution, which is generally unknown prior to the simulations. In particular, they might suffer from slowing down towards the end of a simulation due to the diffusive nature of random walks. In this work we apply irreversibility to the multicanonical Monte Carlo method via the lifting approach to alleviate this behavior. We achieve a 2-4 times speedup in ground-state search for a two-dimensional (2D) Ising model, and up to an order of magnitude of speedup for finding the ground-state energy in an Edwards-Anderson spin glass, compared to traditional multicanonical sampling. The round-trip times between ground states show a narrower distribution and are significantly shorter compared to the reversible counterpart, suggesting that a lower convergence time with a smaller time variance is feasible.</description>

      <title>Evidence of the de Almeida-Thouless transition in three-dimensional spin glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of spin-glass states in a magnetic field remains a major open problem in statistical physics. The existence of the de Almeida-Thouless (dAT) transition for three-dimensional (3D) spin glasses in a field is still debated. We introduce a new computational method to define the spin-glass susceptibility, which is robust against the broad tail in the overlap distribution that undermines conventional analyses. Applying this approach to the Edwards-Anderson spin-glass model in 2D and 3D, and contrasting with the 3D Ising (without disorder) and mean-field spin-glass models, we find a stark difference: the locus of susceptibility maxima bends to the right in the field-temperature plane for the Ising and 2D spin-glass cases, indicating a supercritical crossover line, but bends to the left for the mean-field and 3D spin glasses - a signature of the dAT line. Finite-size scaling further suggests that the peak susceptibility diverges with system size in 3D spin glasses under a field, while saturating in 2D. These results provide direct numerical evidence for the dAT transition in 3D, supporting the replica symmetry breaking scenario.</description>

      <title>Learning the Intrinsic Dimensionality of Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou Trajectories: A Nonlinear Approach using a Deep Autoencoder Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the intrinsic dimensionality (ID) of high-dimensional trajectories, comprising $n_s = 4\,000\,000$ data points, of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) $\beta$ model with $N = 32$ oscillators. To this end, a deep autoencoder (DAE) model is employed to infer the ID in the weakly nonlinear regime ($\beta \lesssim 1$). We find that the trajectories lie on a nonlinear manifold of dimension $m^{\ast} = 2$ embedded in a $64$-dimensional phase space. The DAE further reveals that this dimensionality increases to $m^{\ast} = 3$ at $\beta = 1.1$, coinciding with a symmetry breaking transition, in which additional energy modes with even wave numbers $k = 2, 4$ become excited. Finally, we discuss the limitations of the linear approach based on principal component analysis (PCA), which fails to capture the underlying structure of the data and therefore yields unreliable results in most cases.</description>

      <title>Effects of Dynamic Disorder on Diffusion in Rugged Energy Landscapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Established theoretical studies of diffusion in rugged (or rough) potential surfaces have largely focused on quenched energy landscapes. Here we study diffusion on a rugged energy landscape in the presence of dynamic disorder, a situation relevant to a wide range of disordered systems, including glasses, disordered solids, and biomolecular transport. For static (quenched) Gaussian disorder, Zwanzig derived a compact mean field expression for the diffusion constant, showing that increasing ruggedness leads to a sharp reduction of diffusive transport. Subsequent work demonstrated that in one-dimensional discrete lattices diffusion is further suppressed by rare but long-lived multi-site traps that lie beyond the mean-field description. In many physical systems, however, the local energy landscape is not frozen but fluctuates in time, there by modifying trap lifetimes and transport properties. In this work we develop a minimal, analytically tractable theory of diffusion on rugged energy landscapes with dynamic disorder by allowing site or barrier energies to fluctuate as dichotomic (telegraph) processes with given amplitude and flipping rate. Using a Kehr type formulation appropriate for discrete hopping processes, we derive an analytic expression for the diffusion constant in terms of mean waiting times. We show that dynamic disorder induces a continuous crossover from quasi-quenched, trap-dominated transport to an annealed, motional narrowing regime as the fluctuation rate increases. Explicit numerical calculations confirm this crossover, interpolating between rare-event-dominated diffusion and Zwanzig mean-field regime.</description>

      <title>Competing ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases on the frustrated Ising honeycomb lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ Ising model on the honeycomb lattice, featuring first- and second-neighbor ferromagnetic couplings ($J_1&gt;0$ and $J_2&gt;0$) and third-neighbor antiferromagnetic interactions ($J_3&lt;0$). Using the cluster mean-field method, we analyze the phase transitions in the regime $1/2 &lt; J_2/J_1 \le 1$, where ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases compete. Our results reveal that near the strongly frustrated limit $J_3/J_1 = -1$, the system exhibits order-by-disorder state selection, tricritical and bicritical behavior, critical endpoints, and two successive phase transitions. The ferromagnetic-paramagnetic transition remains second order across the entire interaction range, whereas the antiferromagnetic-paramagnetic boundary shows a richer behavior, including both first- and second-order transitions as well as tricriticality. Increasing the second-neighbor coupling $J_2/J_1$ narrows the range of $J_3/J_1$ where first-order antiferromagnetic-paramagnetic transitions occur; beyond a certain threshold, only second-order order-disorder transitions persist. Consequently, the tricritical point shifts toward $J_3/J_1 \approx -1$ as $J_2/J_1$ increases, culminating in a bicritical point where the antiferromagnetic, ferromagnetic, and paramagnetic phases meet.</description>

      <title>Anomalous transport in non-integrable classical field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomalous KPZ spin transport is well established in integrable non-Abelian lattice models but has not been investigated in continuum field theories as discretization in numerics generally break the continuum theory's integrability. We show that finite temperature acts as a regulator that can restore anomalous transport over a broad time window. In a family of spin field theories labeled by integer $n$, the $n = 1$ case is the Landau-Lifshitz model, whose numerical data shows spin superdiffusion with Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) scaling and, at lower temperature ballistic energy transport, whereas both observables are diffusive at high temperature. The non-integrable $n = 2$ case shows the same crossover. While Lyapunov analysis confirms the model's non-integrability, the structure of spin-density space-time profiles suggests that long-lived soliton-like trajectories exist at low temperature.</description>

      <title>Engineering discrete local dynamics in globally driven dual-species atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a method for engineering discrete local dynamics in globally-driven dual-species neutral atom experiments, allowing us to study emergent digital models through uniform analog controls. Leveraging the new opportunities offered by dual-species systems, such as species-alternated driving, our construction exploits simple Floquet protocols on static atom arrangements, and benefits of generalized blockade regimes (different inter- and intra-species interactions). We focus on discrete dynamical models that are special examples of Quantum Cellular Automata (QCA), and explicitly consider a number of relevant examples, including the kicked-Ising model, the Floquet Kitaev honeycomb model, and the digitization of generic translation-invariant nearest-neighbor Hamiltonians (e.g., for Trotterized evolution). As an application, we study chaotic features of discretized many-body dynamics that can be detected by leveraging only demonstrated capabilities of globally-driven experiments, and benchmark their ability to discriminate chaotic evolution.</description>

      <title>Phase Diagrams of Information Backflow: Unifying Entanglement Revivals and Entropy Overshoots in Minimal Non-Markovian Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Memory effects in non-Markovian dynamics are often diagnosed either via quantum-correlation revivals or via non-monotonic classical information measures, yet a unified minimal framework comparing their ``backflow phases'' is still lacking. Here we propose an information-backflow phase-diagram approach that places \emph{quantum entanglement revivals} and \emph{classical entropy overshoots} on the same footing through a common backflow functional $N_I=\int_{\dot I&gt;0}\dot I\,dt$. On the quantum side, we employ a fractional (Caputo) extension of a two-state dissipative model embedded by thermo-field dynamics (TFD), yielding a closed-form intrinsic entanglement component $b^{(\alpha)}_{qe}(t)=\frac14[E_\alpha(-\lambda^\alpha t^\alpha)]^2\sin^2(\omega t)$ and an integrated revival measure $N_{qe}$ that delineates a sharp boundary near $\alpha\simeq 1/2$ in the $(\alpha,\omega/\lambda)$ plane. On the classical side, we consider a three-state model whose Markov generator is promoted either to an exponential-kernel generalized master equation (with exact Markov embedding) or to a semi-Markov process with Erlang-2 waiting times. We quantify non-monotonicity by the entropy overshoot $\Delta H$ and KL-based diagnostics on the probability simplex. To strengthen the quantum--classical symmetry, we further introduce a \emph{fractional Mittag--Leffler memory kernel} in the classical dynamics and show that an analogous backflow transition emerges around $\alpha\simeq 1/2$, indicating that the boundary originates from the kernel's mathematical structure rather than from quantumness per se. Overall, our results provide a compact, model-agnostic route to classify non-Markovianity by phase diagrams of information backflow and to interpret them via a shared embedding narrative: memory stored in hidden degrees of freedom returns to the observed sector as non-monotonic information flow.</description>

      <title>Eigenstate condensation in quantum systems with finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random quantum states drawn from the Haar ensemble with a constraint on the energy expectation value $E_{\mathrm{av}} = \langle \psi | H | \psi\rangle$ display \textit{eigenstate condensation}: for $E_{\mathrm{av}}$ below a critical value $E_c$, they develop macroscopic overlap with the ground state. We study eigenstate condensation in systems with finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. These systems display three phases: a ground-state phase, in which energy-constrained random states have macroscopic overlap with the ground state; a high-temperature phase, in which they have exponentially small overlap with each energy eigenstate; and an anti-ground-state phase, in which they have macroscopic overlap with the most highly excited state. In local spin systems the ground-state and anti-ground-state phases approach the middle of the spectrum as $1/[\text{system size}]$, but -- because the condensation phase transitions have exponential, rather than polynomial, finite-size scaling -- the crossover becomes exponentially sharp in system size and the high-temperature phase is best understood as an extended phase.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Quantum Technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many challenges arising in Quantum Technology can be successfully addressed using a set of machine learning algorithms collectively known as reinforcement learning (RL), based on adaptive decision-making through interaction with the quantum device. After a concise and intuitive introduction to RL aimed at a broad physics readership, we discuss the key ideas and core concepts in reinforcement learning with a particular focus on quantum systems. We then survey recent progress in RL in all relevant areas. We discuss state preparation in few- and many-body quantum systems, the design and optimization of high-fidelity quantum gates, and the automated construction of quantum circuits, including applications to variational quantum eigensolvers and architecture search. We further highlight the interactive capabilities of RL agents, emphasizing recent progress in quantum feedback control and quantum error correction, and briefly discuss quantum reinforcement learning as well as applications to quantum metrology. The review concludes with a discussion of open challenges -- such as scalability, interpretability, and integration with experimental platforms -- and outlines promising directions for future research.

      <title>Emergent hydrodynamics of chiral active fluids: vortices, bubbles and odd diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starting from a microscopic multiparticle Langevin equation, we systematically derive a hydrodynamic description in terms of density and momentum fields for chiral active particles interacting via standard repulsive and nonlocal odd forces. These odd interactions are reciprocal but non-conservative: they are non-potential forces, as they act perpendicular to the vector joining any pair of particles. As a result, the torques that two particles exert on one another are non-reciprocal. The ensuing macroscopic continuum description consists of a continuity equation for the density and a generalized compressible Navier-Stokes equation for the fluid velocity. The latter includes a chirality-induced torque density term and an odd viscosity contribution. Our theory predicts the emergence of odd diffusivity, edge currents, and an inhomogeneous phase - characterized by bubble-like structures - recently observed in simulations. Specifically, the theory exhibits a linear instability arising from the interplay between odd viscosity and torque density, and admits steady-state inhomogeneous solutions featuring bubbles and vortices, in agreement with numerical simulations. Our findings can be tested experimentally in systems of granular spinners or rotating microorganisms suspended in a fluid.</description>

      <title>Approximate Decoherence, Recoherence and Records in Isolated Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the framework of decoherent histories, we study which past events leave detectable records in isolated quantum systems under the realistic assumption that decoherence is approximate and not perfect. In the first part we establish -- asymptotically for a large class of (pseudo-)random histories -- that the number of reliable records can be much smaller than the number of possible events, depending on the degree of decoherence. In the second part we reveal a clear decoherence structure for long histories based on a numerically exact solution of a random matrix model that, as we argue, captures generic aspects of decoherence. We observe recoherence between histories with a small Hamming distance, for localized histories admitting a high purity Petz recovery state, and for maverick histories that are statistical outliers with respect to Born's rule. From the perspective of the Many Worlds Interpretation, the first part -- which views the self-location problem as a coherent version of quantum state discrimination -- reveals a "branch selection problem", and the second part sheds light on the emergence of Born's rule and the theory confirmation problem.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium phase transitions in a racism-spreading model with interaction-driven dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Racism remains a persistent societal issue, increasingly amplified by the structure and dynamics of online social networks. In this work, we propose a three-state compartmental model to study the spreading and suppression of racist content, drawing from epidemic-like dynamics and interaction-driven transitions. We analyze the model on fully-connected (homogeneous mixing) networks using a set of coupled differential equations, and on Barab\'asi-Albert (BA) scale-free and Watts-Strogatz (WS) small-world networks through agent-based simulations. The system exhibits three distinct stationary regimes: two racism-free absorbing states and one active phase with persistent racist content. We identify and characterize the phase transitions between these regimes, discuss the role of network topology, and highlight the emergence of absorbing states. Our findings illustrate how statistical physics tools can help uncover the macroscopic consequences of microscopic social interactions in digital environments.</description>

      <title>Effective interactions in active Brownian particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report an approach to obtain effective pair potentials which describe the structure of two-dimensional systems of active Brownian particles. The pair potential is found by an inverse method, which matches the radial distribution function found from two different schemes. The inverse method, previously demonstrated via simulated equilibrium configurations of passive particles, has now been applied to a suspension of active particles. Interestingly, although active particles are inherently not in equilibrium, we still obtain effective interaction potentials which accurately describe the structure of the active system. Treating these effective potentials as if they were those of equilibrium systems, furthermore allows us to measure effective chemical potentials and pressures. Both the passive interactions and active motion of the active Brownian particles contribute to their effective interaction potentials.</description>

Abstract: Robust phases of matter, which remain stable under small perturbations, are of fundamental importance in statistical physics and quantum information. Recent advances in interactive quantum dynamics have led to renewed interest in out-of-equilibrium dynamical phases and associated phase transitions in both classical and quantum many-body systems. Motivated by these developments, we investigate whether a stable absorbing phase can exist in one-dimensional classical stochastic systems, with local update rules, in the presence of fluctuations. We study models with multiple absorbing states related by discrete symmetries, such as Z2 for two-state systems, and Z3 or S3 for three-state systems. In these models, domain walls perform random walks and coarsen under local rules, which, if perfect, eventually bring the system to an absorbing state in polynomial time. However, imperfect feedback can cause domain walls to branch, potentially leading to an opposing active phase. While two-state models exhibit a well-known transition between absorbing and active phases as the branching rate increases, in three-state models with only local dynamics, branching is a relevant perturbation, ruling out a robust absorbing phase under purely local rules. However, we discover that by incorporating nonlocal information into the feedback, the absorbing phase can be stabilized, with the transition between the active and absorbing phases belonging to a new universality class. Finally, we outline how these classical rules can be implemented using deterministic quantum circuits and discuss their connections to passive error correction.</description>

      <title>Exact Diagonalization, Matrix Product States and Conformal Perturbation Theory Study of a 3D Ising Fuzzy Sphere Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00842v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical studies of phase transitions in statistical and quantum lattice models provide crucial insights into the corresponding Conformal Field Theories (CFTs). In higher dimensions, comparing finite-volume numerical results to infinite-volume CFT data is facilitated by choosing the sphere $S^{d-1}$ as the spatial manifold. Recently, the fuzzy sphere regulator in Ref. [Zhu et al, Phys. Rev. X 13 021009 (2023)] has enabled such studies with exact rotational invariance, yielding impressive agreement with known 3D Ising CFT predictions, as well as new results. However, systematic improvements and a deeper understanding of finite-size corrections remain essential. In this work, we revisit the fuzzy sphere regulator, focusing on the original Ising model, with two main goals. First, we assess the robustness of this approach using Conformal Perturbation Theory (CPT), to which we provide a detailed guidebook. We demonstrate how CPT provides a unified framework for determining the critical point, the speed of light, and residual deviations from CFT predictions. Applying this framework, we study finite-size corrections and clarify the role of tuning the model in minimizing these effects. Second, we develop a novel method for extracting Operator Product Expansion (OPE) coefficients from fuzzy sphere data. This method leverages the sensitivity of energy levels to detuning from criticality, providing new insights into level mixing and avoided crossings in finite systems. Our work also includes validation of CPT in a 1+1D Ising model away from the integrable limit.</description>

Abstract: Fluctuating hydrodynamics provides a framework connecting mesoscopic fluctuations with macroscopic transport behavior. To bridge mesoscopic and macroscopic transport from microscopic dynamics, we introduce a wavenumber-dependent viscosity, defined via the equilibrium correlation of time-averaged Fourier components of the fine-grained shear stress field. Two-dimensional molecular dynamics simulations reveal its small-wavenumber divergence characteristic of the renormalized viscosity, while its large-wavenumber behavior determines the bare viscosity, thereby establishing a link between mesoscopic and macroscopic transport based on microscopic dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Driving a quantum system out of equilibrium while preserving its subtle quantum mechanical correlations on large scales presents a major challenge, both fundamentally and for technological applications. At its core, this challenge is pinpointed by the question of how quantum effects can persist at asymptotic scales, analogous to quantum critical points in equilibrium. In this work, we construct such a scenario using fermions as building blocks. These fermions undergo an absorbing-to-absorbing state transition between two topologically distinct and quantum-correlated dark states. Starting from a microscopic, interacting Lindbladian, we derive an effective Lindblad-Keldysh field theory in which critical fermions couple to a bosonic bath with hydrodynamic fluctuations associated with particle number conservation. A key feature of this field theory is an emergent symmetry that protects the purity of the fermions' state even in the presence of the thermal bath. We quantitatively characterise the critical point using a leading-order expansion around the upper critical dimension, thereby establishing the first non-equilibrium universality class of fermions. The symmetry protection mechanism, which exhibits parallels to the problem of directed percolation, suggests a pathway toward a broader class of robust, universal quantum phenomena in fermionic systems.</description>

      <title>Scaling Behaviors in Active Model B+ via the Functional Renormalization Group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the scaling behaviors of the active model B+ using the functional renormalization group (FRG) approach, based on the nonequilibrium effective action formulated via the Martin-Siggia-Rose path-integral formalism. We derive the $\beta$ functions for all couplings of the system in generic $d$ dimensions, revealing regulator independence in various contributions to the renormalization group (RG) flow at specific values for $d$. After identifying specific regions of the parameter space that define submodels closed under RG transformations, we determine all fixed points of potential physical relevance. We confirm the existence of a bicritical fixed point, which was conjectured within the perturbative momentum-shell RG method for being responsible for the transition from bulk phase separation to microphase separation in active systems. We argue that, within the FRG approach, global flows significantly differ from those obtained in its perturbative counterpart.</description>

      <title>Dynamically emergent correlations in Brownian particles subject to simultaneous non-Poissonian resetting protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a one-dimensional gas of $N$ independent Brownian particles subject to simultaneous stochastic resetting, with inter-reset times drawn from a general waiting-time distribution $\psi(\tau)$. This includes the well-known Poissonian case, where $\psi(\tau)=re^{-r\tau}$, and extends to more general classes of resetting, such as heavy-tailed and bounded distributions. We show that the simultaneous resetting generates correlations between particles dynamically. These correlations grow with time and eventually drive the system into a strongly correlated non-equilibrium stationary state (NESS). Exploiting the renewal structure of the resetting dynamics, we derive explicit analytical expressions for the joint distribution of the positions of the particles in the NESS. We show that the NESS has a conditionally independent and identically distributed (CIID) structure that enables us to compute various physical observables exactly for arbitrary $\psi(\tau)$. These observables include the average density, extreme value and order statistics, the spacing distribution between consecutive particles and the full counting statistics, i.e., the distribution of the number of particles in a given interval centered at the origin. We discuss the universal features of the large $N$ scaling behaviors of these observables for different choices of the resetting protocol $\psi(\tau)$. Our results provide an interesting example of a stochastic control whereby, by tuning the inter-reset distribution $\psi(\tau)$, one can generate a class of tunable, and yet solvable, strongly correlated NESS in a many-body system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26821v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The particle number $N$ can be used as a quantitative gauge of non-Gaussianity. This idea extends to systems that are not literally finite by assigning them a notional $N$ that captures the same deviation. For an ideal gas with \(N\) insufficiently large for the thermodynamic limit, the velocity distribution that maximises Havrda-Charv\'at entropy departs markedly from the Maxwell-Boltzmann (Gaussian) form obtained in that limit. We explore how five standard normality tests -- Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Anderson-Darling, Cram\'er--von Mises, Jarque-Bera and Shapiro-Wilk -- respond to samples drawn from this finite-$N$ equilibrium distribution. A large-scale Monte Carlo study maps the tests' statistical power across system size \(N\) and sample size \(n\), providing practical reference tables and a heuristic scaling law, visualised as a contour plot, that together indicate when finite-size effects remain detectable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05131v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we give a rigorous mathematical justification for the relaxation time approximation (RTA) model. We find that only the RTA with an energy-independent relaxation time can be justified in the case of hard interactions. Accordingly, we propose an alternative approach to restore the collision invariance lacking in traditional RTA. Besides, we provide a general statement on the non-analytical structures in the retarded correlators within the kinetic description. For hard interactions, hydrodynamic poles are the long-lived modes. Whereas for soft interactions, commonly encountered in relativistic kinetic theory, the gapless eigenvalue spectrum of linearized collision operator leads to gapless branch-cuts. We note that particle mass and inhomogeneous perturbations would complicate the above-mentioned non-analytical structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05549v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that dissipative state preparation protocols in many-body systems can be substantially accelerated via the quantum Mpemba effect. Our approach exploits weak symmetries to analytically identify a class of simple, experimentally-realizable states that converge exponentially faster to the steady state than typical random initializations. In particular, we study the preparation of a lattice Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), where the depletion can be controlled via the dissipation strength. We also show how to tune the momentum of the created high-fidelity BEC by combining superfluid immersion with lattice shaking. Our theoretical predictions are confirmed by numerical simulations of the dissipative dynamics. This protocol paves the way to unlock the enormous potential of the dissipative preparation of highly entangled states in analog quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Exact treatment of the memory kernel under time-dependent system-environment coupling via a train of delta distributions</title>

Abstract: Memory effects in a quantum system coupled to an environment are one of the central features in the theory of open quantum systems. The dynamics of such quantum systems are typically governed by an equation of motion with a time-convolution integral of the memory kernel. However, solving such integro-differential equations is challenging, especially when the memory kernel is nonstationary (not time-translation invariant). In this paper, we analytically and nonperturbatively solve such integro-differential equations with a nonstationary memory kernel by employing a train of Dirac-delta switchings. We then apply this method to the damped Jaynes-Cummings model and the damped harmonic oscillator model to demonstrate that (i) our solution asymptotes to the well-known exact solution in the continuum limit, and that (ii) our method also enables us to visualize the memory effect in the environment.</description>

      <title>General many-body entanglement swapping protocol: opportunities for distributed quantum computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22430</link>

Abstract: Sharing entangled pairs between non-signaling parties via entanglement swapping constitutes a striking demonstration of the nonlocality of quantum mechanics and a crucial building block for future quantum technologies. In this work, we generalize pair-swapping methods by introducing a many-body entanglement swapping protocol, which allows two non-signaling parties to share general many-body states along an arbitrary partitioning. The shared many-body state retains exactly the same Schmidt vectors as the target state and exhibits typically high fidelity, which approaches unity as the variance of the Schmidt coefficients vanishes. Moreover, we demonstrate how the three-party protocol can be generalized to many-body swapping networks, enabling a general many-body state sharing with unit fidelity via arbitrary number of intermediate nodes. This is achieved by replacing all but one of the unitary operations with those corresponding to the same Schmidt states but with a flattened spectrum, which also completely eliminates the need for postselection. We provide a proof of concept of the three-party protocol on real quantum hardware and discuss how it enables new functionalities, such as fault-tolerant entanglement swapping and new strategies for distributed quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Generalized Wigner theorem for non-invertible symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25327v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the conditions under which a conservation law associated with a non-invertible operator may be realized as a symmetry in quantum mechanics. As established by Wigner, all quantum symmetries must be represented by either unitary or antiunitary transformations. Relinquishing an implicit assumption of invertibility, we demonstrate that the fundamental invariance of quantum transition probabilities under the application of symmetries mandates that all non-invertible symmetries may only correspond to {\it projective} unitary or antiunitary transformations, i.e., {\it partial isometries}. This extends the notion of physical states beyond conventional rays in Hilbert space to equivalence classes in an {\it extended, gauged Hilbert space}, thereby broadening the traditional understanding of symmetry transformations in quantum theory. We discuss consequences of this result and explicitly illustrate how, in simple model systems, whether symmetries be invertible or non-invertible may be inextricably related to the particular boundary conditions that are being used.</description>
