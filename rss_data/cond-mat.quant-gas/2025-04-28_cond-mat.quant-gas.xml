      <title>Ab initio Complex Langevin computation of the roton gap for a dipolar Bose condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute from first principles the dispersion relation $\omega(k)$ of a dipolar Bose gas of erbium atoms close to the roton instability by employing the Complex Langevin (CL) algorithm. Other than the path integral Monte Carlo algorithm, which samples the quantum mechanical path integral in the $N$-particle basis, CL samples the field-theoretic path integral of interacting bosons and can be evaluated for experimentally realistic atom numbers. We extract the energy of roton excitations as a function of the s-wave scattering length, and compare our results to those from Gross-Pitaevskii theory, with and without quantum fluctuation corrections.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation-induced first-order superfluid transition in unitary $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ Fermi gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the superfluid phase transition in an $\mathrm{SU}(N)$-symmetric Fermi gas with $N$ distinct spin states using the functional renormalization group. To capture pairing phenomena beyond mean-field theory, we introduce an auxiliary bosonic field and employ the leading order of the derivative expansion of the partially bosonized effective average action. By discretizing the effective potential on a grid and numerically integrating the flow equations, we resolve the thermodynamic behavior near the transition. Our results reveal a fluctuation-induced first-order phase transition for $N \geq 4$, which is absent at the mean-field level. In the unitary regime, we provide quantitative predictions for the critical temperature, as well as for the discontinuities in the superfluid gap and entropy density as functions of $N$. With increasing $N$, the critical temperature decreases, while the discontinuities become more pronounced, indicating a stronger first-order transition.</description>

      <title>Melting of a Bosonic Mott Insulator in Kagome Optical Lattices with Sign-Inverted Hopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the discrete truncated Wigner approximation (dTWA), we investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of ultracold bosons confined in optical kagome lattices, focusing on both unfrustrated positive and frustrated negative hopping regimes. We consider a protocol in which the system is initialized in a Mott insulating state at unit filling, and the hopping amplitude is gradually increased from zero. For positive hopping, the melting of the Mott insulator is accompanied by the emergence of a sharp peak in the momentum distribution at the $\Gamma$ point of the lowest band, signaling the onset of superfluidity. In contrast, for negative hopping, the Mott insulator melts into a highly nontrivial state without long-range phase coherence, characterized instead by a broad momentum distribution within the flat band, consistent with recent experimental observations. These results demonstrate the applicability of dTWA to highly frustrated quantum systems and offer a new route for numerically exploring the dynamics of frustrated quantum magnets.</description>

      <title>Controlling second-order rogue matter wave and line bright soliton dynamics in 2D Bose-Einstein Condensate with higher-order interactions and gain/loss atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the two-dimensional modified Gross-Pitaevskii equation, accounting for the effects of atom gain/loss and a time-independent isotropic confining potential, utilizing the Hirota's bilinear method. Through an appropriate bilinear form, we derive exact one-soliton and multi-soliton solutions. These solutions showcase two prominent phenomena: the second-order rogue matter wave with spatio-temporal localization, and the line soliton with double spatial localization. We demonstrate the feasibility of controlling the soliton amplitude and the effects of gain/loss resulting in areas of collapse by suitably tuning the coefficient of higher-order interactions in the Bose-Einstein condensate. Additionally, by exploring the interaction dynamics of the multi-soliton solutions, we identify elastic-type interactions, claiming the intrinsic properties of solitons. The influence of higher-order interactions and gain/loss terms on the interaction dynamics is also thoroughly analyzed. These analyses demonstrate that, within the framework of Bose-Einstein condensates described by the two-dimensional modified Gross-Pitaevskii equation, higher-order interactions provide a means to control the properties of the generated rogue matter waves. Extensive numerical simulations have been carried out, and their convergence with the theoretically predicted results highlights the emergent features of the obtained solutions. The exact analytical solutions derived in this study rigorously satisfy the original governing equation, thereby ensuring their consistency with the numerical findings and confirming their accuracy. Thus, our findings hold promise for potential future applications.</description>

      <title>Spin-Depairing-Induced Exceptional Fermionic Superfluidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the non-Hermitian (NH) attractive Hubbard model with spin depairing, which is a spin-resolved asymmetric hopping that nonreciprocally operates spins in the opposite direction. We find that spin depairing stabilizes a superfluid state unique to the NH system. This phase is characterized not only by a finite order parameter, but also by the emergence of exceptional points (EPs) in the momentum space - a feature that starkly contrasts with previously discussed NH fermionic superfluidity, where EPs are absent within the superfluid state and emerge only at the onset of the superfluid breakdown. We uncover the rich mechanism underlying this ``exceptional fermionic superfluidity'' by analyzing the interplay between EPs and the effective density of states of the complex energy dispersion. Furthermore, we reveal that the exceptional superfluid state breaks down induced by strong spin depairing on the cubic lattice, while it remains robust on the square lattice.</description>

      <title>Fermionizing the ideal Bose gas via topological pumping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the coherence and correlations of many-body states appearing in topological pumping in a one-dimensional Bose gas. By analyzing the system at zero and infinite interaction strengths, we reveal a rescaling of momentum distributions accompanied by a self-similar behavior in first- and second-order correlation functions. In excited states of non-interacting bosons, the momentum distribution shows a comb-like structure similar to that of non-interacting fermions but at a higher density. This is mirrored by Friedel oscillations in the one-body density matrix. At the same time, the density-density correlations still exhibit the bosonic enhancement. Our work illustrates how topological pumping induces a nontrivial mapping between bosonic and fermionic correlations.</description>

      <title>Non-Classical Spin-Phonon Correlations Induced by Rydberg Facilitation in a Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between mechanical forces and the internal-state dynamics of a chain of Rydberg atoms trapped in tweezer arrays under the facilitation constraint. Dipole interactions between Rydberg atoms couple electronic (spin) degrees of freedom with excited motional (phonon) states. We show that this interaction leads to highly correlated and non-classical phonon states in the form of squeezed center of mass position states of the Rydberg atoms. Coupling with either a normal or an inverted Lennard-Jones-type potential, resulting from an avoided crossing of Rydberg potential curves, leads to in-phase or out-of-phase correlated oscillations in the atom positions respectively. Furthermore, the growth dynamics of a finite cluster of excited Rydberg atoms can be mapped to the dynamics of a single particle in a semi-infinite lattice subject to a linear potential gradient caused by spin-phonon interactions. This results in Bloch oscillations in the spin cluster size, which in turn localize spin excitations in the system.</description>

      <title>Finite temperature phase diagram of the extended Bose-Hubbard model in the presence of disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the finite- and non-zero temperature phase diagram of the Extended Bose-Hubbard Model for both pure and disordered systems. Such a system can be experimentally realized by trapping ultracold Rydberg atoms in optical lattices. By regulating the Rydberg excitation level and the lattice spacing, the system can be engineered to effectively have (i) only the nearest-neighbor interaction and (ii) both nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor interactions. For both of these situations, we construct the mean-field phase diagrams. It is found that the presence of a non-zero temperature significantly changes the phase diagram because now there is a competition between quantum and thermal fluctuations. We observe that conventional Mott insulator (MI) or charge-density-wave (CDW) lobes vanish at higher temperatures. In a pure system, they melt into a normal fluid. In contrast, the only insulating phase that survives at high temperatures in the presence of disorder is a Bose glass. It is evident that the CDW lobes melt at a lower temperature and the Mott lobes melt at higher temperatures. These transition temperatures depend on the on-site and nearest-neighbor interaction strengths, respectively. It is also found that, with the addition of disorder, the insulating lobes are destroyed at a relatively lower temperature. The mathematical framework that we present here is capable of treating long-range interactions, disorder, and finite temperature simultaneously, and versatile enough so that it can be extended to study different forms of disorder or longer-range interactions.</description>

      <title>Far from equilibrium hydrodynamics of nonthermal fixed points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonthermal fixed points are paradigmatic far-from-equilibrium phenomena of relevance to high-energy physics, cosmology, and cold atomic gases. We propose that, despite their intrinsically nonequilibrium nature, nonthermal fixed points give rise to hydrodynamic excitations otherwise known in the vicinity of thermal equilibrium. As a result, nonthermal fixed points can also be characterized by transport coefficients, such as a far-from-equilibrium, and therefore manifestly time-dependent, incarnation of shear viscosity. We corroborate our proposal with explicit studies using relativistic kinetic theory with binary collisions of massless particles in the 14-moment approximation and comparisons to QCD kinetic theory simulations.</description>

      <title>Rapid passage to ordered states in Rydberg atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a finite lifetime, a ubiquitous challenge in quantum systems is how to prepare a target state in the shortest possible time. This issue is particularly relevant for Rydberg atom arrays in optical tweezers where the dephasing time is typically restricted to a few microseconds. In this work, we develop a rapid passage to ordered many-body states in a Rydberg atomic chain, which allows the transition of the system to various ordered phases in the phase diagram, such as the Z$_2$-, Z$_3$-, and Z$_4$-ordered antiferromagnetic states. Our scheme ramps the parameter in a "non-adiabatic to quasi-adiabatic to non-adiabatic (NQN)" manner. The NQN configuration significantly reduces the time cost required for the state preparation using entirely adiabatic methods, and is generally appliable to sizable number of atoms. Moreover, we experimentally validate the NQN scheme on the neutral-atom quantum cloud computer Aquila.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Imaginary Time Crystals in the non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parity-time symmetry constrains the spectrum of non-Hermitian systems to be either real or come in complex conjugate pairs. The transition between a symmetry-preserving phase with real energies and a symmetry-broken phase with complex energies is marked by exceptional points, one of the hallmarks of non-Hermitian systems. Because of these properties, these systems are widely studied, both theoretically and experimentally. In this work, we investigate the thermodynamic properties of the gain and loss Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model for both bosons and fermions, and establish the existence of an imaginary time crystal phase, an imaginary time analogue of a time crystal. This phase occurs when there is a resonance condition between the Matsubara frequencies and the spectrum of the system, making the Green's function of the system oscillate in imaginary time with the Matsubara frequency. We show that this phase appears in the symmetry-broken region. In particular, the topological edge states of this system exhibit oscillations that are present for bosons. Finally, we discuss the applicability of our results for experiments. We examine signatures of these phases in terms of correlation functions in real time and oscillations in thermodynamic potential in inverse temperature $\beta$, and explore possible experimental platforms to realize this system.</description>

      <title>Scale-invariant phase transition of disordered bosons in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The disorder-induced quantum phase transition between superfluid and non-superfluid states of bosonic particles in one dimension is generally expected to be of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) type. Here, we show that hard-core lattice bosons with integrable power-law hopping decaying with distance as $1/r^\alpha$ - corresponding in spin language to a $XY$ model with power-law couplings - undergo a non-BKT continuous phase transition instead. We use exact quantum Monte-Carlo methods to determine the phase diagram for different values of the exponent $\alpha$, focusing on the regime $\alpha &gt; 2$. We find that the scaling of the superfluid stiffness with the system size is scale-invariant at the transition point for any $\alpha\leq 3$ - a behavior incompatible with the BKT scenario and typical of continuous phase transitions in higher dimension. By scaling analysis near the transition point, we find that our data are consistent with a correlation length exponent satisfying the Harris bound $\nu \geq 2$ and demonstrate a new universal behavior of disordered bosons in one dimension. For $\alpha&gt;3$ our data are consistent with a BKT scenario where the liquid is pinned by infinitesimal disorder.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Polar-Core Spin Vortices in Inhomogeneous Spin-1 Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13800v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the easy-plane phase, a ferromagnetic spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate is magnetized in a plane transverse to the applied Zeeman field. This phase supports polar-core spin vortices (PCVs), which consist of phase windings of transverse magnetization. Here we show that spin-changing collisions cause a PCV to accelerate down density gradients in an inhomogeneous condensate. The dynamics is well-described by a simplified model adapted from scalar systems, which predicts the dependence of the dynamics on trap tightness and quadratic Zeeman energy. In a harmonic trap, a PCV accelerates radially to the condensate boundary, in stark contrast to the azimuthal motion of vortices in a scalar condensate. In a trap that has a local potential maximum at the centre, the PCV exhibits oscillations around the trap centre, which persist for a remarkably long time. The oscillations coincide with the emission and reabsorption of axial spin waves, which reflect off the condensate boundary.</description>

Abstract: A decade ago, a universal stabilization mechanism driven by quantum fluctuations was discovered in ultracold Bose gases of highly magnetic atoms. This mechanism prevents these systems from collapsing and instead allows exotic states of matter to arise, including ultradilute quantum droplets, crystallized quantum states, and specifically supersolids. We review the experimental and theoretical progress in understanding these quantum-stabilized states, their emergence, and intriguing properties.</description>

      <title>Chiral Instabilities in Driven-Dissipative Quantum Liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04443v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of periodically driven Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids (TLLs) coupled to a thermal bath using a Floquet-Lindblad approach. When the coupling to the bath satisfies detailed balance, we obtain a condition for parametric instabilities to be suppressed, symmetrically for both chiralities. Remarkably, by designing a purely chiral coupling to the bath, instead of instability suppression, we uncover a driven-dissipative phase transition between the former symmetric parametric instability and a new chiral parametric instability. In the latter, a single chirality of bosonic quasiparticles gets exponentially amplified, leading to a dynamical chiral imbalance within the TLL, reminiscent of the non-Hermitian skin effect.</description>

      <title>Collective Superradiance: Estimating the Peak Emission Rate and Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09985</link>

Abstract: Determining the peak photon emission time and rate for an ensemble of $N$ quantum systems undergoing collective superradiant decay typically requires tracking the time evolution of the density operator, a process with computational costs scaling exponentially with $N$. We present compact, analytic formulas for evaluating the peak emission rate and time for initially fully excited quantum emitter ensembles, valid for any geometric configuration and emitter type. These formulas rely solely on the variance of the eigenvalues of a real symmetric $N \times N$ matrix, which describes collective dissipation. We demonstrate the versatility of these results across various environments, including free space, solid-state, and waveguide reservoirs. For large $N$ the formulas simplify further to depend on just two parameters: average nearest-neighbor spacing and emitter number. Finally, we present scaling laws and bounds on the spatial size of emitter ensembles, such that superradiance is maintained, independent of emitter number or density.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation of the Unruh Temperature via the Thermal Properties of Virtually Evolving Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14685v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel theoretical model to simulate the Unruh temperature by relating it to the critical temperature of multiple Bose-Einstein thermal baths. These thermal baths are conceptualized as snapshots of a Bose-Firework originating from an evolving driven Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). The critical temperature of each snapshot is determined from the heat capacity, which is numerically estimated by calculating the partition function derived from the system's Hamiltonian. By analyzing the relationship between the average number of the phononic excitations at the critical temperature, acceleration, and the critical temperature itself, our model demonstrates a significant agreement with the Unruh temperature formula, thereby validating our hypothesis. This theoretical approach offers a cost-effective and time-efficient alternative to resource-intensive experimental simulations. Furthermore, it provides a unique perspective on quantum simulation by utilizing the critical phenomena of condensed matter systems to probe fundamental quantum relativistic effects.</description>
