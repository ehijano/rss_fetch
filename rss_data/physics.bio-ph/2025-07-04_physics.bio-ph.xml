      <title>Modelling transcriptional silencing and its coupling to 3D genome organisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Timely up- or down-regulation of gene expression is crucial for cellular differentiation and function. While gene upregulation via transcriptional activators has been extensively investigated, gene silencing remains understudied, especially by modelling. This study employs 3D simulations to study the biophysics of a chromatin fibre where active transcription factors compete with repressors for binding to transcription units along the fibre, and investigates how different silencing mechanisms affect 3D chromatin structure and transcription. We examine three gene silencing feedback mechanisms: positive, negative, and neutral. These mechanisms capture different silencing pathways observed or proposed in biological systems. Our findings reveal that, whilst all mechanisms lead to a silencing transition, the signatures of this transition depend on the choice of the feedback. The latter controls the morphologies of the emergent 3D transcription factor clusters, the average gene expression and its variability, or gene noise, and the network of ensuing correlations between activities of neighbouring transcription units. These results provide insights into the biophysics of gene silencing, as well as into the interplay between transcriptional regulation and 3D genome organisation.</description>

      <title>A Scalable and Quantum-Accurate Foundation Model for Biomolecular Force Field via Linearly Tensorized Quadrangle Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate atomistic biomolecular simulations are vital for disease mechanism understanding, drug discovery, and biomaterial design, but existing simulation methods exhibit significant limitations. Classical force fields are efficient but lack accuracy for transition states and fine conformational details critical in many chemical and biological processes. Quantum Mechanics (QM) methods are highly accurate but computationally infeasible for large-scale or long-time simulations. AI-based force fields (AIFFs) aim to achieve QM-level accuracy with efficiency but struggle to balance many-body modeling complexity, accuracy, and speed, often constrained by limited training data and insufficient validation for generalizability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce LiTEN, a novel equivariant neural network with Tensorized Quadrangle Attention (TQA). TQA efficiently models three- and four-body interactions with linear complexity by reparameterizing high-order tensor features via vector operations, avoiding costly spherical harmonics. Building on LiTEN, LiTEN-FF is a robust AIFF foundation model, pre-trained on the extensive nablaDFT dataset for broad chemical generalization and fine-tuned on SPICE for accurate solvated system simulations. LiTEN achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across most evaluation subsets of rMD17, MD22, and Chignolin, outperforming leading models such as MACE, NequIP, and EquiFormer. LiTEN-FF enables the most comprehensive suite of downstream biomolecular modeling tasks to date, including QM-level conformer searches, geometry optimization, and free energy surface construction, while offering 10x faster inference than MACE-OFF for large biomolecules (~1000 atoms). In summary, we present a physically grounded, highly efficient framework that advances complex biomolecular modeling, providing a versatile foundation for drug discovery and related applications.</description>

      <title>Functional classification of metabolic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14437v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chemical reaction networks underpin biological and physical phenomena across scales, from microbial interactions to planetary atmosphere dynamics. Bacterial communities exhibit complex competitive interactions for resources, human organs and tissues demonstrate specialized biochemical functions, and planetary atmospheres are capable of displaying diverse organic and inorganic chemical processes. Despite their complexities, comparing these networks methodically remains a challenge due to the vast underlying degrees of freedom. In biological systems, comparative genomics has been pivotal in tracing evolutionary trajectories and classifying organisms via DNA sequences. However, purely genomic classifications often fail to capture functional roles within ecological systems. Metabolic changes driven by nutrient availability highlight the need for classification schemes that integrate metabolic information. Here we introduce and apply a computational framework for a classification scheme of organisms that compares matrix representations of chemical reaction networks using the Grassmann distance, corresponding to measuring distances between the fundamental subspaces of stoichiometric matrices. Applying this framework to human gut microbiome data confirms that metabolic distances are distinct from phylogenetic distances, underscoring the limitations of genetic information in metabolic classification. Importantly, our analysis of metabolic distances reveals functional groups of organisms enriched or depleted in specific metabolic processes and shows robustness to metabolically silent genetic perturbations. The generalizability of metabolic Grassmann distances is illustrated by application to chemical reaction networks in human tissue and planetary atmospheres, highlighting its potential for advancing functional comparisons across diverse chemical reaction systems.</description>
