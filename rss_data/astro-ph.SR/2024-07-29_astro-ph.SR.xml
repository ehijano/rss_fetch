      <title>Accurate, Precise, and Physically Self-consistent Ages and Metallicities for 400,000 Solar Neighborhood Subgiant Branch Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Age is the most difficult fundamental stellar parameter to infer for isolated stars. While isochrone-based ages are in general imprecise for both main sequence dwarfs and red giants, precise isochrone-based ages can be obtained for stars on the subgiant branch transitioning from core to shell hydrogen burning. We synthesize Gaia DR3-based distance inferences, multiwavelength photometry from the ultraviolet to the mid infrared, and three-dimensional extinction maps to construct a sample of 289,759 solar-metallicity stars amenable to accurate, precise, and physically self-consistent age inferences. Using subgiants in the solar-metallicity open clusters NGC 2682 (i.e., M 67) and NGC 188, we show that our approach yields accurate and physically self-consistent ages and metallicities with median statistical precisions of 8\% and 0.06 dex. The inclusion of systematic uncertainties resulting from non-single or variable stars results in age and metallicity precisions of 9\% and 0.12 dex. We supplement this solar-metallicity sample with an additional 112,062 metal-poor subgiants, including over 3,000 stars with $[\text{Fe/H}]\lesssim-1.50$, 7\% age precisions, and apparent Gaia $G$-band magnitudes $G&lt;14$. We further demonstrate that our inferred metallicities agree with those produced by multiplexed spectroscopic surveys. As an example of the scientific potential of this catalog, we show that the solar neighborhood star-formation history has three components at $([\text{Fe/H}],\tau/\text{Gyr}) \approx (+0.0,4)$, $(+0.2,7)$, and a roughly linear sequence in age--metallicity space beginning at $([\text{Fe/H}],\tau/\text{Gyr})\approx(+0.2,7)$ and extending to $(-0.5,13)$. Our analyses indicate that the solar neighborhood includes stars on disk-like orbits even at the oldest ages and lowest metallicities accessible by our samples.</description>

      <title>Meridional flow in the solar polar caps revealed by magnetic field observation and simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a large-scale motion on the Sun, the meridional flow plays an important role in determining magnetic structure and strength and solar cycle. However, the meridional flow near the solar poles is still unclear. The Hinode observations show that the magnetic flux density in polar caps decreases from the lower latitudes to the poles. Using a surface flux transport model, we simulate the global radial magnetic field to explore the physical process leading to the observed polar magnetic distribution pattern. For the first time, the high-resolution observations of the polar magnetic fields observed by Hinode are used to directly constrain the simulation. Our simulation reproduces the observed properties of the polar magnetic fields, suggesting the existence of a counter-cell meridional flow in the solar polar caps with a maximum amplitude of about 3 m s$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Twenty-three New Heartbeat Star Systems Discovered Based on TESS Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heartbeat stars (HBSs) are ideal astrophysical laboratories to study the formation and evolution of binary stars in eccentric orbits and the internal structural changes of their components under strong tidal action. We discover 23 new HBSs based on TESS photometric data. The orbital parameters, including orbital period, eccentricity, orbital inclination, argument of periastron, and epoch of periastron passage of these HBSs are derived by using a corrected version of Kumar et al.'s model based on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. The preliminary results show that these HBSs have orbital periods in the range from 2.7 to 20 days and eccentricities in the range from 0.08 to 0.70. The eccentricity-period relation of these objects shows a positive correlation between eccentricity and period, and also shows the existence of orbital circularization. The Hertzsprung-Russell diagram shows that the HBSs are not all located in a particular area. The distribution of the derived parameters suggests a selection bias within the TESS survey towards massive HBSs with shorter orbital periods, higher temperatures and luminosities. These objects are a very useful source to study the structure and evolution of eccentricity orbit binaries and to extend the TESS HBS catalog.</description>

      <title>Revision of calcium and scandium abundances in Am stars based on NLTE calculations and comparison with diffusion stellar evolution models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The homogeneous data sets for the calcium and scandium abundances accounting for departures from LTE were obtained for a sample of 54 metallic-line (Am) stars. The Ca and Sc abundances were found to correlate with effective temperature Teff, the abundance growth with increasing Teff being higher in stars with surface gravity log g &lt; 4 than in those with log g &gt; 4. No correlation was found between Ca or Sc abundances and the iron abundance or the velocity of axial rotation. Am stars exhibit on average the higher values of [Ca/H] than those of [Sc/H] as well as the abundance ratio [Ca/Sc] = 0.41 +/- 0.30. However, at Teff &gt; 9500 K there is an allusion to the systematic difference between Am stars with surface gravity log g &gt; 4 and log g &lt; 4. The iron excess is nearly the same in the range 7200 K &lt;= Teff &lt;= 10030 K. Evolution diffusion models computed with the code MESA for stars with masses from 1.5 to 2Msun show the surface abundances that are in good agreement with Ca and Fe abundances observed in Am stars of the three open clusters with the age &gt; 600 Myr. Additional mechanisms of chemical separation should be considered for explanation of the Am phenomenon in young stars of the Pleiades cluster. We tested the published diffusion stellar evolution models. The diffusion models by Richer et al. (2000) and Hui-Bon-Hoa et al. (2022) are shown to agree with observations of Am stars in the open clusters at large values of the free turbulence parameter: omega=1000 for Ca and Fe, omega=500 for Sc. There is no model with the mass and age of the Am-type star Sirius that could reproduce its surface abundances from He to Ni. The results presented in the paper may be of importance for understanding the chemical peculiarity of Am stars.</description>

      <title>TESSILATOR: a one-stop shop for measuring TESS rotation periods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a software package designed to produce photometric lightcurves and measure rotation periods from full-frame images taken by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), which we name ``TESSILATOR''. TESSILATOR is the only publicly-available code that will run a full lightcurve and rotation period ($P_{\rm rot}$) analysis based on just a (list of) target identifier(s) or sky position(s) via a simple command-line prompt. This paper sets out to introduce the rationale for developing TESSILATOR, and then describes the methods, considerations and assumptions for: extracting photometry; dealing with potential contamination; accounting for natural and instrumental systematic effects; lightcurve normalisation and detrending; removing outliers and unreliable data; and finally, measuring the $P_{\rm rot}$ value and several periodogram attributes. Our methods have been tuned specifically to optimise TESS lightcurves and are independent from the pipelines developed by the TESS Science Processing Operations Center, meaning TESSILATOR can, in principle, analyse {\it any} target across the entire celestial sphere.
  We compare TESSILATOR $P_{\rm rot}$ measurements with TESS-SPOC-derived lightcurves of 1,560 (mainly FGKM-type) stars across four benchmark open clusters (Pisces-Eridanus, the Pleiades, the Hyades and Praesepe) and a sample of nearby field M-dwarfs. From a vetted subsample of 864 targets we find an excellent return of $P_{\rm rot}$ matches for the first 3 open clusters ($&gt;85$ per cent) and a moderate ($\sim 60$ per cent) match for the 700 Myr Praesepe and MEarth sample, which validates TESSILATOR as a tool for measuring $P_{\rm rot}$. The TESSILATOR code is available at \url{https://github.com/alexbinks/tessilator}.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Tests of White Dwarf Cooling Physics with Wide Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present follow-up spectroscopy and a detailed model atmosphere analysis of 29 wide double white dwarfs, including eight systems with a crystallized C/O core member. We use state-of-the-art evolutionary models to constrain the physical parameters of each star, including the total age. Assuming that the members of wide binaries are coeval, any age difference between the binary members can be used to test the cooling physics for white dwarf stars, including potential delays due to crystallization and $^{22}$Ne distillation. We use our control sample of 14 wide binaries with non-crystallized members to show that this method works well; the control sample shows an age difference of only $\Delta$Age = $-0.03 \pm$ 0.15 Gyr between its members. For the eight crystallized C/O core systems we find a cooling anomaly of $\Delta$Age= 1.13$^{+1.20}_{-1.07}$ Gyr. Even though our results are consistent with a small additional cooling delay ($\sim1$ Gyr) from $^{22}$Ne distillation and other neutron-rich impurities, the large uncertainties make this result not statistically significant. Nevertheless, we rule out cooling delays longer than 3.6 Gyr at the 99.7% ($3\sigma$) confidence level for 0.6-0.9 $M_{\odot}$ white dwarfs. Further progress requires larger samples of wide binaries with crystallized massive white dwarf members. We provide a list of subgiant + white dwarf binaries that could be used for this purpose in the future.</description>

      <title>The Great Wave: Evidence of a large-scale vertical corrugation propagating outwards in the Galactic disc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse the three-dimensional structure and kinematics of two samples of young stars in the Galactic disc, containing respectively young giants ($\sim$16000 stars out to heliocentric distances of $\sim$7 kpc) and classical Cepheids ($\sim$3400 stars out to heliocentric distances of $\sim$15 kpc). Both samples show evidence of a large-scale vertical corrugation on top of the warp of the Milky Way, which has a vertical height of 150-200 pc, a radial width of about 3 kpc, and a total length of at least 10 kpc, possibly reaching 20 kpc with the Cepheid sample. The stars in the corrugation exhibit both radial and vertical systematic motions, with Galactocentric radial velocities towards the outer disc of about 10-15 km/s. In the vertical motions, once the warp signature is subtracted, the residuals show a large-scale feature of systematically positive vertical velocities, which is located radially outwards with respect to the corrugation, and whose line of maxima approximately coincides with the line of null vertical displacement, consistent with a vertical wave propagating towards the outer parts of the Galactic disc.</description>

      <title>Nova contributions to the chemical evolution of the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. The explosive burning that drives nova eruptions results in unique nucleosynthesis that heavily over-produces certain isotopes relative to the solar abundance. However, novae are often ignored when considering the chemical evolution of our Galaxy due to their low ejecta masses. Aims. In this work, we use previously computed synthetic nova populations and the galactic chemical evolution code OMEGA+ to assess the impact that novae have on the evolution of stable elemental and isotopic abundances. Methods. We combine populations of novae computed using the binary population synthesis code binary_c with the galactic chemical evolution code OMEGA+ and detailed, white dwarf mass-dependent nova yields to model the nucleosynthetic contributions of novae to the evolution of the Milky Way. We consider three different nova yield profiles, each corresponding to a different set of nova yield calculations. Results. Despite novae from low-mass white dwarfs (WDs) dominating nova ejecta contributions, we find that novae occurring on massive WDs are still able to contribute significantly to many isotopes, particularly those with high mass numbers. We find that novae can produce up to 35% of the Galactic 13C and 15N mass by the time the model Galaxy reaches [Fe/H] = 0, and earlier in the evolution of the Galaxy (between [Fe/H] = -2 and -1) novae may have been the dominant source of 15N. Predictions for [13C/Fe], [15N/Fe], 12C/13C, and 14N/15N abundances ratios vary by up to 0.2 dex at [Fe/H] = 0 and by up to 0.7 dex in [15N/Fe] and 14N/15N between [Fe/H] = -2 and -1 (corresponding approximately to Galactic ages of 170 Myr and 1 Gyr in our model). The Galactic evolution of other stable isotopes (excluding Li) is not noticeably affected by including novae.</description>

      <title>Deep learning interpretable analysis for carbon star identification in Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. A large fraction of Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars develop carbon-rich atmospheres during their evolution. Based on their color and luminosity, these carbon stars can be easily distinguished from many other kinds of stars. However, a large number of G, K, and M giants are also distributed in the same region as carbon stars on the HR diagram. Their spectra have differences,especially in the prominent CN molecular bands. Aims. We aim to distinguish carbon stars from other kinds of stars using Gaia's XP spectra, while providing attribution explanations of key features necessary for identification, and even discovering additional new spectral key features. Methods. We proposed a classification model named `GaiaNet', an improved one-dimensional convolutional neural network specifically designed for handling Gaia's XP spectra. We utilized the SHAP interpretability model to calculate the SHAP value for each feature point in a spectrum, enabling us to explain the output of the `GaiaNet' model and provide further meaningful analysis Results. Compared to four traditional machine-learning methods, the `GaiaNet' model exhibits an average classification accuracy improvement of approximately 0.3% on the validation set, with the highest accuracy even reaching 100%. Utilizing the SHAP algorithm, we present a clear spectroscopic heatmap highlighting molecular band absorption features primarily distributed mainly around CN773.3 and CN895.0, and summarize five crucial feature regions for carbon star identification. Upon applying the trained classification model to the CSTAR sample with Gaia `xp_sampled_mean' spectra, we obtained 451 new candidate carbon stars as a by-product.</description>

      <title>Investigating the effect of nuclear deformation on $\beta$-decay half-lives of neutron-rich nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the effect of nuclear deformation on the calculated $\beta$-decay half-lives of 55 neutron-rich nuclei. The deformation values were computed using DD-PC1 and DD-ME2 interactions in the Relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov model. Yet another set of deformation was adopted from the Finite Range Droplet Model (FRDM). The model-dependent deformation values were used as a free parameter in the proton-neutron quasiparticle random phase approximation model to calculate the $\beta$-decay properties under terrestrial and stellar conditions. The Gamow-Teller strength distributions, branching ratios, half-lives and stellar weak rates of selected nuclei were later investigated. It was concluded that the $\beta$-decay properties of neutron-rich nuclei changed with nuclear deformation. The FRDM computed deformation values provided the best predictions for calculated half-lives followed by the DD-ME2 functional. The terrestrial $\beta$-decay half-lives changed up to 3 orders of magnitude and the stellar $\beta$-rates within a factor of 2 as the neutron-rich nuclei switched their geometrical configurations. For magic number nucleus $^{138}$Sn, the stellar rates changed substantially by more than 1 order of magnitude as the nucleus transitioned away from the spherical shape. Our investigation might prove useful for a realistic modeling of nucleosynthesis calculation.</description>

      <title>Superfluid Spin-up: 3D Simulations of Postglitch Dynamics in Neutron Stars Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following a glitch, a neutron star interior undergoes a transfer of angular momentum from the star's crust to the core, resulting in the spin-up of the latter. The crust-core coupling, which determines how quickly this spin-up proceeds, can be achieved through various physical processes, including Ekman pumping, superfluid vortex-mediated mutual friction, and magnetic fields. While the complexity of the problem has hindered studies of the mechanisms' combined action, analytical work on individual processes suggests different spin-up timescales depending on the relative strength of Coriolis, viscous, and mutual friction forces, and the magnetic field, respectively. However, experimental and numerical validations of these results are limited. In this paper, we focus on viscous effects and mutual friction and conduct non-linear hydrodynamical simulations of the spin-up problem in a two-component fluid by solving the incompressible Hall$-$Vinen$-$Bekarevich$-$Khalatnikov (HVBK) equations in the full sphere (i.e., including $r=0$) for the first time. We find that the viscous (normal) component accelerates due to Ekman pumping, although the mutual friction coupling to the superfluid component alters the spin-up dynamics compared to the single-fluid scenario. Close to the sphere's surface, the response of the superfluid is accurately described by the mutual friction timescale irrespective of its coupling strength with the normal component. However, as we move deeper into the sphere, the superfluid accelerates on different timescales due to the slow viscous spin-up of the internal normal fluid layers. We discuss potential implications for neutron stars and requirements for future work to build more realistic models.</description>

      <title>Binary orbit and disks properties of the RW Aur system using ALMA observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamical interactions between young binaries can perturb the material distribution of their circumstellar disks, and modify the planet formation process. In order to constrain the impact and nature of the binary interaction in the RW Aur system (bound or unbound), we analyzed the circumstellar material at 1.3 mm wavelengths, as observed at multiple epochs by ALMA. We analyzed the disk properties through parametric visibility modeling, and we used this information to constrain the dust morphology and the binary orbital period. We imaged the dust continuum emission of RW Aur with a resolution of 3 au, and we find that the radius enclosing 90% of the flux (R90%) is 19 au and 14 au for RW Aur A and B, respectively. By modeling the relative distance of the disks at each epoch, we find a consistent trend of movement for the disk of RW Aur B moving away from the disk of RW Aur A at an approximate rate of 3 mas/yr (about 0.5 au/yr in sky-projected distance). By combining ALMA astrometry, historical astrometry, and the dynamical masses of each star, we constrain the RW Aur binary stars to be most likely in a high-eccentricity elliptical orbit with a clockwise prograde orientation relative to RW Aur A, although low-eccentricity hyperbolic orbits are not ruled out by the astrometry. Our analysis does not exclude the possibility of a disk collision during the last interaction, which occurred $295_{-74}^{+21}$ yr ago relative to beginning of 2024. Evidence for the close interaction is found in a tentative warp of 6 deg in the inner 3 au of the disk of RW Aur A, in the brightness temperature of both disks, and in the morphology of the gas emission. A narrow ring that peaks at 6 au around RW Aur B is suggestive of captured material from the disk around RW Aur A.</description>

Abstract: The Milky Way is a mosaic of stars from different origins. In particular, metal-poor accreted star candidates offer a unique opportunity to better understand the accretion history of the Milky Way. In this work, we aim to explore the assembly history of the Milky Way by investigating accreted stars in terms of their ages, dynamical properties, and chemical abundances. We also aim to better characterize the impact of incorporating asteroseismic information on age and chemical abundance calculations of metal-poor accreted stars for which TESS data is available. In this study, we conducted an in-depth examination of 30 metal-poor accreted star candidates, using TESS and Gaia data, as well as MIKE spectra. We find satisfactory agreement between seismic and predicted/spectroscopic surface gravity (log g) values, demonstrating the reliability of spectroscopic data from our methodology. We found that while age determination is highly dependent on the log g and asteroseismic information used, the overall chemical abundance distributions are similar for different log g. However, we found that calcium (Ca) abundances are more sensitive to the adopted log g. Our study reveals that the majority of our stars have properties compatible to those reported for the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus, with a minority of stars that might be associated to Splash. We found an age distribution with a median of 11.3 Gyr with lower and upper uncertainties of 4.1 and 1.3 Gyr respectively when including asteroseismic information. As regarding some key chemical signatures we note that these stars are metal-poor ([Fe/H]) &lt; -0.8), alpha-rich ([alpha]/Fe] &gt; 0.2), copper-poor ([Cu/Fe] &lt; 0 ) and with chemical abundances typical of accreted stars. These findings illustrate the importance of multi-dimensional analyses in unraveling the complex accretion history of the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Local Spherical Collapsing Box in Athena++: Numerical Implementation and Benchmark Tests</title>

Abstract: We implement a local model for a spherical collapsing/expanding gas cloud into the Athena++ magnetohydrodynamic code. This local model consists of a Cartesian periodic box with time-dependent geometry. We present a series of benchmark test problems, including non-linear solutions and linear perturbations of the local model, confirming the code's desired performance. During a spherical collapse, a horizontal shear flow is amplified, corresponding to angular momentum conservation of zonal flows in the global problem; wave speed and amplitude of sound waves increase in the local frame, due to the reduction in the characteristic length scale of the box, which can lead to an anisotropic effective sound speed in the local box. Our code conserves both mass and momentum to machine precision. This numerical implementation of the local model has potential applications to the study of local physics and hydrodynamic instabilities during protostellar collapse, providing a powerful framework for better understanding the earliest stages of star and planet formation.</description>

      <title>Irregular Fixation: I. Fixed points and librating orbits of the Brown Hamiltonian</title>

Abstract: In hierarchical triple systems, the inner binary is slowly perturbed by a distant companion, giving rise to large-scale oscillations in eccentricity and inclination, known as von-Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) oscillations. Stable systems with a mild hierarchy, where the period ratio is not too small, require an additional corrective term, known as the Brown Hamiltonian, to adequately account for their long-term evolution. Although the Brown Hamiltonian has been used to accurately describe the highly eccentric systems on circulating orbits where the periapse completes a complete revolution, the analysis near its elliptical fixed points had been overlooked. We derive analytically the modified fixed points including the Brown Hamiltonian and analyse its librating orbits (where the periapse motion is limited in range). We compare our result to the direct three-body integrations of millions of orbits and discuss the regimes of validity. We numerically discover the regions of orbital instability, allowed and forbidden librating zones with a complex, fractal, structure. The retrograde orbits, where the mutual inclination is $\iota &gt; 90\ \rm deg$, are more stable and allowed to librate for larger areas of the parameter space. We find numerical fits for the librating-circulating boundary. Finally, we discuss the astrophysical implications for systems of satellites, stars and compact objects. In a companion paper (paper II), we apply our formalism to the orbits of irregular satellites around giant planets.</description>
