      <title>Optimal design of small aperture optical terminals for free-space links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the generalised design of low-complexity, small aperture optical terminals intended for kilometre-scale, terrestrial, free-space laser links between fixed and dynamic targets. The design features single-mode fibre coupling of the free-space beam, assisted by a fast-steering, tip/tilt mirror that enables first-order turbulence suppression and fine target tracking. The total power throughput over the free-space link and the scintillation index in fibre are optimised. The optimal tip/tilt correction bandwidth and range, aperture size, and focal length for a given link are derived using analytical atmospheric turbulence modelling and numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Sensor response and radiation damage effects for 3D pixels in the ATLAS IBL Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pixel sensors in 3D technology equip the outer ends of the staves of the Insertable B Layer (IBL), the innermost layer of the ATLAS Pixel Detector, which was installed before the start of LHC Run 2 in 2015. 3D pixel sensors are expected to exhibit more tolerance to radiation damage and are the technology of choice for the innermost layer in the ATLAS tracker upgrade for the HL-LHC programme. While the LHC has delivered an integrated luminosity of $\simeq$ 235 fb$^{-1}$ since the start of Run 2, the 3D sensors have received a non-ionising energy deposition corresponding to a fluence of ${\simeq} 8.5\times10^{14}$ 1 MeV neutron-equivalent cm$^{-2}$ averaged over the sensor area. This paper presents results of measurements of the 3D pixel sensors' response during Run 2 and the first two years of Run 3, with predictions of its evolution until the end of Run 3 in 2025. Data are compared with radiation damage simulations, based on detailed maps of the electric field in the Si substrate, at various fluence levels and bias voltage values. These results illustrate the potential of 3D technology for pixel applications in high-radiation environments.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed machine learning approaches to reactor antineutrino detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear reactors produce a high flux of MeV-scale antineutrinos that can be observed through inverse beta-decay (IBD) interactions in particle detectors. Reliable detection of reactor IBD signals depends on suppression of backgrounds, both by physical shielding and vetoing and by pattern recognition and rejection in acquired data. A particularly challenging background to reactor antineutrino detection is from cosmogenically induced fast neutrons, which can mimic the characteristics of an IBD signal. In this work, we explore two methods of machine learning -- a tree-based classifier and a graph-convolutional neural network -- to improve rejection of fast neutron-induced background events in a water Cherenkov detector. The tree-based classifier examines classification at the reconstructed feature level, while the graphical network classifies events using only the raw signal data. Both methods improve the sensitivity for a background-dominant search over traditional cut-and-count methods, with the greatest improvement being from the tree-based classification method. These performance enhancements are relevant for reactor monitoring applications that make use of deep underground oil-based or water-based kiloton-scale detectors with multichannel, PMT-based readouts, and they are likely extensible to other similar physics analyses using this class of detector.</description>

      <title>Imaging reconstruction method on X-ray data of CMOS polarimeter combined with coded aperture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray polarization is a powerful tool for unveiling the anisotropic characteristics of high-energy celestial objects. We present a novel imaging reconstruction method designed for hard X-ray polarimeters employing a Si CMOS sensor and coded apertures, which function as a photoelectron tracker and imaging optics, respectively. Faced with challenges posed by substantial artifacts and background noise in the coded aperture imaging associated with the conventional balanced correlation method, we adopt the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm as the foundation of our imaging reconstruction method. The newly developed imaging reconstruction method is validated with imaging polarimetry and a series of X-ray beam experiments. The method demonstrates the capability to accurately reproduce an extended source comprising multiple segments with distinct polarization degrees. Comparative analysis exhibits a significant enhancement in imaging reconstruction accuracy compared to the balanced correlation method, with the background noise levels reduced to 17%. The outcomes of this study enhance the feasibility of Cube-Sat imaging polarimetry missions in the hard X-ray band, as the combination of Si CMOS sensors and coded apertures is a promising approach for realizing it.</description>

      <title>Combining Hybrid and Opaque Scintillator Techniques in Search for Double Beta Plus Decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Double beta plus decay is a rare nuclear disintegration process. Difficulties in its measurement arise from suppressed decay probabilities, experimentally challenging decay signatures and low natural abundances of suitable candidate nuclei. In this article, we propose a new detector concept to overcome these challenges. It is based on the first-time combination of hybrid and opaque scintillation detector technology paired with novel light read-out techniques. This approach is particularly suitable detecting positrons (beta plus) signatures. We expect to discover two-neutrino double beta plus decay modes within 1 tonne-week exposure and are able to probe neutrinoless double beta plus decays at several orders of magnitude improved significance compared to current experimental limits.</description>

      <title>BINGO innovative assembly for background reduction in bolometric $0\nu\beta\beta$ experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: BINGO is a project aiming to set the grounds for large-scale bolometric neutrinoless double-beta-decay experiments capable of investigating the effective Majorana neutrino mass at a few meV level. It focuses on developing innovative technologies (a detector assembly, cryogenic photodetectors and active veto) to achieve a very low background index, of the order of $10^{-5}$ counts/(keV kg yr) in the region of interest. The BINGO demonstrator, called MINI-BINGO, is designed to investigate the promising double-beta-decay isotopes $^{100}$Mo and $^{130}$Te and it will be composed of Li$_2$MoO$_4$ and TeO$_2$ crystals coupled to bolometric light detectors and surrounded by a Bi$_4$Ge$_3$O$_{12}$-based veto. This will allow us to reject a significant background in bolometers caused by surface contamination from $\alpha$-active radionuclides by means of light yield selection and to mitigate other sources of background, such as surface contamination from $\beta$-active radionuclides, external $\gamma$ radioactivity, and pile-up due to random coincidence of background events. This paper describes an R\&amp;D program towards the BINGO goals, particularly focusing on the development of an innovative assembly designed to reduce the passive materials within the line of sight of the detectors, which is expected to be a dominant source of background in next-generation bolometric experiments. We present the performance of two prototype modules -- housing four cubic (4.5-cm side) Li$_2$MoO$_4$ crystals in total -- operated in the Canfranc underground laboratory in Spain within a facility developed for the CROSS double-beta-decay experiment.</description>

      <title>Radiation Hardness Studies of RPC Based on Diamond-Like Carbon Electrodes for MEG II Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19136v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel type of resistive plate chamber, based on diamond-like carbon (DLC) electrodes is under development for background identification in the MEG II experiment. The DLC-RPC is required to have a radiation hardness to mass irradiation since it is planned to be placed in a high-intensity and low-momentum muon beam. In this study, the aging test using a high-intensity X-ray beam was conducted to evaluate the radiation hardness of the DLC-RPC. The accumulated charge due to X-ray irradiation reached about 54 C/cm$^2$, which is approximately half of the one-year irradiation dose expected in the MEG II experiment. As a result, the degradation of the gas gain was observed due to fluorine deposition and insulators formed on the DLC electrodes. In addition, discharges via spacers were also observed repeatedly and interrupted the DLC-RPC operation.</description>

      <title>Scintillator-SiPM Detector for Tracking and Energy Deposition Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An innovative particle detector that offers a compelling combination of cost-effectiveness and high accuracy is introduced. The detector features plastic scintillators paired with a sparse arrangement of SiPMs, strategically positioned within a unique opto-mechanical framework. This configuration delivers precise measurements of spatial impact position and energy deposition of impinging particles. The manuscript describes the detector's physical model complemented by an analytical representation. These calculations underpin a numerical algorithm, facilitating the estimation of particle impingement position and energy deposition. The results of the numerical calculations are compared with the output of GEANT4 simulations and evaluated by rigorous laboratory testing. An array of these detectors, intended for deployment in a spaceborne experiment, underwent detailed design, manufacturing, and testing. Their performance and alignment with the physical model were validated through meticulously conducted ground-based laboratory experiments, conclusively affirming the detector's properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The COTS-Capsule Spaceborne hodoscope was launched into low earth orbit aboard the International Space Station and operated during 2021-2022. The primary objectives of the payload are: measuring and characterizing the radiation environment within the space station; serving as a technology demonstrator for the COTS-Capsule radiation mitigation apparatus; and testing the interaction of high-energy cosmic particles in space with our detectors. The payload features a particle hodoscope equipped with an array of novel detectors based on polyvinyl toluene scintillators and silicon photomultiplier sensors that are used for radiation detection and characterization. This paper provides a comprehensive account of the construction, preflight performance, testing, qualification, and in-orbit calibration of the COTS-Capsule payload. The hodoscope, sensitive to ionizing cosmic particles, facilitates impinging particle track reconstruction, energy deposition estimation, and linear energy transfer estimation. In specific instances, it also provides particle identification and energy deposition estimation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Laser interferometry enables to remotely measure microscopical length changes of deployed telecommunication cables originating from earthquakes. Long range and compatibility with data traffic make it unique to the exploration of remote regions, as well as highly-populated areas where optical networks are pervasive, and its large-scale implementation is attractive for both Earth scientists and telecom operators. However, validation and modeling of its response and sensitivity are still at an early stage and suffer from lack of statistically-significant event catalogs and limited availability of co-located seismometers. We implemented laser interferometry on a land-based telecommunication cable and analyzed 1.5 years of continuous acquisition, with successful detections of events in a broad range of magnitudes, including very weak ones. By comparing fiber and seismometer recordings we determined relations between a cable's detection probability and the magnitude and distance of events, and showed that spectral analysis of recorded data allows considerations on the earthquake dynamics. Our results reveal that quantitative analysis is possible for this sensing technique and support the interpretation of data from the growing amount of interferometric deployments. We anticipate the high integration and scalability of laser interferometry into existing telecommunication grids to be useful for the daily seismicity monitoring, in perspective exploitable for civilian protection use.</description>

      <title>Shot noise-mitigated secondary electron imaging with ion count-aided microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern science is dependent on imaging on the nanoscale, often achieved through processes that detect secondary electrons created by a highly focused incident charged particle beam. Multiple types of measurement noise limit the ultimate trade-off between the image quality and the incident particle dose, which can preclude useful imaging of dose-sensitive samples. Existing methods to improve image quality do not fundamentally mitigate the noise sources. Furthermore, barriers to assigning a physically meaningful scale make the images qualitative. Here we introduce ion count-aided microscopy (ICAM), which is a quantitative imaging technique that uses statistically principled estimation of the secondary electron yield. With a readily implemented change in data collection, ICAM substantially reduces source shot noise. In helium ion microscopy, we demonstrate 3x dose reduction and a good match between these empirical results and theoretical performance predictions. ICAM facilitates imaging of fragile samples and may make imaging with heavier particles more attractive.</description>

      <title>Ptycho-endoscopy on a lensless ultrathin fiber bundle tip</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17213v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) utilizes an aircraft-carried antenna to emit electromagnetic pulses and detect the returning echoes. As the aircraft travels across a designated area, it synthesizes a large virtual aperture to improve image resolution. Inspired by SAR, we introduce synthetic aperture ptycho-endoscopy (SAPE) for micro-endoscopic imaging beyond the diffraction limit. SAPE operates by hand-holding a lensless fiber bundle tip to record coherent diffraction patterns from specimens. The fiber cores at the distal tip modulate the diffracted wavefield within a confined area, emulating the role of the 'airborne antenna' in SAR. The handheld operation introduces positional shifts to the tip, analogous to the aircraft's movement. These shifts facilitate the acquisition of a ptychogram and synthesize a large virtual aperture extending beyond the bundle's physical limit. We mitigate the influences of hand motion and fiber bending through a low-rank spatiotemporal decomposition of the bundle's modulation profile. Our tests demonstrate the ability to resolve a 548-nm linewidth on a resolution target. The achieved space-bandwidth product is ~1.1 million effective pixels, representing a 36-fold increase compared to that of the original fiber bundle. Furthermore, SAPE's refocusing capability enables imaging over an extended depth of field exceeding 2 cm. The aperture synthesizing process in SAPE surpasses the diffraction limit set by the probe's maximum collection angle, opening new opportunities for both fiber-based and distal-chip endoscopy in applications such as medical diagnostics and industrial inspection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17333v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present new exclusion bounds obtained at the European X-ray Free Electron Laser facility (EuXFEL) on axion-like particles (ALPs) in the mass range 10^{-3} eV &lt; m_a &lt; 10^{4} eV. Our experiment exploits the Primakoff effect via which photons can, in the presence of a strong external electric field, decay into axions, which then convert back into photons after passing through an opaque wall. While similar searches have been performed previously at a 3^rd generation synchrotron [1], our work demonstrates improved sensitivity, exploiting the higher brightness of X-rays at EuXFEL.</description>

Abstract: Most search experiments sensitive to quantum chromodynamics (QCD) axion dark matter benefit from microwave cavities, as electromagnetic resonators, that enhance the detectable axion signal power and thus the experimental sensitivity drastically. As the possible axion mass spans multiple orders of magnitude, microwave cavities must be tunable and it is desirable for the cavity to have a tunable frequency range that is as wide as possible. Since the tunable frequency range generally increases as the dimension of the conductor tuning rod increases for a given cylindrical conductor cavity system, we developed a cavity system with a large dimensional tuning rod in order to increase this. We, for the first time, employed not only a piezoelectric motor, but also gears to drive a large and accordingly heavy tuning rod, where such a combination to increase driving power can be adopted for extreme environments as is the case for axion dark matter experiments: cryogenic, high-magnetic-field, and high vacuum. Thanks to such higher power derived from the piezoelectric motor and gear combination, we realized a wideband tunable cavity whose frequency range is about 42\% of the central resonant frequency of the cavity, without sacrificing the experimental sensitivity too much.</description>
