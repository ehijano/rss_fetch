      <title>Sparse Functional Data Classification via Bayesian Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse functional data frequently arise in real-world applications, posing significant challenges for accurate classification. To address this, we propose a novel classification method that integrates functional principal component analysis (FPCA) with Bayesian aggregation. Unlike traditional ensemble methods, our approach combines predicted probabilities across bootstrap replicas and refines them through Bayesian calibration using Bayesian generalized linear models (Bayesian GLMs). We evaluated the performance of the proposed method against single classifiers and conventional ensemble techniques. The simulation results demonstrate that Bayesian aggregation improves the classification accuracy over conventional methods. Finally, we validate the approach through three real-data analyses.</description>

      <title>Towards practical PDMP sampling: Metropolis adjustments, locally adaptive step-sizes, and NUTS-based time lengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Piecewise-Deterministic Markov Processes (PDMPs) hold significant promise for sampling from complex probability distributions. However, their practical implementation is hindered by the need to compute model-specific bounds. Conversely, while Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) offers a generally efficient approach to sampling, its inability to adaptively tune step sizes impedes its performance when sampling complex distributions like funnels.
  To address these limitations, we introduce three innovative concepts: (a) a Metropolis-adjusted approximation for PDMP simulation that eliminates the need for explicit bounds without compromising the invariant measure, (b) an adaptive step size mechanism compatible with the Metropolis correction, and (c) a No U-Turn Sampler (NUTS)-inspired scheme for dynamically selecting path lengths in PDMPs. These three ideas can be seamlessly integrated into a single, `doubly-adaptive' PDMP sampler with favourable robustness and efficiency properties.</description>

      <title>A unified framework for multiple-try Metropolis algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multiple-try Metropolis (MTM) algorithm is a generalization of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm in which the transition kernel uses a compound proposal consisting of multiple candidate draws. Since its seminal paper there have been several extensions to this algorithm. This paper presents a general framework that encompasses many of these extensions, as well as an independent comparison. To facilitate this, a deterministic Metropolis transition kernel is used to develop a procedure that derives valid acceptance probabilities for reversible Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms, given only the proposal mechanism. Several configurations of MTM are explored in full factorial simulation experiment that compares the sampling performance of MTM algorithms with respect to non-Gaussian target distributions, multimodal sampling, and Monte Carlo error. We find that the form of the proposal distribution is the most important factor in determining algorithm performance, while the form of the weight function has negligible impact. A large number of candidate draws can improve the per-iteration performance, though improvement of the overall performance is limited by the additional computational burden introduced by multiple candidacy.</description>

      <title>The pushed beta distribution and contaminated binary sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine a generalisation of the beta distribution that we call the pushed beta distribution. This is a continuous univariate distribution on the unit interval which generalises the beta distribution by "pushing" the density in a particular direction using an additional multiplicative term in the density kernel. We examine the properties of this distribution and compare it to the beta distribution. We also examine the use of this distribution in contaminated binary sampling using Bayesian inference. We find that this distribution arises as the appropriate posterior distribution for inference in certain kinds of contaminated binary models. We derive a broad range of properties of the distribution and we also establish some computational methods to compute various functions for the distribution.</description>

      <title>CRPS-Based Targeted Sequential Design with Application in Chemical Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sequential design of real and computer experiments via Gaussian Process (GP) models has proven useful for parsimonious, goal-oriented data acquisition purposes. In this work, we focus on acquisition strategies for a GP model that needs to be accurate within a predefined range of the response of interest. Such an approach is useful in various fields including synthetic chemistry, where finding molecules with particular properties is essential for developing useful materials and effective medications. GP modeling and sequential design of experiments have been successfully applied to a plethora of domains, including molecule research. Our main contribution here is to use the threshold-weighted Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) as a basic building block for acquisition functions employed within sequential design. We study pointwise and integral criteria relying on two different weighting measures and benchmark them against competitors, demonstrating improved performance with respect to considered goals. The resulting acquisition strategies are applicable to a wide range of fields and pave the way to further developing sequential design relying on scoring rules.</description>

      <title>Rank estimation for the accelerated failure time model with partially interval-censored data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a unified rank-based inferential procedure for fitting the accelerated failure time model to partially interval-censored data. A Gehan-type monotone estimating function is constructed based on the idea of the familiar weighted log-rank test, and an extension to a general class of rank-based estimating functions is suggested. The proposed estimators can be obtained via linear programming and are shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal via standard empirical process theory. Unlike common maximum likelihood-based estimators for partially interval-censored regression models, our approach can directly provide a regression coefficient estimator without involving a complex nonparametric estimation of the underlying residual distribution function. An efficient variance estimation procedure for the regression coefficient estimator is considered. Moreover, we extend the proposed rank-based procedure to the linear regression analysis of multivariate clustered partially interval-censored data. The finite-sample operating characteristics of our approach are examined via simulation studies. Data example from a colorectal cancer study illustrates the practical usefulness of the method.</description>
