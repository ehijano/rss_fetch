      <title>2023 update of the extraction of the CKM matrix elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I discuss the extraction of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix elements under the Standard Model (SM) framework from a global fit combining observables that satisfy the double requirement of being precisely known both experimentally and theoretically. The analysis shown here relies on the CKMfitter package, consisting of a frequentist approach that employs the Range fit (Rfit) scheme to handle theoretical uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Axion-Induced Patchy Screening of the Cosmic Microwave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons can undergo resonant conversion into axions in the presence of magnetized plasma distributed inside non-linear large-scale structure (LSS). This process leads to axion-induced patchy screening: secondary temperature and polarization anisotropies with a characteristic non-blackbody frequency dependence that are strongly correlated with the distribution of LSS along our past light cone. We compute the axion-induced patchy screening contribution to two- and three- point correlation functions that include CMB anisotropies and tracers of LSS within the halo model. We use these results to forecast the sensitivity of existing and future surveys to photon-axion couplings for axion masses between $2\times 10^{-13}$ eV and $3\times 10^{-12}$ eV, using a combination of empirical estimates from Planck data of the contribution from instrumental noise and foregrounds as well as modeled contributions on angular scales only accessible with future datasets. We demonstrate that an analysis using Planck and the unWISE galaxy catalogue would be complementary to the most sensitive existing astrophysical axion searches, probing couplings as small as $3\times 10^{-12} \, {\rm GeV}^{-1}$, while observations from a future survey such as CMB-S4 could extend this reach by almost an additional order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>QCD Axion Strings or Seeds?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the impact of QCD axion strings in the cosmological history of electroweak (EW) symmetry breaking, focussing on the minimal KSVZ axion model. We consider the case of the pure SM Higgs potential as well as a simple scenario with a first order EW phase transition. We capture the effect of the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) sector within an effective-theory approach for the Higgs field, where the axion string core and the heavy PQ states are integrated out. The relevant parameters in this effective theory are controlled by the size of the portal coupling between the Higgs and the PQ scalar, and the mass of the PQ radial excitation. We determine the range of portal couplings for which the axion strings can strongly affect the dynamics of EW symmetry breaking. In the case of a first order EW phase transition, the strings can act as seeds by either catalyzing the nucleation of (non-spherical) bubbles, or leading to the completion of the phase transition by triggering a classical instability.</description>

      <title>Not-so-inelastic Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models of inelastic (or pseudo-Dirac) dark matter commonly assume an accidental symmetry between the left-handed and right-handed mass terms in order to suppress diagonal couplings. We point out that this symmetry is unnecessary, because for Majorana fermions the diagonal couplings are not strongly constrained. Removing the requirement of such an ad-hoc symmetry instead relaxes the relic density constraint due to additional annihilation modes. We consider a simple UV-complete model realising this setup and study constraints from (in)direct detection, beam dump experiments and colliders. We identify two viable mass regions for the dark matter mass, around a few hundred MeV and around a few GeV, respectively. The former region will be fully tested by near-future analyses of NA64 and Belle II data, while the latter turns out to be challenging to explore even with future experiments.</description>

      <title>Leptoquark Searches at TeV Scale Using Neural Networks at Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several discrepancies in the decay of B-meson decay have drawn a lot of interest in the leptoquarks (LQ), making them an exciting discovery. The current research aims to discover the pair-production of leptoquarks that links strongly to the third generation of quarks and leptons at the center of mass energy $\sqrt{s}$=14 TeV, via proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Based on the lepton-quark coupling parameters and branching fractions, we separated our search into various benchmark points. The leading order (LO) signals and background processes are generated, while parton showering and hadronization is also performed to simulate the detector effects. The Boosted Decision Trees (BDTs), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and Likelihood (LH) methods are effective in improving signal-background discrimination compared to traditional cut-based analysis. The results indicate that these machine learning methods can significantly enhance the sensitivity in probing for new physics signals, such as LQs, at two different integrated luminosities. Specifically, the use of BDTs, MLP, and LH has led to higher signal significances and improved signal efficiency in both hadronic and semi-leptonic decay modes. The results suggest that the LQ masses of 500 GeV and 2.0 TeV in fully hadronic decay modes can be accurately probed with signal significance 176.70 (17.6) and 184.27 (0.01) for MVA (cut-based) at 1000 $fb^{-1}$, respectively. Similarly, in semi-leptonic decay mode the signal significance values are 168.56 and 181.89 at lowest and highest selected LQ masses respectively for MVA method only. The enhanced numbers by a factor of 2 are also reported at 3000 $fb^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>The effective field theory of extended Wilson lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct the effective theory of electrically charged, spatially extended, infinitely heavy objects at leading power. The theory may be viewed as a generalization of NRQED for particles with a finite charge distribution where the charge radius and higher moments of the charge distribution are counted as $O(1)$ rather than $O(1/M)$. We show this is equivalent to a Wilson line traced by the worldline of an extended charge distribution. Our canonical use case is atomic nuclei with large charge $Z\gg 1$. The theory allows for the insertion of external operators and is sufficiently general to allow a treatment of both electromagnetic and weak mediated lepton-nucleus scattering including charged-current processes. This provides a first step towards the factorization of Coulomb regions, including structure dependence arising from a finite charge distribution, for scattering with nuclei.</description>

      <title>Low-virtuality splitting in the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When the available collision energy is much above the mass of the particles involved, scattering amplitudes feature kinematic configurations that are enhanced by the much lower virtuality of some intermediate particle. Such configurations generally factorise in terms of a hard scattering amplitude with exactly on-shell intermediate particle, times universal factors. In the case of real radiation emission, such factors are splitting amplitudes that describe the creation or the annihilation -- for initial or final state splittings -- of the low-virtuality particle and the creation of the real radiation particles. We compute at tree-level the amplitudes describing all the splittings that take place in the Standard Model when the collision energy is much above the electroweak scale. Unlike previous results, our splitting amplitudes fully describe the low-virtuality kinematic regime, which includes the region of collinear splitting, of soft emission, and combinations thereof. The splitting amplitudes are compactly represented as little-group tensors in an improved bi-spinor formalism for massive spin-1 particles that automatically incorporates the Goldstone Boson Equivalence Theorem. Simple explicit expressions are obtained using a suitably defined infinite-momentum helicity basis representation of the spinor variables. Our results, combined with the known virtual contributions, could enable systematic predictions of the leading electroweak radiation effects in high-energy scattering processes, with particularly promising phenomenological applications to the physics of future colliders with very high energy such as a muon collider.</description>

      <title>Towards Quarkonium Fragmentation from NRQCD in a Variable-Flavor Number Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address quarkonium formation at moderate to large transverse momenta, where the single-parton collinear fragmentation prevails over the short-distance emission, directly from the hard sub-scattering, of the constituent heavy-quark pair. We rely on Non-Relativistic-QCD (NRQCD) Next-to-Leading Order (NLO) calculations for all parton fragmentation channels to quarkonia, taken as proxies for initial-scale inputs. Preliminary sets of Variable-Flavor Number-Scheme (VFNS) fragmentation functions (FFs) are built via a DGLAP scheme that properly accounts for evolution thresholds. Statistical errors are assessed via a Monte Carlo (MC), replica-like approach aimed at catching Missing Higher-Order Uncertainties (MHOUs).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study vacua of moduli potential consisting of multiple contribution of modular forms in a finite modular symmetry. If the potential is given by a single modular form, the Minkowski vacuum is realized at the fixed point of the modular symmetry. We show that de Sitter vacuum is realized with a multiple modular form case and obtain a non-trivial vacuum which is away from the fixed point, i.e. a large modulus vacuum expectation value, depending on the choice of the weight and representation of the modular forms. We study these vacua by a numerical and analytically. It is also found that vacua obtained in this paper preserve CP symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the role of Roberge-Weiss periodicity in the thermodynamics of quantum chromodynamics at moderately high temperature, where the semi-quark-gluon plasma is expected. From the construction of the grand canonical partition function at zero and also at finite density via the canonical approach, we can discuss the relation between contributions of the Polyakov-loop phase and Roberge-Weiss periodicity. Then, we can conclude that the existence of Roberge-Weiss periodicity is a necessary condition to reproduce exact results at moderately high temperature.</description>

      <title>General amplitude of near-threshold hadron scattering for exotic hadrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the general behavior of the scattering amplitude with channel couplings near the two-body threshold. It is known that the Flatt\'{e} amplitude, which is often used in the analysis of experimental data involving exotic hadrons, has some constraint in the near-threshold energy region. While the M-matrix gives the general expression of the scattering amplitude, it is not smoothly connected to the Flatt\'{e} amplitude, due to the property of the determinant of the amplitude in channel space. In this paper, based on the effective field theory, we propose new parametrization of the scattering amplitude which gives the general expression near the threshold and has a well-defined limit reproducing the Flatt\'{e} amplitude. We show that the nonresonant background contribution exists in the general amplitude even in the first order in the momentum. Finally, we quantitatively evaluate the cross sections by changing the strength of the background contribution. We find that the interference with the background term may induce a dip structure of the cross section near the threshold, in addition to the peak and threshold cusp structures.</description>

      <title>$\gamma$ rays from in-flight positron annihilation as a probe of new physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\gamma$ ray emission originating from in-flight annihilation (IA) of positrons is a powerful observable for constraining high-energy positron production from exotic sources. By comparing diffuse $\gamma$ ray observations of INTEGRAL, COMPTEL and EGRET to theoretical predictions, we set the most stringent constraints on electrophilic feebly interacting particles (FIPs), thereby proving IA as a valuable probe of new physics. In particular, we extensively discuss the case of MeV-scale sterile neutrinos, where IA sets the most stringent constraints, excluding $|U_{\mu4}|^{2} \gtrsim 10^{-13}$ and $|U_{\tau4}|^{2} \gtrsim 2\times 10^{-13}$ for sterile neutrinos mixed with $\mu$ and $\tau$ neutrinos respectively. These constraints improve existing limits by more than an order of magnitude. We briefly discuss the application of these results to a host of exotic positron sources such as dark photons, axion-like particles, primordial black holes (PBHs) and sub-GeV dark matter (DM).</description>

      <title>Determination of CP-violating $HZZ$ interaction with polarised beams at the ILC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study possible CP-violation effects of the 125 GeV Higgs to $Z$ boson coupling at the 250 GeV ILC with transverse and longitudinal beam polarisation via the process $e^+ e^- \rightarrow HZ \rightarrow H \mu^-\mu^+$. We explore the azimuthal angular distribution of the muon pair from the $Z$ boson decay, and constructe CP-odd observables sensitive to CP-violation effects, where we derived this observable both by analytical calculations and by $\mathtt{Whizard}$ simulations. Particularly, we can construct two CP-odd observables with the help of transversely-polarised initial beams and improve the statistical significance of CP-violation effects by combining two measurements. We defined the asymmetries between the signal regions with different signs of the CP-odd observables, and determine the CP-violation effect by comparing with the SM 95% C.L. upper bound. In this paper, we setup a scenario which assumes that the total cross-section is always fixed while CP-violation is varying, and such a scenario helps us to determine the intrinsic CP-mixing angle limit around $|\xi_{CP}|\sim 0.03$ with (90%, 40%) polarised electron-positron beams and 5 ab$^{-1}$ integrated luminosity. In addition, we determine the CP-odd coupling limit $|\widetilde{c}_{HZZ}|\sim 0.01$ as well, where we suppose that the SM tree-level cross-section is fixed and the CP-violation is the varying additional contribution. Comparing with the analysis with unpolarised beams, the sensitivity to the CP-violation effect can be improved by transverse or longitudinal polarisation.</description>

      <title>A randomly generated Majorana neutrino mass matrix using Adaptive Monte Carlo method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A randomly generated complex symmetric matrix using Adaptive Monte Carlo method, is taken as a general form of Majorana neutrino mass matrix, which is diagonalized by the use of eigenvectors. We extract all the neutrino oscillation parameters i.e. two mass-squared differences ($\Delta m_{21}^2$ and $\Delta m_{32}^2$ ), three mixing angles ($\theta_{12}$, $\theta_{13}$, $\theta_{23}$) and three phases i.e. one Dirac CP violating phase ($\delta_{CP}$) and two Majorana phases ($\alpha$ and $\beta$). The charge-parity (CP) violating phases are extracted from the mixing matrix constructed with the eigenvectors of the Hermitian matrix formed by the complex symmetric matrix. All the neutrino oscillation parameters within 3$\sigma$ bound are allowed in both normal hierarchy (NH) and inverted hierarchy (IH) consistent with the latest Planck cosmological upper bound, $\sum\vert m_i\vert&lt;0.12$ eV. This latest cosmological upper bound is allowed only in three cases of zero texture for $m_{11}=0$; $m_{11},m_{12}=0$ and $m_{11},m_{13}=0$ in normal hierarchy whereas none of zero texture is allowed in inverted hierarchy. We also study effective neutrino masses $m_{\beta}$ in tritium beta decay and $m_{\beta\beta}$ in neutrinoless double beta decay.</description>

Here, we discuss such recent applications, including analyticity constraints on hadronic cross sections, radiative corrections, and isospin-breaking effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considering that the study of neutrino-nucleus interactions with incident neutrino energy ranges in the GeV-TeV range is feasible at the Large Hadron Collider, we investigate in this paper the degree of polarization ${\cal{P}}$ of the (anti) tau lepton produced in (anti) tau neutrino - tungsten interactions. We estimate the differential cross-sections and the longitudinal and transverse components of the tau lepton polarization as a function of the tau lepton energy and distinct values of the scattering angle, assuming different values for the energy of the incoming (anti) tau neutrino. Different models for the treatment of the nuclear effects in the parton distribution functions are assumed as input in the calculations. Our results indicate that $ {\cal{P}} &lt; 1$ for the neutrino energies reached at the LHC and are almost insensitive to the nuclear effects.</description>

Abstract: I review recent developments in the field of dark photons-here taken to be U(1) gauge bosons with mass less than the Z-including both kinetically mixed vectors and those that couple to anomaly-free U(1)'s. Distinctions between Higgs and Stueckelberg masses are highlighted, with discussion of swampland constraints, UV completions, and new experimental search strategies.</description>

      <title>Heavy quark mass near the phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assuming that the number densities of heavy flavor in hadron gas and in QGP are same at $T_c$, we obtain the effective mass of heavy quark at $T_c$ from the comparison with the hadron resonance gas model which well describes particle yield in heavy-ion collisions. We find that charm quark mass at vanishing baryon chemical potential is around 1.8 GeV which is much heavier than QCD bare mass and close to $D$ meson mass. The mass slightly increases with increasing baryon chemical potential and then decreases. On the other hand, anticharm quark mass constantly decreases with increasing baryon chemical potential. Bottom quark mass has a similar pattern. Extending the hadron resonance gas model to a bit higher temperature beyond $T_c$, the effective masses of charm and bottom quarks decrease with increasing temperature.</description>

      <title>Open charm tetraquarks in broken SU(3)_F symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prompted by a recent lattice QCD calculation, we review the SU(3) light quark flavor structure of charmed tetraquarks with spin-0 diquarks. Fermi statistics forces the three light quarks to be in the representation 3*x3*= 3+6*. This agrees with the weak repulsion in the 15 of the 3x8 in Dbar K scattering studied on the lattice. We analyze the 3+6* multiplet broken by the strange quark mass and determine the five independent masses from the known masses of diquarks. The mass of D^* _{s0}(2317) is predicted within 50 MeV accuracy. The recently observed D_s^{--}(2900) and D_s^{0}(2900), likely part of a I=1 multiplet, with flavor composition c* q* q' s and X_0(2900), an isosinglet with flavor composition c*s* ud, fit naturally in a 3+6* structure as the first radial excitations. We discuss also the decay modes of D^* _{s0}(2317), of the radial excitations and of the predicted particles.</description>

      <title>Degeneracy Enhancement of Neutron-Antineutron Oscillation in Neutron Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the fermion oscillation in a degenerate environment. The direct consequence is introducing a Pauli blocking factor $1 - f_i$, where $f_i$ is the phase space distribution function, for each intermediate mass eigenstate during propagation. It is then much easier for a state with larger existing fraction or density to oscillate into other states with less degeneracy while the reversed process is not enhanced. This can significantly modify the oscillation behaviors. We apply this degenerate fermion oscillation to a concrete scenario of neutron-antineutron oscillation in neutron star. It turns out antineutrons receive a standing fraction to annihilate with the environmental neutrons. The subsequent neutron star heating can put an extremely stringent bound on the baryon number violating cross mass term between neutron and antineutron.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method for the numerical computation of Fourier-Bessel transforms on a finite or infinite interval. The function to be transformed needs to be evaluated on a grid of points that is independent of the argument of the Bessel function. We demonstrate the accuracy of the algorithm for a wide range of functions, including those that appear in the context of transverse-momentum dependent parton distributions in Quantum Chromodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the positivity of parton distribution functions using the common $\overline{MS}$ factorization scheme. We find that in the perturbative regime $\overline{MS}$ PDFs inherit the strict positivity of physical PDFs. We explicitly discuss the scheme transformation by using suitable physical observables and find that $\overline{MS}$ PDFs are positive above the scale $Q^2$ &gt; 5 GeV^2. Finally, we comment on the direct counterpart of longitudinally polarized PDFs, finding agreement with the unpolarized counterpart.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Reactor Anti-Neutrino 5 MeV Bump with $^{13}$C Neutral-Current Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the first time, we systematically investigate the potential of neutrino-nucleus neutral current interactions with $^{13}$C to identify the origin of the 5 MeV bump observed in reactor anti-neutrino spectra in the inverse beta decay process. The distinctive signal is obtained from the de-excitation of $^{13}$C$^*$ into the ground state emitting a 3.685 MeV photon in various liquid scintillator detectors. Such an interaction predominantly occurs for the reactor anti-neutrinos within the energy range coinciding with the 5 MeV bump. For a detector that has a capability of 95\% level photon and electron separation and small thorium contamination below $5 \times 10^{-17}$ gr/gr located in a site with an overburden of about a few hundred m.w.e, such as the location of near detectors of RENO and Daya Bay will have a great sensitivity to resolve the 5 MeV bump. In addition, we propose a novel approach to track the time evolution of reactor isotopes by analyzing our $^{13}$C signal shedding light on the contributions from $^{235}$U or $^{239}$Pu to the observed bump. This provides an extra powerful tool in both discriminating the flux models and testing any new physics possibilities for the 5 MeV bump at 3$\sigma$ to 5$\sigma$ level with much less systematic uncertainties and assuming 10 kt.year of data collection. Our detector requirements are realistic, aligning well with recent studies conducted for existing or forthcoming experiments.</description>

Abstract: I present the computation of the two-loop amplitudes for the scattering of a lepton pair with an off-shell and an on-shell photon in massless QED. We apply modern techniques developed to tackle QCD amplitudes with many scales: we express the Feynman integrals in terms of a basis of special functions, and reconstruct the amplitudes from numerical finite-field evaluations. Our results complete the amplitude-level ingredients for the N3LO predictions of electron-muon scattering needed to meet the precision target of the future MUonE experiment.</description>

      <title>Effective Field Theory Framework: Construction Strategies and Soft Collinear Effective Theory (SCET)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective Field Theory (EFT) stands as a cornerstone in modern theoretical physics, offering a powerful framework for describing the dynamics of physical systems across a wide range of energy scales. This article provides an in-depth exploration of EFT and its diverse applications in various branches of physics. Beginning with a foundational overview of EFT principles, including its formulation, renormalization, and power counting rules, we delve into its versatility in addressing complex phenomena beyond the reach of traditional approaches. In particle physics, EFT techniques are indispensable for precision calculations and theoretical predictions, enabling the systematic treatment of quantum field theories at energies inaccessible to direct experimentation. Moreover, EFT plays a crucial role in understanding the low-energy dynamics of hadrons, nuclei, and other strongly interacting systems. This article aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to EFT and as an example of constructing EFT from a fundamental theory like QCD we explore how to construct a soft collinear effective theory SCET.</description>

      <title>Direct bounds on Left-Right gauge boson masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the third run of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is ongoing, the underlying theory that extends the Standard Model remains so far unknown. Left-Right Models (LRMs) introduce a new gauge sector, and can restore parity symmetry at high enough energies. If LRMs are indeed realized in nature, the mediators of the new weak force can be searched for in colliders via their direct production. We recast existing experimental limits from the LHC Run 2 and derive generic bounds on the masses of the heavy LRM gauge bosons. As a novelty, we discuss the dependence of the $W_R$ and $Z_R$ total decay width on the LRM scalar content, obtaining model-independent bounds within the specific realizations of the LRM scalar sectors analysed here. These bounds avoid the need to detail the spectrum of the scalar sector, and apply in the general case where no discrete symmetry is enforced. Moreover, we emphasize the impact on the $W_R$ production at LHC of general textures of the right-handed quark mixing matrix without manifest left-right symmetry. We find that the $W_R$ and $Z_R$ masses are constrained to lie above $2$ TeV and $4$ TeV, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08085v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extreme-mass-ratio inspirals consist of binary systems of compact objects, with orders of magnitude differences in their masses, in the regime where the dynamics are driven by gravitational wave emission. The unique nature of extreme-mass-ratio inspirals facilitates the exploration of diverse and stimulating tests related to various aspects of black holes and General Relativity. These tests encompass investigations into the spacetime geometry, the dissipation of the binary system energy and angular momentum, and the impact of the intrinsic non-linear effects of the gravitational interaction. This review accounts for the manifold opportunities for testing General Relativity, ranging from examinations of black hole properties to cosmological and multimessenger tests.</description>

      <title>An Area Law for Entanglement Entropy in Particle Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scattering cross section is the effective area of collision when two particles collide. Quantum mechanically, it is a measure of the probability for a specific process to take place. Employing wave packets to describe the scattering process, we compute the entanglement entropy in 2-to-2 scattering of particles in a general setting using the $S$-matrix formalism. Applying the optical theorem, we show that the linear entropy $\mathcal{E}_2$ is given by the elastic cross section $\sigma_{\text{el}}$ in unit of the transverse size $L^2$ of the wave packet, $\mathcal{E}_2 \sim \sigma_{\text{el}}/L^2$, when the initial states are not entangled. The result allows for dual interpretations of the entanglement entropy as an area and as a probability. Since $\sigma_{\text{el}}$ is generally believed, and observed experimentally, to grow with the collision energy $\sqrt{s}$ in the high energy regime, the result suggests a "second law" of entanglement entropy for high energy collisions. Furthermore, the Froissart bound places an upper limit on the entropy growth.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter-Radiation Scattering Enhances CMB Phase Shift through Dark Matter-loading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A phase shift in the acoustic oscillations of cosmic microwave background (CMB) spectra is a characteristic signature for the presence of non-photon radiation propagating differently from photons, even when the radiation couples to the Standard Model particles solely gravitationally. It is well-established that compared to the presence of free-streaming radiation, CMB spectra shift to higher $\ell$-modes in the presence of self-interacting non-photon radiation such as neutrinos and dark radiation. In this study, we further demonstrate that the scattering of non-photon radiation with dark matter can further amplify this phase shift. We show that when the energy density of the interacting radiation surpasses that of interacting dark matter around matter-radiation equality, the phase shift enhancement is proportional to the interacting dark matter abundance and remains insensitive to the radiation energy density. Given the presence of dark matter-radiation interaction, this additional phase shift emerges as a generic signature of models featuring an interacting dark sector or neutrino-dark matter scattering. Using neutrino-dark matter scattering as an example, we numerically calculate the amplified phase shift and offer an analytical interpretation of the result by modeling photon and neutrino perturbations with coupled harmonic oscillators. This framework also explains the phase shift contrast between self-interacting and free-streaming neutrinos. Fitting models with neutrino-dark matter or dark radiation-dark matter interactions to CMB and large-scale structure data, we validate the presence of the enhanced phase shift, affirmed by the linear dependence observed between the preferred regions of the sound horizon angle $\theta_s$ and interacting dark matter abundance.</description>

      <title>A search for an eV-scale sterile neutrino using improved high-energy $\nu_\mu$ event reconstruction in IceCube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This Letter presents the result of a 3+1 sterile neutrino search using 10.7 years of IceCube data. We analyze atmospheric muon neutrinos that traverse the Earth with energies ranging from 0.5 to 100 TeV, incorporating significant improvements in modeling neutrino flux and detector response compared to earlier studies. Notably, for the first time, we categorize data into starting and through-going events, distinguishing neutrino interactions with vertices inside or outside the instrumented volume, to improve energy resolution. The best-fit point for a 3+1 model is found to be at $\sin^2(2\theta_{24}) = 0.16$ and $\Delta m^{2}_{41} = 3.5$ eV$^2$, which agrees with previous iterations of this study. The result is consistent with the null hypothesis of no sterile neutrinos with a p-value of 3.1\%.</description>

      <title>Methods and stability tests associated with the sterile neutrino search using improved high-energy $\nu_\mu$ event reconstruction in IceCube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide supporting details for the search for a 3+1 sterile neutrino using data collected over eleven years at the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. The analysis uses atmospheric muon-flavored neutrinos from 0.5 to 100\, TeV that traverse the Earth to reach the IceCube detector, and finds a best-fit point at $\sin^2(2\theta_{24}) = 0.16$ and $\Delta m^{2}_{41} = 3.5$ eV$^2$ with a goodness-of-fit p-value of 12\% and consistency with the null hypothesis of no oscillations to sterile neutrinos with a p-value of 3.1\%. Several improvements were made over past analyses, which are reviewed in this article, including upgrades to the reconstruction and the study of sources of systematic uncertainty. We provide details of the fit quality and discuss stability tests that split the data for separate samples, comparing results. We find that the fits are consistent between split data sets.</description>

      <title>Superconducting multi-vortices and a novel BPS bound in chiral perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a novel BPS bound from chiral perturbation theory minimally coupled to electrodynamics at finite isospin chemical potential. At a critical value of the isospin chemical potential, a system of three first-order differential field equations (which implies the second-order field equations) for the gauge field and the hadronic profile can be derived from the requirement to saturate the bound. These BPS configurations represent magnetic multi-vortices with quantized flux supported by a superconducting current. The corresponding topological charge density is related to the magnetic flux density, but is screened by the hadronic profile. Such a screening effect allows to derive the maximal value of the magnetic field generated by these BPS magnetic vortices, being $B_{max}=2,04 \times 10^{14}G$. The solution for a single BPS vortex is discussed in detail, and some physical consequences, together with the comparison with the magnetic vortices in the Ginzburg-Landau theory at critical coupling, are described.</description>

      <title>Coupling renormalization flow in the strongly interacting regime of an asymptotically free quantum field theory in four dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a scalar quantum field theory with global $O(N)^3$ symmetry in four Euclidean dimensions and solve it numerically in closed form in the large-N limit. For imaginary tetrahedral coupling the theory is asymptotically free, with stable and real quantum effective action. We demonstrate the dynamical build-up of a strong interaction as the correlation length increases in a regime where the coupling renormalization flow remains well-defined in the infrared. This is in contrast to perturbative results of asymptotically free theories, which predict that the coupling becomes ill-defined in the infrared, like in quantum chromodynamics. These properties make the model an important laboratory for the study of strong-coupling phenomena in quantum field theory from first principles.</description>

      <title>Deep TOV to characterize Neutron Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrophysical observations, theoretical models, and terrestrial experiments probe different regions of neutron star (NS) interior. Therefore, it is essential to consistently combine the information from these sources. This analysis requires multiple evaluations of Tolman Oppenheimer Volkoff equations which can become computationally expensive with a large number of observations. Further, multi-messenger astronomy requires rapid NS characterization via gravitational waves for efficient electromagnetic follow-up. In this work, we develop a novel neural network-based map from the EoS curve to the mass and radius of cold non-rotating NS. We estimate a speed-up of an order of magnitude when compared with the state-of-the-art RePrimAnd solver and an average error of 1e-3 when calculating the mass and radius of the neutron star. Additionally, we also develop neural network solvers for obtaining EoS curves from a physics conforming EoS model, FRZ$\chi_{1.5}$. We utilize this efficient continuous map to measure the sensitivity of model parameters of FRZ$\chi_{1.5}$ towards mass and radius. We show that 8 out of 18 parameters of this model are sensitive by at least three orders of magnitude higher than the remaining 10 parameters. This information will be useful in further speeding up, as well as probing the crucial parameter space, in the parameter estimation from astrophysical observations using this physics-conforming EoS model.</description>

      <title>Quark and gluon momentum fractions in the pion and in the kaon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the full decomposition of the momentum fraction carried by quarks and gluons in the pion and the kaon. We employ three gauge ensembles generated with $N_f=2+1+1$ Wilson twisted-mass clover-improved fermions at the physical quark masses. For both mesons we perform a continuum extrapolation directly at the physical pion mass, which allows us to determine for the first time the momentum decomposition at the physical point. We find that the total momentum fraction carried by quarks is 0.532(56) and 0.618(32) and by gluons 0.388(49) and 0.408(61) in the pion and in the kaon, respectively, in the $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ scheme and at the renormalization scale of 2 GeV.
  Having computed both the quark and gluon contributions in the continuum limit, we find that the momentum sum is 0.926(68) for the pion and 1.046(90) for the kaon, verifying the momentum sum rule.</description>

      <title>On Holographic Vacuum Misalignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a bottom-up holographic model that provides the dual description of a strongly coupled field theory, in which the spontaneous breaking of an approximate global symmetry yields the SO(5)/SO(4) coset relevant to minimal composite-Higgs models. The gravity background is completely regular and smooth, and has an end of space that mimics confinement on the field theory side. We add to the gravity description a set of localised boundary terms, that introduce additional symmetry-breaking effects, capturing those that would result from coupling the dual strongly coupled field theory to an external, weakly coupled sector. Such terms encapsulate the gauging of a subgroup of the global $SO(5)$ symmetry of the dual field theory, as well as additional explicit symmetry-breaking effects. We show how to combine spurions and gauge fixing and how to take the appropriate limits, so as to respect gauge principles and avoid violations of unitarity.
  The interplay of bulk and boundary-localised couplings leads to the breaking of the SO(5) symmetry to either its SO(4) or SO(3) subgroup, via vacuum misalignment. In field theory terms, the model describes the spontaneous breaking of a SO(4) gauge symmetry to its SO(3) subgroup. We expose the implications of the higgsing phenomenon by computing the spectrum of fluctuations of the model, which we interpret in four-dimensional field-theory terms, for a few interesting choices of parameters. We conclude by commenting on the additional steps needed to build a realistic composite Higgs model.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal Structure of Quark-Gluon Plasma Unveiled Through Nuclear Deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is hindered by our limited understanding of its initial conditions, particularly its longitudinal structure. We propose a novel approach that entails analyzing collisions involving nuclei of similar masses but different deformations. This strategy allows us to vary the initial conditions and collective expansion of the QGP, while minimizing the influence of non-flow correlations. Using a dynamical transport model, we have for the first time extracted the complete longitudinal structure of elliptic flow ($v_2$). Our findings reveal that although deformation significantly enhances the overall magnitude of $v_2$, it does not alter its longitudinal profile. This approach not only enables the separation of the rapidity dependence of flow from its rapidity decorrelations but also prompts further investigation into other nuclear structural features, such as nuclear skin thickness, to advance our understanding of the QGP's initial conditions.</description>

Abstract: Several theories beyond the Standard Model (BSM) predict heavy neutral leptons, or long-lived particles with unique signatures which are difficult to reconstruct. Another area of interest are vector-like quarks which lie at the heart of many extensions to the Standard Model seeking to address the Hierarchy Problem, as they can naturally cancel the mass divergence for the Higgs boson. New results for these BSM searches from the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the LHC are presented.</description>

      <title>New channel to search for dark matter at Belle II</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.04252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new ``disappearing positron track'' channel at Belle II to search for dark matter, in which a positron that is produced at the primary interaction vertex scatters with the electromagnetic calorimeter to produce dark matter particles. Such scatterings can occur via either annihilation with atomic electrons, or the bremsstrahlung process with target nuclei. The main backgrounds are due to photons and neutrons that are produced in the same scatterings and then escape detection. We require a large missing energy and further veto certain activities in the KLM detector to suppress such backgrounds. To illustrate the sensitivity of the new channel, we consider a new physics model where dark matter interacts with the standard model via a dark photon, which decays predominantly to dark matter; we find that our proposed channel can probe some currently unexplored parameter space, surpassing both the mono-photon channel at Belle II and the NA64 constraints.</description>

Abstract: We consider the class of inclusive hadron collider processes in which one or more energetic jets are produced, possibly accompanied by colourless particles. We provide a general formulation of a slicing scheme for this class of processes, by identifying the various contributions that need to be computed up to next-to-leading order (NLO) in QCD perturbation theory. We focus on two novel observables, the one-jet resolution variable $\Delta E_t$ and the $n$-jet resolution variable $k_{T}^{\mathrm{ness}}$, and explicitly compute all the ingredients needed to carry out NLO computations using these variables. We contrast the behaviour of these variables when the slicing parameter becomes small. In the case of $k_{T}^{\mathrm{ness}}$ we also present results for the hadroproduction of multiple jets.</description>

      <title>Naturalness-motivated composite Higgs model for generating the top Yukawa coupling</title>

Abstract: The large top Yukawa coupling results in the top quark contributing significantly to the quantum correction of the Higgs mass term. Traditionally, this effect is canceled by the presence of top partners in symmetry-based models. However, the absence of light top partners poses a challenge to the Naturalness of these models. In this paper, we study a model based on composite Higgs with the top Yukawa coupling originating from dimension-six four-fermion operators. The low cutoff scale of the top quark loop required by the Naturalness principle can be realized with a light gauge boson $E_\mu$ which connects the hyperfermions and top quarks. A scalar-less dynamical model with weakly coupled extended $SU(4)_{EC}$ gauge group is presented. The model features an $E_\mu$ boson and a $Z'_E$ boson both at the sub-TeV scale, which lead to a rich phenomenology, especially in the top physics.</description>

Abstract: This note discusses the matter of probing Beyond the Standard Model physics and how, to succeed in this quest, the interpretations of the Standard Model regarding observed phenomena must be utilized with caution. We give several specific examples of why this is necessary and assess general scenarios in which it is specially important. In particular, we call attention to the fact that once the Standard Model (SM) is finally replaced, the parameters of the new theory which embed those of the SM must be rederived directly from data instead of inherited through their expected relations with those of the SM.</description>

Abstract: We compute the two-loop helicity amplitudes for the scattering of five gluons, including all contributions beyond the leading-color approximation. The analytic expressions are represented as linear combinations of transcendental functions with rational coefficients, which we reconstruct from finite-field samples obtained with the numerical unitarity method. Guided by the requirement of removing unphysical singularities, we find a remarkably compact generating set of rational coefficients, which we are able to display entirely in the manuscript. We implement our results in a public code, which provides efficient and reliable numerical evaluations for phenomenological applications.</description>

Abstract: We complete the computation of two-loop helicity amplitudes required to obtain next-to-next-to-leading order QCD corrections for three-jet production at hadron colliders, including all contributions beyond the leading-color approximation. The analytic expressions are reconstructed from finite-field samples obtained with the numerical unitarity method. We find that the reconstruction is significantly facilitated by exploiting the overlaps between rational coefficient functions of quark and gluon processes, and we display their compact generating sets in the appendix of the paper. We implement our results in a public code, and demonstrate its suitability for phenomenological applications.</description>

      <title>One-loop five-parton amplitudes in the NMRK limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse the real part of one-loop five-parton amplitudes in the next-to-multi-Regge kinematic (NMRK) limit, to leading power, and to finite order in the dimensional regularisation parameter. To leading logarithmic (LL) accuracy, it is known that five-parton amplitudes in this limit are given to all-orders by a single factorised expression, in which the pair of partons which are not well-separated in rapidity are described by a two-parton emission vertex. In this study, we investigate the one-loop amplitudes at next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) accuracy, and find that is has a more complex structure. In particular, it is found that the purely gluonic amplitudes are compatible with an analogous factorisation of individual colour structures. From the one-loop amplitudes we extract one-loop two-parton emission vertices, which are functions of a subset of the momenta of the amplitude. In the multi-Regge kinematic (MRK) limit, the vertices themselves factorise into the known one-loop single-parton emission vertices and Lipatov vertex, with rapidity dependence governed by the one-loop gluon Regge trajectory, as required by compatibility with the known MRK limit of amplitudes. The one-loop two-parton emission vertices are necessary ingredients for the construction of the next-to-next-to leading order (NNLO) jet impact factors in the BFKL framework.</description>

Abstract: Plateau-plateau transition in integer quantum Hall effect is a phase transition between metal and insulator. The behavior how the width $\Delta B$ of the transition changes with temperature and frequency of radiations imposed has been explored extensively. It decreases with the decrease of temperature and frequency, but saturates at critical temperature or frequency. We have recently discussed the effect of axion dark matter on the saturation. The axion generates radiations under strong magnetic field in the experiment of quantum Hall effect. The radiations play a similar role to the one of radiations imposed externally. In this paper we discuss in detail how the width behaves in temperature and frequency under the effect of axion dark matter. We show that the axion effect can be observable in low temperature roughly below $100$mK. According to our detailed analysis of the saturation, we find that critical frequency of saturation observed in previous experiment strongly suggests axion mass $m_a=(0.95\sim 0.99)\times 10^{-5}$eV.</description>

      <title>Single production of vectorlike quarks with charge 5/3 at the 14 TeV LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01248v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vectorlike quarks have been predicted in many new physics scenarios beyond the Standard Model (SM), which can have sizable couplings to first generation quarks without conflicting with current experimental constraints. In a framework of the SM simply extended by an SU(2) doublet $\left(X,T\right)$ including a vectorlike quark $X$~(VLQ-$X$), with electric charge $|Q_{X}| = 5/3$, we investigate the single production of the VLQ-$X$ induced by the couplings between the VLQ-$X$ with the first and the third generation quarks at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) Run-III and High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) operating at $\sqrt{s}=14$~TeV. The signal is searched in events including same-sign dileptons (electrons or muons), one $b$-tagged jet and missing energy, where the X quark is assumed to decay into a top quark and a W boson, both decaying leptonically. After a rapid simulation of signal and background events, the 95\% CL exclusion limits and the $5\sigma$ discovery reach are respectively obtained at the 14 TeV LHC with an integrated luminosity of 300 and 3000 fb$^{-1}$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Secondary massive quarks with the Mellin-Barnes expansion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Processes involving only massless or massive quarks at tree-level get corrections from massive (lighter, heavier, or equal-mass) secondary quarks starting at two-loop order, generated by a virtual gluon splitting into a massive quark anti-quark pair. One convenient approach to compute such two-loop corrections is starting with the one-loop diagram considering the virtual gluon massive. Carrying out a dispersive integral with a suitable kernel over the gluon mass yields the desired two-loop result. On the other hand, the Mellin-Barnes representation can be used to compute the expansion of Feynman integrals in powers of a small parameter. In this article we show how to combine these two ideas to obtain the corresponding expansions for large and small secondary quark masses to arbitrarily high orders in a straightforward manner. Furthermore, the convergence radius of both expansions can be shown to overlap, being each series rapidly convergent. The advantage of our method is that the Mellin representation is obtained directly for the full matrix element from the same one-loop computation one needs in large-$\beta_0$ computations, therefore many existing results can be recycled. With minimal modifications, the strategy can be applied to compute the expansion of the one-loop correction coming from a massive gauge boson. We apply this method to a plethora of examples, in particular those relevant for factorized cross sections involving massless and massive jets, recovering known results and obtaining new ones. Another bonus of our approach is that, postponing the Mellin inversion, one can obtain the small- and large-mas expansions for the RG-evolved jet functions. In many cases, the series can be summed up yielding closed expressions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14441v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we have studied the realizations of the popular TM1 neutrino mixing and neutrino $\mu$-$\tau$ reflection symmetry (which are well motivated from the neutrino oscillation data and lead to interesting phenomenological consequences) in the most minimal seesaw model with a pseudo-Dirac pair of right-handed neutrinos, and their consequences for leptogenesis. In order to realize the low-scale resonant leptogenesis scenario, we have considered two possible ways of generating the tiny mass splitting between the two right-handed neutrinos: one way is to modify their Majorana mass matrix to a form as shown in Eq. (25); the other way is to consider the renormalization-group corrections for their masses. For the $\mu$-$\tau$ reflection symmetry, in order for leptogenesis to work, we have further considered the flavor-dependent conversion efficiencies from the lepton asymmetry to the baryon asymmetry during the sphaleron processes, and its breaking via the renormalization-group corrections.</description>

      <title>Gauge coupling unification and proton decay via 45 Higgs boson in SU(5) GUT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the gauge coupling unification (GCU) and proton decay in a non-supersymmetric SU(5) grand unified theory (GUT) incorporating a 45 representation Higgs field. Our analysis is based on the assumption that Georgi-Jarlskog-type mass matrices for fermions are responsible for explaining the mass ratio of the strange quark and the muon. We examine the conditions of GCU, taking into account the possibility that certain components of the 45 Higgs field have masses much smaller than the GUT scale. We have found that to satisfy the GCU conditions, at least two components of the 45 Higgs field should have such small masses. We search the parameter space to identify regions where the GCU conditions are satisfied, in the scenarios where two or three components of the 45 Higgs boson are hierarchically light. If the colored Higgs component of the 45 Higgs boson has a mass much smaller than the GUT scale, proton decay via colored Higgs boson exchange can occur with an observably large rate. We estimate the mass bounds for the colored Higgs component from the proton decay search at Super- Kamiokande and thereby further restrict the parameter space.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the light quarkonium hybrid mesons of various spin-parities in QCD. Considering different interpolating currents made of the valence light quarks and single gluon, we calculate the mass and current coupling of the strange and nonstrange members of light hybrid mesons by including into computations the nonperturbative quark and gluon condensates up to ten dimensions in order to increase the accuracy of the results. The obtained results may be useful for future experimental searches of these hypothetical states. They can also be used in the calculations of different parameters related to the decays/interactions of light hybrid mesons to/with other states.</description>

      <title>Baryonic Vortex Phase and Magnetic Field Generation in QCD with Isospin and Baryon Chemical Potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel baryonic vortex phase in low energy dense QCD with finite baryon and isospin chemical potentials. It is known that the homogeneous charged pion condensate emerges as a ground state at finite isospin chemical potential, and therein arises the Abrikosov vortex lattice with an applied magnetic field. We first demonstrate that a vortex with the same quantized magnetic flux as the conventional Abrikosov vortex, carries a baryon number captured by the third homotopy group of Skyrmions, once we take into account a modulation of the neutral pion inside the vortex core. Such a vortex-Skyrmion state is therefore dubbed the baryonic vortex. We further reveal that when the baryon chemical potential is above a critical value, the baryonic vortex has negative tension measured from the charged pion condensation. It implies that the phase, in which such vortices emerge spontaneously without an external magnetic field, would take over the ground state at high baryon density. Such a new phase contributes to the comprehension of QCD phase diagram and relates to the generation of magnetic fields inside neutron stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The internal motion of partons inside hadrons has been studied through its impact on very low transverse momentum spectra of Drell-Yan (DY) pairs created in hadron-hadron collisions. We study DY production at next-to-leading order using the Parton Branching (PB) method which describes the evolution of transverse momentum dependent parton distributions. The main focus is on studying the intrinsic transverse momentum distribution (intrinsic-$k_T$) as a function of the center-of-mass energy $\sqrt s$. While collinear parton shower Monte Carlo event generators require intrinsic transverse momentum distributions strongly dependent on $\sqrt s$, this is not the case for the PB method. We perform a detailed study of the impact of soft parton emissions. We show that by requiring a minimal transverse momentum, $q_0$, of a radiated parton, a dependence of the width of the intrinsic-$k_T$ distribution as a function of $\sqrt{s}$ is observed. This dependence becomes stronger with increasing $q_0$.</description>

Abstract: A global interpretation of several significant indications of scalar resonances observed at LHC is achieved using the Georgi Machacek model. Among many other consequences, one predicts large cross sections for the processes ggFH(320)-&gt;h(125)h(125) and A(151)A(151) and ggF-&gt;A(420)-&gt;H(320)Z, where H(320) has been observed in A(420)-&gt;H(320)Z-&gt;bbbbl+l- and where A(151) is observed into two photons accompanied by a b jet, a lepton or missing transverse energy. We predict that ggF-&gt;H(320) has a cross section of about 2000 fb with a BR into h(125)(125) of 17% and into A(151)A(151) of 45%. Henceforth we predict that ggF-&gt;H(320)-&gt;hh will dominate over the SM process h*-&gt;hh, where h is the SM h(125) scalar. One expects that H(320)-&gt;A(151)A(151) can be observed into bbbb, becoming one of the most significant BSM phenomena identified so far. Arguments in favor of a SUSY version of GM are also provided.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14480v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Sp(2$N_c$) gauge dynamics with two Dirac fermion flavours in the fundamental representation. These strongly coupled systems underlie some composite Higgs models with a global symmetry breaking pattern SU(4)$\rightarrow$Sp(4), leading to a light quartet of pseudo-Goldstone bosons that can play the role of the Higgs. Including four-fermion interactions can rotate the vacuum to a technicolour breaking pattern. Using gauge/gravity duality, we study the underlying gauge dynamics. Our model incorporates the $N_c$-specific running of the fermion anomalous dimension and can thus distinguish between specific gauge groups. We determine the bound-state spectrum of the UV SU(4)$\rightarrow$Sp(4) symmetry breaking model, also including fermion masses and mass splitting, and display the $N_c$ dependence. The inclusion of a four-fermion interaction shows the emergence of three Goldstone bosons on the path to technicolour dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.04708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that effective actions for warped compactifications can be subtle, with large deviations in the effective potential from naive expectations owing to constraint equations from the higher-dimensional metric. We demonstrate this deviation in a careful computation of the effective potential for the conifold deformation parameter of the Klebanov-Strassler solution. The uncorrected naive effective potential for the conifold was previously used to argue that the Klebanov-Strassler background would be destabilized by antibranes placed at the conifold infrared tip unless the flux was uncomfortably large. We show this result is too strong because the formerly neglected constraint equations eliminate the features of the potential that allowed for the instability in the de Sitter uplift of the KKLT scenario.</description>

Abstract: Nuclear structure at short $NN$-distances is still poorly understood. In particular, the full quantum structure of the nucleus with a correlated $NN$-pair is a challenge to theory. So far, model descriptions have been limited to the average mean-field picture of the remaining nuclear system after removing the $NN$-pair. In the recent experiment of the BM@N Collaboration at JINR \cite{Patsyuk:2021fju}, the reactions $^{12}\mbox{C}(p,2pn_s)^{10}\mbox{B}$ and $^{12}\mbox{C}(p,2pp_s)^{10}\mbox{Be}$ induced by the hard elastic $pp$ scattering were studied. Here, $n_s$ or $p_s$ denote the undetected slow nucleon in the rest frame of $^{12}\mbox{C}$. In contrast to the previous experiments, the residual bound nucleus was also detected which requires a new level of theoretical understanding. In the present work, we apply the technique of fractional parentage coefficients of the translationally-invariant shell model (TISM) to calculate the spectroscopic amplitude of the system $NN-B$ where $B$ is the remaining nuclear system. The spectroscopic amplitude enters the full amplitude of a nuclear reaction. The relative $NN-B$ wave function is no longer a free parameter of the model but is uniquely related to the internal state of $B$. The interaction of the target proton with the $NN$-pair is considered in the impulse approximation. We also include the initial- and final state interactions of absorptive type as well as the single charge exchange processes. Our calculations are in a reasonable agreement with the BM@N data.</description>

      <title>Numerical 1-loop correction from a potential yielding ultra-slow-roll dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05694v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single-field models of inflation might lead to amplified scalar fluctuations on small scales due, for example, to a transient ultra-slow-roll phase. It was argued by Kristiano $\&amp;$ Yokoyama in arXiv:2211.03395 that the enhanced amplitude of the scalar power spectrum on small scales has the potential to induce a sizeable 1-loop correction to the spectrum at large scales. In this work, we repeat the calculation for the 1-loop correction presented in arXiv:2211.03395. We closely follow their assumptions but evaluate the loop numerically. This allows us to consider both instantaneous and smooth transitions between the slow-roll and ultra-slow-roll phases. In particular, we generate models featuring realistic, smooth evolution from an analytic inflationary potential. We find that, upon fixing the amplitude of the peak in the power spectrum at short scales, the resulting 1-loop correction is not significantly reduced by considering a smooth evolution. In particular, for a power spectrum with a tree-level peak amplitude potentially relevant for small-scale phenomenology, e.g. primordial black hole production, the 1-loop correction on large scales is a few percent of the tree-level power spectrum.</description>

      <title>Astronomical Image Blurring from Transversely Correlated Quantum Gravity Fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06757</link>

Abstract: Quantum fluctuations in spacetime can, in some cases, lead to distortion in astronomical images of faraway objects. In particular, a stochastic model of quantum gravity predicts an accumulated fluctuation in the path length $\Delta L$ with variance $\langle \Delta L^2\rangle\sim l_pL$ over a distance $L$, similar to a random walk, and assuming no spatial correlation above length $l_p$; it has been argued that such an effect is ruled out by observation of sharp images from distant stars. However, in other theories, such as the pixellon (modeled on the Verlinde-Zurek (VZ) effect), quantum fluctuations can still accumulate as in the random walk model while simultaneously having large distance correlations in the fluctuations. Using renormalization by analytic continuation, we derive the correlation transverse to the light propagation, and show that image distortion effects in the pixellon model are strongly suppressed in comparison to the random walk model, thus evading all existing and future constraints. We also find that the diffraction of light rays does not lead to qualitative changes in the blurring effect.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Recombination in the Presence of Primordial Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) may explain observations of magnetic fields on extragalactic scales. They are most cleanly constrained by measurements of cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) anisotropies. Their effects on cosmic recombination may even be at the heart of the resolution of the Hubble tension. We present the most detailed analysis of the effects of PMFs on cosmic recombination to date. To this end we extend the public magneto-hydrodynamic code {\sl ENZO} with a new cosmic recombination routine, Monte-Carlo simulations of Lyman-$\alpha$ photon transport, and a Compton drag term in the baryon momentum equation. The resulting code allows us, for the first time, to realistically predict the impact of PMFs on the cosmic ionization history and the clumping of baryons during cosmic recombination. Our results identify the importance of mixing of Lyman-$\alpha$ photons between overdense- and underdense- regions for small PMF strength. This mixing speeds up recombination beyond the speed-up due to clumping. For non-helical PMFs with a Batchelor spectrum we find a surprising dependency of results on ultra-violet magnetic modes. The present study shall serve as a theoretical foundation for a future precise comparison of recombination with PMFs to CMB data.</description>

      <title>Interacting supernovae as high-energy multimessenger transients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17239v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiwavelength observations have revealed that dense, confined circumstellar material (CCSM) commonly exists in the vicinity of supernova (SN) progenitors, suggesting enhanced mass losses years to centuries before their core collapse. Interacting SNe, which are powered or aided by interaction with the CCSM, are considered to be promising high-energy multimessenger transient sources. We present detailed results of broadband electromagnetic emission, following the time-dependent model proposed in the previous work on high-energy SN neutrinos [K. Murase, New prospects for detecting high-energy neutrinos from nearby supernovae, Phys. Rev. D 97, 081301(R) (2018)]. We investigate electromagnetic cascades in the presence of Coulomb losses, including inverse-Compton and synchrotron components that significantly contribute to MeV and high-frequency radio bands, respectively. We also discuss the application to SN 2023ixf.</description>

      <title>Quantum Gravity Effective Action Provides Entropy of The Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09672v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effective action in renormalizable quantum theory of gravity provides entropy because the total Hamiltonian vanishes. Since it is a renormalization group invariant that is constant in the process of cosmic evolution, we can show conservation of entropy, which is an ansatz in the standard cosmology. Here, we study renormalizable quantum gravity that exhibits conformal dominance at high energy beyond the Planck scale. The current entropy of the universe is derived by calculating the effective action under the scenario of quantum gravity inflation caused by its dynamics. We then argue that ghost modes must be unphysical but are necessary for the Hamiltonian to vanish and for entropy to exist in gravitational systems.</description>

      <title>Towards the quark mass dependence of $T_{cc}^+$ from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14715v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $DD^*$ scattering phase shifts in the $T_{cc}^+=cc\bar{u}\bar{d}$ channel are extracted from lattice QCD for five different charm quark masses and a fixed light-quark mass corresponding to $m_\pi\simeq 280$~MeV. The phase shifts are analysed employing two approaches: effective range expansion and Lippmann--Schwinger equation derived in the effective field theory. In the latter case, the results imply an attraction at short range parametrised by contact terms and a slight repulsion at long range mediated by one-pion exchange with $m_\pi &gt;m_{D^*}-m_D$. The poles in the amplitude across the complex energy plane are extracted and their trajectories are discussed as the charm quark mass is varied. Two complex conjugate poles corresponding to a resonance below threshold are found for $m_c$ close to the physical value. They turn into a pair of virtual states at the largest $m_c$ studied. With further increasing $m_c$, one virtual pole representing $T_{cc}^+$ is expected to move towards the two-body threshold and turn into a bound state. The light-quark mass dependence of the $T_{cc}^+$ pole is briefly discussed using the data on $DD^*$ scattering from other lattice collaborations.</description>

      <title>Confronting Dark Matter Capture Rate with Continuous Gravitational Wave Probe of Local Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continuous gravitational waves (CGWs) from various astrophysical sources are one of the many future probes of upcoming Gravitational Wave (GW) search missions. Neutron stars (NSs) with deformity are one of the leading sources of CGW emissions. In this work, for the first time, a novel attempt to estimate the dark matter (DM) capture rate is performed using CGW as the probe to the local NS population. Competitive bounds on DM capture from the local NS population are reported when compared with DM direct search experiments and other astrophysical observations.</description>
