      <title>Homogenization of a semilinear elliptic problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the homogenization of a semilinear elliptic equation where the coefficients of the second-order differential operator may be discontinuous. We establish the existence and uniqueness of the fine-scale solution, followed by an a priori estimate. The homogenized equation is derived using two-scale convergence, and a corrector result is also provided</description>

      <title>Existence result for a system of two semilinear coupled Poisson equations with asymptotically linear nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the existence of at least one solution to a system of two semilinear coupled Poisson equations with asymptotically linear nonlinearities, without imposing the Ambrosetti-Rabinowitz condition or any of its refinements. The proof relies on a generalized saddle point theorem due to Colin and the author \cite{CS}.</description>

      <title>The effect of "very fast" dispersal on two species competition with drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical theory predicts that for two competing populations subject to a constant downstream drift, the faster disperser will competitively exclude the slower disperser. In the current work, we consider a novel model of a "much faster" dispersing species, modeled via a $p$-Laplacian operator, competing with a slower disperser. We prove global existence of weak solutions to this model for any positive initial condition, in the regime $\frac{3}{2} &lt; p &lt;2$. Counterintuitively, we show that while the faster disperser always wins - the "much faster" disperser could actually lose, for certain initial data. Several numerical simulations are conducted to confirm our analytical findings. Our results have implications for biodiversity, refuge design, and improved biological control, driven by habitat fragmentation and climate change.</description>

      <title>A convergence rate result for front tracking approximations of conservation laws with discontinuous flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the initial value problem for a scalar conservation law in one space dimension with a
  single spatial flux discontinuity, the so-called two-flux problem. We prove that a well-known
  front tracking algorithm has a convergence rate of at least one-half. The fluxes are required to be smooth, but are not required to be
  convex or concave, monotone, or even unimodal. We require that there are no more than
  finitely many flux crossings, but we do not require that they satisfy the so-called crossing condition.
  If both fluxes are strictly increasing or strictly decreasing then our analysis yields a
  convergence rate of one, in agreement with a recent result. Similarly, if the fluxes
  are equal, i.e., there is no flux discontinuity, we obtain a convergence rate of one
  in this case also, in agreement with a classical result.
  The novelty of this paper is that the class of discontinuous-flux conservation laws
  for which there is a front tracking error estimate is expanded, and that the method of analysis is new;
  we do not use the Kuznetsov lemma which is commonly used for this type of analysis.</description>

      <title>On parameterized nonlocal-fractional transmission problems and associated function spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a family of seamlessly coupled nonlocal models associated with transmission conditions across an interface. The models are derived from the variation of a parameterized family of energies consisting of a fractional type Dirichlet energy on one subdomain and a nonlocal Dirichlet energy involving a finite range of interactions on another subdomain. We present the rigorous mathematical formulation and its well-posedness. We also investigate the behavior of the model in various limiting regimes.</description>

      <title>Stability of standing waves for all frequencies to nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with potentials in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the orbital stability of standing waves for one-dimensional nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with potentials. We show that the standing waves are orbitally stable for all frequencies in the $L^{2}$- subcritical and critical cases. Since the presence of potentials breaks the scale invariance of the equations, it is a delicate problem to apply the abstract theory of Grillakis, Shatah, and Strauss (1987) directly without a perturbative argument. For this reason, little is known about the orbital stability of standing waves for \textit{all} frequencies in the non-scale-invariant setting. We overcome this difficulty by employing the approach of Noris, Tavares, and Verzini (2014).</description>

      <title>Global boundedness of solutions of degenerate and non-uniform parabolic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $2 \le N\in\mathbb{N}$, $\Omega$ be a bounded open in $\mathbb{R}^{N}$, $T\in (0,\infty)$, $Q=\Omega\times (0,T)$, $u$ be a weak solution of parabolic equation $\displaystyle \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} -Lu= f$, where $L$ is an elliptic operator on a space of functions on $Q$. The coefficients of $L$ may not be bounded, not strictly nor uniformly elliptic, and not of Muckenhoupt type. We obtain global boundedness of $u$. Our result can be applied to $u$, which may vanish on $(A\times (0,T))\cup (\Omega\times \{0\})$ of the boundary of $Q$ and is free outside this set.</description>

      <title>Robin Problems of Elliptic Equations on Rough Domains: H\"older Regularity, Green's Functions, and Harmonic Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $n\ge 2$ and $s\in (n-2,n)$. Assume that $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is a one-sided bounded non-tangentially accessible domain with $s$-Ahlfors regular boundary and $\sigma$ is the surface measure on the boundary of $\Omega$, denoted by $\partial \Omega$. Let $\beta$ be a non-negative measurable function on $\partial \Omega$ satisfying $\beta\in L^{q_0}(\partial \Omega,\sigma)~\text{with}~ q_0 \in(\frac{s}{s+2-n},\infty]~\text{and}\ \beta\ge a_0~\text{on}~E_0\subset \partial \Omega, $ where $a_0$ is a given positive constant and $E_0\subset \partial \Omega$ is a $\sigma$-measurable set with $\sigma(E_0)&gt;0$. In this article, for any $f\in L^p(\partial \Omega,\sigma)$ with $p\in(s/(s+2-n),\infty]$, we obtain the existence and uniqueness, the global H\"older regularity, and the boundary Harnack inequality of the weak solution to the Robin problem $$\begin{cases} -\mathrm{div}(A\nabla u) = 0~~&amp;\text{in}~\Omega,\\ A\nabla u\cdot \boldsymbol{\nu}+\beta u = f~~&amp;\text{on}~\partial \Omega, \end{cases} $$ where the coefficient matrix $A$ is real-valued, bounded and measurable and satisfies the uniform ellipticity condition and where $\boldsymbol{\nu}$ denotes the outward unit normal to $\partial\Omega$. Furthermore, we establish the existence, upper bound pointwise estimates, and the H\"older regularity of Green's functions associated with this Robin problem. As applications, we further prove that the harmonic measure associated with this Robin problem is mutually absolutely continuous with respect to the surface measure $\sigma$ and also provide a quantitative characterization of mutual absolute continuity at small scales. These results extend the corresponding results established by David et al. [arXiv: 2410.23914] via weakening their assumption that $\beta$ is a given positive constant.</description>

      <title>Stochastic diffusive energy balance climate model with a multiplicative noise modeling the Solar variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the existence, uniqueness, and comparison of solutions for a nonlinear stochastic parabolic partial differential equation that includes the Solar variability in terms of a multiplicative Wiener cylindrical noise in the term of the absorbed radiative energy in a simplified diffusive one-dimensional Energy Balance Model. We introduce a hybrid co-albedo nonlinear term, which has the advantages of both the Sellers model, as it is a continuous function, and the Budyko model, as it has an infinite derivative at $u=-10^C$ (the temperature at which ice is white), allowing the location of the polar ice caps to be easily detected. We show that, despite the lack of differentiability of this function, the method of successive approximations can be satisfactorily applied.</description>

      <title>Necessary and Sufficient Conditions for the Maz'ya-Shaposhnikova Formula in (Fractional) Sobolev Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic behavior, as $\varepsilon \to 0$, of nonlocal functionals $$ \mathcal{F}_{\varepsilon}(u) = \iint_{\mathbb{R}^N\times\mathbb{R}^N}
  \rho_{\varepsilon}(y-x)\,|u(x)-u(y)|^p\,dx\,dy,\qquad u\in L^p(\mathbb{R}^N),\quad 1\leqslant p&lt;\infty, $$ associated with a general family of nonnegative measurable kernels $\{\rho_{\varepsilon}\}_{\varepsilon&gt;0}$. Our primary aim is to single out the weakest moment-type assumptions on the family $\{\rho_{\varepsilon}\}_{\varepsilon&gt;0}$ that are necessary and sufficient for the pointwise convergence $$ \lim_{\varepsilon\to 0}\mathcal{F}_{\varepsilon}(u)=2\|u\|_{L^p}^p $$ to hold for every $u$ in a prescribed subspace of $L^p(\mathbb{R}^N)$. In the canonical smooth regime of compactly supported functions ($u\in C_c^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^N)$) we show that convergence occurs when two optimal conditions are satisfied: (i) a mass-escape condition, and (ii) a short-range attenuation effect, expressed by the vanishing as $\varepsilon\to 0$ of the kernels' $p$-moments in any fixed neighborhood of the origin. This general framework recovers the classical Maz'ya--Shaposhnikova theorem for fractional-type kernels and extends the convergence result to a much broader class of interaction profiles, which may be non-symmetric and non-homogeneous. Using a density argument that preserves the moment assumptions, we prove that the same necessary and sufficient conditions remain valid in the integer-order Sobolev setting ($u\in W^{1,p}(\mathbb{R}^N)$). Finally, by adapting the method to fractional Sobolev spaces $W^{s,p}(\mathbb{R}^N)$ with $s\in(0,1)$, we recover the Maz'ya-Shaposhnikova formula and extend it under analogous abstract conditions on the family $\{\rho_{\varepsilon}\}_{\varepsilon&gt;0}$.</description>

      <title>Global energy minimizers for a diffusion-aggregation model on sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the ground states of a free energy functional on sphere. The energy consists of an entropy and a nonlocal interaction term that are in competition with each other, as they favour spreading and aggregation, respectively. Specifically, the entropy corresponds to slow nonlinear diffusion and the interaction term is modeled by a quadratic interaction potential. We investigate the transitions that occur in the equilibria and the global minimizers of the energy, in terms of the strength of the nonlocal attractive interactions. We consider separately various ranges of the diffusion exponent, which give qualitatively different behaviours of equilibria and ground states. In terms of applications, we note that the energy we consider here is a generalization to nonlinear diffusion of the Onsager free energy with dipolar potential, used to study phase transitions in polymer orientation.</description>

      <title>Large Deflections of A Flow-Driven Cantilever with Kutta-Joukowski Flow Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a canonical flow-structure system modeling airflow over a cantilevered beam. Flow-beam interactions arise in flight systems as well as alternative energy technologies, such as piezoelectric energy harvesters. A potential flow, given through a hyperbolic equation, captures the airflow interacting with a beam clamped on one end and free on the other. The dynamic coupling occurs through an impermeability condition across the beam; in the wake the Kutta-Joukowski flow condition is imposed. Several challenges arise in the analysis, including the unboundedness of the flow domain, lack of interface trace regularity, and flow conditions which give rise to a dynamic and mixed boundary value problem. Additionally, we consider a recent nonlinear model capturing the cantilever large deflections through the effects of inextensibility. We produce a viable underlying semigroup for the model's linearization, which includes a flow regularity theory. Then, exploiting higher regularity nonlinear estimates for the beam, we utilize a semigroup perturbation to obtain local-in-time strong solutions for the nonlinear dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a Schr\"odinger-type equation featuring a derivative in the nonlinear term and incorporating diffusion effects. This type of equation arises in various physical applications, such as modeling low-order magnetization in ferromagnetic nanocables and describing the collision of ferromagnetic solitons in weakly ferromagnetic media. We establish a local well-posedness result for the Cauchy problem associated with this model and analyze the convergence and error order of a Fourier spectral numerical scheme for approximating its solutions in the periodic setting. Additionally, we investigate the behavior of solutions in certain asymptotic regimes, both analytically and through numerical experiments, by examining limiting cases of the model's parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In mathematical physics it is of interest to study Schr\"odinger equations with friction and possessing an invariant measure. The focus of this paper is the Cauchy problem for the Schr\"odinger equation $\p_t f - i \mathscr L f = 0$, where $\mathscr L = \Delta - \sa x,\nabla\da$ is the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operator. We use this as a model to stimulate interest in a new class of possibly degenerate dispersive equations which cannot be treated by the existing theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the $L^p$-boundedness of the Hodge projection in the setting of manifolds with ends. We examine its relationship to the Riesz transform and the space of bounded harmonic functions. In particular, we explore how the $L^p$-boundedness of the Hodge projection is connected to the structure of $L^2$ harmonic one-forms and, subsequently, to the space of bounded harmonic functions.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a nonlocal extension of the Kim-Kim-Suzuki (KKS) phase-field corrosion model aimed at bridging local and nonlocal corrosion modeling approaches, such as phase-field and peridynamic frameworks. In this formulation, classical gradient operators are replaced with integral operators defined over a finite interaction horizon, naturally embedding an intrinsic length scale that aligns with nonlocal theories like peridynamics. Under precise assumptions on function spaces and kernel functions, we define a nonlocal free energy that integrates a standard bulk free energy density with a nonlocal interaction term. Through differentiation in an appropriate Hilbert space, we derive evolution equations, yielding a nonlocal Allen--Cahn equation for the phase-field and a nonlocal Cahn--Hilliard-type equation for the concentration. The latter is expressed as a gradient flow in a metric induced by the inverse of the nonlocal operator, mirroring the classical \(H^{-1}\) metric for conserved dynamics. We establish the well-posedness of these equations using Galerkin approximations, uniform energy estimates, and compactness arguments. Furthermore, we prove the convergence of the nonlocal model to its local KKS counterpart as the interaction horizon approaches zero, effectively unifying local and nonlocal perspectives. Numerical experiments, implemented via finite difference spatial discretization and explicit time-stepping, demonstrate the effects of nonlocality and confirm the theoretical convergence, reinforcing the connection between the two modeling paradigms.</description>

      <title>Global dynamics of damped Euler systems with exterior potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the three-dimensional isothermal Euler equations with linear damping and an exterior potential. For sufficiently large damping, we prove global well-posedness for arbitrarily large initial data by combining a parabolic comparison principle with scaled high-order energy estimates ensuring uniform density bounds. In the small-data regime with arbitrary damping, we establish global classical solutions and derive sharp algebraic decay rates via spectral analysis and frequency decomposition, and further prove their optimality under a mild non-degeneracy condition. Finally, for the pressureless damped system, we construct a weighted functional showing that solutions can blow up in finite time when the damping is insufficient, highlighting a qualitative difference from the pressured case.</description>

      <title>Wave packet decompositions and sharp bilinear estimates for rough Hamiltonian flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to prove bilinear $L^p$ estimates for rough dispersive evolutions satisfying non-degeneracy and transversality assumptions. The estimates generalize the sharp Fourier extension estimates for the cone and the paraboloid. To this end, we require a wave packet decomposition with localization properties in space-time and space-time frequencies. Secondly, we construct a refined wave packet parametrix for dispersive equations with $C^{1,1}$-coefficients by using the FBI transform. As a consequence, we obtain bilinear estimates for solutions to dispersive equations with $C^{1,1}$ coefficients provided that the solutions interact transversely.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a calmed version of the 3$D$ rotational Navier-Stokes equations driven by additive noise. First, we use the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process to transform the equation into a random one. By using the Galerkin approximation, we establish the global well-posedness of solutions for the calmed system. Then, we demonstrate the existence of a closed, measurable $\mathcal{D}_V$-pullback absorbing set. Finally, by proving the pullback flattening property, we obtain the existence of a $\mathcal{D}_V$-pullback attractor in \(V\).</description>

      <title>Infinite-peakon solutions of the Camassa-Holm equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of (conservative) low regularity solutions to the Camassa-Holm equation on the line by exploiting the classical moment problem (in the framework of generalized indefinite strings) to develop the inverse spectral transform method. In particular, we identify explicitly the solutions that are amenable to this approach, which include solutions made up of infinitely many peaked solitons (peakons). We determine which part of the solution can be recovered from the moments of the underlying spectral measure and provide explicit formulas. We show that the solution can be recovered completely if the corresponding moment problem is determinate, in which case the solution is a (potentially infinite) superposition of peakons. However, we also explore the situation when the underlying moment problem is indeterminate.
  As an application, our results are then used to investigate the long-time behavior of solutions. We will demonstrate this on three exemplary cases of solutions with: (i) discrete underlying spectrum (one may choose for this initial data corresponding to Al-Salam-Carlitz II polynomials; notice that they correspond to an indeterminate moment problem); (ii) step-like initial data associated with the Laguerre polynomials, and (iii) asymptotically eventually periodic initial data associated with the Jacobi polynomials.</description>

      <title>Observability of Schr\"odinger propagators on tori in rough settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On a torus of arbitrary dimension, it is conjectured that Schr\"odinger propagators with bounded potentials are observable from any space-time set of positive Lebesgue measure. We establish a criterion that proves the conjecture on the one-dimensional torus, yields new examples of measurable observation sets, and, more significantly, reduces the general conjecture to verifying certain integrability bounds for free Schr\"odinger waves. These bounds are far weaker than Bourgain's conjectured periodic Strichartz estimates, yet remain highly nontrivial.</description>

      <title>Strong stability and the Schiffer Conjecture for the fluid-elastic semigroup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a series of papers, Avalos and Triggiani established the fluid-elastic semigroup for the coupled Stokes-Lam\'e system modelling the coupled dynamics of a linearly elastic structure immersed in a viscous Newtonian fluid. They analyzed the spectrum of its generator and proved that the semigroup is strongly stable, if the domain of the structure satisfies a geometric condition, i.e. it is not a bad domain. We extend these results in two directions: first, for bad domains, we prove a decomposition of the dynamics into a strongly stable part and a pressure wave, a special solution of the Dirichlet-Lam\'e system, that can be determined from the initial values. This fully characterizes the long-time behaviour of the semigroup. Secondly, we show that the characterization of bad domains is equivalent to the Schiffer problem. This strengthens the conjecture that balls are the only bad domains and establishes a direct connection to geometric analysis. We also discuss implications for associated nonlinear systems.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the Gray--Scott reaction--diffusion system on $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ ($n\ge 1$) with mixed diffusion combining local and nonlocal operators. Using semigroup methods and duality estimates, we prove global existence of componentwise nonnegative solutions and establish uniform-in-time bounds. Numerical simulations illustrate pattern formation and highlight qualitative differences between the purely local and mixed-diffusion models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we propose a basic $L^2$-based approach for studying the global and local energy equalities of the incompressible 3D Navier-Stokes equations in the standard energy class on $\mathbb{T}^3 \times (0,T]$. Motivated by L. Onsager's principle of least dissipation of energy (1931), we give a new sufficient condition for the energy equalities in terms of the limit of a sequence of minimizers. In particular, we show that the equalities are attained if this limit is non-vanishing. We observe that the indeterminacy in the vanishing case is reminiscent of turbulence-driven energy transfer dominating other transport processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new minimax principle to prove the existence of multi-peak solutions to the Neumann problem of the $p$-Laplace equation $$ -\varepsilon^p \Delta_p u = u^{q-1} - u^{p-1} \ \ \text{in}\ \Omega,$$ where $\Om$ is a bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^n$ with smooth boundary, $1&lt;p&lt;n$ and $p&lt;q&lt; \frac{np}{n-p}$. The minimax principle will be applied to the set of peak functions, which is a subset of the Sobolev space $W^{1,p} (\Omega)$. The argument is based on a combination of variational method, topological degree theory, and gradient flow.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the properties of solutions to a class of elliptic and parabolic problems involving the fractional Laplacian. By applying the mountain pass theorem, we prove the existence of bounded classical positive solutions in the subcritical regime. Moreover, using the method of moving planes, we establish that these solutions are symmetric or monotone in the first variable. In contrast, we show that no such solutions exist in the supercritical or negative exponent cases. An analysis of the asymptotic behavior of solutions at infinity provides further insight into their profiles, which supports applications to real-world problems. The approaches developed in this work can also be extended to a wider range of nonlocal elliptic and parabolic equations, including those with more general operators and nonlinearities.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study $\Gamma$-convergence of graph Dirichlet energies and spectral convergence of graph Laplacians on unions of intersecting manifolds of potentially different dimensions. Our investigation is motivated by problems of machine learning, as real-world data often consist of parts or classes with different intrinsic dimensions. An important challenge is to understand which machine learning methods adapt to such varied dimensionalities. We investigate the standard unnormalized and the normalized graph Dirichlet energies. We show that the unnormalized energy and its associated graph Laplacian asymptotically only sees the variations within the manifold of the highest dimension. On the other hand, we prove that the normalized Dirichlet energy converges to a (tensorized) Dirichlet energy on the union of manifolds that adapts to all dimensions simultaneously. We also establish the related spectral convergence and present a few numerical experiments to illustrate our findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the source identification problem for the bi-parabolic equation involving a operator. Specifically, we investigate the equation $(\partial_t +\frak A)^2u(t)=\psi(t)f$, where $\frak A$ denotes a poly-harmonic operator. Given the perturbed data of $\psi$ and $u(T)$ (where $T&gt;0$), our objective is to determine $f$. Although several scientific publications have explored regularization techniques for bi-parabolic problems, the existing literature remains limited. By relaxing certain conditions on the function $\psi$ and employing a truncation regularization method while considering the problem on an unbounded domain, we believe our results provide valuable insights.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we give an overview on known as well as new results on the boundedness of the $H^{\infty}$-calculus of the Stokes operator in rough as well as in unbounded (smoother) domains. We present a special case of an abstract comparison principle due to Kunstmann and Weis (\cite{KuW:Hinfty-Stokes}) that serves as the basis for all considerations. Subsequently, we show how this result can be applied to arrive at a bounded $H^{\infty}$-calculus for the Stokes operator. We sketch the proof for no slip boundary conditions in bounded Lipschitz domains which was given in~\cite{KuW:Hinfty-Stokes}. For unbounded domains this approach yields a shorter proof compared to previous arguments. Moreover, we further establish the boundedness of the $H^{\infty}$-calculus for the Stokes operator with Neumann type boundary conditions in bounded convex domains which is entirely new.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we study compactness and regularity theory of minimizing intrinsic fractional harmonic mappings introduced by Moser and Roberts. Based on the partial regularity theory of Moser and Roberts, we first use the modified Luckhaus lemma of Roberts to deduce compactness of these mappings, and then develop volume estimates of singular sets by the quantitative stratification theory of Cheeger and Naber. Combining these two results lead to a global regularity estimates which, in turn, allow us to obtain an improvement of the dimension estimate of singular sets.</description>

Abstract: We discuss some features of a boundary value problem for a system of PDEs that describes the growth of a sandpile in a container under the action of a vertical source. In particular, we characterize the long-term behavior of the profiles, and we provide a sufficient condition on the vertical source that guarantees the convergence to the equilibrium in a finite time. We show by counterexamples that a stable configuration may not be reached in a finite time, in general, even if the source is time-independent.

      <title>Observability estimates for the Schr\"odinger equation on the equilateral triangle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove observability estimates for the Schr\"odinger equation posed on the equilateral triangle in the plane, under both Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions. No geometric control condition is required on the rough localization functions that we consider. This is the first result of this kind on a non-toric domain in the compact setting. Our strategy is to exploit Pinsky's tiling argument to deduce this result from observability estimates on rational twisted tori. These are obtained via propagation of singularities, adapting arguments from Burq and Zworski. The later require Strichartz estimates on such twisted rational tori, that we derive from Zygmund inequalities in the same geometric setting, also providing the sharp constant. Strichartz estimates on the equilateral triangle are also derived from this analysis.</description>

      <title>A coarse-graining theory for elliptic operators and homogenization in high contrast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review a coarse-graining theory for divergence-form elliptic operators. The construction centers on a pair of coarse-grained matrices defined on spatial blocks that encode a scale-dependent notion of ellipticity, transmit precise information from small to large scales, and yield coarse-grained counterparts of standard elliptic estimates. Under simplifying assumptions, we give a complete proof of the result of [arXiv:2405.10732] that homogenization is reached within at most $C\log^2(1+\Theta)$ dyadic length scales in the high-contrast regime, where $\Theta$ is the ellipticity contrast. We argue that this scale-local notion of ellipticity is genuinely iterable across arbitrarily many scales, providing a framework for a rigorous renormalization group analysis.</description>

      <title>Traveling wave solutions for the generalized Burgers-Fisher equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traveling wave solutions, in the form $u(x,t)=f(x+ct)$, to the generalized Burgers-Fisher equation $$ \partial_tu=u_{xx}+k(u^n)_x+u^p-u^q, \quad (x,t)\in\mathbb{R}\times(0,\infty), $$ with $n\geq2$, $p&gt;q\geq1$ and $k&gt;0$, are classified with respect to their speed $c\in(-\infty,\infty)$ and the behavior at $\pm\infty$. The existence and uniqueness of traveling waves with any speed $c\in\mathbb{R}$ is established and their behavior as $x\to\pm\infty$ is described. In particular, it is shown that there exists a unique $c^*\in(0,\infty)$ such that there exists a unique soliton $f^*$ with speed $c^*$ and such that $$ \lim\limits_{\xi\to-\infty}f^*(\xi)=\lim\limits_{\xi\to\infty}f^*(\xi)=0, \quad \xi=x+ct. $$ Moreover, if $n&lt;p+q+1$ then $c^*&lt;kn$ and if $n&gt;p+q+1$ then $c^*&gt;kn$. For $c&lt;\min\{c^*,kn\}$, any traveling wave with speed $c$ satisfies $\lim\limits_{\xi\to-\infty}f(\xi)=0$ and $\lim\limits_{\xi\to\infty}f(\xi)=1$, while for $c&gt;\max\{c^*,kn\}$ any traveling wave with speed $c$ satisfies $\lim\limits_{\xi\to-\infty}f(\xi)=1$ and $\lim\limits_{\xi\to\infty}f(\xi)=0$. In particular, for any speed $c\in(0,c^*)$, there are traveling wave solutions $u$ with speed $c$ such that $u(x,t)\to1$ as $t\to\infty$, in contrast to the non-convective case $k=0$.</description>

      <title>Sharp behavior of semilinear damped wave equations driven by mixed local-nonlocal operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the Cauchy problem for the semilinear damped wave equation $u_{tt}+\mathcal{L}_{a,b}u+u_t=|u|^p$ with the mixed local-nonlocal operator $\mathcal{L}_{a,b}:=-a\Delta+b(-\Delta)^{\sigma}$, where $a,b\in\mathbb{R}_+$ and $\sigma\in(0,1)\cup (1,+\infty)$. We determine the critical exponent for this problem being $p_{\mathrm{crit}}=1+\frac{2\min\{1,\sigma\}}{n}$, which sharply separates global in-time existence and finite-time blow-up of solutions. Furthermore, for the super-critical case $p&gt;p_{\mathrm{crit}}$, we establish the asymptotic profiles of global in-time solutions, showing the anomalous diffusion when $\sigma\in(0,1)$ and the classical diffusion when $\sigma\in(1,+\infty)$, together with the sharp decay estimates. For solutions blowing up in finite time when $1&lt;p\leqslant p_{\mathrm{crit}}$, we derive the sharp estimates for upper and lower bounds of lifespan. Our results reveal the crucial influence of mixed operators on the qualitative properties of solutions, fundamentally governing their critical phenomena, large-time behavior and blow-up dynamics, via $\max\{1,\sigma\}$ or $\min\{1,\sigma\}$.</description>

      <title>On domains of elliptic operators with distributional coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we show how one can use recently gained insights from the study of singular SPDEs, more particularly the study of singular operators via the theory of Paracontrolled Distributions, to construct domains for (singular) elliptic operators. Formally we consider \[ A (u) \text{"$=$''} (1 - \Delta) u + \nabla V \cdot \nabla u + \xi u +
  {{div} (\rho u)}, \] where $V \in \mathcal{C}^{\delta}$, $\xi \in \mathcal{C}^{- 2 + \delta}$, $\rho \in \mathcal{C}^{- 1 + \delta},{div}\rho = 0$ and which satisfy a structural assumption that is notably satisfied when $\xi$ is a "sub-critical noise". We also show that under this assumption, one can construct a continuous change of variables $\Theta$ which satisfies \[ A \Theta - (1 - \Delta) \in \mathcal{L} (H^2 ; H^{\delta'}) \] which allows us to define $A$ rigorously and parametrise a domain. Moreover, for suitably regularised operators \[ A_{\varepsilon} (u) := (1 - \Delta) u + \nabla V_{\varepsilon} \cdot
  \nabla u + (\xi_{\varepsilon} + c_{\varepsilon}) u +
  {{div} (\rho_{\varepsilon} \cdot u)}, \] we show that for a strongly converging regularised change of variables $\Theta_{\varepsilon} \rightarrow \Theta$ we have \[ A_{\varepsilon} \Theta_{\varepsilon} \rightarrow A \Theta \text{ in }
  \mathcal{L} (H^2 ; L^2) \] which in particular implies norm resolvent convergence to a limiting closed operator.</description>

      <title>Nonuniqueness of Leray-Hopf solutions to the unforced incompressible 3D Navier-Stokes Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonuniqueness of Leray-Hopf solutions to the unforced incompressible 3D Navier-Stokes equations is one of the central open problems in mathematical fluid dynamics. In this paper, we provide, to our knowledge, the first rigorous computer-assisted proof demonstrating such nonuniqueness. Inspired by earlier works in this area, we construct a Leray-Hopf solution in the self-similar setting and then establish the existence of a second solution by analyzing the stability of the linearized operator around this profile, showing that it corresponds to an unstable perturbation. To achieve this, we develop an innovative numerical method that computes candidate solutions with high precision and propose a framework for rigorously establishing exact solutions in a neighborhood of these candidates. A key step is to decompose the linearized operator into a coercive part plus a compact perturbation, which is further approximated by a finite-rank operator up to a small error. The invertibility of the linearized operator restricted to the image of this finite-rank approximation is then rigorously verified using computer-assisted proofs. This certifies the existence of an unstable eigenpair and, consequently, yields a second solution - indeed, infinitely many Leray-Hopf solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a long history of parabolic monotonicity formulas that developed independently from several different fields and a much more recent elliptic theory. The elliptic theory can be localized and there are additional monotone quantities. There is also a surprising link: Taking a high-dimensional limit of the right elliptic monotonicity can give a parabolic one as a limit. Poincar\'e was the first to observe such a connection. We introduce two deficit functions, one elliptic and one parabolic, then show that the parabolic deficit is pointwise the limit of the elliptic and, that the elliptic satisfies an equation that converges to the equation for the parabolic. These pointwise quantities and their equations recover the monotonicities and leads to an elliptic proof of the log Sobolev inequality as well as new concentration of measure phenomena.</description>

      <title>Effective medium theory for embedded sound-soft obstacles in an anisotropic inhomogeneous medium with applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of time-harmonic acoustic scattering in an inhomogeneous medium with a complex topological structure. Specifically, the medium is anisotropic and contains several disjoint sound-soft obstacles. This model commonly arises in the inverse scattering problem of simultaneously recovering the embedded obstacles and the surrounding medium. We propose a novel theoretical framework that demonstrates how embedded obstacles can be effectively approximated by an isotropic and lossy medium with specified physical parameters, wherein the total wave field exhibits decay properties related to these specified material parameters at the boundaries of the obstacles. This mathematical characterization of the wave in an effective medium model can be used to locate the underlying obstacles. Furthermore, we establish rigorous estimates to validate this approximation and provide a concrete example illustrating our theoretical results. Our proposed effective medium theory offers substantial applications within the context of the aforementioned inverse problem.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove the diameter comparison, the global weighted volume comparison and the splitting theorem in weighted manifolds when the infinity-Bakry-Emery Ricci curvature has a lower bound in the spectrum sense. Our results extend Antonelli-Xu's spectral Bonnet-Myers and Bishop-Gromov theorems, and Antonelli-Pozzetta-Xu's spectral splitting theorem to weighted manifolds. Our results are also some supplements of Chu-Hao's spectral diameter and global volume comparisons, and Yeung's spectral splitting theorem in weighted manifolds.</description>

      <title>A Besov-based integration-by-parts method for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This note introduces a novel numerical analysis framework for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations based on Besov spaces. The key contribution of this note is to establish the stability and convergence of a semi-implicit time-stepping scheme by deriving precise error estimates in the $B^0_{\infty,1}$ and $B^0_{\infty,2}$ spaces. Another contribution of our analysis is the detailed treatment of the $B^0_{\infty,2}$ case, where a crucial integration-by-parts technique is employed to adeptly handle the nonlinear advection term. This technique allows for a refined estimate that effectively transfers derivatives onto the test functions, mitigating the inherent analytical challenges posed by the low regularity of these spaces. Our results provide sharper, more localized error bounds than in classical Sobolev spaces, directly linking the scheme's convergence to the critical regularity of the continuous solution. This work underscores the advantage of Besov spaces for the numerical analysis of nonlinear fluid PDEs.</description>

Abstract: We consider an energy functional that arises in micromagnetic and liquid crystal theory on thin films. In particular, our energy comprises a non-convex term that models anti-symmetric exchange as well as an anisotropy term. We devise an algorithm for energy minimization in the continuous case and show weak convergence of a subsequence towards a solution of the corresponding Euler--Lagrange equation. Furthermore, an algorithm for numerical energy minimization is presented. We show empirically that this numerical algorithm converges to the correct solutions for a benchmark problem without the need for user-supplied parameters, and present a rigorous convergence analysis for important special cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a semilinear stochastic heat equation in spatial dimension at least $3$, forced by a noise that is white in time with a covariance kernel that decays like $\lvert x\rvert^{-2}$ as $\lvert x\rvert\to\infty$. We show that in an appropriate diffusive scaling limit with a logarithmic attenuation of the noise, the pointwise statistics of the solution can be approximated by the solution to a forward-backward stochastic differential equation (FBSDE). The scaling and structure of the problem is similar to that of the two-dimensional stochastic heat equation forced by an approximation of space-time white noise considered by the first author and Gu (Ann. Probab., 2022). However the resulting FBSDE is different due to the long-range correlations of the noise.</description>

      <title>Geometric structure of stationary problem for spatial 1D self-diffusion equation with logistic growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the solution structure of non-trivial, non-constant stationary states of 1D spatial parabolic equations with nonlinear self-diffusion and logistic growth terms. A two-dimensional ordinary differential equation satisfying the stationary problem is derived and all its dynamics, including to infinity, is revealed by the Poincar\'e-Lyapunov compactification, one of the compactifications of phase space. The advantage of this method is that it can be used to classify all dynamical systems (especially connecting orbits) of a two-dimensional system including infinity. Therefore, the classification results for the dynamical system including to infinity give the classification results for the non-constant stationary states obtained only from the structure of the original equations. This argument allows us to observe a change in the classification of the non-constant stationary states by an explicit relation between the linear diffusion coefficient and the self-diffusion coefficient, combined with arguments about the symmetries and conserved quantities of the ODEs. This means that changing the self-diffusion coefficient as a bifurcation parameter not only qualitatively changes the dynamical system from a big saddle homoclinic orbit of the ODEs to a heteroclinic orbit that connects the saddle equilibria, but also significantly changes the shape and the properties of the stationary states. It explicitly shows the relationship between linear and self-diffusion, gives a characterization of non-trivial stationary states in terms of dynamical systems, and gives a deep insight into the influence of self-diffusion, one of the nonlinear diffusions.</description>

      <title>Steady Gradient Ricci Solitons with $O(p)\times O(q)$ Symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We find new examples of steady gradient Ricci solitons with positive curvature operator in dimensions four and above. Utilising a procedure first introduced by Lai, we construct examples with $O(p) \times O(q)$ symmetry in dimension $p+q$ for any pair of integers $p,q \geq 2$ and discuss their asymptotic geometry.</description>

      <title>A posteriori existence of strong solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations in 3D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Global existence of strong solutions to the three-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations remains an open problem. A posteriori existence results offer a way to rigorously verify the existence of strong solutions by ruling out blow-up on a certain time interval, using only numerical solutions. In this work we present such a result for the Navier-Stokes equations subject to periodic boundary conditions, which makes use of a version of the celebrated blow-up criterion in the critical space $L^\infty(L^3)$ by Iskauriaza, Ser\"egin and Shverak (2003). Our approach is based on a conditional stability estimate in $L^2$ and $L^3$. The a posteriori criterion that, if satisfied, verifies existence of strong solutions, involves only negative Sobolev norms of the residual. We apply the criterion to numerical approximations computed with mixed finite elements and an implicit Euler time discretisation. A posteriori error estimates allow us to derive a fully computable criterion without imposing any extra assumptions on the solution. While limited to short time intervals, with sufficient computational resources in principle the criterion might allow for a verification over longer time intervals than what can be achieved by theoretical means.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.06288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that all non-trivial solutions of a broad class of nonlinear dispersive equations, whose linear evolution is governed by a dispersion relation under minimal regularity assumptions, cannot remain compactly supported for any non-trivial time interval. Our approach, based on complex-analytic arguments and the Paley-Wiener-Schwartz theorem, yields a stronger result: if linear solutions are compactly supported at two distinct times, then the dispersion relation must admit an analytic extension. This extends previous results beyond polynomial dispersion relations and applies to more general settings, including fractional-order systems. As an application, we examine the generalized space-time fractional Schr\"{o}dinger equation, illustrating the role of memory effects in wave propagation.</description>

Abstract: We derive Schauder estimates using ideas from Campanato's approach for a general class of local hypoelliptic operators and non-local kinetic equations. The method covers equations in divergence and non-divergence form. In particular our results are applicable to the inhomogeneous Landau and to the non-cutoff Boltzmann equation.

Abstract: We give a partial negative answer to a question left open in a previous work by Brasco and the first and third-named authors concerning the sharp constant in the fractional Hardy inequality on convex sets. Our approach has a geometrical flavor and equivalently reformulates the sharp constant in the limit case $p=1$ as the Cheeger constant for the fractional perimeter and the Lebesgue measure with a suitable weight. As a by-product, we obtain new lower bounds on the sharp constant in the $1$-dimensional case, even for non-convex sets, some of which optimal in the case $p=1$.</description>

Abstract: We consider an asymptotic behavior of solutions to the Vlasov-Riesz system of order $\alpha$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ which is a kinetic model induced by Riesz interactions. We prove small data scattering when $1/2&lt;\alpha&lt;1$ and modified scattering when $1&lt;\alpha&lt;1+\delta$ for some $\delta&gt;0$. Moreover, we show the existence of (modified) wave operators for such a regime. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result on the existence of modified scattering with polynomial correction in kinetic models.</description>

      <title>Discarding Lavrentiev's Gap in Non-autonomous and Non-Convex Variational Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14995v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish that the Lavrentiev gap between Sobolev and Lipschitz maps does not occur for a scalar variational problem of the form: \[ \textrm{to minimize} \qquad u \mapsto \int_\Omega f(x,u,\nabla u)\,dx \,, \] under a Dirichlet boundary condition. Here, \(\Omega\) is a bounded Lipschitz open set in \(\rn\), \(N\geq 1\) and the function $f$ is required to be measurable with respect to the spatial variable, continuous with respect to the second one, and convex with respect to the last variable. Under these assumptions alone, Lavrentiev gaps may occur, as illustrated by classical examples in the literature. We identify an additional natural condition on $f$ to discard such phenomena, that can be interpreted as a balance between the variations with respect to the first variable and the growth with respect to the last one. This unifies most of the structural assumptions that have been introduced so far to prevent the occurence of Lavrentiev gaps. Remarkably, typical assumptions that are usually imposed on $f$ in this setting are dropped here: we do not require $f$ to be bounded or convex with respect to the second variable, nor impose any condition of $\Delta_2$-kind with respect to the last variable.</description>

      <title>Existence, regularity and stability in a strongly degenerate nonlinear diffusion and haptotaxis model of cancer invasion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a mathematical model of cancer cell invasion of the extracellular matrix (ECM), comprising a strongly degenerate parabolic partial differential equation for the cell volume fraction, coupled with an ordinary differential equation for the ECM volume fraction ($0 \leq {\phi} \leq 1$). The model captures the intricate link between the dynamics of invading cancer cells and the surrounding ECM. First, migrating cells undergo haptotaxis, i.e., movement up ECM density gradients. Secondly, cancer cells degrade the ECM fibers by means of membrane-bound proteases. Finally, their migration speed is modulated by the ECM pore sizes, resulting in the saturation or even interruption of cell motility both at high and low ECM densities. The inclusion of the physical limits of cell migration results in two regimes of degeneracy (at ${\phi} = 0$ and ${\phi} = 1$) impacting simultaneously the nonlinear diffusion and haptotaxis terms. We devise specific estimates that are compatible with the strong degeneracy of the equation, focusing on the vacuum present at low ECM densities. Based on these regularity results, and associated local compactness, we prove stability of weak solutions with respect to perturbations on bounded initial data, and global existence of weak solutions in the limit of an approximate non-degenerate problem.</description>

      <title>Exponential decay estimates for the resolvent kernel on a Riemannian manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On a complete, connected, non-compact Riemannian manifold, with Ricci curvature bounded from below, we establish exponential decay estimates at infinity for the spherical sums of the resolvent kernel, i.e., the integral kernel of the resolvent $(-\Delta+\lambda)^{-1}$ of the Laplace-Beltrami operator for $\lambda&gt;0$. The exponential decay rate in these estimates is optimal, in the sense that it cannot be improved based solely on a uniform bound on the Ricci curvature.
  In addition to technical results, the paper offers two conceptual takeaways. Firstly, in pursuit of optimal decay estimates, it may be worth shifting the emphasis from the resolvent kernel to its density - a geometrically more natural object. Secondly, contrary to expectations, the exponential decay of the resolvent kernel is driven mainly by the area/volume growth, and the bottom of the spectrum of $\Delta$ is not a decisive factor. This is in contrast with the heat kernel decay, and shows that optimal resolvent kernel estimates cannot be derived from heat kernel estimates.</description>

Abstract: We prove that solutions to linear kinetic equations in a half-space with absorbing boundary conditions decay for large times like $t^{-\frac{1}{2}-\frac{d}{4}}$ in a weighted $\sfL^{2}$ space and like $t^{-1-\frac{d}{2}}$ in a weighted $\sfL^{\infty}$ space, i.e. faster than in the whole space and in agreement with the decay of solutions to the heat equation in the half-space with Dirichlet conditions. The class of linear kinetic equations considered includes the linear relaxation equation, the kinetic Fokker-Planck equation and the Kolmogorov equation associated with the time-integrated spherical Brownian motion.</description>

      <title>Quadratic flatness and Regularity for Codimension-One Varifolds with Bounded Anisotropic Mean Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a uniformly convex norm $ \phi $ on $ \mathbf{R}^{n+1} $ and a unit-density $ n $-dimensional varifold $ V $ in an open subset of $ \mathbf{R}^{n+1} $ with bounded mean $ \phi $-curvature, under the hypothesis
  $$ \textrm{$\mathcal{H}^n \llcorner {\rm spt}\| V \| $ is absolutely continuous with respect to $ \| V \| $},$$
  we prove that there exists an open dense $ \mathscr{C}^{1, \alpha}$-regular part in $ {\rm spt} \| V \| $. Moreover we prove that the $ \mathscr{C}^{1, \alpha}$-regular part of $ V $ is $ \mathcal{H}^n $-almost equal to $({\rm spt}\| V \|)^\ast $, the subset of $ {\rm spt}\| V \| $ where at least one blow up (in Hausdorff distance) of $ {\rm spt}\| V \| $ is not equal to $ \mathbf{R}^{n+1} $.
  These results are consequences of a quadratic flatness theorem asserting that if $ V $ is a general -- not necessarily rectifiable -- varifold $ V $ with bounded mean $ \phi $-curvature and locally $ \mathcal{H}^n $-finite support, then the set of points $ R $ where $ {\rm spt}\| V \|$ admits (exactly) two mutually tangent balls satisfies $ \mathcal{H}^n(({\rm spt}\| V \|)^\ast \setminus R) =0 $ and meets each relatively open set of $ {\rm spt}\| V \| $ on a set of positive $ \mathcal{H}^n $-measure. Indeed, quadratic flatness at a point guarantees that the Allard anisotropic regularity theorem can be applied, hence proving that $ {\rm spt}\| V \|$ is regular around that point.</description>

      <title>The new observations about the parameter-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger-Poisson system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12732v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the existence results of solutions for the following Schr\"{o}dinger-Poisson system involving different potentials:
  \begin{equation*}
  \begin{cases}
  -\Delta u+V(x)u-\lambda \phi u=f(u)&amp;\quad\text{in}~\mathbb R^3,
  -\Delta\phi=u^2&amp;\quad\text{in}~\mathbb R^3.
  \end{cases} \end{equation*}
  We first consider the case that the potential $V$ is positive and radial so that the mountain pass theorem could be implied. The other case is that the potential $V$ is coercive and sign-changing, which means that the Schr\"{o}dinger operator $-\Delta +V$ is allowed to be indefinite. To deal with this more difficult case, by a local linking argument and Morse theory, the system has a nontrivial solution. Furthermore, we also show the asymptotical behavior result of this solution. Additionally, the proofs rely on new observations regarding the solutions of the Poisson equation. As a main novelty with respect to corresponding results in \cite{MR4527586,MR3148130,MR2810583}, we only assume that $f$ satisfies the super-linear growth condition at the origin. We believe that the methodology developed here can be adapted to study related problems concerning the existence of solutions for Schr\"{o}dinger-Poisson system.</description>

      <title>On completeness of modified wave operators for defocusing NLS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15921v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we study modified scattering for the nonlinear defocusing Schr\"odinger equation with a critical gauge-invariant nonlinearity of order 1+2/n.
  We address the following question: Given initial data in an appropriate weighted Sobolev space, what is the leading term in the asymptotic behavior of the solution as times goes to infinity? More precisely, we seek a final state in a space of type similar to the space of the initial data such that the leading term is represented by the free propagator and modified phase function.
  The solution to this problem can be reformulated in terms of the completeness of wave operators. For n=1, we obtain a complete answer, provided appropriate control on the sup - norm even for large initial data. For n = 2 completeness is established under suitable control of the sup - norm of the solution.</description>

Abstract: We prove the rigidity, among sets of finite perimeter, of volume-preserving critical points of the capillary energy in the half space, in the case where the prescribed interior contact angle is between $90^\circ$ and $120^\circ$. No structural or regularity assumption is required on the finite perimeter sets. Assuming that the ``tangential'' part of the capillary boundary is $\mathcal{H}^n$-null, this rigidity theorem extends to the full hydrophobic regime of interior contact angles between $90^\circ$ and $180^\circ$. Furthermore, we establish the anisotropic counterpart of this theorem under the assumption of lower density bounds.</description>

Abstract: A new monotone quantity in graphical mean curvature flows of higher codimensions is identified in this work. The submanifold deformed by the mean curvature flow is the graph of a map between Riemannian manifolds, and the quantity is monotone increasing under the area-decreasing condition of the map. The flow provides a natural homotopy of the corresponding map and leads to sharp criteria regarding the homotopic class of maps between complex projective spaces, and maps from spheres to complex projective spaces, among others.</description>

Abstract: In the present work we introduce a unified framework that allows for the very first systematic construction of symmetric resonance-based integrators to approximate a wide class of nonlinear dispersive equations at low-regularity. The inclusion of symmetries in the construction of resonance-based schemes presents serious challenges and induces a need for a significant extension of prior approaches to allow for sufficient number of degrees of freedom in the resulting schemes while preserving the favorable low-regularity convergence properties of prior constructions. Motivated by recent work arXiv:2005.01649, we achieve this by introducing a novel formalism based on forest formulae that allows us to encode a wider range of possibilities of iterating Duhamel's formula and interpolatory approximations of lower order parts in the construction of these time-stepping methods. The forest formulae allow for a simple characterisation of symmetric schemes and provides a fascinating algebraic structure in its own right which echo those used in Quantum Field Theory for renormalising Feynman diagrams and those used for the renormalisation of singular SPDEs via the theory of Regularity Structures. Our constructions lead to the development of several new symmetric low regularity integrators that exhibit remarkable structure preservation and convergence properties which are witnessed in numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Frozen Gaussian approximation for the fractional Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a refined Frozen Gaussian approximation (FGA) for the fractional Schr\"odinger equation in the semi-classical regime, where the solution exhibits rapid oscillations as the scaled Planck constant $\varepsilon$ becomes small. Our approach utilizes an integral representation based on asymptotic analysis, offering a highly efficient computational framework for high-frequency wave function evolution. Crucially, we introduce the momentum space representation of the FGA and a regularization parameter $\delta$ to address singularities in the higher-order derivatives of the Hamiltonian flow coefficients, which are typically assumed to be second-order differentiable or smooth in conventional analysis. We rigorously prove convergence of the method to the true solution and provide numerical experiments that demonstrate its precision and robust convergence behavior.</description>

      <title>Rapid stabilization and finite time stabilization of the bilinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10002v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to establish the rapid stabilization of the bilinear Schr\"odinger control system and its linearized system, and the finite time stabilization of the linearized system using the Grammian operators. The analysis of the rapid stabilization involves a new quantity (variable) which is inspired by the adjoint state in the optimal control theory and is proposed in our recent work on control systems associated with strongly continuous group. The analysis of the finite time stabilization follows the strategy introduced by Coron and Nguyen in the study of the finite time stabilization of the heat equation and incorporate a new ingredient involving the estimate of the cost of controls of the linearized system in small time derived in this paper.</description>

      <title>On constant mean curvature 1-immersions of surfaces into hyperbolic 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07518v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the work of Bryant on constant mean curvature (CMC) $1$-immersions of surfaces into the hyperbolic space H^3 and after the results of Tarantello (2023), we pursue a possible parametrization for the moduli space of (CMC) 1-immersions of a surface S (closed, orientable and of genus &gt;1) into hyperbolic 3-manifolds. Those immersions enter as "critical" object in our analysis. In fact, they can be attained only as limits of the (CMC) c-immersions (as c tends to 1), obtained in Huang-Lucia-Tarantello (2022), for |c|&lt;1. However, such passage to the limit can be prevented by possible blow-up phenomena, so that the pullback metrics of the (CMC) c-immersions may yield (at the limit) to a singular metric with conical singularities at finitely many points (the blow-up points). In case of genus g=2, blow up can occur only at a single point, and in Tarantello (2023) it was shown how it could be prevented and the passage to the limit ensured in terms of the Kodaira map. In this note we sharpen this result and for genus g=2, we obtaina condition (we believe sharp) which involves only the Kodaira map on the six Weierstrass points. In addition we tackle the case of higher genus, where multiple blow-up points occur. In this case, we need to identify a suitable replacement of the Kodaira map, now defined on the space of non-zero effective divisors. More importantly, we need to improve in a substantial way the asymptotic analysis of Tarantello (2023) limited to the case of "blow-up" with minimal mass. In this direction we give a contribution which best applies to the case of genus g=3, but also provides a relevant step and a convincing indication on what should happen in the general case.</description>

      <title>BIBO stability of 1-D hyperbolic boundary control systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the question of bounded-input bounded-output (BIBO) stability of a class of 1-D hyperbolic boundary control systems, which, in particular, contains distributed port-Hamiltonian systems. Exploiting the particular structure of the transfer function of these systems, we derive several sufficient conditions for BIBO stability.</description>

      <title>Weak $(1,1)$ estimate for maximal truncated rough singular integral operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17737v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In their seminal work (Amer. J. Math. 78: 289-309, 1956), Calder\'on and Zygmund introduced the maximal truncated rough singular integral operator and established its $L^p$-boundedness for $1 &lt; p &lt; \infty$. However, the endpoint case $p = 1$ remained an open problem. This paper resolves this problem. More precisely, we prove that the maximal truncated rough singular integral operator is of weak type $(1,1)$.</description>
