      <title>(2+1)D Quantum Electrodynamics at Finite Density on a Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore (2+1)D quantum electrodynamics (QED) at finite density on a quantum computer, including two fermion flavors. Our method employs an efficient gauge-invariant ansatz together with a quantum circuit structure that enforces Gauss's law. As a proof of principle, we benchmark our simulation protocol on a small lattice system, demonstrating the identification of phase transitions in terms of the particle number of the fermion flavors. Classical simulations are used to obtain optimized variational parameters, which are then deployed in inference runs on IBM quantum hardware. We conclude by discussing hardware limitations and prospects for scaling this method to larger systems.</description>

      <title>Roles of $U(1)$ axial anomaly effects in cold and dense two-color QCD with $2+2$ flavors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore phase structures and hadron mass spectra in cold and dense two-color QCD with $2+2$ flavors where the sign problem disappears. We particularly focus on $U(1)$ axial anomaly effects. We employ an $N_f=2+2$ linear sigma model based on the $SU(8)$ Pauli-G\"{u}rsey symmetry to describe negative-parity as well as positive-parity hadrons, for which low-energy excitations are appropriately described particularly in the baryon superfluid phase with light diquark condensates. As a result, the strange chiral condensate is found to be enhanced in the superfluid phase owing to the flavor-mixing structure of $U(1)$ axial anomaly effects. We also confirm this enhancement by means of the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model. Besides, our present analysis predicts the existence of a novel superfluid phase where heavy diquarks condense in dense regime. The topological susceptibility with $2+2$ flavors from the viewpoints of the anomaly effects and chiral-symmetry restoration is investigated. Furthermore, we derive a complete inverse mass hierarchy for negative-parity diquarks with sufficient anomaly effects. Our findings are expected to provide future lattice simulations with useful information on flavor-symmetry violation from the $U(1)$ axial anomaly aspects in cold and dense two-color QCD medium.</description>

      <title>Thermal quarks and Polyakov loops in two-color dense QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study confinement and deconfinement in dense two color QCD by analyzing the dynamics of thermal quarks and gluons. The Polyakov loop is used as a probe of the relevant thermal excitations, distinguishing quark and hadron dominated regimes in dense matter. To describe the Polyakov loop, we adopt both lattice informed phenomenological models and the massive Yang Mills framework. After calibrating these models at zero density, we investigate in medium modifications of the Polyakov loops and gluon propagators at finite temperature and density. Diquark gaps control the screening at zero temperature, whereas the screening due to thermal quarks is sensitive to the Polyakov loop. Inclusion of the Polyakov loop helps to reproduce lattice data at low temperature, suggesting that thermal excitations are predominantly hadronic rather than uncorrelated quarks.</description>

      <title>Multiple dispersive bounds. I) An improved z-expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the implementation of two novel ingredients in the standard $z$-expansion of hadronic form factors, commonly referred to as the Boyd-Grinstein-Lebed (BGL) approach [1-4]. The first new ingredient is the explicit addition of a unitarity filter applied to a given known set of input data for the hadronic form factors. This further constraint is not usually taken into account in the phenomenological applications of the BGL $z$-expansion. We show that it brings to a formulation of the BGL approach fully equivalent to the Dispersion Matrix (DM) method [5], which describes hadronic form factors in a completely model-independent and non-perturbative way. The second key ingredient is represented by the introduction of suitable kernel functions in the evaluation of unitarity bounds, leading to the application of multiple dispersive bounds to hadronic form factors, whenever data and/or (non-)perturbative techniques allow to do so. This idea may be useful for the investigation of many physical processes, from the analysis of the electromagnetic form factors of mesons and baryons to the study of weak semileptonic decays of hadrons. An explicit numerical application will be presented in the companion paper [6], where the effects of sub-threshold branch-cuts are analyzed.</description>

      <title>Multiple dispersive bounds. II) Sub-threshold branch-cuts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply the general framework of multiple dispersive bounds, firstly discussed in the companion paper [1], to the study of sub-threshold branch-cuts. We propose the simultaneous application of a double dispersive bound as a proper way to take into account unitarity constraints within phenomenological analyses of hadronic form factors in the presence of sub-threshold branch-cuts. Accordingly, the standard $z$-expansion of hadronic form factors, commonly referred to as the Boyd-Grinstein-Lebed approach [2-5], is modified by including simultaneously the dispersive bounds related to the pair-production and to the sub-threshold regions. For the latter one the effects of above-threshold poles are described through a new resonance model and the possible choices of the outer function outside the pair-production region are discussed. A detailed numerical analysis of the experimental data or lattice QCD results in the spacelike region for the charged kaon form factor is presented as a direct application of the procedure of double dispersive bound. The comparison with other methodologies present in literature and with the $z$-expansion based on the single, total dispersive bound clearly shows that the $z$-expansion including the double dispersive bound provides the most precise extrapolation at large momentum transfer as well as the most stable results with respect to the choice of the outer function outside the pair-production region.</description>
