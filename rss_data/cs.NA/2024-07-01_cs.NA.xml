      <title>High-order Adaptive Rank Integrators for Multi-scale Linear Kinetic Transport Equations in the Hierarchical Tucker Format</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new adaptive rank approximation technique for computing solutions to the high-dimensional linear kinetic transport equation. The approach we propose is based on a macro-micro decomposition of the kinetic model in which the angular domain is discretized with a tensor product quadrature rule under the discrete ordinates method. To address the challenges associated with the curse of dimensionality, the proposed low-rank method is cast in the framework of the hierarchical Tucker decomposition. The adaptive rank integrators we propose are built upon high-order discretizations for both time and space. In particular, this work considers implicit-explicit discretizations for time and finite-difference weighted-essentially non-oscillatory discretizations for space. The high-order singular value decomposition is used to perform low-rank truncation of the high-dimensional time-dependent distribution function. The methods are applied to several benchmark problems, where we compare the solution quality and measure compression achieved by the adaptive rank methods against their corresponding full-grid methods. We also demonstrate the benefits of high-order discretizations in the proposed low-rank framework.</description>

      <title>High Order Accurate Hermite Schemes on Curvilinear Grids with Compatibility Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High order accurate Hermite methods for the wave equation on curvilinear domains are presented. Boundaries are treated using centered compatibility conditions rather than more standard one-sided approximations. Both first-order-in-time (FOT) and second-order-in-time (SOT) Hermite schemes are developed. Hermite methods use the solution and multiple derivatives as unknowns and achieve space-time orders of accuracy $2m-1$ (FOT) and $2m$ (SOT) for methods using $(m+1)^d$ degree of freedom per node in $d$ dimensions. The compatibility boundary conditions (CBCs) are based on taking time derivatives of the boundary conditions and using the governing equations to replace the time derivatives with spatial derivatives. These resulting constraint equations augment the Hermite scheme on the boundary. The solvability of the equations resulting from the compatibility conditions are analyzed. Numerical examples demonstrate the accuracy and stability of the new schemes in two dimensions.</description>

      <title>Thermo-Electro-Mechanical Modeling of Power Transmission Line Failures across Four US States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The failure of overhead transmission lines in the United States can lead to significant economic losses and widespread blackouts, affecting the lives of millions. This study focuses on the reliability of transmission lines, specifically examining the effects of wind, ambient temperature, and current demands on lines, incorporating minimal and significant pre-existing damage. We develop a Thermo-Electro-Mechanical Model to analyze the transmission line failures across sensitive and affected states of the United States, integrating historical data on wind and ambient temperature. By combining numerical simulation with historical data analysis, our research assesses the impact of varying environmental conditions on the reliability of transmission lines. Our methodology begins with a deterministic approach to model temperature and damage evolution, using phase-field modeling for fatigue and damage, coupled with electrical and thermal models. Later, we adopt the Probability Collocation Method to investigate the stochastic behavior of the system, enhancing our understanding of uncertainties in model parameters, conducting sensitivity analysis, and estimating the probability of failures over time. This approach allows for a comprehensive analysis of factors affecting transmission line reliability, contributing valuable insights into improving power line's resilience against environmental conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this chapter, we describe the Parallel Sparse Computation Toolkit (PSCToolkit), a suite of libraries for solving large-scale linear algebra problems in an HPC environment. In particular, we focus on the tools provided for the solution of symmetric and positive-definite linear systems using up to 8192 GPUs on the EuroHPC-JU Leonardo supercomputer. PSCToolkit is an ongoing mathematical software project aimed at exploiting the extreme computational speed of current supercomputers for relevant problems in Computational and Data Science.</description>

      <title>Spectral approximation of a new class of stochastic fractional evolution equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A method for numerical approximation of a new class of fractional parabolic stochastic evolution equations is introduced and analysed. This class of equations has recently been proposed as a space-time extension of the SPDE-method in spatial statistics. A truncation of the spectral basis function expansion is used to discretise in space, and then a quadrature is used to approximate the temporal evolution of each basis coefficient. Strong error bounds are proved both for the spectral and temporal approximations. The method is tested and the results are verified by several numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Meshfree Variational Physics Informed Neural Networks (MF-VPINN): an adaptive training strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a Meshfree Variational Physics Informed Neural Network. It is a Variational Physics Informed Neural Network that does not require the generation of a triangulation of the entire domain and that can be trained with an adaptive set of test functions. In order to generate the test space we exploit an a posteriori error indicator and add test functions only where the error is higher. Four training strategies are proposed and compared. Numerical results show that the accuracy is higher than the one of a Variational Physics Informed Neural Network trained with the same number of test functions but defined on a quasi-uniform mesh.</description>

      <title>Error analysis of an implicit-explicit time discretization scheme for semilinear wave equations with application to multiscale problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an implicit-explicit (IMEX) scheme for semilinear wave equations with strong damping. By treating the nonlinear, nonstiff term explicitly and the linear, stiff part implicitly, we obtain a method which is not only unconditionally stable but also highly efficient. Our main results are error bounds of the full discretization in space and time for the IMEX scheme combined with a general abstract space discretization. As an application, we consider the heterogeneous multiscale method for wave equations with highly oscillating coefficients in space for which we show spatial and temporal convergence rates by using the abstract result.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Constrained Neural Networks for Solving Structured Inverse Eigenvalue Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel neural network for efficiently solving Structured Inverse Eigenvalue Problems (SIEPs). The main contributions lie in two aspects: firstly, a unified framework is proposed that can handle various SIEPs instances. Particularly, an innovative method for handling nonnegativity constraints is devised using the ReLU function. Secondly, a novel neural network based on multilayer perceptrons, utilizing the Stiefel layer, is designed to efficiently solve SIEP. By incorporating the Stiefel layer through matrix orthogonal decomposition, the orthogonality of similarity transformations is ensured, leading to accurate solutions for SIEPs. Hence, we name this new network Stiefel Multilayer Perceptron (SMLP). Furthermore, SMLP is an unsupervised learning approach with a lightweight structure that is easy to train. Several numerical tests from literature and engineering domains demonstrate the efficiency of SMLP.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a reformulation of the governing equations for incompressible multi-phase flow in the volume of fluid setting leads to a well defined energy rate. Weak nonlinear inflow-outflow and solid wall boundary conditions complement the development and lead to an energy estimate in terms of external data. The new formulation combined with summation-by-parts operators lead to provably nonlinear energy stability.</description>

      <title>On an Interaction Model of General Language Change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the following article, we construct an interaction model (a variant of the SIR-model) of general language change. In the context of language change it is desirable to deduce the long-term behaviour of the corresponding dynamical system (for example to decide if complete of reversible language change are going to happen). We analyse this dynamical system by first proving non-existence of periodic orbits and then invoking the Poincar\'{e}-Bendixson theorem to show convergence to critical points only. Non-existence of periodic orbits is established by contradiction in showing that the average position of a potential periodic orbit must coincide with a certain critical point $C$ which cannot be encircled by the flow of the dynamical system so that the average position would be pulled to that side. Thus the long-term behaviour of the model for any given initial constellation of speakers depends only on four interaction parameters and can be easily analysed by looking at the four critical points. Subsequent numerical analysis of real data on language change is used to justify the relevance of the constructed model for the practicing quantitative linguist. We show how data-fitting methods can be used to determine the four interaction parameters and predict from them the long-term behaviour of the system, i.e. if complete language change or reversible language change will take place.</description>

      <title>Surrogate model for Bayesian optimal experimental design in chromatography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We applied Bayesian Optimal Experimental Design (OED) in the estimation of parameters involved in the Equilibrium Dispersive Model for chromatography with two components with the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. The coefficients estimated were Henry's coefficients, the total absorption capacity and the number of theoretical plates, while the design variables were the injection time and the initial concentration. The Bayesian OED algorithm is based on nested Monte Carlo estimation, which becomes computationally challenging due to the simulation time of the PDE involved in the dispersive model. This complication was relaxed by introducing a surrogate model based on Piecewise Sparse Linear Interpolation. Using the surrogate model instead the original reduces significantly the simulation time and it approximates the solution of the PDE with high degree of accuracy. The estimation of the parameters over strategical design points provided by OED reduces the uncertainty in the estimation of parameters. Additionally, the Bayesian OED methodology indicates no improvements when increasing the number of measurements in temporal nodes above a threshold value.</description>

      <title>Yet another best approximation isotropic elasticity tensor in plane strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For plane strain linear elasticity, given any anisotropic elasticity tensor $\mathbb{C}_{\rm aniso}$, we determine a best approximating isotropic counterpart $\mathbb{C}_{\rm iso}$. This is not done by using a distance measure on the space of positive definite elasticity tensors (Euclidean or logarithmic distance) but by considering two simple isotropic analytic solutions (center of dilatation and concentrated couple) and best fitting these radial solutions to the numerical anisotropic solution based on $\mathbb{C}_{\rm aniso}$. The numerical solution is done via a finite element calculation, and the fitting via a subsequent quadratic error minimization. Thus, we obtain the two Lam\'e-moduli $\mu$, $\lambda$ (or $\mu$ and the bulk-modulus $\kappa$) of $\mathbb{C}_{\rm aniso}$. We observe that our so-determined isotropic tensor $\mathbb{C}_{\rm iso}$ coincides with neither the best logarithmic fit of Norris nor the best Euclidean fit. Our result calls into question the very notion of a best-fit isotropic elasticity tensor to a given anisotropic material.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.09856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an efficient dimension-by-dimension finite-volume method which solves the adiabatic magnetohydrodynamics equations at high discretization order, using the constrained-transport approach on Cartesian grids. Results are presented up to tenth order of accuracy. This method requires only one reconstructed value per face for each computational cell. A passage through high-order point values leads to a modest growth of computational cost with increasing discretization order. At a given resolution, these high-order schemes present significantly less numerical dissipation than commonly employed lower-order approaches. Thus, results of comparable accuracy are achievable at a substantially coarser resolution, yielding overall performance gains. We also present a way to include physical dissipative terms: viscosity, magnetic diffusivity and cooling functions, respecting the finite-volume and constrained-transport frameworks.</description>

      <title>Model order reduction of an ultraweak and optimally stable variational formulation for parametrized reactive transport problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This contribution introduces a model order reduction approach for an advection-reaction problem with a parametrized reaction function. The underlying discretization uses an ultraweak formulation with an $L^2$-like trial space and an 'optimal' test space as introduced by Demkowicz et al. This ensures the stability of the discretization and in addition allows for a symmetric reformulation of the problem in terms of a dual solution which can also be interpreted as the normal equations of an adjoint least-squares problem. Classic model order reduction techniques can then be applied to the space of dual solutions which also immediately gives a reduced primal space. We show that the necessary computations do not require the reconstruction of any primal solutions and can instead be performed entirely on the space of dual solutions. We prove exponential convergence of the Kolmogorov $N$-width and show that a greedy algorithm produces quasi-optimal approximation spaces for both the primal and the dual solution space. Numerical experiments based on the benchmark problem of a catalytic filter confirm the applicability of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Fast Fourier Transform periodic interpolation method for superposition sums in a periodic unit cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a Fast Fourier Transform based Periodic Interpolation Method (FFT-PIM), a flexible and computationally efficient approach for computing the scalar potential given by a superposition sum in a unit cell of an infinitely periodic array. Under the same umbrella, FFT-PIM allows computing the potential for 1D, 2D, and 3D periodicities for dynamic and static problems, including problems with and without a periodic phase shift. The computational complexity of the FFT-PIM is of $O(N \log N)$ for $N$ spatially coinciding sources and observer points. The FFT-PIM uses rapidly converging series representations of the Green's function serving as a kernel in the superposition sum. Based on these representations, the FFT-PIM splits the potential into its near-zone component, which includes a small number of images surrounding the unit cell of interest, and far-zone component, which includes the rest of an infinite number of images. The far-zone component is evaluated by projecting the non-uniform sources onto a sparse uniform grid, performing superposition sums on this sparse grid, and interpolating the potential from the uniform grid to the non-uniform observation points. The near-zone component is evaluated using an FFT-based method, which is adapted to efficiently handle non-uniform source-observer distributions within the periodic unit cell. The FFT-PIM can be used for a broad range of applications, such as periodic problems involving integral equations in computational electromagnetic and acoustic, micromagnetic solvers, and density functional theory solvers.</description>

      <title>Generalized framework for admissibility preserving Lax-Wendroff Flux Reconstruction for hyperbolic conservation laws with source terms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lax-Wendroff Flux Reconstruction (LWFR) is a single-stage, high order, quadrature free method for solving hyperbolic conservation laws. We perform a cell average decomposition of the LWFR scheme that is similar to the one used in the admissibility preserving framework of Zhang and Shu (2010). By performing a flux limiting of the time averaged numerical flux, the decomposition is used to obtain an admissibility preserving LWFR scheme. The admissibility preservation framework is further extended to a newly proposed extension of LWFR scheme for conservation laws with source terms. This is the first extension of the high order LW scheme that can handle source terms. The admissibility and accuracy are verified by numerical experiments on the Ten Moment equations of Livermore et al.</description>

      <title>Strassen's algorithm is not optimally accurate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a non-commutative algorithm for multiplying 2x2 matrices using 7 coefficient products. This algorithm reaches simultaneously a better accuracy in practice compared to previously known such fast algorithms, and a time complexity bound with the best currently known leading term (obtained via alternate basis sparsification). To build this algorithm, we consider matrix and tensor norms bounds governing the stability and accuracy of numerical matrix multiplication. First, we reduce those bounds by minimizing a growth factor along the unique orbit of Strassen's 2x2-matrix multiplication tensor decomposition. Second, we develop heuristics for minimizing the number of operations required to realize a given bilinear formula, while further improving its accuracy. Third, we perform an alternate basis sparsification that improves on the time complexity constant and mostly preserves the overall accuracy.</description>

      <title>Point collocation with mollified piecewise polynomial approximants for high-order partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The solution approximation for partial differential equations (PDEs) can be substantially improved using smooth basis functions. The recently introduced mollified basis functions are constructed through mollification, or convolution, of cell-wise defined piecewise polynomials with a smooth mollifier of certain characteristics. The properties of the mollified basis functions are governed by the order of the piecewise functions and the smoothness of the mollifier. In this work, we exploit the high-order and high-smoothness properties of the mollified basis functions for solving PDEs through the point collocation method. The basis functions are evaluated at a set of collocation points in the domain. In addition, boundary conditions are imposed at a set of boundary collocation points distributed over the domain boundaries. To ensure the stability of the resulting linear system of equations, the number of collocation points is set larger than the total number of basis functions. The resulting linear system is overdetermined and is solved using the least square technique. The presented numerical examples confirm the convergence of the proposed approximation scheme for Poisson, linear elasticity, and biharmonic problems. We study in particular the influence of the mollifier and the spatial distribution of the collocation points.</description>

      <title>On the solution existence for collocation discretizations of time-fractional subdiffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-fractional parabolic equations with a Caputo time derivative of order $\alpha\in(0,1)$ are discretized in time using continuous collocation methods. For such discretizations, we give sufficient conditions for existence and uniqueness of their solutions. Two approaches are explored: the Lax-Milgram Theorem and the eigenfunction expansion. The resulting sufficient conditions, which involve certain $m\times m$ matrices (where $m$ is the order of the collocation scheme), are verified both analytically, for all $m\ge 1$ and all sets of collocation points, and computationally, for all $ m\le 20$. The semilinear case is also addressed.</description>

      <title>Two-level Nonlinear Preconditioning Methods for Flood Models Posed on Perforated Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article focuses on the numerical solution of the Diffusive Wave equation posed in a domain containing a large number of polygonal perforations. These numerous perforations represent structures in urban areas, and this problem is used to model urban floods. This article relies on the work done in a previous article by the same authors, in which we introduced low-dimensional coarse approximation space for the linear Poisson equation based on a coarse polygonal partitioning of the domain. Similarly to other multi-scale numerical methods, this coarse space is spanned by locally discrete harmonic basis functions. We show that this coarse space also lends itself to the linearized Diffusive Wave problem that is obtained at each iteration of Newton's method. Furthermore, we present nonlinear preconditioning techniques, including a Two-level RASPEN and Two-step method, which can significantly reduce the number of iterations compared to the traditional Newton's method. For all proposed methods, we provide a discussion regarding the complexity of the algorithms. Numerical examples illustrating the performance of the proposed methods include a large-scale test case based on topographical data from the city of Nice.</description>

      <title>Low-rank optimization methods based on projected-projected gradient descent that accumulate at Bouligand stationary points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.03962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.03962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of minimizing a differentiable function with locally Lipschitz continuous gradient on the algebraic variety of real matrices of upper-bounded rank. This problem is known to enable the formulation of several machine learning and signal processing tasks such as collaborative filtering and signal recovery. Several definitions of stationarity exist for this nonconvex problem. Among them, Bouligand stationarity is the strongest first-order necessary condition for local optimality. This paper proposes a first-order algorithm that combines the well-known projected-projected gradient descent map with a rank reduction mechanism and generates a sequence in the variety whose accumulation points are Bouligand stationary. This algorithm compares favorably with the three other algorithms known in the literature to enjoy this stationarity property, regarding both the typical computational cost per iteration and empirically observed numerical performance. A framework to design hybrid algorithms enjoying the same property is proposed and illustrated through an example.</description>

      <title>Improved Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) formulation with multiple root nodes for discrete sizing optimization of truss structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new method for discrete optimum design of truss structures utilizing Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) with update process, the best reward, accelerating technique, and terminal condition. An improved MCTS formulation with multiple root nodes is developed in this study. Update process means that once a final solution is found, it is used as the initial solution for next search tree. The best reward is used in the backpropagation step. Accelerating technique is introduced by decreasing the width of search tree and reducing maximum number of iterations. The agent is trained to minimize the total structural weight under various constraints until the terminal condition is satisfied. Then, optimal solution is the minimum value of all solutions found by search trees. These numerical examples show that the agent can find optimal solution with low computational cost, stably produces an optimal design, and is suitable for practical engineering problems.</description>
