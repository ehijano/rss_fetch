      <title>The Role of Counterions in the Assembly of Charged Virus-Like Shells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic virus-like particles (VLP), designed from simplified building blocks, can reduce the complexity of native viral proteins and be tailored for specific applications. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the role of counterions (H2PO4-, PO43-, Cl-, and F-) in stabilizing a pre-assembled virus-like shell formed by cationic peptides exemplified by synthetic cyclopeptide (sequence: cyc-Gln-DLeu-Arg-DLeu-Arg-DLeu-Arg-DLeu) VLP shells. Our findings reveal that polyatomic anions (H2PO4- and PO43-) facilitate stable assemblies by condensing on the VLP shell to higher degrees, thereby neutralizing Coulombic repulsion among the peptide building blocks. Cohesion is largely promoted through the multidentate hydrogen bonds with arginine: Substituting arginine by lysine in the system with H2PO4- leads to destabilization of the structure. H2PO4- additionally engages in hydrophobic interactions with leucine side chains. By contrast, monoatomic anions (Cl- and F-) show insufficient coordination to the peptides and fail to stabilize the assembly, while supplementing F- with excess 1M NaCl can recover the structural integrity by screening electrostatic interactions. This study provides important insights into the role of counterions in molecular self-assembly and the nature of their interactions with amino-acid side chains involved in the cooperative formation and stabilization of synthetic virus-like shells.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Protonated Oxalate from Machine-Learned Simulations and Experiment: Infrared Signatures, Proton Transfer Dynamics and Tunneling Splittings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The infrared spectroscopy and proton transfer dynamics together with the associated tunneling splittings for H/D-transfer in oxalate are investigated using a machine learning-based potential energy surface (PES) of CCSD(T) quality, calibrated against the results of new spectroscopic measurements. Second order vibrational perturbation calculations (VPT2) very successfully describe both the framework and H-transfer modes compared with the experiments. In particular, a new low-intensity signature at 1666 cm$^{-1}$ was correctly predicted from the VPT2 calculations. An unstructured band centered at 2940 cm$^{-1}$ superimposed on a broad background extending from 2600 to 3200 cm$^{-1}$ is assigned to the H-transfer motion. The broad background involves a multitude of combination bands but a major role is played by the COH-bend. For the deuterated species, VPT2 and molecular dynamics simulations provide equally convincing assignments, in particular for the framework modes. Finally, based on the new PES the tunneling splitting for H-transfer is predicted as $\Delta_{\rm H} = 35.0$ cm$^{-1}$ from ring polymer instanton calculations using higher-order corrections. This provides an experimentally accessible benchmark to validate the computations, in particular the quality of the machine-learned PES.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity In Static and Dynamic Light Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Static Light Scattering (SLS) and Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) are very important techniques to study the characteristics of nano-particles in dispersion. The data of SLS is determined by the optical characteristic and the measured values of DLS are determined by optical and hydrodynamic characteristics of different size nano-particles in dispersion. In general, the nano-particles investigated are considered to be cross-linked soft particles or hyper-branched chains with a three dimensional network structure. Therefore the density of these nano-particles is not homogeneous and the different parts have different optical characteristics. However our experiments reveal that the long time average data of scattered intensity can be perfectly described by homogeneous spherical model. Based on the size distribution obtained using the SLS or TEM technique and the relation between the static and hydrodynamic radii, all the calculated and measured values of $g^{\left( 2\right) }\left( \tau \right) $ investigated are also consistent perfectly. Since the long time average scattered intensity of non-homogeneous spherical nano-particles can be perfectly described by homogeneous spherical model, so the phenomenons of ergodicity happen in our experiments.</description>

      <title>Can a Quantum Computer Simulate Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectra Better than a Classical One?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The simulation of the spectra measured in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy experiments is a computationally non-trivial problem, and as such, it represents a problem for which a quantum computer may provide some practical advantage over traditional computing methods. In order to understand the extent to which such problems may provide examples of useful quantum advantage, it is important to understand the limitations of existing classical simulation methods. In this work, we benchmark our classical solver designed to solve such problems. We find that it performs well, even beyond the common experimental parameter regimes, except for a specific molecule with certain unusual features. We discuss what implications this may have for future efforts to demonstrate quantum advantage in the context of NMR.</description>

      <title>Stimulated Raman Spectroscopy with Tunable Visible Broadband Probe Pulse Generated by Kerr-Instability Amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19080v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Femtosecond, broadband stimulated Raman spectroscopy is a popular approach to measuring molecular dynamics with excellent signal-to-noise and spectral resolution. We present a new method for broadband stimulated Raman spectroscopy that employs Kerr-instability amplification to amplify the supercontinuum spectrum from sapphire and create a highly tunable Raman probe spectrum spanning from 530 to 1000 nm (-6000 to 2800 cm^(-1)). Our method, called Kerr-instability amplification for broadband stimulated Raman spectroscopy (KAB-SRS) provides an alternative to optical parametric amplifiers by producing a broader and more tunable spectrum at a significantly reduced cost to OPA implementations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of KAB-SRS by measuring the stimulated Raman loss spectrum of 1-decanol.</description>
