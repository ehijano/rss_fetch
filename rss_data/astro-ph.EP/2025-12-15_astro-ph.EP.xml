      <title>An Open Benchmark of One Million High-Fidelity Cislunar Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cislunar space spans from geosynchronous altitudes to beyond the Moon and will underpin future exploration, science, and security operations. We describe and release an open dataset of one million numerically propagated cislunar trajectories generated with the open-source Space Situational Awareness Python package (SSAPy). The model includes high-degree Earth/Moon gravity, solar gravity, and Earth/Sun radiation pressure; other planetary gravities are omitted by design for computational efficiency. Initial conditions uniformly sample commonly used osculating-element ranges, and each trajectory is propagated for up to six years under a single, fixed start epoch. The dataset is intended as a reusable benchmark for method development (e.g., space domain awareness, navigation, and machine learning pipelines), a reference library for statistical studies of orbit families, and a starting point for community-driven extensions (e.g., alternative epochs). We report empirically observed stability trends (e.g., a band near 5 GEO and persistence of some co-orbital classes including L4/L5 librators) as dataset descriptors rather than new dynamical results. The chief contribution is the scale, fidelity, organization (CSV/HDF5 with full state time series and metadata), and open availability, which together lower the barrier to comparative and data-driven studies in the cislunar regime.</description>

      <title>Mantle Differentiation, Mixing and Interior-Exterior Exchange</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the formation of large-scale heterogeneity in the solid Earth from the magma ocean phase to the present day, focusing on lower-mantle structure and evolution, as well as continental formation and its impact on interior-exterior volatile exchange. The solidification of the magma ocean sets the "initial condition" for solid-state mantle structure and evolution, partitioning volatiles between the surface and interior, and differentiating major and trace elements between mantle reservoirs. A possibly long-lived basal magma ocean is a potential reservoir for iron and incompatible trace elements with important implications for the present-day structure of the lowermost mantle and the distribution of heat-producing elements. With emergent plate tectonics and mantle convection, the production of oceanic crust is the dominant differentiation mechanism, and may contribute to lower-mantle heterogeneity. In turn, convection acts to re-mix heterogeneity. Thus, the structure of the lower mantle records the early differentiation of our planet, as well as long-term evolution. The formation of continental crust and lithosphere has also an important influence on deep-mantle structure and composition, because the distribution of continents can control the scale of plate tectonics, and thus affect mantle convection patterns. While the formation of continental crust and lithosphere, scenarios can be tested by self-consistent long-term evolution models. The exchange of water between the surface and mantle also plays an important role in the dynamics of Earth\' s deep interior. By using relative sea-level change as a proxy for the interior-exterior exchange of water, it is possible to constrain the deep-mantle water cycle. Based on a comprehensive review of these topics, we conclude with several open questions that should be addressed by future studies.</description>

      <title>On the Border: Searching for Cometary Activity Near the Centaur-JFC Transition Line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current wide-field surveys discover ~15 Jupiter-family comets (JFCs) each year, typically identified via visual detection of a dust coma or tail. The same surveys also discover many asteroids that have distant JFC-like orbits, but with no reported activity. We observed asteroids on Jupiter-crossing orbits beyond the depth of typical survey imaging using the 2.5 m Isaac Newton Telescope. We used deep imaging to observe 16 asteroids in this region, plus 7 known comets for comparison. Three asteroids (2011 WM183, (669525) 2012 XO144, and 2020 RX133) showed surface brightness profiles consistent with low-level activity, equating to ~19% of our total sample. We note that 2020 RX133 is a Jupiter Trojan. When we considered the heliocentric distance range of the asteroids at the time they showed activity, this fraction increased to 33% of the targets in the 3.16 \leq Rh \leq 4.56 au region, and therefore it is possible to infer that at least ~30 asteroids with Tj \leq 3.05 and in the 4.05 &lt; a &lt; 5.05 au parameter space may potentially exhibit low-level activity. We also estimated nuclear radii for the three active targets of r_n = 1.8 \pm 0.2 km, r_n \leq 0.8 km, and r_n \leq 0.5 km for (669525) 2012 XO144, 2011 WM183, and 2020 RX133 respectively. The median color index for the observed asteroids is (g-r)_{PS1} = 0.52 \pm 0.13, aligning with those expected for D-type asteroids.</description>

      <title>CPI-C: Cool Planet Imaging Coronagraph on Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cool Planet Imaging Coronagraph (CPI-C) on Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST) is proposed to direct image the cool planets around nearby solar-type stars (within 40 pc). The core scientific objective of CPI-C is to conduct high-contrast directly imaging surveys of exoplanets ranging in size from Neptune-like to Jupiter-like, located at separations of 0.5 to 5 AU from their host stars, and to perform systematic spectroscopic analysis of the detected planets through high-precision multi-band photometry. CPI-C employs a step-transmission apodization technique to suppress the diffraction noises from the telescope pupil and a precise phase correction technique to eliminate the speckle noises due to imperfections of the optical surfaces. The contrast requirement is better than $10^{-8}$ at an inner working angle (IWA) of $3-4\lambda/D$, in the visible wavelength from 600 nm to 900 nm. CPI-C will be the first space-based instrument capable of directly imaging the reflection light from the cool exoplanets in the visible wavelength enabling the measurement of key physical parameters such as the effective temperature, surface gravity, radius, mass, and other key parameters. The potential observation results will significantly contribute to further understand the formation and evolution mechanisms of planets, which will also lay a solid foundation for future confirmation of the Earth-twins in the next generation space flagship missions.</description>

      <title>Dynamical evolution of massless particles in star clusters with NBODY6++GPU-MASSLESS: II. The long-term evolution of free-floating comets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Comets, asteroids, planetesimals, free-floating planets and brown dwarfs, are continuously injected into the intra-cluster environment after expulsion from their host planetary systems or binary system. The dynamics of large populations of such free-floating comets (ffcs) in a star cluster environment is not yet fully understood. Aims. We investigate the dynamical evolution of comet populations in star clusters, and characterize the kinematics and ejection rates of ffc in a star cluster. Moreover, we determine whether a different initial energy distribution affects the mass segregation of the less massive population. Methods. We carry out simulations using the N-body code NBODY6++GPU-MASSLESS (Flammini Dotti et al. 2025), which allows fast integration of star clusters that contain large numbers of massless particles, to characterize the dynamics of populations of low-mass particles with sub-virial and super-virial distributions. Results. Comets do not participate in the mass segregation process, similarly to planet-size objects, regardless of their initial energy distribution. The latter is slightly changing the whole dynamical evolution at the start of the simulation. We only observe an initial relaxation or collapse of the objects for super-virial and sub-virial ratios, respectively. The external regions of the ffcs population tend to be pulled back in the cluster core at the end of the simulation, suggesting the gravitational pull of the stars is pulling them back in the core. This phenomenon occurs at later times if the system in virial equilibrium. Compared to less massive bodies, brown dwarfs experiences more mass segregation the inner regions tend to be more mixed with the stellar population</description>

      <title>Stellar physics at sub-nanoradian angular resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many stars -- if they could be imaged with enough angular resolution -- would exhibit features expected from theory but not possible to extract from spectra. We may group these by increasing complexity as follows. First, smooth variations in brightness across the surface, resembling solar limb darkening but much more prominent and involving more processes in stars with fast spin or external tides. Next, there are periodic features: not only oscillations, but also convective cells and starspots, which appear to transit across a star as its spins, and exoplanets that really do transit across the star. Then, there are transients like flares.
  Current optical interferometers provide synthetic apertures of a few hundred metres and angular resolutions down to about nanoradian ($\simeq 0.2\,$milliarcsecond), enough to resolve some of the above features on the nearest upper main-sequence stars, giants and supergiants. Ongoing projects aims to km-scale synthetic apertures, enough to measure the radius of the nearest white dwarf. In this White Paper we briefly discuss what could be observed with synthetic apertures over $\sim20\,$km -- resolving detail on white dwarfs at the level currently possible on supergiants.</description>

      <title>Dynamical constraints on the S2 (S0-2) star possible companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The center of the Galaxy harbors a supermassive black hole, Sgr\,A*, which is surrounded by a massive star cluster known as the S-cluster. The most extensively studied star in this cluster is the B-type main-sequence S2 star (also known as S0-2). These types of stars are commonly found in binary systems in the Galactic field, but observations do not seem to detect a companion to S2. This absence may be attributed to observational biases or to a dynamically hostile environment caused by phenomena such as tidal disruption or mergers. Using a $N$-body code with first-order post-Newtonian corrections, we investigate whether S2 can host a stellar or planetary companion. We perform $10^{5}$ simulations adopting uniform distributions for the orbital elements of the companion. Our results show that companions may exist for orbital periods shorter than 100~days, eccentricities below 0.8, and across the full range of mutual inclinations. The number of surviving companions increases with shorter orbital periods, lower eccentricities, and nearly coplanar orbits. We also find that the disruption mechanisms include mergers driven by Lidov-Kozai cycles and breakups that occur when the companion surpasses the Hill radius of its orbit. Finally, we find that the presence of a companion would alter S2's astrometric signal by no more than $ 5\,\mu{\rm as}$. Current radial-velocity detection limits constrain viable stellar binary configurations to approximately 4.4\% of the simulated cases. Including astrometric limits reduces to 4.3\%. Imposing an additional constraint that any companion must have a mass $\lesssim 2\,M_{\odot}$ (otherwise it would be visible) narrows the fraction of undetectable stellar binaries to just 3.0\%.</description>

      <title>Asteroid Occultations with VERITAS: Observations and Considerations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Occultations, the covering up of one celestial body by another celestial body, have been used in astronomy for millennia to learn about the sun and moon. Since 2018, VERITAS has implemented a program to detect predicted asteroid occultations, where an asteroid covers up a star. VERITAS has attempted to observe over 100 occultations to date and successfully observed 20 occultations. With these occultations, VERITAS can directly measure the smallest angular diameters of any instrument or technique in the optical for stars between magnitude 9 and 13. Each angular diameter is measured by fitting the diffraction pattern observed by the central VERITAS pixel at the start and end of an occultation. Once a planned FADC upgrade is complete, VERITAS will begin a program to search for serendipitous occultations within its full field of view (3 deg). Serendipitous occultations of sub-km trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) have the potential to constrain models of solar system formation. This work details how VERITAS predicts and observes occultations as well as the overall status of the asteroid occultation program and future steps for observing occultations of both asteroids and TNOs.</description>

      <title>A review on combinatorial approach to aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a combinatorial approach to discrete, finite, and irreversibly aggregating systems has been progressively developed. In this work, we review its achievements up to the present moment, focusing on the practical aspects and discussing its limitations. First, we present the assumptions and combinatorial foundations of the approach, which are based on direct counting of the system states, in contrast to the previous approaches of Smoluchowski and Marcus--Lushnikov. A method to obtain combinatorial expressions for the average number of clusters of a given size and the corresponding standard deviation is described by solving the simplest example of a constant kernel. Then, we extend consideration to a number of kernels (e.g., additive, product, linear--chain, condensation), which were recently solved by explicitly finding the number of internal states of the cluster of a given size. Next, we show that theoretical predictions for any given kernel may be obtained with no need to find an explicit solution but using a recursive expression. We exploit this opportunity to present the use of combinatorial expressions to solve kernels related to the real processes of aerosol growth and planetesimal formation. At this point, a comparison to numerical results appears. Other potential application fields are indicated, including dust agglomeration and polymer growth. Finally, issues related to the varying precision of the theoretical predictions are summarized. In the last section, we propose open problems.</description>

      <title>Transformer Embeddings for Fast Microlensing Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for free-floating planets (FFPs) is a key science driver for upcoming microlensing surveys like the Nancy Grace Roman Galactic Exoplanet Survey. These rogue worlds are typically detected via short-duration microlensing events, the characterization of which often requires analyzing noisy, irregularly-sampled observations. We present a pipeline for this task using simulation-based inference. We use a Transformer encoder to learn a compressed summary representation of the raw time-series data, which in turn conditions a neural posterior estimator. We demonstrate that our method produces accurate and well-calibrated posteriors over three orders of magnitude faster than traditional methods. We also demonstrate its performance on KMT-BLG-2019-2073, a short-duration FFP candidate event.</description>

      <title>Slantwise convection and heat transport in icy moon oceans</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ocean heat transport on icy moons shapes the ice shell topography, a primary observable of these moons. Two key processes control the heat transport: baroclinic instability driven by surface buoyancy contrasts and convective instability driven by heating from the core. However, global ocean simulations cannot accurately resolve convection under realistic icy moon conditions and instead often use Earth-based convective parameterizations, which capture only vertical convective mixing and cannot represent rotation-aligned slantwise convection on icy moons. We use high-resolution convection-resolving simulations to investigate ocean heat transport by slantwise convection in a parameter regime relevant to icy moons, isolated from baroclinic instability. Total heat transport follows the Coriolis-Inertial-Archimedean scaling with an added latitude dependence. The vertical transport increases with latitude, and the meridional transport is poleward. These results indicate that slantwise convection redistributes heat toward the poles, favoring a poleward-thinning ice shell, qualitatively consistent with Enceladus's observed ice thickness distribution.</description>

      <title>Spatial Profiles of 3I/ATLAS CN and Ni Outgassing from Keck/KCWI Integral Field Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11779v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cometary activity from interstellar objects provides a unique window into the environs of other stellar systems. We report blue-sensitive integral field unit spectroscopy of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS from the Keck-II-mounted Keck Cosmic Web Imager on August 24, 2025 UT. We confirm previously reported CN and Ni outgassing, and present, for the first time, the radial profiles of Ni and CN emission in 3I/ATLAS. We find a characteristic $e$-folding radius of $593.7\pm14.8$ km for Ni and $841.0\pm15.4$ km for CN; this suggests that the Ni emission is more centrally concentrated in the nucleus of the comet and favors hypotheses involving easily dissociated species such as metal carbonyls or metal-polycyclic-aromatic-hydrocarbon molecules. Additional integral field spectroscopy after perihelion will offer a continued opportunity to determine the evolution of the radial distributions of species in interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS.</description>

Abstract: We derive a simple, accurate, non-linear, global equation governing spiral density waves in thin, non-self-gravitating, inviscid accretion discs. These discs may have any slowly varying surface density or temperature profile. For specific 'self-similar' disc profiles, solutions to our equation match (novel) smooth non-linear exact spiral solutions derived via a separate method, which highlight that non-linear spiral waves need not shock. Indeed, at low amplitudes, we find that dispersion can overcome wave steepening, and may prevent the inner spiral wakes excited by low mass planets (below roughly 1% of a thermal mass) embedded in protoplanetary discs from shocking. At high amplitudes, we find a simple universal description of non-linear spiral waves with shocks, as well as caps on the possible amplitude and wave action flux of non-linear spirals both with and without shocks, depending on how many arms they have. We further find that highly non-linear spirals are far more loosely wound than their linear counterparts. These developments shed light on why two-armed spirals are prevalent across a range of astrophysical systems which don't necessarily possess an intrinsic twofold symmetry, and why they appear surprisingly loosely wound in observations. These results are supported by very high-resolution numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Characterization of debris disks observed with SPHERE</title>

Abstract: This study aims to characterize debris disks observed with SPHERE across multiple programs, with the goal of identifying systematic trends in disk morphology, dust mass, and grain properties as a function of stellar parameters. We analyzed a sample of 161 young stars using SPHERE observations at optical and near-IR wavelengths. Disk geometries were derived from ellipse fitting and model grids, while dust mass and properties were constrained by modified blackbody (MBB) and size distribution (SD) modeling of SEDs. The dynamical modeling was performed to assess whether the observed disk structures can be explained by the presence of unseen planets. We resolved 51 debris disks, including four new detections: HD 36968, BD-20 951, and the inner belts of HR 8799 and HD 36546. In addition, we found a second transiting giant planet in the HD 114082 system, with a radius of 1.29 $R_{\rm Jup}$ and an orbital distance of ~1 au. We identified nine multi-belt systems, with outer-to-inner belt radius ratios of $1.5-2$, and found close agreement between scattered-light and millimeter-continuum belt radii. They scale weakly with stellar luminosity ($R_{\rm belt} \propto L_{\star}^{0.11}$), but show steeper dependencies when separated by CO and CO$_2$ freeze-out regimes. Disk fractional luminosities follow collisional decay trends, declining as $t_{\rm age}^{-1.18}$ for A and $t_{\rm age}^{-0.81}$ for F stars. The inferred dust masses span $10^{-5}-1\,M_\oplus$ from MBB and $0.01-1\,M_\oplus$ from SD modeling. These masses scale as $R_{\rm belt}^n$ with $n&gt;2$ in belt radius and super-linearly with stellar mass, consistent with trends seen in protoplanetary disks. Analysing correlation between disk polarized flux and IR excess, we found an offset of ~1 dex between total-intensity (HST) and polarized fluxes. A new parametric approach to estimate dust albedo and maximum polarization fraction is introduced.</description>

      <title>Portable Adaptive Optics for Exoplanet Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.08050</link>
      <description>arXiv:1806.08050v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Portable Adaptive Optics (PAO) is a low-cost and compact system, designed for 4-meter class telescopes that have no Adaptive Optics (AO), because of the physical space limitation at the Nasmyth or Cassegrain focus and the historically high cost of the conventional AO. The initial scientific observations of the PAO are focused on the direct imaging of exoplanets and sub-stellar companions. This paper discusses the PAO concept and the associated high-contrast imaging performance in our recent observational runs. PAO is delivering a Strehl ratio better than $60\%$ in $H$ band under median seeing conditions of $1 ''$. Combined with our dedicated image rotation and subtraction (IRS) technique and the optimized IRS (O-IRS) algorithm, the averaged contrast ratio for a $5\leq V\rm_{mag} \leq 9$ primary star is $1.3 \times 10^{-5}$ and $3.3 \times 10^{-6}$ at angular distance of $0.36 ''$ under exposure time of 7 minutes and 2 hours, respectively. PAO has successfully revealed the known exoplanet of $\kappa$ And b, in our recent observation at 3.5-meter ARC telescope at Apache Point Observatory. We have performed the associated astrometry and photometry analysis of the recovered $\kappa$ And b planet, which gives a projected separation of $0.984 \pm 0.05 ''$, a position angle of $51.1 \pm 0.5^{\circ}$, and a mass of $10.15_{-1.255}^{+2.19}M_{\rm Jup}$. These results demonstrate that PAO can be used for direct imaging of exoplanets with medium-sized telescopes.</description>
