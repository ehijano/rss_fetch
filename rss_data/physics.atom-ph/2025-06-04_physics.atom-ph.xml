      <title>Linear optical sub-Doppler Ramsey resonances in ultrathin gas cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper theoretically establishes and studies the sub-Doppler linear optical Ramsey resonances that arise under certain conditions near centers of optical transitions in the absorption of a sufficiently weak monochromatic light beam during its stationary propagation in the normal direction through an ultrathin gas cell whose internal thickness is less than or of the order of the wavelength of this radiation. We consider a situation when the cross section of this beam consists of two coaxial spatially separated regions, with the absorption signal being detected in a comparatively narrow central part of the beam. The paper studies the significant dependence of the linear optical Ramsey resonances, that arise in such an absorption spectrum, on the distance between these regions, as well as on the phase difference between them. In particular, it is shown that if this phase difference is close to pi, then instead of absorption, amplification of the central part of the incident beam can occur. The Ramsey resonances under consideration are most clearly manifested when the internal thickness of the gas cell is equal to a small halfinteger number of wavelengths of the resonant radiation. However, these resonances do not arise if this thickness is equal to an integer number of such waves. The established Ramsey resonances, under certain conditions, can find application in ultrahigh resolution atomic (molecular) spectroscopy, as well as effective references in compact optical frequency standards.</description>

      <title>Magneto-optical trapping of aluminum monofluoride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magneto-optical trapping of molecules has thus far been restricted to molecules with $^2\Sigma$ electronic ground states. These species are chemically reactive and only support a simple laser cooling scheme from their first excited rotational level. Here, we demonstrate a magneto-optical trap (MOT) of aluminum monofluoride (AlF), a deeply bound and intrinsically stable diatomic molecule with a $^1\Sigma^+$ electronic ground state. The MOT operates on the strong A$^1\Pi\leftarrow{}$X$^1\Sigma^+$ transition near 227.5~nm, whose Q$(J)$ lines are all rotationally closed. We demonstrate a MOT of about $6\times 10^4$ molecules for the $J=1$ level of AlF, more than $10^4$ molecules for $J=2$ and $3$, and with no fundamental limit in going to higher rotational levels. Laser cooling and trapping of AlF is conceptually similar to the introduction of alkaline-earth atoms into cold atom physics, and is key to leveraging its spin-forbidden a$^3\Pi \leftarrow{}$X$^1\Sigma^+$ transition for precision spectroscopy and narrow-line cooling.</description>

      <title>Study of atomic effects on electron spectrum in bound-muon decay process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the bound-muon decay process, the study of atomic effects on the electron spectrum near its endpoint is performed within the framework of the Fermi effective theory. The analysis takes into account for corrections due to finite-nuclear-size, nuclear-deformation, electron-screening, and vacuum-polarization effects, all of which are incorporated self-consistently into the Dirac equation. Furthermore, the nuclear-recoil correction to the muon binding energy is included. Calculations are carried out for the isotopes of C, Al, and Si, which are of a particular importance for forthcoming experiments aimed at search for the charged-lepton flavor-violating process of muon-to-electron conversion in a nuclear field.</description>

      <title>Floquet-engineered decoherence-resilient protocols for wideband sensing beyond the linear standard quantum limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key advantage of quantum metrology is the ability to surpass the standard quantum limit for measurement precision through the use of non-classical states. However, there is typically little to no improvement in precision with the use of non-classical states for measurements whose duration exceeds the decoherence time of the underlying quantum states. Measurements aimed at the ultimate possible precision are thus performed almost exclusively with classical states and, therefore, are constrained by the standard quantum limit. Here, we demonstrate that by using the phenomenon of subharmonic excitation, in combination with a recently demonstrated technique of Raman excitation of a harmonic oscillator, the frequency of an electric field can be measured at a resolution below the standard quantum limit of the corresponding linear measurement. As the input states can be classical, this metrological gain persists to long timescales and improves the ultimate possible precision. While we demonstrate this technique using motional Raman subharmonic excitation of a single 40ca^+ ion through engineered Floquet states, this technique is expected to be extendable to other platforms, such as NV centers, solid-state qubits, and neutral atoms, where it can provide metrological gain for sensing across the radio frequency, microwave, and optical domains.</description>

      <title>$^{229}$Th Nuclear Spectroscopy in an Opaque Material: Laser-Based Conversion Electron M\"ossbauer Spectroscopy of $^{229}$ThO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, we report the first demonstration of laser-induced conversion electron M\"{o}ssbauer spectroscopy of the $^{229}$Th nuclear isomeric state, which provides the ability to probe the nuclear transition in a material that is opaque to light resonant with the nuclear transition. Specifically, we excite the nuclear transition in a thin ThO$_2$ sample whose band gap ($\sim$ 6 eV) is considerably smaller than the nuclear isomeric state energy (8.4 eV). As a result, the excited nucleus can quickly decay by internal conversion, resulting in the ejection of electrons from the surface. By collecting these conversion electrons, nuclear spectroscopy can be recorded. Unlike fluorescence spectroscopy, this technique is compatible with materials whose work function is less than the nuclear transition energy, opening a wider class of systems to study. Further, because ThO$_2$ can be made from spinless isotopes and the internal conversion decay process reduces the isomeric state lifetime to only $\sim$10 $\mu$s, allowing $\sim$10$^8$ relative reduction in clock interrogation time, a conversion-electron-based nuclear clock could lead to a $\sim$10$^4$ reduction in clock instability.</description>

      <title>Ubiquitous Symmetry at Critical Points Across Diverse Optimization Landscapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry plays a crucial role in understanding the properties of mathematical structures and optimization problems. Recent work has explored this phenomenon in the context of neural networks, where the loss function is invariant under column and row permutations of the network weights. It has been observed that local minima exhibit significant symmetry with respect to the network weights (invariance to row and column permutations). And moreover no critical point was found that lacked symmetry. We extend this line of inquiry by investigating symmetry phenomena in real-valued loss functions defined on a broader class of spaces. We will introduce four more cases: the projective case over a finite field, the octahedral graph case, the perfect matching case, and the particle attraction case. We show that as in the neural network case, all the critical points observed have non-trivial symmetry. Finally we introduce a new measure of symmetry in the system and show that it reveals additional symmetry structures not captured by the previous measure.</description>

      <title>Optimizing NN reduction in an atom interferometer network for GW detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sensitivity of an atom gradiometer aiming to detect gravitational waves (GW) is impacted by fluctuations of Earth's gravity field also called Newtonian Noise (NN). Sensor arrays have proved to be a promising technique for NN reduction. In our study, we further investigate the benefits of Atom Interferometer (AI) networks by improving their geometry and the extraction of the GW signal. We focus on Seismic Newtonian Noise in the frequency band from 0.1 to 10 Hz. On one hand, we show that using a specific detector geometry, a better NN rejection can occur optimizing the number of gradiometers in the network. On the other hand, we show that carrying out optimization in sub frequency bands - which results in using various detector geometries from a common network - allows even higher NN rejection while keeping a similar number of interferometers.</description>

      <title>Liouvillian and Hamiltonian exceptional points of atomic vapors: The spectral signatures of quantum jumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate spectral singularities in an alkali-metal atomic vapor modeled using four and effectively three hyperfine states. By comparing the eigenvalue spectra of a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian (NHH) and a Liouvillian superoperator, we analyze the emergence and characteristics of both semiclassical and quantum exceptional points. Our results reveal that, for atomic systems, the NHH approach alone may be insufficient to fully capture the system's spectral properties. While NHHs can yield accurate predictions in certain regimes, a comprehensive description typically requires the Liouvillian formalism, which governs the Lindblad master equation and explicitly incorporates quantum jump processes responsible for repopulation dynamics. We demonstrate that the inclusion of quantum jumps fundamentally alters the spectral structure of the system. In particular, we present examples in which the existence, location in parameter space, or even the order of spectral degeneracies differ significantly between the two approaches, thereby highlighting the impact of quantum jumps and the limitations of the NHH method. Finally, using the hybrid-Liouvillian formalism, we show how quantum jumps reshape spectral features initially predicted by the NHH, ultimately determining the full Liouvillian spectrum.</description>

      <title>Cold hybrid electrical-optical ion trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.10366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advances in research such as quantum information and quantum chemistry require subtle methods for trapping particles (including ions, neutral atoms, molecules, etc.). Here we propose a hybrid ion trapping method by combining a Paul trap with optical tweezers. The trap combines the advances of the deep-potential feature for the Paul trap and the micromotion-free feature for the optical dipole trap. By modulating the optical-dipole trap synchronously with the radio frequency voltage of the Paul trap, the alternating electrical force in the trap center is fully counteracted, and the micromotion temperature of a cold trapped ion can reach the order of nK while the trap depth is beyond 300K. These features will enable cold collisions between an ion and an atom in the $s$-wave regime and stably trap the produced molecular ion in the cold hybrid system. This will provide a unique platform for probing the interactions between the ions and the surrounding neutral particles and enable the investigation of new reaction pathways and reaction products in the cold regime.</description>

      <title>Observing dynamics of distinct structural transitions in trapped-ion clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interacting many-particle systems can self-organize into a rich variety of crystalline structures. While symmetry provides a powerful framework for predicting whether structural transitions between crystal states are continuous or discontinuous, collective lattice dynamics offer complementary insights into the microscopic mechanisms that drive these transitions. Trapped laser-cooled ions present a pristine and highly controllable few-body system for studying this interplay of symmetry and dynamics. Here, we use real-time fluorescence imaging while deforming the trap potential to observe a variety of structural transitions in three-dimensional unit-cell-sized ion clusters. We probe their distinct dynamical signatures: mode softening indicating a structural instability at a symmetry-breaking continuous transition, stochastic switching between stable structures at a discontinuous transition, and hysteresis near a spinodal point. We also observe a remarkable triple point-like feature where a discontinuous symmetry-changing transition and a continuous symmetry-breaking transition occur simultaneously. Analytical calculations based on symmetry considerations and numerical analysis of collective modes provide a comprehensive understanding of the observed dynamics. Our results demonstrate that tunable Coulomb clusters serve as a versatile platform to elucidate the interplay between symmetry, energy landscapes, and dynamical pathways in structural transitions.</description>
