      <title>Optimizing First-Line Therapeutics in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: Insights from Joint Modeling and Large-Scale Data Analysis</title>

Abstract: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is often intrinsically resistant to several first- and second-line therapeutics and can rapidly acquire further resistance after a patient begins receiving treatment. Treatment outcomes are therefore significantly impacted by the optimization of therapeutic scheduling. Previous preclinical research has suggested scheduling bevacizumab in sequence with combination antiproliferatives could significantly improve clinical outcomes. Mathematical modeling is a well-suited tool for investigating this proposed scheduling modification. To address this critical need, individual patient tumor data from 11 clinical trials in NSCLC has been collated and used to develop a semi-mechanistic model of NSCLC growth and response to the various therapeutics represented in those trials. Precise estimates of clinical parameters fundamental to cancer modeling have been produced - such as the rate of acquired resistance to various pharmaceuticals, the relationship between drug concentration and cancer cell death, as well as the fine temporal dynamics of vascular remodeling in response to bevacizumab. In a reserved portion of the dataset, this model was used to predict the efficacy of individual treatment time courses with a mean error rate of 59.7% after a single tumor measurement and 11.7% after three successive tumor measurements. A delay of 9.6 hours between pemetrexed-cisplatin and bevacizumab administration is predicted to optimize the benefit of sequential administration. At this gap, approximately 93.5% of simulated patients benefited from a gap in sequential administration compared with concomitant administration. Of those simulated patients, the mean improvement in tumor reduction was 20.7%. This result suggests that scheduling a modest gap between the administration of bevacizumab and its partner antiproliferatives could meaningfully improve patient outcomes in NSCLC.</description>
