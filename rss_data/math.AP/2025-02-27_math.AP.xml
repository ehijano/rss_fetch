      <title>From Fisher information decay for the Kac model to the Landau-Coulomb hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Kac model for the space-homogeneous Landau equation with the Coulomb potential. We show that the Fisher information of the Liouville equation for the unmodified $N$-particle system is monotonically decreasing in time. The monotonicity ensures the compactness to derive a weak solution of the Landau hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Global solutions for systems of strongly invariant operators on closed manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the global hypoellipticity and solvability of strongly invariant operators and systems of strongly invariant operators on closed manifolds. Our approach is based on the Fourier analysis induced by an elliptic pseudo-differential operator, which provides a spectral decomposition of $L^2(M)$ into finite-dimensional eigenspaces. This framework allows us to characterize these global properties through asymptotic estimates on the matrix symbols of the operators. Additionally, for systems of normal strongly invariant operators, we derive an explicit solution formula and establish sufficient conditions for global hypoellipticity and solvability in terms of their eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>A new asymptotic regime for the KdV equation with Wigner-von Neumann type initial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the long-time asymptotic behavior of solutions to the Cauchy problem for the KdV equation, focusing on the evolution of the radiant wave associated with a Wigner-von Neumann (WvN) resonance induced by the initial data (potential). A WvN resonance refers to an energy level where the potential exhibits zero transmission (complete reflection). The corresponding Jost solution at such energy becomes singular, and in the NLS context, this is referred to as a spectral singularity. A WvN resonance represents a long-range phenomenon, often introducing significant challenges, such as an infinite negative spectrum, when employing the inverse scattering transform (IST). To avoid some of these issues, we consider a restricted class of initial data that generates a WvN resonance but for which the IST framework can be suitably adapted. For this class of potentials, we demonstrate that each WvN resonance produces a distinct asymptotic regime -- termed the resonance regime -- characterized by a slower decay rate for large time compared to the radiant waves associated with short-range initial data.</description>

      <title>Type-I Superconductors in the Limit as the London Penetration Depth Goes to 0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type-I superconductors are described by the London equations, which, in the static case, relate the magnetic field $\boldsymbol{\eta}_{\lambda_{L}}$ to the current $\boldsymbol{j}_{\lambda_{L}},$ $$d^*\boldsymbol{\eta}_{\lambda_{L}}=\boldsymbol{j}_{\lambda_{L}},\,d\boldsymbol{j}_{\lambda_{L}}=-\frac{1}{\lambda_{L}^2}\boldsymbol{\eta}_{\lambda_{L}}.$$
  We represent the magnetic field as a 2-form and the current as a 1-form. Assume that the superconducting material is contained in a bounded, connected set, $\Omega,$ with smooth boundary. The parameter $0&lt;\lambda_{L},$ called the "London penetration depth," gives an estimate for the thickness of the layer near to $\partial \Omega$ where the current $\boldsymbol{j}_{\lambda_{L}}$ is largely carried. In an earlier paper, we introduced a system of Fredholm integral equations of second kind, on $\partial\Omega,$ for solving the physically relevant scattering problems in this context. In real type-I superconductors $\lambda_{L}\approx 100$nm, which often renders the integral equation approach computationally intractable. In this paper we provide an explicit formula for approximate solutions, $(\widetilde{\boldsymbol \eta}_{\lambda_{L}},\widetilde{\boldsymbol \jmath}_{\lambda_{L}}),$ to scattering problems for the static London equations, and show that the $L^2$-error in the magnetic field is $\|\boldsymbol{\eta}_{\lambda_{L}}-\widetilde{\boldsymbol \eta}_{\lambda_{L}}\|_{L^2}=O(\lambda_{L}^{1-\epsilon}),$ for any $\epsilon&gt;0.$ The current converges to a singular current sheet supported on $\partial\Omega;$ we show that $\|\boldsymbol{j}_{\lambda_{L}}-\widetilde{\boldsymbol \jmath}_{\lambda_{L}}\|_{L^2}=O(\lambda_{L}^{\frac{1-\epsilon}{2}}),$ for any $\epsilon&gt;0.$ The paper concludes with numerical examples, illustrating the efficacy of our methods.</description>

      <title>Non-divergence evolution operators modeled on H\"ormander's vector fields with Dini continuous coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we construct a fundamental solution for operators of the form H = a_ij(x,t) X_i X_j - d/dt (having adopted Einstein's convention on repeated indexes) and we show that the latter satisfies suitable Gaussian estimates. Here the X_i are H\"ormander's vector fields generating a Carnot group and A = (a_ij) is a symmetric and uniformly positive-definite matrix with bounded double Dini continuous entries. As a consequence of this procedure we also prove an existence result for the related Cauchy problem, under a Dini-type condition on the source.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear bound states with prescribed angular momentum in the mass supercritical regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the existence, orbital stability/instability and regularity of bound state solutions to nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with super-quadratic confinement in two and three spatial dimensions for the mass supercritical case. Such solutions, which are given by time-dependent rotations of a non-radially symmetric spatial profile, correspond to critical points of the underlying energy function restricted on the double constraints consisting of the mass and the angular momentum. The study exhibits new pictures for rotating Bose-Einstein condensates within the framework of Gross-Pitaevskii theory. It is proved that there exist two non-radial symmetric solutions, one of which is local minimizer and the other is mountain pass type critical point of the underlying energy function restricted on the constraints. Moreover, we derive conditions that guarantee that local minimizers are regular, the set of those is orbitally stable and mountain pass type solutions are strongly unstable. The results extend and complement the recent ones in \cite{NSS}, where the consideration is undertaken in the mass subcritical case.</description>

      <title>Periodic propagation of singularities for heat equations with time delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents two remarkable phenomena associated with the heat equation with a time delay: namely, the propagation of singularities and periodicity. These are manifested through a distinctive mode of propagation of singularities in the solutions. Precisely, the singularities of the solutions propagate periodically in a bidirectional fashion along the time axis. Furthermore, this propagation occurs in a stepwise manner. More specifically, when propagating in the positive time direction, the order of the joint derivatives of the solution increases by 2 for each period; conversely, when propagating in the reverse time direction, the order of the joint derivatives decreases by 2 per period. Additionally, we elucidate the way in which the initial data and historical values impact such a propagation of singularities.
  The phenomena we have discerned not only corroborate the pronounced differences between heat equations with and without time delay but also vividly illustrate the substantial divergence between the heat equation with a time delay and the wave equation, especially when viewed from the point of view of singularity propagation.</description>

      <title>Global-in-time estimates for the 2D one-phase Muskat problem with contact points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the dynamics of a two-dimensional viscous fluid evolving through a porous medium or a Hele-Shaw cell, driven by gravity and surface tension. A key feature of this study is that the fluid is confined within a vessel with vertical walls and below a dry region. Consequently, the dynamics of the contact points between the vessel, the fluid and the dry region are inherently coupled with the surface evolution. A similar contact scenario was recently analyzed for more regular viscous flows, modeled by the Stokes [GuoTice2018] and Navier-Stokes [GuoTice2024] equations. Here, we adopt the same framework but use the more singular Darcy's law for modeling the flow. We prove global-in-time a priori estimates for solutions initially close to equilibrium. Taking advantage of the Neumann problem solved by the velocity potential, the analysis is carried out in non-weighted $L^2$-based Sobolev spaces and without imposing restrictions on the contact angles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we show that the Schrodinger equation in quantum mechanics is mathematically equivalent to the Euler-Bernoulli equation for vibrating beams and plates in elasticity theory, with dependent initial data. Remarks are made on potential applications of this equivalence for symplectic and quantum computing, the two-slit experiment using vibrating beams and plates, and the p-adic Euler-Bernoulli equation.</description>

      <title>On the stability-instability transition in large Bose-Fermi mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the low-energy spectrum of large Bose-Fermi mixtures. In the chosen scaling, the fermions induce an effective attraction among the bosons, which competes with their intrinsic repulsive interaction. Our main result demonstrates the convergence of the eigenvalues towards those of an effective Bose Hamiltonian. For short-range potentials, we apply this result to derive a stability-instability transition in the bosonic subsystem, driven by the Bose-Fermi coupling strength $g$. For small $|g|$, the bosons form a stable Bose-Einstein condensate with the energy per particle uniformly bounded from below. For large $|g|$, the energy per particle is no longer uniformly bounded from below, signalling the collapse of the condensate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study a new family of tensor tomography problems. At rank 2 it corresponds to linearization of travel time of elastic waves, measured for all polarizations. We provide a kernel characterization for ranks up to 2. The kernels consist of potential tensors, but in an unusual sense: the associated differential operators have degree 2 instead of the familiar 1. The proofs are based on Fourier analysis, Helmholtz decompositions, and cohomology.</description>

      <title>Weak type $(1,1)$ bounds for Riesz transforms for elliptic operators in non-divergence form</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $L=-\sum_{i,j=1}^n a_{ij}D_iD_j$ be the elliptic operator in non-divergence form with smooth real coefficients satisfying uniformly elliptic condition. Let $W$ be the global
  nonnegative adjoint solution. If $W\in A_2$, we prove that the Riesz transforms $\nabla L^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ is of weak type $(1,1)$ with respect to the measure $W(x)dx$. This, together with $L^2_W$ boundedness of Riesz transforms \cite{EHH}, implies that the Riesz transforms are bounded in $L^p_W$ for $1&lt;p&lt;2$. Our results are applicable to the case of real coefficients having sufficiently small BMO norm.</description>

      <title>Convergence of random splitting method for the Allen-Cahn equation in a background flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study in this paper the convergence of the random splitting method for Allen-Cahn equation in a background flow that plays as a simplified model for phase separation in multiphase flows. The model does not own the gradient flow structure as the usual Allen-Cahn equation does, and the random splitting method is advantageous due to its simplicity and better convergence rate. Though the random splitting is a classical method, the analysis of the convergence is not straightforward for this model due to the nonlinearity and unboundedness of the operators. We obtain uniform estimates of various Sobolev norms of the numerical solutions and the stability of the model. Based on the Sobolev estimates, the local trunction errors are then rigorously obtained. We then prove that the random operator splitting has an expected single run error with order $1.5$ and a bias with order $2$. Numerical experiments are then performed to confirm our theoretic findings.</description>

  u(t,r)\sim Q\left(\frac{r}{\lambda(t)}\right), \end{equation*}where $Q$ is a stationary state of the equation and the blow-up rates are quantized by \begin{equation*} \lambda(t)\sim c_{u}(T-t)^{\frac{l}{\gamma}},\,\,\,l\,\,\,\text{is any positive integer},\,\,\,\gamma=\gamma(d)=\frac{d-4-\sqrt{(d-6)^2-12}}{2}. \end{equation*} Moreover, such solutions are in fact $(l-1)$-codimension stable under pertubation of the initial data.</description>

      <title>Instability of stationary solutions for double power nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.14337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a double power nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation which possesses the algebraically decaying stationary solution $\phi_0$ as well as exponentially decaying standing waves $e^{i\omega t}\phi_\omega(x)$ with $\omega&gt;0$. It is well-known from the general theory that stability properties of standing waves are determined by the derivative of $\omega\mapsto M(\omega):=\frac{1}{2}\|\phi_\omega\|_{L^2}^2$; namely $e^{i\omega t}\phi_\omega$ with $\omega&gt;0$ is stable if $M'(\omega)&gt;0$ and unstable if $M'(\omega)&lt;0$. However, the stability/instability of stationary solutions is outside the general theory from the viewpoint of spectral properties of linearized operators. In this paper we prove the instability of the stationary solution $\phi_0$ in one dimension under the condition $M'(0):=\lim_{\omega\downarrow 0}M'(\omega)\in[-\infty, 0)$. The key in the proof is the construction of the one-sided derivative of $\omega\mapsto\phi_\omega$ at $\omega=0$, which is effectively used to construct the unstable direction of $\phi_0$.</description>

      <title>Remark on the local well-posedness of compressible non-Newtonian fluids with initial vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18564v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss in this short note the local-in-time strong well-posedness of the compressible Navier-Stokes system for non-Newtonian fluids on the three dimensional torus. We show that the result established recently by Kalousek, M\'{a}cha, and Ne\v{c}asova in \doi{10.1007/s00208-021-02301-8} can be extended to the case where vanishing density is allowed initially. Our proof builds on the framework developed by Cho, Choe, and Kim in \doi{10.1016/j.matpur.2003.11.004} for compressible Navier-Stokes equations in the case of Newtonian fluids. To adapt their method, special attention is given to the elliptic regularity of a challenging nonlinear elliptic system. We show particular results in this direction, however, the main result of this paper is proven in the general case when elliptic $W^{2,p}$-regularity is imposed as an assumption. Also, we give a finite time blow-up criterion.</description>

      <title>Convergence of the volume preserving fractional mean curvature flow for convex sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03912v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the volume preserving fractional mean curvature flow starting from a convex set does not develop singularities along the flow. By the recent result of Cesaroni-Novaga \cite{CN} this then implies that the flow converges to a ball exponentially fast. In the proof we show that the apriori estimates due to Cinti-Sinestrari-Valdinoci \cite{CSV2} imply the $C^{1+\alpha}$-regularity of the flow and then provide a regularity argument which improves this into $C^{2+\alpha}$-regularity of the flow. The regularity step from $C^{1+\alpha}$ into $C^{2+\alpha}$ does not rely on convexity and can probably be adopted to more general setting.</description>

      <title>The three limits of the hydrostatic approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The primitive equations are derived from the $3D$-Navier-Stokes equations by the hydrostatic approximation. Formally, assuming an $\varepsilon$-thin domain and anisotropic viscosities with vertical viscosity $\nu_z=\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^\gamma)$ where $\gamma=2$, one obtains the primitive equations with full viscosity as $\varepsilon\to 0$. Here, we take two more limit equations into consideration: For $\gamma&lt;2$ the $2D$-Navier-Stokes equations are obtained. For $\gamma&gt;2$ the primitive equations with only horizontal viscosity $-\Delta_H$ as $\varepsilon\to 0$. Thus, there are three possible limits of the hydrostatic approximation depending on the assumption on the vertical viscosity. The latter convergence has been proven recently by Li, Titi, and Yuan using energy estimates. Here, we consider more generally $\nu_z=\varepsilon^2 \delta$ and show how maximal regularity methods and quadratic inequalities can be an efficient approach to the same end for $\varepsilon,\delta\to 0$. The flexibility of our methods is also illustrated by the convergence for $\delta\to \infty$ and $\varepsilon\to 0$ to the $2D$-Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

      <title>Initial data for Minkowski stability with arbitrary decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct and parametrize solutions to the constraint equations of general relativity in a neighborhood of Minkowski spacetime with arbitrary prescribed decay properties at infinity. We thus provide a large class of initial data for the results on stability of Minkowski which include a mass term in the asymptotics. Due to the symmetries of Minkowski, a naive linear perturbation fails. Our construction is based on a simplified conformal method, a reduction to transverse traceless perturbations and a nonlinear fixed point argument where we face linear obstructions coming from the cokernels of both the linearized constraint operator and the Laplace operator. To tackle these obstructions, we introduce a well-chosen truncated black hole around which to perturb. The control of the parameters of the truncated black hole is the most technical part of the proof, since its center of mass and angular momentum could be arbitrarily large.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a link between Muckenhoupt $A_p$ weights and a means to address small divisor problems. We use this link to obtain a quantitative version of the Ehrenpreis-Malgrange theorem of local solvability for constant coefficient PDE. We give an example as to how our theorem applies. In our quantitative version of the Ehrenpreis-Malgrange theorem, the loss of derivatives in the solvability estimate is measured in the scale of Sobolev spaces via the use of Muckenhoupt A_p weights. A part of our results are global in nature.</description>

      <title>Malliavin Calculus for the stochastic heat equation and results on the density</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10115v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the one-dimensional stochastic heat equation with unbounded, nonlinear,Lipschitz coefficients with Dirichlet boundary conditions. Using Malliavin calculus, we construct a piecewise approximation of the solution u and establish regularity results. This approximation enables us to provide a new proof of the existence of a density for the random variable u(t, x) at any fixed t, x. Unlike existing proofs, which rely on comparison principles ([10], [12]), our approach is based purely on a localization argument, which allows us to handle the unbounded coefficients.</description>

      <title>Regularity and existence for semilinear mixed local-nonlocal equations with variable singularities and measure data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article proves the existence and regularity of weak solutions for a class of mixed local-nonlocal problems with singular nonlinearities. We examine both the purely singular problem and perturbed singular problems. A central contribution of this work is the inclusion of a variable singular exponent in the context of measure-valued data. Another notable feature is that the source terms in both the purely singular and perturbed components can simultaneously take the form of measures. To the best of our knowledge, this phenomenon is new, even in the case of a constant singular exponent.</description>

      <title>An accurate approach to determining the spatiotemporal vehicle load on bridges based on measured boundary slopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, a novel mathematical model is developed to evaluate the spatiotemporal vehicle loads on long bridges from slope measurements made at the ends of a bridge based on Euler-Bernoulli beam model with internal and external damping. The mathematical modelling of this phenomena leads to the inverse source problem of determining the spatiotemporal vehicle load $F(x,t)$ in the variable coefficient Euler-Bernoulli equation $\rho_A(x)u_{tt}+\mu(x) u_{t}+(r(x)u_{xx})_{xx}+(\kappa(x)u_{xxt})_{xx}=F(x,t)$, $(x,t)\in \Omega_T:=(0,\ell)\times (0,T)$ subject to the "simply supported" boundary conditions $u(0,t)=(r(x)u_{xx}+(\kappa(x)u_{xxt})_{x=0}=0$, $u(\ell,t)=(r(x)u_{xx}+(\kappa(x)u_{xxt})_{x=\ell}=0$, from the both measured outputs: $\theta_1(t):=u_x(0,t)$ and $\theta_2(t):=u_x(\ell,t)$, that is, the measured boundary slopes. It is shown that the input-output maps $(\Phi F)(t):=u_x(0,t;F)$, $(\Psi F)(t):=u_x(\ell,t;F)$, $F \in \mathcal{F}\subset L^2(\Omega_T)$, corresponding to the inverse problem, are compact and Lipschitz continuous. Then Tikhonov functional $J(F)=\Vert \Phi F-\theta_1 \Vert_{L^2(0,T)}^2+\Vert \Psi F-\theta_2 \Vert_{L^2(0,T)}^2$ is introduced to prove the existence of a quasi-solution to the inverse problem. An explicit gradient formula for the Fr\'{e}chet derivative of the Tikhonov functional is derived. The Lipschitz continuity of the Fr\'{e}chet gradient, which guarantees the monotonicity of iterations in gradient methods, has been proven.</description>

Abstract: We obtain uniform estimates for the canonical solution to $\bar\partial u=f$ on the Cartesian product of bounded planar domains with $C^2$ boundaries, when $f$ is continuous up to the boundary. This generalizes Landucci's result for the bidisc toward higher dimensional product domains. In particular, it answers an open question of Kerzman for continuous datum.</description>

      <title>On residues and conjugacies for germs of 1-D parabolic diffeomorphisms in finite regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.13182v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study conjugacy classes of germs of non-flat diffeomorphisms of the real line fixing the origin. Based on the work of Takens and Yoccoz, we establish results that are sharp in terms of differentiability classes and order of tangency to the identity. The core of all of this lies in the invariance of residues under low-regular conjugacies. This may be seen as an extension of the fact (also proved in this article) that the value of the Schwarzian derivative at the origin for germs of $C^3$ parabolic diffeomorphisms is invariant under $C^2$ parabolic conjugacy, though it may vary arbitrarily under parabolic $C^1$ conjugacy.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Hodge Theorem: curl and asymmetric pseudodifferential projections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02015v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a new approach to the study of spectral asymmetry. Working with the operator $\operatorname{curl}:=*\mathrm{d}$ on a connected oriented closed Riemannian 3-manifold, we construct, by means of microlocal analysis, the asymmetry operator -- a scalar pseudodifferential operator of order $-3$. The latter is completely determined by the Riemannian manifold and its orientation, and encodes information about spectral asymmetry. The asymmetry operator generalises and contains the classical eta invariant traditionally associated with the asymmetry of the spectrum, which can be recovered by computing its regularised operator trace. Remarkably, the whole construction is direct and explicit.</description>

      <title>Renormalized stochastic pressure equation with log-correlated Gaussian coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17195v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study periodic solutions to the following divergence-form stochastic partial differential equation with Wick-renormalized gradient on the $d$-dimensional flat torus $\mathbb{T}^d$,
  \[
  -\nabla\cdot\left(e^{\diamond (- \beta X) }\diamond\nabla U\right)=\nabla \cdot (e^{\diamond (- \beta X)} \diamond \mathbf{F}),
  \] where $X$ is the log-correlated Gaussian field, $\mathbf{F}$ is a random vector field representing the flux, the in/out-flow of fluid per unit area per unit time, and $\diamond$ denotes the Wick product. The problem is a variant of the stochastic pressure equation, in which $U$ is modeling the pressure of a creeping water-flow in crustal rock that occurs in enhanced geothermal heating. In the original model, the Wick exponential term $e^{\diamond(-\beta X)}$ is modeling the random permeability of the rock. The porosity field is given by a log-correlated Gaussian random field $\beta X$, where $\beta&lt;\sqrt{d}$. We use elliptic regularity theory in order to define a notion of a solution to this (a priori very ill-posed) problem, via modifying the $S$-transform from Gaussian white noise analysis, and then establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions. Moreover, we show that the solution to the problem can be expressed in terms of the Gaussian multiplicative chaos measure.</description>
