      <title>Periodic Boundary Conditions for Bosonic Path Integral Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an algorithm for bosonic path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) simulations with periodic boundary conditions (PBC) that scales quadratically with the number of particles. Path integral methods are a powerful tool to simulate bosonic condensed phases, which exhibit fundamental physical phenomena such as Bose--Einstein condensation and superfluidity. Recently, we developed a quadratic scaling algorithm for bosonic PIMD, but employed an ad hoc treatment of PBC. Here we rigorously enforce PBC in bosonic PIMD. It requires summing over the spring energies of all periodic images in the partition function, and a naive implementation scales exponentially with the system size. We present an algorithm for bosonic PIMD simulations of periodic systems that scales only quadratically. We benchmark our implementation on the free Bose gas and a model system of cold atoms in optical lattices. We also study an approximate treatment of PBC based on the minimum-image convention, and derive a numerical criterion to determine when it is valid.</description>

      <title>Anti-scarring from eigenstate stacking in a chaotic spinor condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The early-time dynamics of many-body quantum chaotic systems is typically considered non-universal due to the divergence from the predictions of random matrix theory. The eigenstate stacking theorem, on the other hand, asserts uniformity in a phase space for the cumulative probability density of eigenstates that fall within a sufficiently large energy window, opening a route to universality in early times. This fact must hold even in many-body systems. Here, we study a chaotic spinor Bose-Einstein condensate, whose quantum scar dynamics has recently been observed in the laboratory. Quantum scars, living densely near an unstable periodic orbit, must be compensated by anti-scarred states populating sparsely there by the virtue of stacking theorem. We find that such anti-scarring is present in this many-particle system by extending the applicability of stacking theorem. Our work uncovers how the quantum scarring of some eigenstates affects the rest of the chaotic and thermal spectrum in quantum systems with many particles.</description>

      <title>Shell-Shaped Quantum Droplet in a Three-Component Ultracold Bose Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15846v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shell-shaped Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) is a typical quantum system in curved geometry. Here we propose a new type of shell-shaped BEC with self-bound character, thereby liberating it from stringent conditions such as microgravity or fine-tuned trap. Specifically, we consider a three-component (1,2,3) ultracold Bose gas where (1,2) and (2,3) both form quantum droplets. The two droplets are mutually immiscible due to strong 1-3 repulsion, while still linked by component-2 to form a globally self-bound object. The outer droplet then naturally develops a shell structure without any trapping potential. It is shown that the shell structure can significantly modify the equilibrium density of the core, and lead to unique collective excitations highlighting the core-shell correlation. All results have been demonstrated in a realistic $^{23}$Na-$^{39}$K-$^{41}$K mixture. By extending quantum droplets from flat to curved geometries, this work paves the way for future exploring the interplay of quantum fluctuations and non-trivial real-space topologies in ultracold gases.</description>

      <title>Rotational Superradiance in a Time-Reversal Symmetry-Broken Quantum Gas inside an Optical Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Appearance of quantized vortices in a superfluid and a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) stems from their nontrivial response to broken time-reversal symmetry (TRS). Here we show that breaking of the TRS by, for example, rotation or an external synthetic magnetic field in a transversely-driven BEC coupled to a single mode of an optical cavity modifies drastically Dicke-superradiance and self-ordering phenomena in this system. In particular, photon scattering from the pump laser into the cavity is amplified by the rotational motion of the BEC, leading to so-called 'rotational superradiance' - in a loose analogy to black-hole physics - with distinct critical scaling properties. Another notable finding is that cavity photons mediate long-range, periodic attractive interactions among the vortices, which compete with pair-wise logarithmic repulsive vortex interactions and deform the Abrikosov triangular vortex lattice favoring a stripe-like pattern. Remarkably, the rotation of the BEC and topological properties of the vortex lattice can be monitored nondestructively through the cavity output field.</description>

      <title>Borromean supercounterfluids at finite temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12833v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the properties of standard (single-component) superfluids are well understood, principal differences arise in a special type of multicomponent systems -- the so-called Borromean supercounterfluids -- in which (i) supertransport is possible only in the counterflow regime and (ii) there are three or more counterflowing components. Borromean supercounterfluids's correlation and topological properties distinguish them from their single- and two-component counterparts.
  The component-symmetric case characterized by a distinctively different universality class of the supercounterfluid-to-normal phase transition is especially interesting. Using the recently introduced concept of compact-gauge invariance as the guiding principle, we develop the finite-temperature description of Borromean supercounterfluids in terms of an asymptotically exact long-wave effective action. We formulate and study Borromean XY and loop statistical models, capturing the universal long-range properties and allowing us to perform efficient worm algorithm simulations. Numeric results demonstrate perfect agreement with analytic predictions. Particularly instructive is the two-dimensional case, where the Borromean nature of the system is strongly manifested while allowing for an asymptotically exact analytic description.</description>

      <title>Bosonized Momentum Distribution of a Fermi Gas via Friedrichs Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Benedikter and the author proved an approximate formula for the momentum distribution of a 3d fermionic gas interacting by a short-range pair potential in the mean-field regime, within a trial state close to the ground state. Here, we derive an exact formula for the momentum distribution in this trial state, using a diagrammatic formalism due to Friedrichs. We further demonstrate how the formula of Benedikter and the author arises from a restriction of the contributing diagrams to those corresponding to a bosonization approximation.</description>

      <title>Winding Topology of Multifold Exceptional Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite their ubiquity, a systematic classification of multifold exceptional points, $n$-fold spectral degeneracies (EP$n$s), remains a significant unsolved problem. In this article, we characterize the Abelian eigenvalue topology of generic EP$n$s and symmetry-protected EP$n$s for arbitrary $n$. The former and the latter emerge in a $(2n-2)$- and $(n-1)$-dimensional parameter space, respectively. By introducing topological invariants called resultant winding numbers, we elucidate that these EP$n$s are stable due to topology of a map from a base space (momentum or parameter space) to a sphere defined by resultants. In a $D$-dimensional parameter space ($D\geq c$), the resultant winding number topologically characterize a $(D-c)$-dimensional manifold of generic [symmetry-protected] EP$n$s whose codimension is $c=2n-2$ [$c=n-1$]. Our framework implies fundamental doubling theorems for both generic EP$n$s and symmetry-protected EP$n$s in $n$-band models.</description>

      <title>Protecting Intercavity Polaritons in Strongly Coupled Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically designed and experimentally demonstrated a mechanism to protect a spatially segregated mixed light-matter state, known as intercavity exciton-polariton in strongly coupled optical cavities. This excitation, shared across the coupled cavity array, exhibits remarkable robustness over a wide momentum range, without compromising photon-exciton mixing or the spatial separation of its photonic and excitonic components, which also enables a tunable heavy mass. Additionally, we unveil a direct connection between the transparency window, characteristic of slow-light experiments, and the protection of the intercavity polariton nature. Both phenomena originate from the strategic design of an energy-level landscape featuring a $\Lambda$-scheme, opening new avenues for exploring and utilizing these unique optical excitations in advanced photonic applications.</description>
