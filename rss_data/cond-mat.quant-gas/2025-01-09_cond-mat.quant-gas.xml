      <title>A novel BPS bound with a first order BPS system in the $2D$ Gross-Pitaevskii equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel BPS bound for the Gross-Pitaevskii equations in two spatial dimensions is presented. The energy can be bound from below in terms of the combination of two boundary terms, one related to the vorticity (but ``dressed'' by the condensate profile) and the second to the ``skewness'' of the configurations. The bound is saturated by configurations which satisfy a system of two first-order PDE: when such BPS system is satisfied, the Gross-Pitaevskii equations are satisfied as well. The analytic solutions of this BPS system constructed in the present manuscript represent configurations with fractional vorticity living in an annulus. Using these techniques, we present the first analytic examples of this kind. The hydrodynamical interpretation of the BPS system is discussed. The implications of these results are outlined.</description>

      <title>Meson-polariton and string dynamics via cavity coupling in Rydberg atom array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the real time meson and string dynamics of one dimensional Rydberg atom arrays in presence of a collective cavity mode. We derive an effective description in terms of a Tavis-Cummings-Ising model, whose phase diagram features ordered and disordered phases. Single domain walls on top of ordered states behave differently from those found in Ising models, featuring strong anisotropy because of the $U(1)$ invariant coupling between light and matter. The non-local nature of the cavity mode is instead affecting meson and string dynamics drastically. Meson hybridizes coherently with the cavity photons, leading to composite meson-polariton excitations. Strings, differently from local interacting theories, acquire a finite kinetic energy and propagate freely thanks to the non-local interaction between the underlying domain-walls mediated by the cavity mode. We conclude by examining the effect of cavity losses, proposing a state-preparation protocol which actively uses the cavity mode, and presenting a concrete experimental blueprint.</description>

      <title>Dynamic generation of superflow in a fermionic ring through phase imprinting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dynamic generation of persistent current by phase imprinting fermionic atoms in a ring geometry. Mediated by the pairing interaction, the Fermi condensate dynamically acquires a quantized current by developing azimuthal phase slips, as well as density and pairing-order-parameter depletions. Resorting to the Bogolioubov-de Gennes formalism, we investigate the time evolution of the transferred total angular momentum and the quantized superfluid current throughout the phase-imprinting process. This enables a detailed analysis of the impact of interaction, as well as different initial pairing states, on the superflow formation. In particular, we show that, as the condensate is tuned toward the Bose-Einstein-condensate side of the Feshbach resonance, the azimuthal density distribution becomes less susceptible to the phase imprinting potential, leading to smaller quantized current under the same imprinting parameters. Our results offer microscopic insights into the dynamic development of superflow in the phase-imprinting process, and are helpful for the ongoing experimental effort.</description>

      <title>Yrast states of quantum droplets confined in a ring potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a quantum droplet which is confined in a ring potential. We investigate the so-called "yrast" state, i.e., the lowest-energy state of the droplet assuming that it has some fixed expectation value of the angular momentum. Two are the most interesting aspects of this problem, the nonlinear term -- which is partly attractive and partly repulsive -- and the periodic boundary conditions. For some range of the parameters, the attractive, or the repulsive part of the nonlinear term dominates and one gets the expected behavior. In some intermediate regime the two nonlinear terms are of comparable size. In this case both the solution, as well as the corresponding dispersion relation show an interesting behavior. Finally, we make contact with the problem of solitary-wave excitation, since the derived solutions are travelling-wave, i.e., solitary-wave, solutions.</description>

      <title>Bose-Hubbard model with power-law hopping in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the zero-temperature phase diagram of the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model with power-law hopping decaying with distance as $1/r^\alpha$ using exact large scale Quantum Monte-Carlo simulations. For all $1&lt;\alpha\leq 3$ the quantum phase transition from a superfluid and a Mott insulator at unit filling is found to be continuous and scale invariant, in a way incompatible with the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) scenario, which is recovered for $\alpha&gt;3$. We characterise the new universality class by providing the critical exponents by means of data collapse analysis near the critical point for each $\alpha$ and from careful analysis of the spectrum. Large-scale simulations of the grand canonical phase diagram and of the decay of correlation functions demonstrate an overall behavior akin to higher dimensional systems with long-range order in the ground state for $\alpha \leq 2$ and intermediate between one and higher dimensions for $2&lt;\alpha \leq 3$. Our exact numerical results provide a benchmark to compare theories of long-range quantum models and are relevant for experiments with cold neutral atom, molecules and ion chains.</description>

      <title>Spin fractionalization at the edge of quantum Hall fluids induced by bulk quasiparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14879v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a measurable spin for the edge of a lowest Landau level and incompressible fractional quantum Hall state in the presence of an Abelian or non-Abelian bulk quasiparticle. We show that this quantity takes a fractional value inherited from the fractional spin of the bulk quasiparticle. We present a geometric picture that does not rely on global symmetries of the wavefunction but is able to treat quasiparticles and edges with different shapes. We study finite-size many-body wavefunctions on the cylinder with circular quasiparticles and straight edges. Our results are supported by matrix-product-state calculations for the Laughlin and the k=3 Read-Rezayi states.</description>

      <title>A bosonic matrix product state description of Read-Rezayi states and its application to quasi-hole spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14889v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the $k=3$ Read-Rezayi quantum Hall state by means of a purely bosonic matrix product state formulation, which is described in detail. We calculate the density profiles in the presence of bulk quasi-holes of six different types: one for each $\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermion sector. From the density profiles, we calculate the (local) spins of these quasi-holes. By employing a spin-statistics relation, we obtain the exchange statistics parameters. Our results, which are entirely based on local properties of the quasi-holes, corroborate previous results obtained by explicitly braiding quasi-holes, showing that the exchange statistics can be read off from the monodromy properties of the wave functions, i.e., that the associated Berry phase vanishes. We also discuss the entanglement spectrum, to show that our bosonic matrix product state formulation correctly captures the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermionic structure of the $k=3$ Read-Rezayi states.</description>
