      <title>Monetary Macro Accounting Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a monetary macro accounting theory (MoMaT) and its software specification for a consistent national accounting. In our money theory money functions primarily as a medium of payment for obligations and debts, not as a medium of exchange, originating from the temporal misalignment where producers pay suppliers before receiving revenue. MoMaT applies the legal principles of Separation and Abstraction to model debt, contracts, property rights, and money to understand their nature. Monetary systems according to our approach operate at three interconnected levels: micro (division of labor), meso (banking for risk-sharing), and macro (GDP sharing, money issuance). Critical to money theory are macro debt relations, hence the model focuses not on the circulation of money but on debt vortices: the ongoing creation and resolution of financial obligations. The Bill of Exchange (BoE) acts as a unifying contractual instrument, linking debt processes and monetary issuance across fiat and gold-based systems. A multi-level BoE framework enables liquidity exchange, investments, and endorsements, designed for potential implementation in blockchain smart contracts and AI automation to improve borrowing transparency. Mathematical rigor can be ensured through category theory and sheaf theory for invariances between economic levels and homology theory for monetary policy foundations. Open Games can structure macroeconomic analysis with multi-agent models, making MoMaT applicable to blockchain economic theory, monetary policy, and supply chain finance.</description>

      <title>Optimal taxation and the Domar-Musgrave effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article concerns the optimal choice of flat taxes on labor and capital income, and on consumption, in a tractable economic model in which agents are subject to idiosyncratic investment risk. We identify the tax rates which maximize welfare in stationary equilibrium while preserving tax revenue, finding that an increase in welfare equivalent to a permanent increase in consumption of nearly 7% can be achieved by only taxing capital income and consumption. The Domar-Musgrave effect explains cases where it is optimal to tax capital income. We characterize the dynamic response to the substitution of consumption taxation for labor income taxation.</description>
