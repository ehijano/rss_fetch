      <title>$\phi$-Dwarfs: White Dwarfs probe Quadratically Coupled Scalars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study ultralight scalar fields with quadratic couplings to Standard-Model fermions and derive strong constraints from white-dwarf mass-radius data. Such couplings source scalar profiles inside compact stars, shift fermion masses, and can produce a new ground state of matter. We analyze couplings to electrons and to nucleons, incorporating composition and finite-temperature effects in white dwarf structure and equations of state. We identify two robust observables: (i) forbidden gaps - ranges of radii with no stable configurations - and (ii) characteristic shape distortions that drive white dwarf masses toward the Chandrasekhar limit (electron couplings) or shift the maximum mass (nucleon couplings). Confronting these predictions with precise measurements for Sirius B and Procyon B, together with the global white dwarf population, excludes large regions of unexplored parameter space and extends earlier QCD-axion-specific bounds to a broader class of scalar theories. Our stellar constraints rely only on sourcing and do not assume the scalar constitutes dark matter; where mass reductions are small, precision laboratory searches remain competitive. White-dwarf astrophysics thus provides a powerful, largely assumption-minimal probe of ultralight, quadratically coupled scalars.</description>

      <title>Thermal Damping of Neutrino-Coupled Scalar Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We point out that ultralight scalar dark matter that modulates neutrino masses can be significantly thermal damped by cosmic neutrinos in the early universe. This dissipative effect arises as a backreaction from the neutrinos which are being driven slightly out of thermal equilibrium by the scalar. We estimate the rate of such thermal damping and explore its phenomenological implications. For a scalar that is produced early, we find that the effect of thermal damping results in a predictable final abundance largely insensitive to its initial condition while circumventing late time limits. This motivates a parameter-space line to target experimentally.</description>

      <title>Direct Collapse Black Hole Candidates from Decaying Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Injecting 1-13.6 eV photons into the early universe can suppress the molecular hydrogen abundance and alter the star formation history dramatically enough to produce direct collapse black holes. These, in turn, could explain the recently observed population of puzzling high-redshift supermassive black holes that appear to require super-Eddington accretion. We show that axion dark matter decay in the intergalactic medium can account for this energy injection. We use a single zone model of the gas core and semi-analytically evolve its chemo-thermal properties to track the conditions for which the system becomes an atomic cooling halo-a necessary precursor for the production of heavy black hole seeds to explain the high-redshift black hole population. Windows of axions masses between 24.5-26.5 eV with photon couplings as low as $4\times 10^{-12}$/GeV may realize this atomic cooling halo condition. We highlight the significance of the band structure of molecular hydrogen on the effectiveness of this process and discuss estimates of the heavy seed population and prospects for testing this model.</description>

      <title>CP-conserving SO(3) parameterization of the neutrino mixing matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pattern of neutrino mixing, usually parameterized by the Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata $U_{\rm PMNS}$ matrix, still remains a striking puzzle in particle physics. $U_{\rm PMNS}$ is one of six possible products of multiplying three Euler matrices. Here we discuss the neutrino mixing matrix parameterization for three known flavours of neutrinos based on the SO(3) group represented by one three-dimensional rotation matrix $U_{\rm SO3}$. The mixing matrix $U_{\rm SO3}$ with cyclic order of the Lie group generators implies $\delta_{\rm{CP}}=180^\circ$ for clockwise rotation in three dimensions, a viable scenario for normal mass ordering. We determine a range of rotation angles for $U_{\rm SO3}$ which deviate substantially from the almost maximal mixings in the standard $U_{\rm PMNS}$ scenario, yielding `democratic' values for the mixing angles. With the fixed $\delta_{\rm CP}$ value, the $U_{\rm SO3}$ parameterization can be validated or falsified by the next generation of neutrinoless double beta decay experiments and puts a stringent constraint on the absolute neutrino mass. The proposed $U_{\rm SO3}$ neutrino mixing parameterization is suited for independent CP-conserving neutrino oscillation experimental analysis.</description>

      <title>Cosmic domain walls on a lattice: illusive effects of initial conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolution of cosmic domain walls (DWs) settles to the scaling solution, which is often assumed to be independent of initial conditions. However, lattice simulations performed in this work reveal a clear dependence of the scaling DW area on the initial configuration of the sourcing scalar field, specifically, its infrared (IR) properties. Namely, the DW area grows as one suppresses IR modes in the initial scalar field spectrum. This growth is saturated, when the area parameter $\xi$ commonly used in the literature reaches the value $\xi_{max} \approx 1.2$. The dependence of $\xi$ on IR modes is argued to be of non-physical origin: it is likely to be due to effects of the lattice boundary. Assuming that physically the memory of initial conditions is erased, one recognizes $\xi \approx 1.2$ obtained in the situation with maximally suppressed IR modes as a genuine universal value of the area parameter in the scaling regime. We demonstrate that ignorance about initial conditions may affect predictions for the energy density of gravitational waves by the factor five. The spectral shape of gravitational waves is also affected by the choice of initial conditions, most notably in the low-frequency part. Likewise, we revisit annihilation of DWs under the influence of a potential bias. It has been previously found in Ref. [19] that the annihilation happens significantly earlier compared to the estimate based on the simple balance between the potential bias and surface energy density. We further support this observation and show that the tendency towards an earlier annihilation gets even stronger upon removing IR modes in simulations.</description>

      <title>Extra Radiation Cosmologies: Implications of the Hubble Tension for eV-scale Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new analysis on sterile neutrino cosmologies using the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) second data release (DR2) baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements in combination with cosmic microwave background (CMB), CMB lensing, and supernova data. We show that BAO observables are intrinsically less sensitive to the combined effects of relativistic energy density, $N_{\rm eff}$, and the sum of neutrino masses, $\Sigma m_\nu$, which are both augmented in sterile neutrino cosmologies. With SH0ES local expansion rate, $H_0$, data, we find $N_{\rm eff} = 3.43 \pm 0.13$, reducing the Hubble tension to $2.4\sigma$. For a 0.1~eV sterile neutrino, we find $N_{\rm eff}=3.50$ as the best fit. For this representative $N_{\rm eff}$, we find an upper limit of $m_s &lt; 0.17$ eV (95\% CL), greater than a factor of four weaker than standard constraints on $\Sigma m_\nu$. When SH0ES is included, light sterile neutrinos with masses $m_s\simeq0.1$--$0.2$ eV are favored at $\gtrsim 3\sigma$, whereas eV-scale sterile masses remain strongly excluded by the data in the cosmologies we study. Our findings confirm our previous results that partially thermalized sub-eV sterile neutrinos are preferred by the SH0ES $H_0$ data. The preferred $m_s$ mass scale overlaps with, but is not identical to, that favored in neutrino oscillation solutions to short-baseline anomalies.</description>

      <title>Temperature derivative divergence of the electric conductivity and thermal photon emission rate at the critical end point from holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermal photon emission rate $\frac{d\Gamma}{dk}$ and DC eletric conductivity $\sigma_{Q}$ of the strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma (sQGP) are investigated around the critical end point in a $N_f=2+1$ holographic QCD model with parameters obtained from machine-learning. It is found that both thermal photon emission rate and eletric conductivity grow most obviously around $T_c$, which agrees with the previous studies, and the result of eletric conductivity at zero chemical potential resembles the lattice results. Moreover, it is found that both the temperature derivative of the eletric conductivity and thermal photon emission rate diverge at the critical end point.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal effective field theory and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review recent applications of nonlocal effective field theory, focusing in particular on nonlocal chiral effective theory and nonlocal quantum electrodynamics (QED), as well as an extension of nonlocal effective theory to curved spacetime. For the chiral effective theory, we discuss the calculation of generalized parton distributions (GPDs) of the nucleon at nonzero skewness, along with the corresponding gravitational (or mechanical) form factors, within the convolution framework. In the QED application, we extend the nonlocal formulation to construct the most general nonlocal QED interaction, in which both the propagator and fundamental QED vertex are modified due to the nonlocal Lagrangian, while preserving the Ward-Green-Takahashi identities. For consistency with the modified propagator, a solid quantization is proposed, and the nonlocal QED is applied to explain the lepton $g-2$ anomalies without the introduction of new particles or interactions. Finally, with an extension of the chiral effective action to curved spacetime, we investigate the nonlocal energy-momentum tensor and gravitational form factors of the nucleon with a nonlocal pion-nucleon interaction.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Helicity, Magnetic Monopoles, and Higgs Winding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Changes in magnetic helicity are often discussed across a variety of fields,
  from condensed matter physics to early universe cosmology.
  It is frequently stated that the helicity change is given by the integral of the gauge field strength tensor and its dual over spacetime, $\int F \wedge F$. However, this is incorrect when magnetic monopoles once exist in the spacetime. In this paper, we show the correct formula of the helicity change in such a case for the Maxwell theory with the magnetic monopoles.
  We also discuss what happens when we embed the Maxwell theory with magnetic monopoles into non-Abelian gauge theories. We show that a similar formula holds for the 't Hooft--Polyakov monopole. In particular, we find the winding numbers and the zeroes of the Higgs field in the non-Abelian gauge theory play a crucial role in the helicity change.
  The same discussion is also applicable to the electroweak theory, and we discuss the implication of our findings to the baryon number change via the chiral anomaly in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Strong decays of the $DK^\ast$ and $\bar{D}K^{\ast}$ molecular states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the abundant structure near the threshold of the $D^{(*)}K^{(*)}/\bar{D}^{(*)}K^{(*)}$, we estimate the strong decay properties of the $T_{c\bar{s}1}^{f/a}$ and $T_{\bar{c}\bar{s}1}^{f/a}$ with $I(J^{P})=0/1(1^{+})$ in $DK^{*}$ and $\bar{D}K^{*}$ molecular scenarios in the present paper. By employing the effective Lagrangian approach, the widths of the processes $T_{c\bar{s}1}^{f}\to D^{*}K, D_{s}^{*}\eta, DK\pi$, $T_{c\bar{s}1}^{a}\to D^{*}K, D_{s}^{*}\pi, DK\pi$, and $T_{\bar{c}\bar{s}1}^{f/a}\to\bar{D}^{*}K, \bar{D}K\pi$ are estimated. Considering the present estimations, we propose to search for $T_{c\bar{s}1}^{f/a}$ states in $D^{*}K$ and $D_{s}^{*}\pi/D_{s}^{*}\eta$ mass invariant spectra. Their ratios may serve as an important test of the molecular scenario.</description>

      <title>Efficient tau-pair invariant mass reconstruction with simplified matrix element techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quality of the invariant mass reconstruction of the di-{\tau} system is crucial for searches and analyses of di-{\tau} resonances. Due to the presence of neutrinos in the final state, the {\tau} {\tau} invariant mass cannot be calculated directly at hadron colliders, where the longitudinal momentum sum constraint cannot be applied. A number of approaches have been adopted to mitigate this issue. The most general one uses Matrix Element (ME) integration for likelihood estimation, followed by invariant mass reconstruction as the value maximizing the likelihood. However, this method has a significant computational cost due to the need for integration over the phase space of the decay products. We propose an algorithm that reduces the computational cost by two orders of magnitude, while maintaining the resolution of the invariant mass reconstruction at a level comparable to the ME-based method. Moreover, we introduce additional features to estimate the uncertainty of the reconstructed mass and the kinematics of the initial {\tau} leptons (e.g., their momenta).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main purpose behind this work has been to construct a Supersymmetric extension of Axionic Electrodynamics based on a Lorentz Symmetry-Violating framework. Thus, in addition to the axion and the photon, our model naturally incorporates its supersymmetric partners - the axino and the photino - and allows for the interaction between them. This enriches the Axionic Electrodynamics not only from a theoretical standpoint but also for its phenomenological relevance, providing additional interactions between possible dark matter candidates.</description>

      <title>Unified interpretation of 95 GeV di-photon and di-tau Excesses in the Georgi-Machacek Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the 95 GeV excesses in the $\gamma\gamma$ and $\tau\tau$ channels in the Georgi-Machacek model, where a single light $CP$-even custodial singlet $H$ can account for both hints. Using one-loop renormalization group-improved effective potential and positive-definiteness conditions for vacuum stability, together with perturbative unitarity, electroweak precision tests, $B$-physics, and Higgs data, we identify a narrow but viable parameter region. In this region, charged and doubly charged scalars enhance $H\to\gamma\gamma$, while the fermionic rescaling controls $H\to\tau\tau$, yielding combined signal strengths compatible at the $2\sigma$ level. The scenario predicts characteristic patterns in the singlet mixing and triplet VEV and is highly testable at the HL-LHC and future lepton colliders via precision $\kappa_V$ measurements and direct exotic searches.</description>

      <title>Using net quark number gain to probe the phases of QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss an observable that probes the content of a QCD medium at finite temperature and chemical potential, the net quark number gain. It is the response of the thermal bath to a static quark or antiquark probe. While insignificant at high temperatures, it reveals the bath's tendency to form meson-like or baryon-like configurations (depending on the probe and chemical potential) at low temperatures, which would screen the probe's color charge. The net quark number gain also helps explain how a single quark/antiquark can be added to a supposedly confining medium in the first place: the latter provides the missing quarks/antiquarks to form hadron-like states. We sketch the derivation of this general result for temperatures much smaller than the constituent quark masses and discuss possible further applications to study the various features of the QCD phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Impact of Evaporation Barriers on Solar-Captured Dark Matter Distributions and Evaporation Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) particles traversing the Sun can lose energy through elastic scattering with solar nuclei and become gravitationally captured. For DM with masses below a few GeV, however, evaporation caused by collisions with hot nuclei efficiently ejects particles, preventing their long-term accumulation. This defines a minimum mass threshold, typically around a few GeV, below which the Sun cannot retain DM. In this work, we investigate how an additional evaporation barrier - arising either from multiple scattering in an optically thick regime or from a long-range DM-nucleon interaction - modifies this equilibrium. We compute the transport and thermalization of captured DM using a phase-space approach that evolves the orbital distribution rather than assuming a Maxwellian form. Without a barrier, we recover the standard result that evaporation dominates for sub-few-GeV DM, leading to negligible net retention. With a barrier, however, the escape of light DM is strongly suppressed, enabling the Sun to capture and retain particles below the canonical evaporation mass. The barrier effectively raises the escape threshold, either through repeated scatterings or through an additional long-range attractive potential. We present the resulting phase-space distributions, density and velocity profiles, and highlight how the suppression of the high-velocity tail drives the captured population closer to thermal equilibrium with the solar core. These modifications increase the equilibrium abundance of light DM by orders of magnitude and have direct implications for solar neutrino searches as an indirect probe of DM.</description>

      <title>Universal critical dynamics near the chiral phase transition and the QCD critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a novel real-time formulation of the functional renormalization group (FRG) for dynamical systems with reversible mode couplings to study Model G and H, which are the conjectured dynamic universality classes of the two-flavor chiral phase transition and the QCD critical point, respectively. We compute the dynamic critical exponent in both models in spatial dimensions $2&lt;d&lt;4$. We discuss qualitative commonalities and differences in the non-perturbative RG flow, such as weak scaling relations which hold in either case versus the characteristic strong scaling of Model G which is absent in Model H. For Model G, we also extract a novel dynamic scaling function that describes the universal momentum and temperature dependence of the diffusion coefficient of iso-(axial-)vector charges in the symmetric phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The baryonic $b\to s$ transition $\Lambda_b\to\Lambda^{(*)}\nu{\bar\nu}$ is analyzed. We combine the mesonic counterpart $B^+\to K^+\nu{\bar\nu}$ and $B^0\to K^{*0}\nu{\bar\nu}$ as well as other observables involving $B$ mesons like $R(K^{(*)})$, ${\rm Br}(B_s\to\mu^+\mu^-)$, ${\rm Br}(B^+\to K^+\mu^+\mu^-)$, and $P_5'(B^+\to K^{*+}\mu^+\mu^-)$. We find that the new physics scale $M_{\rm NP}$ to be $2.04~{\rm TeV}\le M_{\rm NP} \le 11.76~{\rm TeV}$ (at $1\sigma$) for ordinary heavy new mediators. Our predictions for the branching ratios ${\rm Br}(\Lambda_b\to\Lambda^{(*)}\nu{\bar\nu})$ are $2.07 (1.07)$ times the standard model estimations, which could be verified at future colliders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effective kinetic theory (EKT) of QCD provides a possible picture of various non-equilibrium processes in heavy- and light-ion collisions. While there have been substantial advances in simulating the EKT in simple systems with enhanced symmetry, eventually, event-by-event simulations will be required for a comprehensive phenomenological modeling. As of now, these simulations are prohibitively expensive due to the numerical complexity of the Monte Carlo evaluation of the collision kernels. In this talk, we show how the evaluation of the collision kernels can be performed using neural networks paving the way to full event-by-event simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain the collision kernel and related dipole cross section during the initial nonequilibrium stages in heavy-ion collisions. These quantities are a crucial input for jet quenching calculations. We further compute the gluon splitting rates in the AMY formalism resulting from this nonequilibrium kernel. Comparing with thermal and commonly used forms, we find that particularly the gluon splitting rate for parton energies of the order of the hard effective temperature significantly differs from these approximations.</description>

      <title>The Physics of Jet Quenching in Perturbative QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hard processes in collider experiments typically produce QCD jets, which have long served as precision tests of QCD in the vacuum. More recently, heavy-ion programs at RHIC and the LHC have offered a novel perspective on jets, establishing them as unique probes of strongly interacting matter. Experimental observations, including the suppression of high-$p_T$ hadrons and jets, provide compelling evidence for the formation of a new state of matter and its strong coupling to energetic partons.
  These advances have motivated new theoretical approaches to jet quenching that go beyond standard perturbative techniques, aiming to elucidate the mechanisms of energy dissipation and thermalization of energetic partons in the quark-gluon plasma. This review highlights recent progress, beginning with a unified description of medium-induced radiation across the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal regime and its role in turbulent gluon cascades. We then examine radiative corrections that renormalize the transport coefficient $\hat q$, the mechanism of color decoherence in multi-parton systems, and nonlinear QCD evolution equations for jet energy loss. Finally, we confront this framework with experimental measurements, underscoring the need for precision phenomenology to fully exploit the rich data sets from RHIC and the LHC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a specific class of forward-scattering diagrams with imaginary kinematics, which, via the optical theorem, describe processes involving two identical fermions occupying the same state. What initially seems to be a contradiction turns out to be a key element in how the Pauli exclusion principle manifests itself in scattering theory. The discussion is entirely basic and could easily fit into any quantum field theory textbook. To the best of our knowledge, however, this point has not been addressed in the literature, and we aim to fill this gap.</description>

      <title>Null matter and the ultrarelativistic origin of hydrodynamics at zero temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We uncover a universal sector of relativistic fluid dynamics by taking a novel ultrarelativistic limit in which the temperature tends to zero while the flow simultaneously approaches the speed of light. In this regime, hydrodynamics becomes an effective theory of \emph{null matter}, characterised by a preferred null vector, a preferred scale, and their gradients. We show that this theory of null matter constitutes an example of a hydrodynamic theory that can be linearly stable and causal in an arbitrary choice of frame. The framework developed here for null matter can offer insights into ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions, astrophysical phenomena with inherently large Lorentz factors, and the dynamics of black hole horizons.</description>

      <title>Updated observational constraints on $\phi$CDM dynamical dark energy cosmological models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present updated observational constraints on the spatially flat $\phi$CDM model, where dark energy is described by a minimally coupled scalar field $\phi$ with an inverse power-law potential $V=V_0 \phi^{-\alpha}$. Using Planck 2018 CMB temperature, polarization (P18), and lensing power spectra (lensing), along with a compilation of non-CMB data including baryon acoustic oscillation, type Ia supernova, Hubble parameter, and growth rate measurements, we constrain $\phi$CDM and $\phi$CDM+$A_L$ models where $A_L$ is the CMB lensing consistency parameter. The scalar field parameter $\alpha$, which governs dark energy dynamics, is more tightly constrained by non-CMB data than by CMB data alone. For the full dataset, we obtain $\alpha = 0.055 \pm 0.041$ in the $\phi$CDM model and $\alpha = 0.095 \pm 0.056$ in the $\phi$CDM+$A_L$ model, mildly favoring evolving dark energy over a cosmological constant by $1.3\sigma$ and $1.7\sigma$. The Hubble constant is $H_0=67.55_{-0.46}^{+0.53}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ in the $\phi$CDM model, consistent with median statistics and some local determinations, but in tension with other local determinations. The constraints for matter density and clustering amplitude ($\Omega_m = 0.3096 \pm 0.0055$, $\sigma_8 = 0.8013_{-0.0067}^{+0.0077}$) of the flat $\phi$CDM model statistically agree with $\Lambda$CDM model values. Allowing $A_L$ to vary reduces tensions between CMB and non-CMB data, although we find $A_L = 1.105 \pm 0.037$, $2.8\sigma$ higher than unity, consistent with the excess smoothing seen in Planck data. Model comparison using AIC and DIC indicates that the $\phi$CDM model provides a fit comparable to $\Lambda$CDM, with the $\phi$CDM+$A_L$ slightly preferred. Overall, while the $\Lambda$CDM model remains an excellent fit, current data leave open the possibility of mildly evolving quintessence-like dynamical dark energy.</description>

      <title>Bulk viscosity from neutron decays to dark baryons in neutron star matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The possibility of neutron decay into dark particles has been proposed as a way to resolve a growing discrepancy between two different measurements of the neutron lifetime. The most popular formulation is a dark sector consisting of a dark baryon $\chi$ and a dark scalar $\phi$, where a neutron in vacuum decays about 1% of the time via the channel $n\rightarrow \chi+\phi$. In this work, we consider the effect of this additional neutron decay channel on transport in neutrons star mergers. We find that the neutron dark decay rate in medium is quite slow, and thus the dark baryons modify the dense matter equation of state in a way that decreases the Urca bulk viscosity by, at most, a factor of 2-3. However, if the neutron dark decay was to occur more rapidly, then the bulk viscosity at merger temperatures of tens of MeV would be strongly enhanced, potentially rapidly damping oscillations in merger environments and therefore providing a signature of slowly equilibrating matter in the merger.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study methods for efficient preparation of approximate ground states of $SU(3)$ lattice gauge theory on quantum hardware. Working in a variant of the electric basis, we introduce a refinement of the irrep truncation based on the energy density of site singlets, which provides a finer gradation of simulation complexity. Using strong-coupling perturbation theory as a guide, we develop simple ansatz circuits for ground state preparation and test them via classical simulation on small lattices, including the $2\times 2$ plaquette lattice in $d=2$ and the cube in $d=3$. We contrast state fidelities and resource requirements of variational methods against adiabatic state preparation and introduce a method that hybridizes the two approaches. Finally, we report on the public release of \texttt{ymcirc} -- a package of tools for building $SU(3)$ circuits and processing measurements -- and \texttt{pyclebsch}, a package for efficiently computing $SU(N)$ Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.</description>

      <title>Study of chaos and scrambling in hairy AdS Soliton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we perform a comprehensive study of the classical and quantum chaos in a candidate five-dimensional hairy AdS soliton. It is a horizonless geometry holographically dual to a confining field theory with finite scalar potential. We probe classical chaos by using particle geodesics and closed classical string. While the former shows no signature of chaos, the latter provides chaotic dynamics of the string using the Lyapunov exponent and the evolution of the Poincar\'e section. Further we perform an independent spectral analysis using the tools of the random matrix theory (RMT), namely the level space distributions and the Dyson-Mehta(DM) $\Delta_{3}$-statistics. We observe a clear transition from the low energy Wigner-Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE) distribution to the high energy Poisson distribution. This signifies a flow from quantum chaos in the infrared to integrability in the ultraviolet. We quantitatively characterize the inherent quantum scrambling in the dual theory by computing the butterfly velocity, the rate of spatial spread of the information scrambling, inside the bulk. We undergo two independent holographic methods: entanglement wedge reconstruction and derivation of out-of-time-ordered correlators via shockwave analysis. In these methods, we heuristically treat the region near the soliton tip to analyse the infrared physics of scrambling similarly as done in the near-horizon region of black hole. We find that the hair parameter controls various scrambling properties. Finally, we make comments on the interplay between insulator/superconductor phase transition in hairy soliton geometry and dynamical transition from integrability to chaos as both of these are affected by the presence of the hair parameter.</description>

      <title>Cosmological constraints on non-phantom dynamical dark energy with DESI Data Release 2 Baryon Acoustic Oscillations: A 3$\sigma$+ lensing anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a 12-parameter cosmological model with non-phantom dynamical dark energy (NPDDE), where non-phantom implies that the equation of state (EoS) of dark energy (DE), $w(z)\geq-1$ for all redshifts $z$. Thus, the DE EoS covers the parameter space corresponding to the popular single scalar-field dark energy models, i.e., Quintessence. The cosmological model comprises 6 parameters of the $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model, and additionally the dynamical DE EoS parameters ($w_0$, $w_a$), the scaling of the lensing amplitude ($A_{\rm lens}$), sum of the neutrino masses ($\sum m_\nu$), the effective number of non-photon relativistic degrees of freedom ($N_{\rm eff}$), and the running of the scalar spectral index ($\alpha_s$). We derive constraints on the parameters by combining the latest Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release (DR) 2 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements with cosmic microwave background (CMB) power spectra from Planck Public Release (PR) 4, CMB lensing data from Planck PR4 and Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) DR6, uncalibrated Type Ia supernovae (SNe) data from the Pantheon+ and Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 5 (DESY5) samples, and Weak Lensing (WL) data from DES Year 1. Our major finding is that with CMB+BAO+WL and CMB+BAO+SNe+WL, we find 3$\sigma$+ evidence for $A_{\rm lens} &gt;1$, indicating a higher than expected CMB lensing amplitude relative to the NPDDE prediction of unity. This implies that for cosmology to accommodate realistic quintessence-like dark energy models (as opposed to unrealistic phantom DE), one would also need to explain a relatively significant presence of the lensing anomaly.</description>

      <title>Multi-strangeness matter from ab initio calculations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hypernuclei and hypernuclear matter connect nuclear structure in the strangeness sector with the astrophysics of neutron stars, where hyperons are expected to emerge at high densities and affect key astrophysical observables. We present the first {\em ab initio} calculations that simultaneously describe single- and double-$\Lambda$ hypernuclei from the light to medium-mass range, the equation of state for $\beta$-stable hypernuclear matter, and neutron star properties. Despite the formidable complexity of quantum Monte Carlo~(QMC) simulations with multiple baryonic degrees of freedom, by combining nuclear lattice effective field theory with a newly developed auxiliary-field QMC algorithm we achieve the first sign-problem free {\em ab initio} QMC simulations of hypernuclear systems containing an arbitrary number of neutrons, protons, and $\Lambda$ hyperons, including all relevant two- and three-body interactions. This eliminates reliance on the symmetry-energy approximation, long used to interpolate between symmetric nuclear matter and pure neutron matter. Our unified calculations reproduce hyperon separation energies, yield a neutron star maximum mass consistent with observations, predict tidal deformabilities compatible with gravitational-wave measurements, and give a trace anomaly in line with Bayesian constraints. By bridging the physics of finite hypernuclei and infinite hypernuclear matter within a single {\em ab initio} framework, this work establishes a direct microscopic link between hypernuclear structure, dense matter composition, and the astrophysical properties of neutron stars.</description>

Abstract: We propose a novel use of Large Language Models (LLMs) as unsupervised anomaly detectors in particle physics. Using lightweight LLM-like networks with encoder-based architectures trained to reconstruct background events via masked-token prediction, our method identifies anomalies through deviations in reconstruction performance, without prior knowledge of signal characteristics. Applied to searches for simultaneous four-top-quark production, this token-based approach shows competitive performance against established unsupervised methods and effectively captures subtle discrepancies in collider data, suggesting a promising direction for model-independent searches for new physics.</description>

      <title>Two-component diffuse Galactic gamma-ray emission revealed with Fermi-LAT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The enigma of cosmic ray origin and propagation stands as a key question in particle astrophysics. The precise spatial and spectral measurements of diffuse Galactic gamma-ray emission provide new avenues for unraveling this mystery. Based on 16 years of Fermi-LAT observations, we find that the diffuse gamma-ray spectral shapes are nearly identical for low energies (below a few GeV) but show significant dispersion at high energies (above a few GeV) across the Galactic disk. We further show that the diffuse emission can be decomposed into two components, a universal spectral component dominating at low energies which is consistent with the expectation from interactions of background cosmic rays and the interstellar matter, and a spatially variant component dominating at high energies which is likely due to local accelerators. These findings suggest that there is dual-origin of the Galactic diffuse emission, including the ``cosmic ray sea'' from efficient propagation of particles and the ``cosmic ray islands'' from inefficient propagation of particles, and thus shed new light on the understanding of the propagation models of Galactic cosmic rays.</description>

      <title>Initial spin fluctuations in heavy-ion collisions and where to find them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collective spin phenomena in the final states of heavy-ion collisions are typically understood to originate from vorticity and shear in the quark-gluon plasma. Here, we ask whether spin could already be present in the initial condition of the collisions. In particular, we argue that if a spin density exists at the beginning of the QGP expansion, it should experience event-by-event fluctuations due to the finite number of participant nucleons. In this contribution, we propose a simple model of fluctuating spin initial conditions for event-by-event spin hydrodynamics based on the Glauber Monte Carlo paradigm. We postulate that, if the net spin of the events is conserved from the initial to the final state, then initial state fluctuations of spin should manifest in specific spin correlations of $\Lambda$ hyperons. Within our picture, we predict that this signal is much larger in central O+O collisions than in central Pb+Pb collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The amplitude of an excited shape mode in a kink is expected to decay with a well-known power law via scalar radiation emission due to the nonlinear self-coupling of the scalar field. In this work we propose an alternative decay mechanism via pair production of fermions in a simple extension of the $\phi^4$ model in which the scalar field is coupled to a (quantum) fermionic field through a Yukawa-like interaction term. We study the power emitted through fermions as a function of the coupling constant in the semi-classical limit (without backreaction) and compare it to the case of purely scalar radiation emission.</description>

Abstract: Methods from Quantum Information Theory are used to scrutinize quantum correlations encoded in the two-quark density matrix over light-cone momentum fractions $x_1$ and $x_2$. A non-perturbative three quark model light-cone wavefunction predicts significant non-classical correlations associated with the "entanglement negativity" measure for asymmetric and small quark momentum fractions. We perform one step of QCD scale evolution of the entire density matrix, not just its diagonal (dPDF), by computing collinearly divergent corrections due to the emission of a gluon. Finally, we present first qualitative numerical results for single-step scale evolution of quantum entanglement correlations in double quark PDFs. At a higher $Q^2$ scale, the non-classical correlations manifest in the dPDF for nearly symmetric momentum fractions.</description>

      <title>Probing Z/W Pole Physics at High-energy Muon Colliders via Vector-boson-fusion Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A future $e^+e^-$ collider could run at the Z-pole to perform important electroweak (EW) precision measurements, while such a run may not be viable for a future muon collider. This however can be compensated by the measurements of other EW processes, taking advantage of the high energy and large luminosity of the muon collider. In this paper, we consider the measurements of the vector boson fusion processes of $WW/WZ/W\gamma$ to a pair of fermions (along with a $\nu_{\mu}\bar{\nu}_{\mu}$ or $\nu_{\mu}\mu^+/\bar{\nu}_{\mu}\mu^-$ pair) at a high-energy muon collider and study their potential in probing the EW observables. We consider two run scenarios for the muon collider with center-of-mass energy of 10 TeV and 30 TeV, respectively, and focus on the processes involving $f=b,c,\tau$ and the dimension-6 operators that directly modify the corresponding fermions coupling to the $Z/W$ bosons. The invariant mass distribution of the $f\bar{f}$ pair helps to separate the events from the $Z/W$ resonance and the high-energy ones, while the polar angle of the outing fermion also provides additional information. By performing a chi-squared analysis on the binned distributions and combining the information from the $WW$ and $WZ/W\gamma$ fusion processes, all relevant Wilson coefficients can be constrained simultaneously. The precision surpasses the current EW measurement constraints and is even competitive with future $e^+e^-$ colliders. Our analysis can be included in a more complete framework which is needed to fully determine the potential of muon colliders in EW precision measurements.</description>

      <title>Semileptonic decay of double strangeness heavy flavor baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the double strangeness heavy flavor baryons $\Omega_c^0$ and $\Omega_b^-$, which contain two strange quarks. Using QCD light-cone sum rules (LCSRs), we calculate the form factors for the Cabibbo-suppressed processes $\Omega_c^0\to\Xi^-$ and $\Omega_b^-\to\Xi^0$, corresponding to the heavy-quark transitions $c\to d$ and $b\to u$, respectively. Combining these with the helicity amplitude formalism for semileptonic decay differential widths, we computed the branching fractions of their corresponding semileptonic decay processes. Our analysis reveals significant discrepancies between two versions of QCD LCSRs: one using the light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs) of the final-state $\Xi$ baryon and the other using the LCDAs of the initial-state double strangeness heavy flavor baryons. The results obtained with the $\Xi$ baryon's LCDAs show excellent agreement with other theoretical calculations. However, when using the LCDAs of the double strangeness heavy flavor baryons, the results differ by orders of magnitude, warranting further investigation.</description>

      <title>Threshold resummation for $W$-boson pair production at NNLO+NNLL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present results for threshold resummation of the invariant mass distribution, for on-shell production of a pair of $W$-bosons at next-to-next-to-leading order + next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (NNLO+NNLL) accuracy in QCD. Owing to its sensitivity to the self-interactions between gauge bosons, this process is important to investigate at the energies of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We achieve this resummation by exploiting the factorization properties of the soft and virtual parts of the partonic cross-section. Our analysis has been carried out for the invariant mass distribution up to $Q$ = 2500 GeV. At this highest $Q$ we find that, for 13.6 TeV LHC, the NNLL resummation enhances the NNLO cross-sections by about $6.3\%$ and reduces the conventional scale uncertainties from 6.8\% at NNLO to 4.1\% at NNLO+NNLL. We also estimate the intrinsic uncertainties due to the non-perturbative parton distribution functions at the highest perturbative order, for both fixed-order and resummed results, to be around 3\% for $Q \sim$ 2000 GeV.</description>

      <title>Axionlike particle-assisted supercooling chiral phase transition in QCD: Identifying Coleman-Weinberg type-chiral phase transition in QCD-like scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new scenario to realize the Coleman-Weinberg (CW) type chiral phase transition in the QCD thermal history. This scenario predicts an axionlike particle (ALP) with mass $\gtrsim$ sub GeV, consistently with the current experimental and cosmological bounds. The chiral phase transition is evaluated by monitoring ordinary QCD setup in a view of a two-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model at the mean-field approximation level. The present work thus can open a new window to search for the ALP associated with the QCD phase transition epoch of the thermal history, to be probed by gravitational wave and primordial black hole productions. This proposal is based on a generic classification of the order of the chiral phase transition in a view of the scale violation classes: the soft-scale breaking term and the CW-type scale anomaly term, in or off medium with or without chemical potentials. On this theoretical ground, we also revisit existing scenarios which undergo the supercooling chiral phase transition, such as nearly scale-invariant QCD and QCD with a large baryon chemical potential.</description>

      <title>Beyond Neutrino Mass: Observable $n$-$\overline{n}$ Oscillations in UV Complete Seesaw Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Next-generation experiments, such as the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment and the European Spallation Source, are set to improve sensitivity to neutron-antineutron oscillation, a direct probe of $\Delta B = 2$ baryon number violation, with particularly significant gains expected at the latter. The discovery of such a rare $\Delta B = 2$ process would indicate physics beyond the Standard Model and could point to specific unified theories that allow observable $n-\overline{n}$ transitions. We accordingly examine $n-\overline{n}$ oscillations within a unified framework that accounts for charged fermion masses and generates viable neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism. More specifically, we show that $n-\overline{n}$ oscillations can arise from two specific topologies within two distinct $SU(5)$ scenarios. One topology requires a presence of two color-sextet scalars in the Type II seesaw framework, whereas the other involves a scalar sextet and a color-octet fermion in the Type III seesaw framework. While the former topology can be realized in the $SO(10)$/Pati-Salam frameworks, the latter finds a natural embedding in $SU(5)$, which constitutes one of the key novelties of our work. Remarkably enough, the same dynamics responsible for fermion masses also induces baryon number violation, thus linking $n-\overline{n}$ oscillations to the flavor structure of the theory. We show that, given a TeV-scale mass for one of the colored states, upcoming searches for such $\Delta B = 2$ processes can probe for a presence of the other colored states with masses up to $10^{11}\,\mathrm{GeV}$, well beyond the reach of colliders. This positions $n-\overline{n}$ oscillations as a rare low-energy portal to grand unification and ultra-heavy new physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate photon, pion, and rho-meson production from proton synchrotron radiation in the presence of strong magnetic fields. The proton decay widths and the luminosities of the emitted particles are calculated within a relativistic quantum framework that incorporates Landau quantization. A scaling rule is derived for the transition probability between different Landau levels. This allows an evaluation of transitions for extremely high Landau numbers exceeding $10^{15}$. Furthermore, we calculate the momentum distribution of the emitted particles by properly including the proton recoil effect associated with particle emission. The results differ significantly from conventional semiclassical approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.04992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: After the successful full-shape analyses of BOSS data using the Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure, we investigate what upcoming galaxy surveys might achieve. We introduce a ``perturbativity prior" that ensures that loop terms are as large as theoretically expected, which is effective in the case of a large number of EFT parameters. After validating our technique by comparison with already-performed analyses of BOSS data, we provide Fisher forecasts using the one-loop prediction for power spectrum and bispectrum for two benchmark surveys: DESI and MegaMapper. We find overall great improvements on the cosmological parameters. In particular, we find that MegaMapper (DESI) should obtain at least a 12$\sigma$ ($2\sigma$) evidence for non-vanishing neutrino masses, bound the curvature $\Omega_k$ to 0.0012 (0.012), and primordial inflationary non-Gaussianities as follows: $f_{\text{NL}}^{\text{loc.}}$ to $\pm 0.26$ (3.3), $f_{\text{NL}}^{\text{eq.}}$ to $\pm16$ (92), $f_{\text{NL}}^{\text{orth.}}$ to $\pm 4.2$ (27). Such measurements would provide much insight on the theory of Inflation. We investigate the limiting factor of shot noise and ignorance of the EFT parameters.</description>

Abstract: The Lifshitz formula is well known as a theoretical approach to investigate the Casimir effect at finite temperature. In this Letter, we generalize the Lifshitz formula to the Casimir effect originating from quantum fields at finite chemical potential. To demonstrate the versatility of this formula, we discuss the typical phenomena of the Casimir effect at finite chemical potential in various systems, such as some boundary conditions, finite temperatures, arbitrary spatial dimensions, and mismatched chemical potentials. This formula can be applied to the Casimir effect in dense quark matter and Dirac/Weyl semimetals, where the chemical potential is regarded as a parameter to control the Casimir effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19983v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we review the physics opportunities at linear $e^+e^-$ colliders with a special focus on high centre-of-mass energies and beam polarisation, take a fresh look at the various accelerator technologies available or under development and, for the first time, discuss how a facility first equipped with a technology mature today could be upgraded with technologies of tomorrow to reach much higher energies and/or luminosities. In addition, we will discuss detectors and alternative collider modes, as well as opportunities for beyond-collider experiments and R\&amp;D facilities as part of a linear collider facility (LCF). The material of this paper will support all plans for $e^+e^-$ linear colliders and additional opportunities they offer, independently of technology choice or proposed site, as well as R\&amp;D for advanced accelerator technologies. This joint perspective on the physics goals, early technologies and upgrade strategies has been developed by the LCVision team based on an initial discussion at LCWS2024 in Tokyo and a follow-up at the LCVision Community Event at CERN in January 2025. It heavily builds on decades of achievements of the global linear collider community, in particular in the context of CLIC and ILC.</description>

      <title>Isospin kaon anomaly and its consequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02113v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Isospin symmetry is well fulfilled in the QCD vacuum, as evidenced by small mass differences of isospin partners and suppressed isospin-violating decays. Recently, the NA61/SHINE collaboration reported an unexpectedly large isospin-violating charged-to-neutral kaon ratio in Ar-Sc heavy-ion collisions (HIC).Using a quark recombination approach, we introduce a function of kaon multiplicities that reduces to unity in the isospin-symmetric limit independently of the scattering energy and type of nuclei. Using this quantity, we show that nucleus-nucleus collisions violate isospin sizably (at the $6.4\sigma$--level), while proton-proton data on kaon multiplicities do not. We predict other isospin-violating enhancements in HIC, such as the proton-to-neutron ratio $p/n \sim 1.2$ and the hyperon ratio $\Sigma^{+}/\Sigma^{-}\sim1.4$. Finally, we extend the approach to antiquarks in the initial state, useful for e.g. pion-nucleus scattering reactions.</description>

      <title>Lattice study of $cc\bar u\bar s$ tetraquark channel in $D^{(*)}D^{(*)}_s$ scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first lattice QCD determination of coupled $DD_s^*$ and $D^*D_s$ scattering amplitudes in the $J^{P}=1^{+}$ channel and elastic $DD_s$ scattering amplitude in the $J^{P}=0^{+}$ channel. The aim is to investigate whether tetraquarks with flavor $cc\bar u\bar s$ exist in the region near threshold. Lattice QCD ensembles from the CLS consortium with $m_{\pi} \sim 280$ MeV, $a\sim0.09$ fm and $L/a = 24, 32$ are utilized. Finite-volume spectra are determined via variational analysis of two-point correlation matrices, computed using large bases of operators resembling bilocal two-meson structures within the distillation framework. The scattering matrix for partial wave $l=0$ is determined using lattice eigenenergies from multiple inertial frames following L\"uscher's formalism as well as following the solutions of Lippmann-Schwinger Equation in the finite-volume on a plane-wave basis. We observe small nonzero energy shifts in the simulated spectra from the noninteracting scenario in both the channels studied, which points to rather weak nontrivial interactions between the mesons involved. Despite the nonzero energy shifts, the lattice-extracted $S$-wave amplitudes do not carry signatures of any hadron pole features in the physical amplitudes in the energy region near the threshold.</description>

      <title>Superradiant dark matter production from primordial black holes: Impact of multiple modes and gravitational wave emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rotating primordial black holes (PBHs) in the early universe can emit particles through superradiance, a process particularly efficient when the particle's Compton wavelength is comparable to the PBH's gravitational radius. Superradiance leads to an exponential growth of particle occupation numbers in gravitationally bound states. We present an analysis of heavy bosonic dark matter (DM) production through three gravitational mechanisms: Hawking radiation, superradiant instabilities, and ultraviolet (UV) freeze-in. We consider PBHs that evaporate before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). For both scalar and vector DM, our analysis incorporates the evolution of a second superradiant mode. We demonstrate that the growth of a second superradiant mode causes the decay of the first mode, and thus the second mode cannot further enhance the DM abundance beyond that already achieved by the first mode. Our study also reveals that while superradiance generally enhances DM production, gravitational wave (GW) emission from the superradiant cloud may significantly modify this picture. For scalar DM, GW emission reduces the parameter space where superradiance effectively augments relic abundance. For vector DM, rapid GW emission from the superradiant cloud may yield relic abundances below those achieved through Hawking radiation alone. These findings demonstrate that multiple-mode effect and GW emission play critical roles in modeling DM production from PBHs in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Model-Independent Dark Energy Measurements from DESI DR2 and Planck 2015 Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17415v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) distance measurements and Planck cosmic microwave background distance priors, we have measured the dark energy density $\rho_X(z)$ and dark energy equation of state w_X(z) as free functions of redshift (smoothly interpolated from values at {z_i}={0, 1/3, 2/3, 1, 4/3, 2.33}, and find both to be consistent with a cosmological constant, with only deviations of 1\sigma for $\rho_X(z)$ &amp; ~ 2$\sigma$ for w_X(z) at z=2/3. We also find that measuring {$\rho_X(z_i)$} is preferred to measuring {w_X(z_i)} by model selection using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) as well as the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Varying the choice of redshift values of the $\rho_X(z)$ measurements leads to very consistent results, with AIC/BIC slightly favoring the case of our fiducial {z_i} with z=4/3 omitted. We find agreement with a cosmological constant except for the 1-2$\sigma$ deviation at 0.4 &lt; z &lt; 0.9, where DESI DR2 BAO measurements deviate from a cosmological constant at similar statistical significance. Our results differ noticeably from those of the DESI Collaboration, in which they used the same DESI DR2 data combined with Planck data and found a 3.1$\sigma$ deviation from a cosmological constant, which is primarily the consequence of their assuming parametrization w_X(z)=w_0+w_a(1-a). Our results indicate that assuming a linear w_X(z) could be misleading and precludes discovering how dark energy actually varies with time at higher redshifts. In our quest to discover the physical nature of dark energy, the most urgent goal at present is to determine definitively whether dark energy density varies with time. It is of critical importance to measure dark energy density as a free function of redshift from data. Future galaxy redshift surveys by Euclid and Roman at higher redshifts will significantly advance our understanding of dark energy.</description>

      <title>Occurrence of fast neutrino flavor conversions in QCD phase-transition supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Core-collapse supernovae undergoing a first-order quantum chromodynamics (QCD) phase transition experience the collapse of the central proto-neutron star that leads to a second bounce. This event is accompanied by the release of a second neutrino burst. Unlike the first stellar core bounce neutrino burst which consists exclusively of electron neutrinos, the second burst is dominated by electron antineutrinos. Such a condition makes QCD supernovae an ideal site for the occurrence of fast neutrino flavor conversion (FFC), which can lead to rapid flavor equilibration and significantly impact the related neutrino signal. In this work, we perform a detailed analysis of the conditions for fast flavor instability (FFI) around and after the second neutrino burst in QCD phase transition supernova models launched from 25~$M_\odot$ and 40~$M_\odot$ progenitor models. We evaluate the relevant instability criteria and find two major phases of FFC. The first phase is closely associated with the collapse and the rapidly expanding shock wave, which is a direct consequence of the proto-neutron star collapse due to the phase transition. The second phase takes place a few milliseconds later when electron degeneracy is restored near the proto-neutron star surface. We also characterize the growth rate of FFI and estimate its impact on the evolution of the neutrino flavor content. The potential observational consequences on neutrino signals are evaluated by comparing a scenario assuming complete flavor equipartition with other scenarios without FFC. Finally, we investigate how FFC may influences $r$-process nucleosynthesis associated with QCD phase transition driven supernova explosions.</description>

      <title>Kolmogorov-type non-thermal fixed points and beyond of far-from-equilibrium dilute system: ultra-cold Fermi gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The far-from-equilibrium dynamics driven by the scattering from next-to-leading-order (NLO) corrections in the quantum field theory has stationary solutions for the particle distribution characterized as the Kolmogorov-type non-thermal fixed points. The dynamics of the spatially homogeneous, isotropic dilute ultra-cold Fermi gas is investigated, and its kinetic equation confirms the Kolmogorov-type non-thermal fixed points in the perturbation theory by the quasi-particle assumption, in contrast to the wave turbulence of the weakly coupled ultra-cold Bose gas. In addition, other stationary states are found without the quasi-particle assumption and in a strongly coupled system. These analytical solutions provide chances for future experiments and numerical simulations in search of far-from-equilibrium stationary states of the dilute system.</description>

      <title>Quantum Metric Corrections to Liouville's Theorem and Chiral Kinetic Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasiparticles may possess not only Berry curvature but also a quantum metric in momentum space. We develop a canonical formalism for such quasiparticles based on the Dirac brackets, and demonstrate that quantum metric modifies the phase-space density of states at $\mathcal{O}(\hbar^2)$, leading to corrections to Liouville's theorem, kinetic theory, and related physical quantities. In particular, we show that, in the presence of an inhomogeneous electric field, quantum metric induces corrections to the energy density and energy current. Applied to chiral fermions, this framework provides a nonlinear extension of chiral kinetic theory consistent with quantum field theory. Our work paves the way to potential applications of the quantum metric in high-energy physics and astrophysics.</description>

      <title>High energy gammas and neutrinos from the Sun, Jupiter and Earth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmic rays reaching the atmosphere of an astrophysical object produce showers of secondary particles that may then scape into space. Here we obtain the flux of gammas and neutrinos of energy $E&gt;10$ GeV emited by the Sun, Jupiter and Earth. We show that, while the solar magnetic field induces an albedo flux of gammas from all the points in the Sun's surface, the dipolar magnetic field in the planets implies gammas only from the very peripheral region. Neutrinos, in contrast, can cross these objects and emerge from any point in their surface. The emission from these astrophysical objects is above the diffuse flux from cosmic ray interactions with the interstellar medium and has a distinct spectrum and gamma to neutrino ratio.</description>
