      <title>Boolean-valued second-order logic revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following the paper~[3] by V\"{a}\"{a}n\"{a}nen and the author, we continue to investigate on the difference between Boolean-valued second-order logic and full second-order logic. We show that the compactness number of Boolean-valued second-order logic is equal to $\omega_1$ if there are proper class many Woodin cardinals. This contrasts the result by Magidor~[10] that the compactness number of full second-order logic is the least extendible cardinal. We also introduce the inner model $C^{2b}$ constructed from Boolean-valued second-order logic using the construction of G\"{o}del's Constructible Universe L. We show that $C^{2b}$ is the least inner model of $\mathsf{ZFC}$ closed under $\mathrm{M}_n^{\#}$ operators for all $n &lt; \omega$, and that $C^{2b}$ enjoys various nice properties as G\"{o}del's L does, assuming that Projective Determinacy holds in any set generic extension. This contrasts the result by Myhill and Scott~[14] that the inner model constructed from full second-order logic is equal to HOD, the class of all hereditarily ordinal definable sets.</description>

      <title>Mazurkiewicz Sets and Containment of Sierpi\'{n}ski-Zygmund Functions under Rotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Mazurkiewicz set is a plane subset that intersect every straight line at exactly two points, and a Sierpi\'{n}ski-Zygmund function is a function from $\mathbb{R}$ into $\mathbb{R}$ that has as little of the standard continuity as possible. Building on the recent work of Kharazishvili, we construct a Mazurkiewicz set that contains a Sierpi\'{n}ski-Zygmund function in every direction and another one that contains none in any direction. Furthermore, we show that whether a Mazurkiewicz set can be expressed as a union of two Sierpi\'{n}ski-Zygmund functions is independent of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the Axiom of Choice (ZFC). Some open problems related to the containment of Hamel functions are stated.</description>

      <title>A note on one-variable theorems for NSOP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an example of an SOP theory $T$, such that any $L(M)$-formula $\varphi(x,y)$ with $|y|=1$ is NSOP. We show that any such $T$ must have the independence property. We also give a simplified proof of Lachlan's theorem that if every $L$-formula $\varphi(x,y)$ with $|x|=1$ is NSOP, then $T$ is NSOP.</description>

      <title>On the asymptotic behaviour of stochastic processes, with applications to supermartingale convergence, Dvoretzky's approximation theorem, and stochastic quasi-Fej\'er monotonicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a novel and general result on the asymptotic behavior of stochastic processes which conform to a certain relaxed supermartingale condition. Our result provides quantitative information in the form of an explicit and effective construction of a rate of convergence for this process, both in mean and almost surely, that is moreover highly uniform in the sense that it only depends on very few data of the surrounding objects involved in the iteration. We then apply this result to derive new quantitative versions of well-known concepts and theorems from stochastic approximation, in particular providing effective rates for a variant of the Robbins-Siegmund theorem, Dvoretzky's convergence theorem, as well as the convergence of stochastic quasi-Fej\'er monotone sequences, the latter of which formulated in a novel and highly general metric context. We utilize the classic and widely studied Robbins-Monro procedure as a template to evaluate our quantitative results and their applicability in greater detail. We conclude by illustrating the breadth of potential further applications with a brief discussion on a variety of other well-known iterative procedures from stochastic approximation, covering a range of different applied scenarios to which our methods can be immediately applied. Throughout, we isolate and discuss special cases of our results which even allow for the construction of fast, and in particular linear, rates.</description>

      <title>Effective Completeness for S4.3.1-Theories with Respect to Discrete Linear Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.00317</link>
      <description>arXiv:1712.00317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The computable model theory of modal logic was initiated by Suman Ganguli and Anil Nerode in [4]. They use an effective Henkin-type construction to effectivize various completeness theorems from classical modal logic. This construction has the feature of only producing models whose frames can be obtained by adding edges to a tree digraph. Consequently, this construction cannot prove an effective version of a well-known completeness theorem which states that every $\mathsf{S4.3.1}$-theory has a model whose accessibility relation is a linear order of order type $\omega$. We prove an effectivization of that theorem by means of a new construction adapted from that of Ganguli and Nerode.</description>

      <title>The weakness of finding descending sequences in ill-founded linear orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11807v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the Weihrauch degree of the problems ``find a bad sequence in a non-well quasi order'' ($\mathsf{BS}$) and ``find a descending sequence in an ill-founded linear order'' ($\mathsf{DS}$). We prove that $\mathsf{DS}$ is strictly Weihrauch reducible to $\mathsf{BS}$, correcting our mistaken claim in [arXiv:2010.03840]. This is done by separating their respective first-order parts. On the other hand, we show that $\mathsf{BS}$ and $\mathsf{DS}$ have the same finitary and deterministic parts, confirming that $\mathsf{BS}$ and $\mathsf{DS}$ have very similar uniform computational strength. We prove that K\"onig's lemma $\mathsf{KL}$ and the problem $\mathsf{wList}_{2^{\mathbb{N}},\leq\omega}$ of enumerating a given non-empty countable closed subset of $2^{\mathbb{N}}$ are not Weihrauch reducible to $\mathsf{DS}$ or $\mathsf{BS}$, resolving two main open questions raised in [arXiv:2010.03840]. We also answer the question, raised in [arXiv:1804.10968], on the existence of a ``parallel quotient'' operator, and study the behavior of $\mathsf{BS}$ and $\mathsf{DS}$ under the quotient with some known problems.</description>

      <title>A note on dual Dedekind finiteness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A set $A$ is dually Dedekind finite if every surjection from $A$ onto $A$ is injective; otherwise, $A$ is dually Dedekind infinite. It is proved consistent with $\mathsf{ZF}$ (i.e., the Zermelo--Fraenkel set theory without the axiom of choice) that there exists a family $\langle A_n\rangle_{n\in\omega}$ of sets such that, for all $n\in\omega$, $A_n^n$ is dually Dedekind finite whereas $A_n^{n+1}$ is dually Dedekind infinite. This resolves a question that was left open in [J. Truss, Fund. Math. 84, 187--208 (1974)].</description>

      <title>Strict comparison in reduced group $C^*$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06031v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that for every $n\geq 2$, the reduced group $C^*$-algebras of the countable free groups $C^*_r(\mathbb{F}_n)$ have strict comparison. Our method works in a general setting: for $G$ in a large family of non-amenable groups, including hyperbolic groups, free products, mapping class groups, right-angled Artin groups etc., we have $C^*_r(G)$ have strict comparison. This work also has several applications in the theory of $C^*$-algebras including: resolving Leonel Robert's selflessness problem for $C^*_r(G)$; uniqueness of embeddings of the Jiang-Su algebra $\mathcal{Z}$ up to approximate unitary equivalence into $C^*_r(G)$; full computations of the Cuntz semigroup of $C^*_r(G)$ and future directions in the $C^*$-classification program.</description>

      <title>Negative resolution to the $C^*$-algebraic Tarski problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10505v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the $K_1$-group of ultraproducts of unital, simple $C^*$-algebras with unique trace and strict comparison. As an application, we prove that the reduced free group $C^*$-algebras $C^*_r(F_m)$ and $C^*_r(F_n)$ are elementarily equivalent (i.e., have isomorphic ultrapowers) if and only if $m = n$. This settles in the negative the $C^*$-algebraic analogue of Tarski's 1945 problem for groups.</description>
