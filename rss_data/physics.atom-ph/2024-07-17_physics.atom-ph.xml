      <title>Rydberg EIT based laser lock to Zeeman sublevels with 0.6 GHz scanning range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a technique for frequency locking a laser to the Zeeman sublevel transitions between the 5P$_{3/2}$ intermediate and 32D$_{5/2}$ Rydberg states in $^{87}$Rb. This method allows for continuous frequency tuning over 0.6 GHz by varying an applied external magnetic field. In the presence of the applied field, the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) spectrum of an atomic vapor splits via the Zeeman effect according to the strength of the magnetic field and the polarization of the pump and probe lasers. We show that the 480 nm pump laser, responsible for transitions between the Zeeman sublevels of the intermediate state and the Rydberg state, can be locked to the Zeeman-split EIT peaks. The short-term frequency stability of the laser lock is 0.15 MHz and the long-term stability is within 0.5 MHz. In addition, we show that in the absence of an applied magnetic field and adequate shielding, the frequency shift of the lock point has a peak-to-peak variation of 1.6 MHz depending on the polarization of the pump field, while when locked to Zeeman sublevels this variation is reduced to 0.6 MHz. The proposed technique is useful for research involving Rydberg atoms, where large continuous tuning of the laser frequency with stable locking is required.</description>

      <title>Feynman Diagrams for Matter Wave Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new theoretical framework based on Feynman diagrams to compute phase shifts in matter wave interferometry. The method allows for analytic computation of higher order quantum corrections, beyond the traditional semi-classical approximation. These additional terms depend on the finite size of the initial matter wavefunction and/or have higher order dependence on $\hbar$. We apply the method to compute the response of matter wave interferometers to power law potentials and potentials with an arbitrary spatial dependence. The analytic expressions are validated by comparing to numerical simulations, and estimates are provided for the scale of the quantum corrections to the phase shift response to the gravitational field of the earth, anharmonic trapping potentials, and gravitational fields from local proof masses. We find that for certain experimentally feasible parameters, these corrections are large enough to be measured, and could lead to systematic errors if not accounted for. We anticipate these corrections will be especially important for trapped matter wave interferometers and for free-space matter wave interferometers in the presence of proof masses. These interferometers are becoming increasingly sensitive tools for mobile inertial sensing, gravity surveying, tests of gravity and its interplay with quantum mechanics, and searches for dark energy.</description>

      <title>Multi-reservoir enhanced loading of tweezer atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a species-independent method for improved loading into a single-atom optical tweezer array, utilizing iterative loading with multiple reservoir tweezers. Demonstrated with dual wavelength tweezer arrays of $^{88}$Sr atoms, our approach achieves a 96$\%$ loading rate after four reload cycles. This method can significantly enhance existing tweezer rearrangement protocols, potentially reducing iteration time and optical power consumption, thereby enabling a larger number of atoms in a quantum logic device.</description>

      <title>Scalable Networking of Neutral-Atom Qubits: Nanofiber-Based Approach for Multiprocessor Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutral atoms are among the leading platforms toward realizing fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC). However, scaling up a single neutral-atom device beyond $\sim 10^4$ atoms to meet the demands of FTQC for practical applications remains a challenge. To overcome this challenge, we clarify the criteria and technological requirements for further scaling based on multiple neutral atom quantum processing units (QPUs) connected through photonic networking links. Our quantitative analysis shows that nanofiber optical cavities have the potential as an efficient atom-photon interface to enable fast entanglement generation between atoms in distinct neutral-atom modules, allowing multiple neutral-atom QPUs to operate cooperatively without sacrificing computational speed. Using state-of-the-art millimeter-scale nanofiber cavities with the finesse of thousands, over a hundred atoms can be coupled to the cavity mode with an optical tweezer array, with expected single-atom cooperativity exceeding 100 for telecom-band transition of ytterbium atoms. This enables efficient time-multiplexed entanglement generation with a predicted Bell pair generation rate of 100 kHz while maintaining a small footprint for channel multiplexing. These proposals and results indicate a promising pathway for building large-scale multiprocessor fault-tolerant quantum computers using neutral atoms, nanofiber optical cavities, and fiber-optic networks.</description>

      <title>A Nuclear Interferometer for Ultra-Light Dark Matter Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the nuclear interferometer - a single-photon interferometry experiment based upon the thorium-229 nuclear clock transition - as a novel detector for ultra-light dark matter (ULDM). Thanks to the enhanced sensitivity of this transition to the variation of fundamental constants, we find that possible realisations of such an experiment deploying either single ions or clouds of atoms have the potential to be complementary to advanced very-long-baseline terrestrial clock atom interferometers in the search for ultra-light dark matter with scalar couplings to photons. Nuclear interferometry may also offer an unparalleled window to new physics coupling to the QCD sector via quarks or gluons, with a discovery reach that could enhance existing and proposed experiments over a range of frequencies in the direction of well-motivated parameter space.</description>

      <title>Robust Quantum Control via Multipath Interference for Thousandfold Phase Amplification in a Resonant Atom Interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel technique for enhancing the robustness of light-pulse atom interferometers against the pulse infidelities that typically limit their sensitivities. The technique uses quantum optimal control to favorably harness the multipath interference of the stray trajectories produced by imperfect atom-optics operations. We apply this method to a resonant atom interferometer and achieve thousand-fold phase amplification, representing a fifty-fold improvement over the performance observed without optimized control. Moreover, we find that spurious interference can arise from the interplay of spontaneous emission and many-pulse sequences and demonstrate optimization strategies to mitigate this effect. Given the ubiquity of spontaneous emission in quantum systems, these results may be valuable for improving the performance of a diverse array of quantum sensors. We anticipate our findings will significantly benefit the performance of matter-wave interferometers for a variety of applications, including dark matter, dark energy, and gravitational wave detection.</description>

      <title>A practical approach to calculating magnetic Johnson noise for precision measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic Johnson noise is an important consideration for many applications involving precision magnetometry, and its significance will only increase in the future with improvements in measurement sensitivity. The fluctuation-dissipation theorem can be utilized to derive analytic expressions for magnetic Johnson noise in certain situations. But when used in conjunction with commercially available finite element analysis tools, the combined approach is particularly powerful as it provides a practical means to calculate the magnetic Johnson noise arising from conductors of arbitrary geometry and permeability. In this paper, we demonstrate this method to be one of the most comprehensive approaches presently available to calculate thermal magnetic noise. In particular, its applicability is shown to not be limited to cases where the noise is evaluated at a point in space but also can be expanded to include cases where the magnetic field detector has a more general shape, such as a finite size loop, a gradiometer, or a detector that consists of a polarized atomic species trapped in a volume. Furthermore, some physics insights gained through studies made using this method are discussed.</description>

      <title>Frequency dependence of nonsequential double ionization of atoms in strong laser fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The frequency dependence of (nonsequential) double ionization is studied in fully quantum mechanical calculations using a (1+1)-dimensional model atom. Other time-dependent effects such as the influence of the number of field cycles are also investigated. We present ionization yields and momentum distributions. The results are consistent with experimental and semi-classical data available in the literature, thus complementing them with a quantum mechanical description.</description>

      <title>High-Precision Transition Energy Measurements of Neon-like Fe XVII Ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08395v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We improve by a factor of 4-20 the energy accuracy of the strongest soft X-ray transitions of Fe XVII ions by resonantly exciting them in an electron beam ion trap with a monochromatic beam at the P04 beamline of the PETRA III synchrotron facility. By simultaneously tracking instantaneous photon-energy fluctuations with a high-resolution photoelectron spectrometer, we minimize systematic uncertainties down to 10-15 meV, or velocity equivalent $\pm\sim$5 km s$^{-1}$ in their rest energies, substantially improving our knowledge of this key astrophysical ion. Our large-scale configuration-interaction computations include more than four million relativistic configurations and agree with the experiment at a level without precedent for a 10-electron system. Thereby, theoretical uncertainties for interelectronic correlations become far smaller than those of quantum electrodynamics (QED) corrections. The present QED benchmark strengthens our trust in future calculations of many other complex atomic ions of interest to astrophysics, plasma physics, and for the development of optical clocks with highly charged ions.</description>

      <title>Eighth-Order Foldy-Wouthuysen Transformation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The calculation of higher-order binding corrections to bound systems is a fundamental problem of theoretical physics. For any nonrelativistic expansion, one needs the Foldy-Wouthuysen Transformation which disentangles the particle and the antiparticle degrees of freedom. This transformation is carried out here to eighth order in the momenta, or, to eighth order in the momentum operators, which is equivalent to the eighth order of the fine-structure constant. Matrix elements of the eighth-order terms are evaluated for F_5/2 and F_7/2 states in hydrogenlike ions and compared with the Dirac-Coulomb energy levels.</description>

      <title>Path integral for the quartic oscillator: An accurate analytic formula for the partition function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09859v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work an approximate analytic expression for the quantum partition function of the quartic oscillator described by the potential $V(x) = \frac{1}{2} \omega^2 x^2 + g x^4$ is presented. Using a path integral formalism, the exact partition function is approximated by the partition function of a harmonic oscillator with an effective frequency depending both on the temperature and coupling constant $g$. By invoking a Principle of Minimal Sensitivity (PMS) of the path integral to the effective frequency, we derive a mathematically well-defined analytic formula for the partition function. Quite remarkably, the formula reproduces qualitatively and quantitatively the key features of the exact partition function. The free energy is accurate to a few percent over the entire range of temperatures and coupling strengths $g$. Both the harmonic ($g\rightarrow 0$) and classical (high-temperature) limits are exactly recovered. The divergence of the power series of the ground-state energy at weak coupling, characterized by a factorial growth of the perturbational energies, is reproduced as well as the functional form of the strong-coupling expansion along with accurate coefficients. Explicit accurate expressions for the ground- and first-excited state energies, $E_0(g)$ and $E_1(g)$ are also presented.</description>

      <title>Violation of the Leggett-Garg Inequality for Dynamics of a Bose-Einstein Condensate in a Double-Well Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Leggett-Garg inequality (LGI) serves as a criterion to determine the adherence of macroscopic system dynamics to macrorealism, as postulated by Leggett and Garg. A violation of this inequality implies either the absence of a realistic description of the system or the impracticality of noninvasive measurements. In this work, we investigate the violation of the LGI for the system of bosons in a double-well potential. Specifically, we explore the violation of the LGI in the dynamics of bosons in a double-well potential in the Bose-Einstein-Condensation (BEC) regime, where the system can be considered as two weakly coupled Bose condensates, and in the single-particle regime to establish the conditions under which the violation of the LGI occurs. Our analysis reveals that the LGI is violated due to Josephson oscillations, while it remains unviolated in the strong coupling regime, attributed to the self-trapping phenomena. Notably, we observe that the violation of the LGI becomes increasingly significant as the particle number increases. These findings provide valuable insights into the macrorealistic behavior of Bose condensates and highlight the effect of measurements on the dynamics of a macroscopic system.</description>
