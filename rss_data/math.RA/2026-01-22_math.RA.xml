      <title>Bispectral rational functions and Leonard trios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that Leonard pairs have a close connection with bispectral orthogonal polynomials of the Askey scheme. In this paper, we introduce the notion of a Leonard trio $(V,\oV,Z)$, an algebraic structure extending Leonard pairs, for which the overlap coefficients of eigenfunctions of $V$ and $\oV$ are biorthogonal rational functions satisfying generalized eigenvalue problems. We introduce and start the classification of irreducible Leonard trios by using its connection with Leonard pairs and Heun operators. In particular, we show that Wilson's rational functions appear as overlap coefficients, prove its difference, recurrence and biorthogonality relations, and obtain a summation formula expressing them as a finite sum of products of two $q$-Racah polynomials. We also begin to investigate reduced Leonard trios, for which the general eigenvalue problem simplifies to a $R_I$-type recurrence relation. As an illustration, we present an example of this in which the rational functions appearing as overlap coefficients can be expressed as a ${}_{4}\phi_3$ and are associated with a Leonard pair of dual $q$-Hahn type.</description>

      <title>On geometric models in representation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geometric models have emerged as an important tool in the representation theory of algebras. Surface models associated to gentle algebras have been particularly fruitful in advancing our understanding of their module and derived categories. We give an overview of some of the theoretical advances that geometric surface models for the derived categories of graded gentle algebras and their connections to Fukaya categories of surfaces have made possible.</description>

      <title>Rings in which one-sided strongly $\pi$-regular elements are strongly $\pi$-regular</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1977, Hartwig and Luh asked if $a$ is an element of a Dedekind-finite ring $S$, then does $aS = a^2S$ imply $Sa = Sa^2$. This question was answered negatively by Dittmer, Khurana, and Nielsen in 2014. On the other hand, Dittmer et al. proved that the question of Hartwig and Luh has a positive answer for Dedekind-finite exchange rings. We explore the question of Hartwig and Luh for various other classes of Dedekind-finite rings. We will also prove that the condition in question is not left-right symmetric.</description>

      <title>From affine algebraic racks to Leibniz algebras and Yang-Baxter operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce analogues of algebraic groups called algebraic racks, which are pointed rack objects in the category of schemes over a ground field. Addressing a problem of Loday, we construct functors assigning left and right Leibniz algebras to affine algebraic racks. These functors are compatible with closed subracks and ideals, and they recover the Lie algebras of linear algebraic groups (via conjugation quandles) and the Leibniz algebras of algebraic Lie racks. We also study properties of coordinate algebras and Leibniz algebras of affine algebraic racks. Finally, we use rack schemes to functorially construct (co-)nondegenerate Yang-Baxter operators in various categories.</description>
