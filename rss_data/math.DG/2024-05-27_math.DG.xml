      <title>Extended Solitons of the Ambient Obstruction Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we expand on the work of the first author on ambient obstruction solitons, which are self-similar solutions to the ambient obstruction flow. Our main result is to show that any closed ambient obstruction soliton is ambient obstruction flat and has constant scalar curvature. We show, in fact, that the first part of this result is true for a more general extended soliton equation where we allow an arbitrary conformal factor to be added to the equation. We discuss how this implies that, on a compact manifold, the ambient obstruction flow has no fixed points up to conformal diffeomorphism other than ambient obstruction flat metrics. These results are the consequence of a general integral inequality that can be applied to the solitons to any geometric flow. Additionally, we use these results to obtain a generalization of the Bourguignon-Ezin identity on a closed Riemannian manifold and study the converse problem on a closed extended $q$-soliton. We also study this extended equation further in the case of homogeneous and product metrics.</description>

      <title>Conformal trajectories in 3-dimensional space form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of conformal trajectories in three-dimensional Riemannian manifolds $M^3$. Given a conformal vector field $V\in\mathfrak{X}(M^3)$, a conformal trajectory of $V$ is a regular curve $\gamma$ in $M^3$ satisfying $\nabla_{\gamma'}\gamma'=q\, V\times\gamma'$, for some fixed non-zero constant $q\in {\mathbb{R}}$. In this paper, we study conformal trajectories in the space forms ${\mathbb{R}}^3$, ${\mathbb{S}}^3$ and ${\mathbb{H}}^3$. For (non-Killing) conformal vector fields in ${\mathbb{S}}^3$ (respectively in ${\mathbb{H}}^3$), we prove that conformal trajectories have constant curvature and its torsion is a linear combination of trigonometric (respectively hyperbolic) functions on the arc-length parameter. In the case of Euclidean space ${\mathbb{R}}^3$, we obtain the same result for the radial vector field and characterising all conformal trajectories.</description>

      <title>Translators of the mean curvature flow in the special linear group $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Translators in the special linear group $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ are surfaces whose mean curvature $H$ and unit normal vector $N$ satisfy $H=\langle N,X\rangle$, where $X$ is a fixed Killing vector field. In this paper we study and classify those translators that are invariant by a one-parameter group of isometries. By the Iwasawa decomposition, there are three types of such groups. The dimension of the Killing vector fields is $4$ and an exhaustive discussion is done for each one of the Killing vector fields and each of the invariant surfaces. In some cases, explicit parametrizations of translators are obtained.</description>

      <title>Conformal properties of spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify the cone of smooth metrics $\mc{M}(M)$ on a manifold $M^n$ with the space of smooth isometric embeddings $f_g: (M,g) \rightarrow (\mb{S}^{\tn},\tg)$ into a standard sphere of large dimension $\tn=\tn(n)$, and their isotopic deformations, and the space $\mc{C}(M)$ of conformal classes with the embeddings of metrics in the same conformal class, isotopic to each other by conformal deformations. Uniform limits of $C^1$ isometric embeddings of a metric, or isometric embeddings of metrics on $M$ with a different smooth structure, and their deformations, are carried by $(\mb{S}^{\tn},\tg)$ also, but when the latter exist, they do not embed into a smooth flow of any $f_g(M)\hookrightarrow \mb{S}^{\tn}$. We characterize the metrics of constant scalar curvature by properties of their isometric embeddings, and use it to prove a homotopy lifting property of the bundle $\mc{M}(M) \stackrel{\pi}{\rightarrow } \mc{C}(M)$ by Yamabe metrics. When $M$ carries an almost complex structure $J_0$, this result extends to a homotopy lifting property of the bundle $\mc{M}^{J_0}(M) \stackrel{\pi}{\rightarrow } \mc{C}^{J_0}(M)$ of metrics, compatible with some $J$ in the same orientation class as $J_0$, and their classes, the lift now by almost Hermitian Yamabe metrics. We use these results and the gap theorem of Simons to study the existence and integrability properties of almost complex structures on spheres, and products. We find the sigma invariants of $Sp(2)$ and the $M^7_k$ spheres of Milnor, and with one exception, the almost Hermitian sigma invariant of any product of spheres with almost complex structures. We organize all manifolds with Yamabe, or almost Hermitian Yamabe metrics on them, in a Pascal like triangle, set according to their dimensions and symmetries, and the values of their associated conformal invariants.</description>

      <title>Bending-Neutral Deformations of Minimal Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Minimal surfaces are ubiquitous in nature. Here they are considered as geometric objects that bear a deformation content. By refining the resolution of the surface deformation gradient afforded by the polar decomposition theorem, we identify a bending content and a class of deformations that leave it unchanged. These are the bending-neutral deformations, fully characterized by an integrability condition. We prove that (1) every minimal surface is transformed into a minimal surface by a bending-neutral deformation and (2) given two minimal surfaces, there is a bending-neutral deformation that maps one into the other. Thus, all minimal surfaces have indeed a universal bending content.</description>

      <title>On the fundamental theorem of submanifold theory and isometric immersions with supercritical low regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental result in global analysis and nonlinear elasticity asserts that given a solution $\mathfrak{S}$ to the Gauss--Codazzi--Ricci equations over a simply-connected closed manifold $(\mathcal{M}^n,g)$, one may find an isometric immersion $\iota$ of $(\mathcal{M}^n,g)$ into the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^{n+k}$ whose extrinsic geometry coincides with $\mathfrak{S}$. Here the dimension $n$ and the codimension $k$ are arbitrary. Abundant literature has been devoted to relaxing the regularity assumptions on $\mathfrak{S}$ and $\iota$. The best result up to date is $\mathfrak{S} \in L^p$ and $\iota \in W^{2,p}$ for $p&gt;n \geq 3$ or $p=n=2$.
  In this paper, we extend the above result to $\iota \in \mathcal{X}$ whose topology is strictly weaker than $W^{2,n}$ for $n \geq 3$. Indeed, $\mathcal{X}$ is the weak Morrey space $L^{p, n-p}_{2,w}$ with arbitrary $p \in ]2,n]$. This appears to be first supercritical result in the literature on the existence of isometric immersions with low regularity, given the solubility of the Gauss--Codazzi--Ricci equations. Our proof essentially utilises the theory of Uhlenbeck gauges -- in particular, Rivi\`{e}re--Struwe's work [Partial regularity for harmonic maps and related problems, Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 61 (2008)] on harmonic maps in arbitrary dimensions and codimensions -- and compensated compactness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe the intersection between geodesic and conformal currents on closed hyperbolic three-manifolds.
  We use this to prove some sharp bounds which involve the Liouville entropy of a negatively curved metric, the minimal surface entropy, and the area ratio. Using these ideas we also give a new proof of the Mostow Rigidity Theorem in the three-dimensional case.</description>

      <title>On deformation quantization of the space of connections on a two manifold and Chern Simons Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use recent progress on Chern-Simons gauge theory in three dimensions [18] to give explicit, closed form formulas for the star product on some functions on the affine space ${\mathcal A}(\Sigma)$ of (smooth) connections on the trivialized principal $G$-bundle on a compact, oriented two manifold $\Sigma.$ These formulas give a close relation between knot invariants, such as the Kauffman bracket polynomial, and the Jones and HOMFLY polynomials, arising in Chern Simons gauge theory, and deformation quantization of ${\mathcal A}(\Sigma).$ This relation echoes the relation between the manifold invariants of Witten [20] and Reshetikhin-Turaev [16] and {\em geometric} quantization of this space (or its symplectic quotient by the action of the gauge group). In our case this relation arises from explicit algebraic formulas arising from the (mathematically well-defined) functional integrals of [18].</description>

Abstract: We introduce a notion of distributional $k$-forms on $d$-dimensional manifolds which can be integrated against suitably regular $k$-submanifolds. Our approach combines ideas from Whitney's geometric integration [Whi57] with those of sewing approaches to rough integration [Gub04, FdLP06].</description>

      <title>The Chern-Simons Functional Integral, Kauffman's Bracket Polynomial, and other link invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Chern-Simons Gauge Theory in axial gauge on ${\mathbb R}^3.$ This theory has a quadratic Lagrangian and therefore expectations can be computed nonperturbatively by explicit formulas, giving an (unbounded) linear functional on a space of polynomial functions in the gauge fields, as a mathematically well-defined avatar of the formal functional integral. We use differential-geometric methods to extend the definition of this linear functional to expectations of products of Wilson loops corresponding to oriented links in ${\mathbb R}^3,$ and derive skein relations for them. In the case $G=SU(2)$ we show that these skein relations are closely related to those of the Kauffman bracket polynomial, which is closely related to the Jones polynomial. We also study the case of groups of higher rank. We note that in the absence of a cubic term in the action, there is no quantization condition on the coupling $\lambda,$ which can be any complex number. This is in line with the fact that the Jones polynomial, in contrast to the manifold invariants of Witten and Reshetikhin-Turaev, is defined for any value of the coupling. The appearance of the parameter $e^{\frac1{2\lambda}}$ in the expectations and skein relations is also natural. Likewise, the extension of the theory to noncompact groups presents no difficulties. Finally we show how computations similar to ours, but for gauge fields in two dimensions, yield the Goldman bracket.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the geometry associated with the kinematics of a planar robot known as the "three-segment snake," whose velocity distribution belongs to a class of (2,3,5) distributions. We discover that, under certain assumptions on its construction parameters, the snake may be endowed with a CR structure of CR dimension 1 and real codimension 3. We solve the associated Cartan equivalence problem and find the invariants of the snake's CR structure.</description>

      <title>Dimension Reductions in Instanton Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dimension reduction of instantons over product manifolds with calibrated factors. We first prove an integrability result that relates dimension reduction with curvature conditions. Then we find a topological criterion for bundles over product manifolds to admit instantons that satisfy the aforementioned curvature conditions; in particular, pull-back bundles satisfy this criterion. Consequently, we deduce explicit descriptions for the moduli space of Hermitian Yang--Mills connections, G2-, and Spin(7)-instantons in various contexts, and establish well-behaved compactifications for these moduli spaces when one factor of the product manifold is a hyperk\"ahler surface.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show the existence of some special coordinate systems for expressing maps with branch points. These coordinates allow obtaining an explicit representation formula of branch immersions and understanding the regularity of some fundamental elements in the theory of R. D. Gulliver, R. Osserman and H. L. Royden. For conformal maps, we prove that these coordinates exist with certain regularity if and only if the mean curvature vector extends and is in a particular H\"older space. In the general case, we characterize this type of coordinate system. Also, using these coordinates, we study the regularity and behavior of curvatures near branch points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we are interested in studying Serrin's overdetermined problems in Riemannian manifolds. For manifolds endowed with a conformal vector field, we prove a Pohozoaev-type identity to show a Serrin's type rigidity result using the P-function approach introduced by Weinberger. We proceed with a conformal change to achieve this goal, starting from a geometric Pohozaev identity due to Schoen. Moreover, we obtain a symmetry result for the associated Dirichlet problem by using a generalized normalized wall shear stress bound.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study quantitative stability results for different classes of Sobolev inequalities on general compact Riemannian manifolds. We prove that, up to constants depending on the manifold, a function that nearly saturates a critical Sobolev inequality is quantitatively $W^{1,2}$-close to a non-empty set of extremal functions, provided that the corresponding optimal Sobolev constant satisfies a suitable strict bound. The case of sub-critical Sobolev inequalities is also covered. Finally, we discuss degenerate phenomena in our quantitative controls.</description>

      <title>2-torsion in instanton Floer homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the existence of $2$-torsion in instanton Floer homology with $\mathbb{Z}$ coefficients for closed $3$-manifolds and singular knots. First, we show that the non-existence of $2$-torsion in the framed instanton Floer homology $I^\sharp(S_n^3(K);\mathbb{Z})$ of any nonzero integral $n$-surgery along a knot $K$ in $S^3$ would imply that $K$ is fibered. Also, we show that $I^\sharp(S_{r}^3(K);\mathbb{Z})$ for any nontrivial $K$ with $r=1,1/2,1/4$ always has $2$-torsion. These two results indicate that the existence of $2$-torsion is expected to be a generic phenomenon for Dehn surgeries along knots. Second, we show that for genus-one knots with nontrivial Alexander polynomials and for unknotting-number-one knots, the unreduced singular instanton knot homology $I^\sharp(S^3,K;\mathbb{Z})$ always has $2$-torsion. Finally, some crucial lemmas that help us demonstrate the existence of $2$-torsion are motivated by analogous results in Heegaard Floer theory, which may be of independent interest. In particular, we show that, for a knot $K$ in $S^3$, if there is a nonzero rational number $r$ such that the dual knot $\widetilde{K}_r$ inside $S^3_r(K)$ is Floer simple, then $S^3_r(K)$ must be an L-space and $K$ must be an L-space knot.</description>

Abstract: A regular semisimple Hessenberg variety $\mathrm{Hess}(S,h)$ is a smooth subvariety of the full flag variety $\mathrm{Fl}(\mathbb{C}^n)$ associated with a regular semisimple matrix $S$ of order $n$ and a function $h$ from $\{1,2,\dots,n\}$ to itself satisfying a certain condition. We show that when $\mathrm{Hess}(S,h)$ is connected and not the entire space $\mathrm{Fl}(\mathbb{C}^n)$, the reductive part of the identity component $\mathrm{Aut}^0(\mathrm{Hess}(S,h))$ of the automorphism group $\mathrm{Aut}(\mathrm{Hess}(S,h))$ of $\mathrm{Hess}(S,h)$ is an algebraic torus of dimension $n-1$ and $\mathrm{Aut}(\mathrm{Hess}(S,h))/\mathrm{Aut}^0(\mathrm{Hess}(S,h))$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of $\mathfrak{S}_n$ or $\mathfrak{S}_n\rtimes \{\pm 1\}$, where $\mathfrak{S}_n$ is the symmetric group of degree $n$. As a byproduct of our argument, we show that $\mathrm{Aut}(X)/\mathrm{Aut}^0(X)$ is a finite group for any projective GKM manifold $X$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate Ruelle-Pollicott resonances of Anosov diffeomorphisms with respect to the measure of maximal entropy. We highlight a profound connection between resonances and eigenvalues of the action induced by the dynamics on de Rham cohomology. We finally exploit this relation to get information about the Ruelle-Pollicott asymptotics of the correlation function and establish a cohomological bound for the speed of mixing of Anosov diffeomorphisms.</description>

      <title>Smoothing effects and extinction in finite time for fractional fast diffusions on Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study nonnegative solutions to the Cauchy problem for the Fractional Fast Diffusion Equation on a suitable class of connected, noncompact Riemannian manifolds. This parabolic equation is both singular and nonlocal: the diffusion is driven by the (spectral) fractional Laplacian on the manifold, while the nonlinearity is a concave power makes the diffusion singular, so that solutions lose mass and may extinguish in finite time. Existence of mild solutions follows by nowadays standard nonlinear semigroups techniques, and we use these solutions as the building blocks for a more general class of so-called weak dual solutions, which allow for data both in the usual $L^1$ space and in a larger weighted space, determined in terms of the fractional Green function. We focus in particular on a priori smoothing estimates (also in weighted $L^p$ spaces) for a quite large class of weak dual solutions. We also show pointwise lower bounds for solutions, showing in particular that solutions have infinite speed of propagation. Finally, we start the study of how solutions extinguish in finite time, providing suitable sharp extinction rates.</description>

      <title>Statistical conformal Killing Vector Fields for FLRW Space-Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classification of conformal Killing vector fields for FLRW space-time from Riemannian point of view was done by Maartens-Maharaj in \cite{Maartens1986}. In this paper, we introduce conformal Killing vector fields from a new point of view for the FLRW space-time. In particular, we consider three cases for the conformal factor. Then, it is shown that there exist nine conformal vector fields on FLRW in total, such that six of them are Killing and the rest being non-Killing conformal vector fields. Consequently, by recalling the concept of statistical conformal Killing vector fields introduced in \cite{SP}, we classify statistical structures with repsect to which these vector fields are conformal Killing. We also obtain the form of affine connections that feature a vanishing Lie derivative with respect to these conformal Killing vector fields. Imposing the torsion-free and the Codazzi conditions on these connections, we study statistical structures on FLRW. Finally, for torsionful connections we study the vanishing of the Lie derivative of the torsion tensor with respect to these conformal Killing vector fields and derive the conditions under which this is valid.</description>

Abstract: In a remarkable series of works, Guo, Phong, Song, and Sturm have obtained key uniform estimates for the Green's functions associated with certain K\"ahler metrics. In this note, we broaden the scope of their techniques by removing one of their assumptions and allowing the complex structure to vary. We apply our results to various families of canonical K\"ahler metrics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.02389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that in a closed Riemannian manifold with dimension between $3$ and $7$, either there are minimal hypersurfaces with arbitrarily large area, or there exist uncountably many stable minimal hypersurfaces. Moreover, the latter case has a very pathological Cantor set structure which does not show up in certain manifolds. Among the applications, we prove that there exist minimal hypersurfaces with arbitrarily large area in analytic manifolds. In the proof, we use the Almgren-Pitts min-max theory proposed by Marques-Neves, the ideas developed by Song in his proof of Yau's conjecture, and the resolution of the generic multiplicity-one conjecture by Zhou.</description>

Abstract: We identify all metrics on a closed $n$-manifold with their Nash isometric embeddings into a standard sphere of large, but fixed dimension, and use the Palais' isotopic extension theorem to identify their deformations with the isotopic deformations of their embeddings, the deformations of metrics in a conformal class identified with their corresponding isotopic conformal deformations. If $n\geq 3$, we characterize metrics of constant scalar curvature in terms of properties of extrinsic quantities of their associated embeddings, and prove that any metric on the manifold of constant positive scalar curvature, which can be minimally embedded into this background sphere, is a Yamabe metric in its conformal class. We then use Simons' gap theorem to study the extrinsic quantities of almost complex Hermitian deformations, by Yamabe metrics, of the standard minimal almost complex isometric embeddings of $\mb{S}^6$, $\mb{S}^2 \times \mb{S}^4$, $\mb{S}^2\times\mb{S}^6$, and $\mb{S}^6\times \mb{S}^6$, respectively, and prove that none of these manifolds carry integrable almost complex structures.

We provide a partial compactification of the moduli space of pointed ALH*-gravitational instantons with respect to the pointed Gromov-Hausdorff topology and locally is a polyhedron complex.</description>

      <title>On some manifolds with positive sigma invariants and their realizing conformal classes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05123v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the metric of the Riemannian product $(\mb{S}^k(r_1)\times \mb{S}^{n-k}(r_2), g^n_k)$, $r_1^2+r_2^2=1$, is a Yamabe metric in its conformal class if, and only if, either $g^n_k$ is Einstein, or the linear isometric embedding of this manifold into the standard $n+1$ dimensional sphere is minimal. We combine this result with Simons' gap theorem to show that, for $2\leq k\leq n-2$, the conformal class of the product metric with minimal embedding, which is at the upper end of Simons' gap theorem, realizes the sigma invariant of $\mb{S}^k\times \mb{S}^{n-k}$, and that this is the only class that achieves such a value. Similarly, we use coherent minimal isometric embeddings of suitably scaled standard Einstein metrics $g$ on $\mb{P}^n(\mb{R})$, $\mb{P}^n(\mb{C})$, and $\mb{P}^n(\mb{H})$ into unit spheres, and determine the sigma invariant of these projective spaces, prove that in each case the conformal class $[g]$ realizes it, and that this realizing class is unique.</description>

Abstract: We prove that every complete, minimally immersed submanifold $f\: M^n \to \mathbb{S}^{n+p}$ whose second fundamental form satisfies $|A|^2 \le np/(2p-1)$, is either totally geodesic, or (a covering of) a Clifford torus or a Veronese surface in $\mathbb{S}^4$, thereby extending the well-known results by Simons, Lawson and Chern, do Carmo &amp; Kobayashi from compact to complete $M^n$. We also obtain the corresponding result for complete hypersurfaces with nonvanishing constant mean curvature, due to Alencar &amp; do Carmo in the compact case, under the optimal bound on the umbilicity tensor. In dimension $n \le 6$, a pinching theorem for complete higher-codimensional submanifolds with non-vanishing parallel mean curvature is proved, partly generalizing previous work of Santos. Our approach is inspired by the conformal method of Fischer-Colbrie, Shen &amp; Ye and Catino, Mastrolia &amp; Roncoroni.</description>

      <title>Flow by Gauss Curvature to the Orlicz Minkowski Problem for q-torsional rigidity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Minkowski problem for torsional rigidity ($2$-torsional rigidity) was firstly studied by Colesanti and Fimiani \cite{CA} using variational method. Moreover, Hu, Liu and Ma \cite{HJ00} also studied this problem by method of curvature flows and obtain the existence of smooth even solutions. In addition, the Minkowski problem for $2$-torsional rigidity was also extended to $L_p$ version and Orlicz version.
  Recently, Hu and Zhang \cite{HJ2} introduced the concept of Orlicz mixed $q$-torsional rigidity and obtained Orlicz $q$-torsional measure through the variational method for $q&gt;1$.Specially, they established the functional Orlicz Brunn-Minkowski inequality and the functional Orlicz Minkowski inequality.
  Motivated by the forgoing works, we can propose the Orlicz Minkowski problem for $q$-torsional rigidity, and then confirm the existence of smooth non-even solutions to the Orlicz Minkowski problem for $q$-torsional rigidity with $q&gt;1$ by method of a Gauss curvature flow.</description>

Abstract: Let $(M, \omega, J)$ be a K\"ahler manifold, equipped with an effective Hamiltonian torus action $\rho: T \rightarrow \mathrm{Diff}(M, \omega, J)$ by isometries with moment map $\mu: M \rightarrow \mathfrak{t}^{*}$. We first construct a singular mixed polarization $\mathcal{P}_{\mathrm{mix}}$ on $M$. Second, we construct a one-parameter family of complex structures $J_{t}$ on $M$ which are compatible with $\omega$. Furthermore, the path of corresponding K\"ahler metrics $g_{t}$ is a complete geodesic ray in the space of K\"ahler metrics of $M$, when $M$ is compact. Finally, we show that the corresponding family of K\"ahler polarizations $\mathcal{P}_{t}$ associated to $J_{t}$ converges to $\mathcal{P}_{\mathrm{mix}}$ as $t \rightarrow \infty$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.04199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A statistic on a statistical model is sufficient if it has no information loss, namely, the Fisher metric of the induced model coincides with that of the original model due to Kullback and Ay-Jost-L\^e-Schwachh\"ofer. We introduce a quantitatively weak version of sufficient statistics such that the Fisher metric of the induced model is bi-Lipschitz equivalent to that of the original model. We characterize such statistics in terms of the conditional probability or by the existence of a certain decomposition of the density function in a way similar to characterizations of sufficient statistics due to Fisher-Neyman and Ay-Jost-L\^e-Schwachh\"ofer.</description>

Abstract: In the spirit of the classical theory for K3 surfaces, we construct a Hausdorff fine moduli space for families of marked K3 surfaces over smooth rational curves in the K3 period domain. This moduli space admits an \'etale holomorphic map to the parameter space for such rational curves, which assumes the role of a period space for this moduli problem. Over an open subset containing all twistor cycles, we construct a family of such families that is a universal small deformation for every twistor family. Finally, small deformations of K3 twistor families are shown to induce complex-hyperk\"ahler metrics on members of the families via the original complex version of Penrose's Non-linear Graviton construction. This answers a question posed independently by Fels--Huckleberry--Wolf and Looijenga. Generalizations to higher-dimensional irreducible holomorphic-symplectic manifolds are studied throughout.</description>

      <title>The Ambient Space Formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03820v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new formalism to solve the kinematical constraints due to Weyl invariance for CFTs in curved backgrounds and/or non-trivial states, and we apply it to thermal CFTs and to CFTs on squashed spheres. The ambient space formalism is based on constructing a class of geometric objects that are Weyl covariant and identifying them as natural building blocks of correlation functions. We construct (scalar) $n$-point functions and we illustrate the formalism with a detailed computation of 2-point functions. We compare our results for thermal 2-point functions with results that follow from thermal OPEs and holographic computations, finding exact agreement. In our holographic computation we also obtain the OPE coefficient of the leading double-twist contribution, and we discuss how the double-twist coefficients may be computed from the multi-energy-momentum contributions, given knowledge of the analytic structure of the correlator. The 2-point function for the CFT on squashed spheres is a new result. We also discuss the relation of our work to flat holography.</description>

      <title>On ergodic properties of geodesic flows on uniform visibility manifolds without conjugate points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study on ergodic properties of the geodesic flow on a $C^\infty$ uniform visibility manifold $M$ without conjugate points. If $M$ is a closed surface of genus at least two without conjugate points, and with continuous Green bundles and bounded asymptote, we study the geometric properties of singular geodesics and show that if all singular geodesics are closed, then there are at most finitely many isolated singular closed geodesics and finitely many generalized strips. In particular, the geodesic flow is ergodic with respect to Liouville measure under the above assumption.
  Let $(M,g)$ be a closed uniform visibility manifold without conjugate points and $X$ its universal cover. Under the entropy gap assumption, the geodesic flow has a unique measure of maximal entropy (MME for short) by \cite[Theorem 1.2]{MR}. We develop a Patterson-Sullivan construction of this unique MME and show that it has local product structure, is fully supported, and has the Bernoulli property.
  If we assume further that $M$ has continuous Green bundles and the geodesic flow has a hyperbolic periodic point, using the nonuniform hyperbolic structure on an open dense subset and the symbolic approach developed in \cite{LP}, we show that for any H\"{o}lder continuous function, the equilibrium state is unique under the pressure gap condition.
  Under the same conditions above, we apply the mixing properties of the MME to count the number of free-homotopy classes containing a closed geodesic, as well as the volume asymptotics of Riemannian balls in the universal cover. We then obtain some rigidity results involving the Margulis function.
  Finally, for a uniform visibility manifold $M=X/\Gamma$ (not necessarily compact) without conjugate points, we show that if $\Gamma$ is non-elementary and contains an expansive isometry, then the Hopf-Tsuji-Sullivan dichotomy holds.</description>
