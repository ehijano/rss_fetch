      <title>Barrow Holographic Dark Energy in f (Q, T) gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present analysis, we explore a new version of dark energy called Barrow holographic dark energy within the framework modified gravity called $f(Q,T)$ gravity by adopting the simple homogeneous, isotropic, and spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) model of the universe. Our goal is to understand how the universe evolved over time. To do this, we use parameterizetion of Hubble's parameter method. We then use a powerful tool called Monte Carlo Markov Chain to find the best values for the constants in our formula. We do this by comparing our formula to actual data from observations of the universe. Once we have the best values for the constants, we calculate other important parameters that describe the universe's evolution. These include: Deceleration parameter which measures how quickly the expansion is slowing down. We found $q_0 = -0.601^{+0.0131}_{-0.0131}$. Equation of state parameter to measures the properties of dark energy. We find $\omega_0 = -0.7018^{+0.0101}_{-0.0101}$. We also study the stability and energy conditions along with the state-finder and $O_m(z)$-parameter of our model to ensure it's consistent with our understanding of the universe.</description>

      <title>The Stability of Anisotropic Compact Stars Influenced by Dark Matter under Teleparallel Gravity: An Extended Gravitational Deformation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our investigation, we pioneer the development of geometrically deformed strange stars within the framework of $f(\mathcal{T})$ gravity theory through gravitational decoupling via the complete geometric deformation (CGD) technique. The significant finding is the precise solution for deformed strange star (SS) models achieved through the vanishing complexity factor scenario. Further, we introduce the concept of space-time deformation caused by dark matter (DM) content in DM haloes, leading to perturbations in the metric potentials $g_{tt}$ and $g_{rr}$ components. Mathematically, this DM-induced deformation is achieved through the CGD method, where the decoupling parameter $\alpha$ governs the extent of DM influence. To validate our findings, we compare our model predictions with observational constraints, including GW190814 (with a mass range of $2.5-2.67 M_{\odot}$) and neutron stars (NSTRs) such as EXO 1785-248 [mass=$1.3_{-0.2}^{+0.2}~M_{\odot}$], 4U 1608-52 [mass=$1.74_{-0.14}^{+0.14}~M_{\odot}$], and PSR J0952-0607 [mass=$2.35_{-0.17}^{+0.17}~M_{\odot}$]. Our investigation delves into the stability of the model by considering causality conditions, Herrera's Cracking Method, the adiabatic index, and the Harrison-Zeldovich-Novikov criterion. We demonstrate that the developed model mimics a wide range of recently observed pulsars. To emphasize its compatibility, we highlight the predicted mass and radius in tabular form by varying both the parameters $\alpha$ and $\zeta_1$. Notably, our findings are consistent with the observation of gravitational waves from the first binary merger event. Furthermore, we compare our results with those obtained for a slow-rotating configuration. In addition to this, we discuss the moment of inertia using the Bejger-Haensel approach in this formulation.</description>

      <title>GUP corrected Casimir Wormholes with Electric Charge in $f(R,L_m)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we study and investigate the effects of the Generalised Uncertainty Principle (GUP) and electric charge on Casimir wormhole geometry in the Curvature-Lagrangian coupled $f(R,L_m)$ gravity. The functional form of the considered model is $f(R,L_m)=\frac{R}{2\kappa}+L_m^{\,\,\alpha}$, corresponding to it the analytic shape function is found. For our analysis, we study the wormhole spacetimes for three particular models for the redshift function. We observe that the null energy condition is violated despite a positive contribution from the electromagnetic energy density. We also note that electric charges, GUP effects, and higher model parameter values increase the throat length. Further, we have studied the deflection of light using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, emphasizing the contribution from GUP by including higher-order terms.</description>

      <title>A model independent approach to the study of structure growth in $f(R)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last decade, much attention has been given to the study of modified gravity theories to find a more natural explanation for the late-time acceleration of the Universe. Particular attention has focused on the so-called $f(R)$ dark energy models. Instead of focusing on a particular f(R) model, we present a completely model-independent approach to study the background dynamics and the growth of matter density perturbations for those f(R) models that mimic the $\Lambda$CDM evolution at the background level. We do this by characterising the dynamics of the gravitational field using a set of dimensionless variables and using cosmography to determine the expansion history. We then illustrate the integrity of this method by fixing the cosmography to be the same as an exact $\Lambda$CDM model, allowing us to test the solution. We compare the exact evolution of the density contrast and growth index with what one obtains from various levels of the quasi-static approximation, without choosing the form of $f(R)$ dark energy.</description>

      <title>Secondary Gravitational Waves in Non-local Starobinsky inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how infinite derivative modifications of gravity impact on the stochastic background of Gravitational Waves from early Universe. The generic property of the ghost-free theory fixed on Minkowski space-time is the emergence of an infinite number of complex mass states when other classical backgrounds are considered. These additional states are shown to enhance the power spectrum of scalar perturbations generated during inflation. Current and future space-based and terrestrial interferometers offer indirect testing methods for the infinite derivative gravity action, enabling the exploration of new parameter spaces. In particular, we identify unconventional blue-tilted Gravitational Wave spectra, presenting a novel approach for testing infinite derivative quantum gravity in the future.</description>

      <title>Optical Properties and Thermal Geometries of Hot NUT-Kerr-Newman-Kasuya-AdS Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to studying the optical and thermal geometrical properties of Hot, NUT-KerrNewman-Kasuya-AdS black hole (BH). This BH is characterized by the NUT charge and a parameter Q that comprises the electric and magnetic charge. We compute the image of the BH shadow in two types: 1) at infinity, 2) at specific limit by analytical approach. We also investigate the effect of Nut, spin, inclination angle, and cosmological constant on the shape of shadow. We analyze that for type 1, the shadow in increasing for higher values of NUT charge, the cosmological constant, rotation parameters, and inclination angle, while for type 2, by increasing these parameters, the circular symmetry of the image of the BH shadow variate. Moreover, we discuss well-known thermal geometries such as Weinhold, Ruppeiner, HPEM, and Quevedo case I &amp; II spacetime. It is found that Ruppeiner , HPEM and Quevedo (II) formulations provide physical information about the microscopic structure as compared to Weinhold and Quevedo (I) geometries of Hot NUT-Kerr-Newman-Kasuya-AdS BH. Our findings provides distinctive characteristics in the shadow and thermal geometries of this BH as compare to other BH types.</description>

      <title>Elementary derivation of the Kerr metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main aim of this paper is to simplify and popularise the construction from the 2013 paper by Apostolov, Calderbank, and Gauduchon, which (among other things) derives the Plebanski-Demianski family of solutions of GR using ideas of complex geometry. The starting point of this construction is the observation that the Euclidean versions of these metrics should have two different commuting complex structures, as well as two commuting Killing vector fields. After some linear algebra, this leads to an ansatz for the metrics, which is half-way to their complete determination. Kerr metric is a special 2-parameter subfamily in this class, which makes these considerations directly relevant to Kerr as well. This results in a derivation of the Kerr metric that is self-contained and elementary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a novel set of asymptotically flat wormhole solutions within the framework of $f(R,T)$ theory of gravity. Considering a linear
  $f(R,T)=R+ 2\lambda T$ form, we show that a wide variety of wormhole solutions with asymptotically linear equation of state exist. Our solutions satisfy all the energy conditions, namely the null, weak, strong and dominant energy conditions. The relationship between free parameters in the shape function and boundary conditions is analyzed.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we calculated the emission rate of magnetized particles passing through the event horizon of the Bardeen black hole by using the Parikh-Wilczek method. The emission spectrum deviates from the pure thermal spectrum, but conforms to the unitary principle of quantum mechanics. Our results support the conservation of information.</description>

      <title>A new quantization scheme of black holes in effective loop quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Loop quantum cosmology has achieved great successes, in which the polymerization plays a crucial role. In particular, the phase-space-variable dependent polymerization turns out to be the unique one that leads to consistent quantization of the homogeneous and isotropic universe. However, when applying the same scheme to the quantization of black holes, it meets resistances. In this paper, we continue to study the quantum effects of the polymerization near the location that a classical black hole horizon used to exist, from the point of view of effective loop quantum gravity. In particular, we find a phase-space-variable dependent polymerization scheme that leads to negligible quantum effects near the location of the classical black hole horizon, but significantly alters the spacetime structure near the origin, so that the classical singularity is finally replaced by a finite and regular transition surface. The final geodesically-complete spacetime consists of a regular transition surface that connects a black hole in one side and an anti-trapped region in the other side. In the anti-trapped region, no white hole horizons are found and the spacetime is extended to infinity, at which the geometric radius of the two-spheres becomes infinitely large.</description>

      <title>Black Holes, Warp Drives, and Energy Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following the work of H. Ellis, we study warp drives in the gravitational field of a Schwarzschild black hole. We find that as long as the warp drive crosses the black hole horizon at a subluminal speed, the horizon would be effectively absent inside the warp bubble. Moreover, we discover that the black hole's gravitational field can alleviate the violations of the weak energy condition (WEC) and the null energy condition (NEC) and therefore decrease the amount of negative energy required to sustain a warp drive, which may be instrumental for creating microscopic warp drives in lab experiments. We also consider the thermodynamics of a warp bubble interacting with a black hole and point out some paradoxes that may indicate a gap in our understanding of them from the thermodynamic point of view.</description>

      <title>Eccentric features in the gravitational wave phase of dynamically formed black hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the gravitational wave (GW) phase shift arising from R{\o}mer delay in binary black hole (BBH) mergers formed dynamically in three-body systems, where both the inner orbit of the merging binary and the outer orbit are eccentric. We provide a semi-analytical model and several analytical approximations that allow for fast evaluation of both the temporal evolution and the maximum value of the phase shift. The highest phase shifts occur when the binary merges close to the pericentre of the outer orbit, and can in this case be orders-of-magnitude larger compared to the circular limit. At high outer orbit eccentricities, the orbital curvature leaves distinct imprints onto the phase shift if the binary passes the outer pericentre during its inspiral. By comparing with phase-shifts measured in numerical chaotic 3-body scatterings, we show that our model accurately describes the observed phase of dynamically assembled binary systems in realistic astrophysical scenarios, providing a way to directly determine their formation channel via single GW observations.</description>

      <title>On the interactions and equilibrium between Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the interactions and the conditions for the equilibrium of forces between generic non-rotating black holes of the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton (EMD) theory. We study known (and some new) solutions of the time-symmetric initial-data problem escribing an arbitrary number of those black holes, some of them with primary scalar hair. We show how one can distinguish between initial data corresponding to dynamical situations in which the black holes (one or many) are not in equilibrium and initial data which are just constant-time slices of a static solution of the full equations of motion describing static black holes using (self-)interaction energies. For a single black hole, non-vanishing self-interaction energy is always related to primary scalar hair and to a dynamical black hole. Removing the self-interaction energies in multi-center solutions we get interaction energies related to the attractive and repulsive forces acting on the black holes. As shown by Brill and Lindquist, for widely separated black holes, these take the standard Newtonian and Coulombian forms plus an additional interaction term associated with the scalar charges which is attractive for like charges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the theory of a higher-derivative (HD) real scalar field $\phi$ coupled to a complex scalar $\sigma$, the coupling of the $\phi$ and $\sigma$ being given by two types, $\lambda_{\sigma\phi}\sigma^\dagger \sigma\phi^{2}$ and $\xi_{\sigma\phi}\sigma^\dagger \sigma\left(\partial_{\mu}\phi\right)^{2}$. We evaluate $\phi$ one-loop corrections $\delta V(\sigma)$ to the effective potential of $\sigma$, both the contribution from the positive norm part of $\phi$ and that from the {\it negative norm part} (ghost). We show that $\delta V(\sigma_{\rm cl})$ at $\sigma_{\rm cl}\to \infty$, where $\sigma_{\rm cl}$ is a classical value of $\sigma$, is positive, implying the stability of $\delta V(\sigma_{\rm cl})$ by the HD 1-loop radiative corrections at high energy.</description>

      <title>Parity-breaking galaxy 4-point function from lensing by chiral gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent searches for parity breaking in the galaxy four-point correlation function, as well as the prospects for greatly improved sensitivity to parity breaking in forthcoming surveys, motivate the search for physical mechanisms that could produce such a signal. Here we show that a parity-violating galaxy four-point correlation function may be induced by lensing by a chiral gravitational-wave background. We estimate the amplitude of a signal that would be detectable with a current galaxy survey, taking into account constraints to the primordial gravitational-wave-background amplitude. We find that this mechanism is unlikely to produce a signal large enough to be seen with a galaxy survey but note that it may come within reach with future 21cm observations.</description>

      <title>Holographic Gubser flow: A combined analytic and numerical study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gubser flow is an evolution with cylindrical and boost symmetries, which can be best studied by mapping the future wedge of Minkowski space (R$^{3,1}$) to dS$_3$ $\times$ $\mathbb{R}$ in a conformal relativistic theory. Here, we sharpen our previous analytic results and validate them via the first numerical exploration of the Gubser flow in a holographic conformal field theory.
  Remarkably, the leading generic behavior at large de Sitter time is free-streaming in transverse directions and the sub-leading behavior is that of a color glass condensate. We also show that Gubser flow can be smoothly glued to the vacuum outside the future Minkowski wedge generically given that the energy density vanishes faster than any power when extrapolated to early proper time or to large distances from the central axis. We find that at intermediate times the ratio of both the transverse and longitudinal pressures to the energy density converge approximately to a fixed point which is hydrodynamic only for large initial energy densities. We argue that our results suggest that the Gubser flow is better applied to collective behavior in jets rather than the full medium in the phenomenology of heavy ion collisions and can reveal new clues to the mechanism of confinement.</description>

      <title>Are long gamma-ray bursts progenitors to merging binary black holes?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The distribution of delay times between the formation of binary black hole (BBH) progenitors and their gravitational-wave (GW) merger provides important clues about their unknown formation histories. When inferring the delay time distribution, it is typically assumed that BBH progenitor formation traces the star formation rate (SFR). In this work, we consider the rate of long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) instead of the SFR. LGRBs are thought to correspond to the formation of (possibly spinning) black holes, and may therefore be related to the population of BBH progenitors. By comparing the redshift evolution of the LGRB rate as inferred by Ghirlanda &amp; Salvaterra (2022) and the BBH merger rate inferred by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) observations, we find that the delay time distribution between LGRBs and BBH mergers is well-described by a power law with minimum delay time $10$ Myr and slope $\alpha ={-0.96}^{+0.64}_{-0.85}$ (90\% credibility). This matches theoretical predictions for the BBH delay time distribution, which in turns lends support to the hypothesis that LGRBs trace BBH progenitor formation. However, comparing the absolute rates of these two populations, we find that at most $f = {0.04}^{+0.18}_{-0.03}$ of LGRBs may evolve into merging BBH. We also consider the possibility that LGRBs only produce BBH systems with large aligned spins (with effective inspiral spin $\chi_\mathrm{eff} &gt; 0.2$). In this case, we find $f = {0.003}^{+0.011}_{-0.002}$ and the delay time distribution favors the steepest power law slopes we consider ($\alpha = -2$).</description>

      <title>The 230 GHz Variability of Numerical Models of Sagittarius A* II. The Physical Origins of the Variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explored in Chan et al. 2024 how the ion-electron temperature ratio affects certain numerical models of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*). Specifically, we studied these effects in magnetic-dominated regions in magnetic-arrested disk (MAD), focusing on the $3$-hour variability at $230$ GHz -- $M_{\Delta T}$. In this study, we investigate how variations in electron temperature prescription parameter, $R_{\rm Low}$, influence $M_{\Delta T}$ by analyzing a series of general-relativistic raytracing (GRRT) snapshots. In certain black hole models with a spin $a &gt; 0$, we discover that increasing $R_{\rm Low}$ renders the photon ring more optically thick, obscuring the varying accretion flows that contribute to the variability. However, as $R_{\rm Low}$ increases further, MAD flux eruptions become more pronounced, compensating for the decrease in $M_{\Delta T}$. For models with a spin $a &lt; 0$, although a higher $R_{\rm Low}$ also increases the optical thickness of the fluid, voids within the optically thick gas fail to cover the entire photon ring. Similarly, flux eruptions are more prominent as $R_{\rm Low}$ increases further, contributing to the observed rise in $M_{\Delta T}$ against $R_{\rm Low}$. For black holes with $a \approx 0$, although the effect of increasing optical depth is still present, their $230$ GHz light curves and hence $M_{\Delta T}$ are insensitive to the changes in $R_{\rm Low}$. Furthermore, we find that the variability of the $230$ GHz light curves at $R_{\rm Low} = 1$ correlates with fluctuations in the internal energy of the gas near the black hole, indicating that unusual gas heating may be the source of significant $M_{\Delta T}$ seen in simulations. Our findings highlight potential approaches for refining $M_{\Delta T}$ to better align with observations when modelling Sgr A* or other low-luminosity active galactic nuclei.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the possibility of accommodating both early and late-time tensions using a novel reinforcement learning technique. By applying this technique, we aim to optimize the evolution of the Hubble parameter from recombination to the present epoch, addressing both tensions simultaneously. To maximize the goodness of fit, our learning technique achieves a fit that surpasses even the $\Lambda$CDM model. Our results demonstrate a tendency to weaken both early and late time tensions in a completely model-independent manner.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note we study nonequilibrium fluctuations in gravitational algebras within de Sitter space. An essential aspect of this study is quantum measurement theory, which allows us to access the dynamical fluctuations of observables via a two-point measurement scheme. Using this formalism, we establish specific fluctuation theorems. Additionally, we demonstrate that quantum channels are represented by subfactors, using the relationship between measurement theory and quantum channels. We also comment on implementing a quantum channel using Jones' theory of subfactors.</description>

      <title>Weyl-Einsteinian-Cubic Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a Weyl-gauging of strongly coupled Einsteinian-Cubic gravity (ECG) in Weyl's geometry via upgraded Weyl's curvature tensors, which include abelian gauge fields, and properly tuned compensating real scalar fields. The model is free from any dimensionful parameters. The bare ECG emerges as the lower energy limit of the Weyl-ECG in the local non-conformal-invariant vacua (i.e., broken phase) in the maximally symmetric spacetimes fixing the vacuum expectation value of the scalar field to the Planck mass scale. Here, the natural presence of (anti-) de Sitter backgrounds spontaneously breaks Weyl's local conformal symmetry akin to the Higgs mechanism, while it is radiatively broken at the renormalization scale at the one-loop level in flat vacua through the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism. The model allows anti-de Sitter and flat spaces but does not allow de Sitter to be vacuum spacetime solutions. The properties of the model deserve further exploration, specifically, those of nonperturbative (e.g., instantons and/or anti-instantons) contributions, for example, in the resurgence or tachyon condensation context requires detailed study.</description>

      <title>Expanding covariant cosmography of the local Universe: incorporating the snap and axial symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studies show that the model-independent, fully non-perturbative covariant cosmographic approach is suitable for analyzing the local Universe $(z\lesssim 0.1)$. However, accurately characterizing large and inhomogeneous mass distributions requires the fourth-order term in the redshift expansion of the covariant luminosity distance $d_L(z,\boldsymbol{n})$. We calculate the covariant snap parameter $\mathbb{S}$ and its spherical harmonic multipole moments using the matter expansion tensor and the evolution equations for lightray bundles. The fourth-order term adds 36 degrees of freedom, since the highest independent multipole of the snap is the 32-pole (dotriacontapole) $(\ell=5)$. Including this term helps to de-bias estimations of the covariant deceleration parameter. Given that observations suggest axially symmetric anisotropies in the Hubble diagram for $z \lesssim 0.1$ and theory shows that only a subset of multipoles contributes to the signal, we demonstrate that only 12 degrees of freedom are needed for a model-independent description of the local universe. We use an analytical axisymmetric model of the local Universe, with data that matches the Zwicky Transient Facility survey, in order to provide a numerical example of the amplitude of the snap multipoles and to forecast precision.</description>

Abstract: We study the supersymmetric structure of the spin current in four dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric theories. By coupling the stress tensor multiplet to a vierbein multiplet we identify a spin current with the Hodge dual of the bottom component of the stress tensor multiplet in a wide range of theories. This implies that in holographic theories the Hodge dual of the $R$ current may serve as a spin current, paving the way for holographic studies of theories with background torsion.</description>

      <title>Higher-order effects in the dynamics of hierarchical triple systems. II. Second-order and dotriacontapole-order effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the long-term evolution of hierarchical triple systems in Newtonian gravity to second order in the quadrupolar perturbation parameter, and to sixth order in $\epsilon = a/A$, the ratio of the semimajor axes of the inner and outer orbits. We apply the ``two-timescale'' method from applied mathematics to the Lagrange Planetary Equations for the inner and outer orbits, in which each osculating orbit element is split into an orbit averaged part that evolves on the long perturbative timescale, and an ``average-free'' part that is oscillatory in the orbital timescales. Averages over the two orbital timescales are performed using the well-known secular approximation. We also incorporate perturbative corrections to the relation between time and the orbital phases. We place no restrictions on the masses, on the relative orbit inclinations or on the eccentricities, beyond the requirement that the quadrupolar parameter and $\epsilon$ both be small. The result is a complete set of long-timescale evolution equations for the averaged elements of the inner and outer orbits. At first order in perturbation theory, we obtain the dotriacontapole contributions explicitly at order $\epsilon^6$. At second order in perturbation theory, i.e. quadratic in the quadrupole perturbation amplitude, we find contributions that scale as $\epsilon^{9/2}$ (found in earlier work), $\epsilon^{5}$, $\epsilon^{11/2}$, and $\epsilon^{6}$. At first perturbative order and dotriacontapole order, the two averaged semimajor axes are constant in time (and we prove that this holds to arbitrary multipole orders); but at second perturbative order, beginning at $O( \epsilon^{5})$, they are no longer constant. Nevertheless we verify that the total averaged energy of the system is conserved, and we argue that this behavior is not incompatible with classical theorems on secular evolution of the semimajor axes.</description>

      <title>Multidimensionality of the Hubble tension: the roles of $\Omega_m$ and $\omega_c$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hubble tension is inherently multidimensional, and bears important implications for parameters beyond $H_0$. We discuss the key role of the matter density parameter $\Omega_m$ and the physical cold dark matter density $\omega_c$. We argue that once $\Omega_m$ and the physical baryon density $\omega_b$ are calibrated, through Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and/or Type Ia Supernovae (SNeIa) for $\Omega_m$, and via Big Bang Nucleosynthesis for $\omega_b$, any model raising $H_0$ inevitably raises $\omega_c$ and, under minimal assumptions, the clustering parameter $S_8$. We explicitly verify that this behaviour holds when analyzing recent BAO and SNeIa data. We argue that a calibration of $\Omega_m$ which is as reliable and model-independent as possible should be a priority in the Hubble tension discussion, and an interesting possibility in this sense could be represented by galaxy cluster gas mass fraction measurements.</description>

      <title>Higher derivative SVT theories from Kaluza-Klein reductions of Horndeski theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It was recently pointed out that some precise Photon-Galileon couplings in four dimensions (4D) -- inspired by a higher dimensional reduction -- are enough to obtain a Horndeski theory that is less constrained by the stringent experimental bounds on the speed of Gravitational Waves. They imply the constancy of the ratio of speed of gravity to light throughout cosmic evolution. This holds without fine tuning, even if one includes the general $G_4 (\pi,X)$ and $G_5 (\pi)$ scalar potentials. In this paper we go into the details of this 4D Luminal extension of Horndeski theory including its scalar sector. We also present the complete action including the general $G_5(\pi,X),\, G_6(\pi,X)$ scalar potentials. Thus we show all the $U(1)$ gauge invariant vector Galileons in 4D that result from a Kaluza-Klein dimensional reduction from 5D Galileons. They provide a consistent coupling of a higher derivative vector to scalar modifications of gravity - namely, without inducing Ostrogradsky ghosts and keeping gauge invariance- in the aim to explore more universal couplings of dark energy to other matter, such as vectors and in particular the Photon.</description>

Abstract: In this article, it is shown how the extended conformal Einstein field equations and a gauge based on the properties of conformal geodesics can be used to analyse the non-linear stability of de Sitter-like spacetimes with spatial sections of negative scalar curvature. This class of spacetimes admits a smooth conformal extension with a space-like conformal boundary. Central to the analysis is the use of conformal Gaussian systems to obtain a hyperbolic reduction of the conformal Einstein field equations for which standard Cauchy stability results for symmetric hyperbolic systems can be employed. The use of conformal methods allows us to rephrase the question of the global existence of solutions to the Einstein field equations into considerations of finite existence time for the conformal evolution system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.02672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational waves modulate the apparent frequencies of other periodic signals. Low-frequency gravitational waves could therefore be detected by observing frequency modulations in signals from higher-frequency sources, e.g., those from binary white dwarfs detected with the LISA gravitational-wave detector. We propose a concrete method to extract these modulations by coherently adding the cross-spectra of a large number of well-resolved quasi-monochromatic signals. We apply this method to the case of LISA, and find this method would enable the detection of background gravitational wave strain amplitudes of, e.g., $A\simeq10^{-10}$ at a frequency $F\simeq10^{-8}\,\rm Hz$, given current projections for the number and properties of Galactic binary white dwarfs and the sensitivity of the instrument. We also estimate (to within an order of magnitude) that this method could potentially compete with that of current Pulsar Timing Arrays when using signals from binary neutron stars such as those expected to be observed with proposed detectors like DECIGO. Our results show that gravitational-wave detectors could be sensitive at frequencies outside of their designed bandwidth using the same infrastructure, which has the potential to open up unexplored and otherwise inaccessible parts of the gravitational wave spectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.01985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a cosmological model within the framework of symmetric teleparallel gravity, focusing on $f(Q)$ gravity, where $Q$ represents the non-metricity scalar. Utilizing cosmological datasets, we derive an accelerating cosmological model by constraining its free parameters. To achieve this, we determine the parametric form of the Hubble parameter using a well-motivated $f(Q)$ function. Remarkably, all obtained values fall within the range suggested by cosmological observations. By employing the best-fit parameters, we calculate the present geometrical parameters and demonstrate the accelerating behaviour of the Universe. Furthermore, we thoroughly examine the evolutionary behaviours of the Universe, noting that our model converges to the $\Lambda$CDM model at late times. Finally, we investigate the energy conditions and find a violation of the strong energy condition, which could provide a valuable understanding of the nature of dark energy.</description>

      <title>Cosmology in $R^2$-gravity: Effects of a Higher Derivative Scalar Condensate Background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.03803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A well known extension of Einstein General Relativity is the addition of an $R^2$-term, which is free of ghost excitations and in the linearized framework, reduces Einstein General Relativity and an additional higher derivative scalar. According to \cite{Chakraborty:2020ktp}, the above scalar sector can sustain a Time Crystal-like minimum energy state, with non-trivial time dependence. Exploiting previous result that the scalar can sustain modes with periodic time dependence in its lowest energy, we consider this condensate as a source and study the Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmology in this background. The effect of the $R^2$-term is interpreted as a back reaction. A remarkable consequence of the condensate is that, irrespective of open or close geometry of the Universe, for an appropriate choice of parameter window, the condensate can induce a decelerating phase before the accelerated expansion starts and again, in some cases, it can help to avoid the singularity in the deceleration parameter (that is present in conventional FLRW Cosmology).</description>

Abstract: We consider, from a dynamical systems point of view, a trivalent spin network model in Loop Quantum Gravity presenting self-organized criticality (SOC), arising from a spin propagation dynamics. We obtain a partition function for the domains of stability connecting gauge non-invariant avalanches, leading to an entropy formula for the asymptotic SOC state. The microscopic origin of this SOC entropy is therefore given by the excitation-relaxation spin dynamics in the avalanche cycle. The puncturing of TSN edges participating in the avalanche are counted in terms of an ensemble perimeter over the implicit avalanches. By identifying this perimeter with that of an isolated $(2+1)$-dim. black hole horizon, we conjecture that the SOC entropy reduces to the Bekenstein-Hawking perimeter-entropy law for the Ba\~nados, Teitelboim, and Zanelli (BTZ) black hole, by an appropriate adjustment of a potential function based on the thermodynamical formalism of Sinai, Ruelle and Bowen.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics and the Joule-Thomson expansion of dilaton black holes in 2+1 dimensions</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we study thermodynamics and its applications to the static charged dilaton black hole in 2+1 dimensions. We chose the extended phase space where the pressure $P = -\frac{\Lambda}{ 8 \pi}$. There is a number $N$ for the black hole solutions which leads to a class of black holes where $ \frac{2}{3} \leq N &lt; 2$. We noticed that thermodynamic behavior falls into two broad categories: For $\frac{2}{3} \leq N &lt; 1$, the black hole is locally stable for all values of the horizon radius and does not go through phase transitions. For $ 1 \leq N &lt; 2$, small black holes are locally stable and large black holes are not: there is a first order phase transition between small black holes and the thermal AdS space similar to Hawking-Page phase transition. In order to demonstrate the two broad categories, we have focused on $N =1, \frac{2}{3}$ and $N = \frac{6}{7}$ black holes in detail. We computed the first law and the Smarr relations for the black hole and introduced two new thermodynamical parameters in order to satisfy the first law. We computed specific heat capacities, internal energy and free energy for black holes and studied local and global stability of the black hole. We have also studied the Joule-Thomson expansion for the black hole. It is also noted that unlike the charged BTZ black hole, the charged dilaton black hole does not violate the Reverse Isoperimetric Inequality for certain values of parameters of the theory.</description>

      <title>Random pure Gaussian states and Hawking radiation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10562v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A black hole evaporates by Hawking radiation. Each mode of that radiation is thermal. If the total state is nevertheless to be pure, modes must be entangled. Estimating the minimum size of this entanglement has been an important outstanding issue. We develop a new theory of constrained random symplectic transformations, based on that the total state is pure and Gaussian with given marginals. In the random constrained symplectic model we then compute the distribution of mode-mode correlations, from which we bound mode-mode entanglement. Modes of frequency much larger than $\frac{k_B T_{H}(t)}{\hbar}$ are not populated at time $t$ and drop out of the analysis.Among the other modes we find that correlations and hence entanglement between relatively thinly populated modes (early-time high-frequency modes and/or late modes of any frequency) to be strongly suppressed. Relatively highly populated modes (early-time low-frequency modes) can on the other hand be strongly correlated, but a detailed analysis reveals that they are nevertheless very unlikely to be entangled. Our analysis hence establishes that restoring unitarity after a complete evaporation of a black hole does not require any significant quantum entanglement between any pair of Hawking modes. Our analysis further gives exact general expressions for the distribution of mode-mode correlations in random, pure, Gaussian states with given marginals, which may have applications beyond black hole physics.</description>

      <title>On the asymmetric non-canonical braneworld in five dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14693v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Revisiting Einstein's gravitational theory, we build a five-dimensional braneworld. Within this framework, one announces the appearance of symmetric and asymmetric domain walls. Furthermore, it examines the emergent four-dimensional gravity from a theory with non-canonical dynamics. Exploring the physical and mathematical aspects, e.g., brane's energy density and the Kaluza-Klein (KK) spectrum, one verifies that brane splitting is absent in the canonical and non-canonical theories. Additionally, we note the localization of the four-dimensional fluctuation projection on the 3-branes, which ensures the theory's stability. Thereby, one can conclude that the behavior of gravitational perturbations of the domain wall maintains a profile similar to a stable and non-localizable tower of massive modes. In contrast, within the brane core, the matter sector generates new barriers and potential wells, resulting in massive modes with approximately symmetric amplitudes. However, the non-canonical dynamics generate massive modes with asymmetric amplitudes far from the 3-brane.</description>

      <title>Probing Penrose-type singularities in sonic black holes</title>

Abstract: Addressing the general question whether Penrose singularities physically exist inside black holes, we investigate the problem in the context of an analogue system, a flowing laboratory liquid, for which the governing equations are at least in principle known to all relevant scales, and in all regions of the effective spacetime. We suggest to probe the physical phenomena taking place close to the singularity in the interior of a $2+1$D analogue black hole arising from a polytropic, inviscid, irrotational, and axisymmetric steady flow, and propose to this end an experimental setup in a Bose-Einstein condensate. Our study provides concrete evidence, for a well understood dynamical system, that the Einstein equations are not necessary for a singularity to form, demonstrating that Penrose-type spacetime singularities can potentially also exist in non-Einsteinian theories of gravity. Finally, we demonstrate how the singularity is physically avoided in our proposed laboratory setup.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a speculative model exploring the behavior of quantum information for particles entering closed timelike curves (CTCs) in Kerr-Newman spacetime. We apply Gavassino's restoration principle to derive a theoretical framework for cyclic information dynamics within these extreme gravitational environments. Our model focuses specifically on particles that enter CTCs near the inner horizon of a Kerr-Newman black hole, examining how such curves might affect quantum state evolution, entanglement preservation, and information retention.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose two novel models in the framework of $f(Q)$ gravity to explain our accelerated universe, namely the exponential $f(Q)_{EXP}$ model and the hyperbolic tangent $f(Q)_{HT}$ model. The current cosmological electromagnetic observations including the cosmic microwave background anisotropies (CMB), the baryon acoustic oscillations(BAO), the type Ia supernovae (SN) and the direct measurements of H(z), combined with the simulated gravitational-wave data are used to constrain the $f(Q)$ models. We find that the Hubble tension can be significantly alleviated to $1.40\sigma$ level in the $f(Q)_{EXP}$ model. The fitting $\chi^2$ of the $f(Q)_{HT}$ model is $9.75\sigma$ poorer than that of the $f(Q)_{EXP}$ model, implying the $f(Q)_{HT}$ model would be excluded by future gravitational-wave observation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07440v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tunneling processes in de Sitter spacetime are studied by using the stochastic approach. We exploit the Martin-Siggia-Rose-Janssen-de Dominicis (MSRJD) functional integral to obtain the tunneling rate. The applicability conditions of this method are clarified using the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism. In the case of a shallow potential barrier, we reproduce the Hawking-Moss (HM) tunneling rate. Remarkably, in contrast to HM picture, the configuration derived from the MSRJD functional integral satisfies physically natural boundary conditions. We also discuss the case of a steep potential barrier and find an interesting Coleman-de Luccia (CDL) bubble-like configuration. Our results demonstrate how the bubble nucleation process could be described in the stochastic approach. Our method turns out to be useful for investigating various tunneling processes during inflation.</description>

      <title>Imprints of massive black-hole binaries on neighbouring decihertz gravitational-wave sources</title>

Abstract: The most massive black holes in our Universe form binaries at the centre of merging galaxies. The recent evidence for a gravitational-wave (GW) background from pulsar timing may constitute the first observation that these supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) merge. Yet, the most massive SMBHBs are out of reach of interferometric {GW} detectors and are exceedingly difficult to resolve individually with pulsar timing. These limitations call for unexplored strategies to detect individual SMBHBs in the uncharted frequency band $\lesssim10^{-5}\,\rm Hz$ in order to establish their abundance and decipher the coevolution with their host galaxies. Here we show that SMBHBs imprint detectable long-term modulations on GWs from stellar-mass binaries residing in the same galaxy. We determine that proposed deci-Hz GW interferometers sensitive to numerous stellar-mass binaries could uncover modulations from $\sim\mathscr{O}(10^{-1}$ - $10^4)$ SMBHBs with masses $\sim\mathscr{O}(10^7$ - $10^8)\,\rm M_\odot$ out to redshift $z\sim3.5$. This offers a unique opportunity to map the population of SMBHBs through cosmic time, which might remain inaccessible otherwise.</description>

Abstract: We study neutrino spin oscillations while the particles scatter off a rotating black hole surrounded by a thick magnetized accretion disk. Neutrino spin precession is caused by the interaction of the neutrino magnetic moment with the magnetic field in the disk which has both toroidal and poloidal components. Our calculation of the observed neutrino fluxes, accounting for spin oscillations, are based on numerical simulations of the propagation of a great number of incoming test particles using High Performance Parallel Computing. The obtained results significantly improve our previous findings. We briefly discuss the applications for the observations of astrophysical neutrinos.</description>

Abstract: Observations of gravitational waves from binary black hole (BBH) mergers have measured the redshift evolution of the BBH merger rate. The number density of galaxies in the Universe evolves differently with redshift based on their physical properties, such as their stellar masses and star formation rates. In this work we show that the measured population-level redshift distribution of BBHs sheds light on the properties of their probable host-galaxies. We first assume that the hosts of BBHs can be described by a mixture model of galaxies weighted by stellar mass or star formation rate, and find that we can place upper limits on the fraction of mergers coming from a stellar mass weighted sample of galaxies. We then constrain parameters of a physically motivated power-law delay-time distribution using GWTC-3 data, and self-consistently track galaxies in the \textsc{UniverseMachine} simulations with this delay-time model to infer the probable host-galaxies of BBHs over a range of redshifts. We find that the inferred host-galaxy distribution at redshift $z=0.21$ has a median star formation rate $\sim 0.9\,M_\odot\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ and a median stellar mass of $\sim 1.9 \times 10^{10}\,M_\odot$. We also provide distributions for the mean stellar age, halo mass, halo radius, peculiar velocity, and large scale bias associated with the host-galaxies, as well as their absolute magnitudes in the B- and ${ \rm K_s}$-bands. Our results can be used to design optimal electromagnetic follow-up strategies for BBHs, and also to aid the measurement of cosmological parameters using the statistical dark siren method.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Production of Completely Dark Photons with Nonminimal Couplings to Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark photons are a theorized massive spin-1 particle which can be produced via various mechanisms, including cosmological gravitational particle production (GPP) in the early universe. In this work, we extend previous results for GPP of dark photons to include nonminimal couplings to gravity. We find that nonminimal couplings can induce a ghost instability or lead to runaway particle production at high momentum and discuss the constraints on the parameter space such that the theory is free of instabilities. Within the instability-free regime we numerically calculate the particle production and find that the inclusion of nonminimal couplings can lead to an enhancement of the particle number. As a result, GPP of nonminimally coupled dark photons can open the parameter space for production of a cosmological relevant relic density (constituting all or part of the dark matter) as compared to the minimally-coupled theory. These results are independent of the choice of inflation model, which we demonstrate by repeating the analysis for a class of rapid-turn multi-field inflation models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent observations of nearby black hole low-mass X-ray binaries have suggested possible evidence of dark matter density spikes. It has long been established that cold dark matter should form dense spikes around intermediate-mass and supermassive black holes due to adiabatic compression of the surrounding dark matter halo. Lighter black holes formed from stellar collapse, however, are not expected to develop such spikes, and so it is unclear how the stellar-mass black holes in these binaries could have acquired such features. Given that primordial black holes are expected to form ultra-dense dark matter mini-spikes, in this Letter we explore the possibility of a primordial origin for these stellar-mass black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss a situation where a holographic CFT state has multiple semiclassical bulk duals. In our example, a given holographic state has two simple, semiclassical descriptions, one with a closed universe, constructed using the gravitational path integral, and one without a closed universe, constructed using the extrapolate dictionary. This highlights an ambiguity in the AdS/CFT dictionary. We propose various options for resolving this tension although none are perfectly satisfactory. We also discuss what this implies for the black hole interior and the gravitational path integral.</description>
