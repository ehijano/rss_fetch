      <title>The CN matrix of a pure braid projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The CN matrix of an $n$-braid projection $B$ is an $n \times n$ matrix such that each $(i,j)$ entry indicates the number of crossings between $i^{th}$ and $j^{th}$ strands of $B$. In this paper, patterns of an $n \times n$ matrix to be a CN matrix are discussed and the CN matrix of a pure 6-braid projection is characterized. As an application, the OU matrix of a pure 6-braid diagram and the crossing matrix of a positive pure 6-braid are also characterized.</description>

      <title>$\pi_1$-injective bounding and application to 3- and 4-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose a closed oriented $n$-manifold $M$ bounds an oriented $(n+1)$-manifold.It is known that $M$ $\pi_1$-injectively bounds an oriented $(n+1)$-manifold $W$. We prove that $\pi_1(W)$ can be residually finite if $\pi_1(M)$ is, and $\pi_1(W)$ can be finite if $\pi_1(M)$ is. In particular, each closed 3-manifold $M$ $\pi_1$-injectively bounds a 4-manifold with residually finite $\pi_1$, and bounds a 4-manifold with finite $\pi_1$ if $\pi_1(M)$ is finite. Applications to 3- and 4-manifolds are given:
  (1) We study finite group actions on closed 4-manifolds and $\pi_1$-isomorphic cobordism of 3-dimensional lens spaces. Results including: (a) Two lens spaces are $\pi_1$-isomorphic cobordant if and only if there is a degree one map between them. (b) Each spherical 3-manifold $M\ne S^3$ can be realized as the unique non-free orbit type for a finite group action on a closed 4-manifold.
  (2) The minimal bounding index $O_b(M)$ for closed 3-manifolds $M$ are defined, %and bounding Euler charicteristic $\chi_b(M)$. the relations between finiteness of $O_b(M)$ and virtual achirality of aspherical (hyperbolic) $M$ are addressed. We calculate $O_b(M)$ for some lens spaces $M$. Each prime is realized as a minimal bounding index.
  (3) We also discuss some concrete examples:Surface bundle often bound surface bundles, and prime 3-manifolds often virtually bound surface bundles, $W$ bounded by some lens spaces realizing $O_b$ is constructed.</description>

Abstract: We study the structure of a series of groups $\Gamma_n^4$ defined by Kim and Manturov. We show that the groups are finite for all $n \ge 6$ and in fact they are 2-step nilpotent $2$-groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We estimate the asymptotic growth of reciprocal conjugacy classes in Hecke groups using their free product structure and word lengths of reciprocal elements. Our approach is different from other works in this direction and uses tools from basic probability theory.</description>

      <title>Khovanov-Rozansky cycle calculus for bipartite links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bipartite calculus is a direct generalization of Kauffman planar expansion from $N=2$ to arbitrary $N$, applicable to the restricted class of knots which are entirely made of antiparallel lock tangles. Whenever applicable, it allows a straightforward generalization of the Khovanov calculus without a need of the technically complicated matrix factorization used for arbitrary $N$ in the Khovanov-Rozansky (KR) approach. The main object here is the $3^{n}$-dimensional hypercube with $n$ being the number of bipartite vertices. Maps, differentials, complex and Poincar\'e polynomials are straightforward and indeed reproduce the Khovanov-Rozansky polynomials in the known cases. This provides a great simplification of the Khovanov-Rozansky calculus on the bipartite locus, what can make it an accessible tool for the study of superpolynomials.</description>

      <title>Compactifications of strata of differentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04844v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this informal expository note, we quickly introduce and survey compactifications of strata of holomorphic 1-forms on Riemann surfaces, i.e. spaces of translation surfaces. In the last decade, several of these have been constructed, studied, and successfully applied to problems. We discuss relations between their definitions and properties, focusing on the different notions of convergence from a flat geometric perspective.</description>

      <title>Free ribbon lemma for surface-link</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09281v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A free surface-link is a surface-link whose fundamental group is a free group not necessarily meridian-based. Free ribbon lemma says that every free sphere-link in the 4-sphere is a ribbon sphere-link. Four different proofs of Free ribbon lemma are explained. The first proof is done in an earlier paper. The second proof is done by showing that there is an O2-handle basis of a ribbon surface-link. The third proof is done by removing the commuter relations from a Wirtinger presentation of a free group, which a paper on another proof of Free ribbon lemma complements. The fourth proof is given by the special case of the proof of the result that every free surface-link is a ribbon surface-link which is a stabilization of a free ribbon sphere-link. As a consequence, it is shown that a surface-link is a sublink of a free surface-link if and only if it is a stabilization of a ribbon sphere-link.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial p-th Calabi flow for finite and infinite ideal circle patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study of the combinatorial $p$-th Calabi flow for both finite and infinite ideal circle patterns. In the finite case, we establish a sharp criterion: the combinatorial $p$-th Calabi flow with $p&gt;1$ converges if and only if a constant curvature metric exists in the underlying geometric background. In the infinite setting, we prove the long-time existence of solutions to the combinatorial $p$-th Calabi flow for $p \geq 2$, representing a significant advance in the theory of curvature flows on infinite structures.</description>

      <title>Zariski dense non-tempered subgroups in higher rank of nearly optimal growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19551v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct the first example of a Zariski-dense, discrete, non-lattice subgroup $\Gamma_0$ of a higher rank simple Lie group $G$, which is non-tempered in the sense that the quasi-regular representation $L^2(\Gamma_0\backslash G)$ is non-tempered. More precisely, let $n\ge 3$ and let $\Gamma$ be the fundamental group of a closed hyperbolic $n$-manifold that contains a properly embedded totally geodesic hyperplane. We show that there exists a non-empty open subset $\mathcal O$ of $\operatorname{Hom}(\Gamma, \operatorname{SO}(n,2))$ such that for any $\sigma\in \mathcal O$, the subgroup $\sigma(\Gamma)$ is a Zariski-dense and non-tempered Anosov subgroup of $\operatorname{SO}(n,2)$. In addition, the growth indicator of $\sigma(\Gamma)$ is nearly optimal: it almost realizes the supremum of growth indicators among all non-lattice discrete subgroups, a bound imposed by property $(T)$ of $\operatorname{SO}(n,2)$.</description>

      <title>Character Expansion and the Harer-Zagier Transform of Knot Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is known that statistical mechanical solvable models give knot polynomials. The HOMFLY-PT polynomial is a two-parameter knot polynomial that admits a character expansion, expressed as a sum of Schur functions over Young tableaux. The Harer-Zagier transform (HZ), which converts the HOMFLY-PT polynomial into a rational polynomial in $q$ and $\lambda$, can also be expanded in terms of the HZ of characters. When the HZ of a knot is fully factorisable, such an expansion consists of Young diagrams of hook shape. However, for the vast majority of knots and links the HZ is not factorisable. We show that, in non-factorised cases with up to 7-strands, the HZ transform can be decomposed into a sum of factorised terms. Furthermore, by the substitution $\lambda= q^\mu$ for a magic number $\mu$, the HZ can be reduced to a simple rational function in $q$ consisting of products of cyclotomic polynomials.</description>
