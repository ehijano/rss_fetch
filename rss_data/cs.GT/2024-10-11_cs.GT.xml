      <title>Static Pricing for Online Selection Problem and its Variants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies an online selection problem, where a seller seeks to sequentially sell multiple copies of an item to arriving buyers. We consider an adversarial setting, making no modeling assumptions about buyers' valuations for the items except acknowledging a finite support. In this paper, we focus on a class of static pricing algorithms that sample a price from a pre-determined distribution and sell items to buyers whose valuations exceed the sampled price. Such algorithms are of practical interests due to their advantageous properties, such as ease of implementation and non-discrimination over prices.
  Our work shows that the simple static pricing strategy can achieve strong guarantees comparable to the best known dynamic pricing algorithms. Particularly, we design the optimal static pricing algorithms for the adversarial online selection problem and its two important variants: the online assignment problem and the online selection with convex cost. The static pricing algorithms can even attain the optimal competitive ratios among all online algorithms for the online selection problem and the online assignment problem. To achieve these results, we propose an economics-based approach in the competitive analysis of static pricing algorithms, and develop a novel representative function-based approach to derive the lower bounds. We expect these approaches will be useful in related problems such as online matching.</description>

      <title>Responding to Promises: No-regret learning against followers with memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a repeated Stackelberg game setup where the leader faces a sequence of followers of unknown types and must learn what commitments to make. While previous works have considered followers that best respond to the commitment announced by the leader in every round, we relax this setup in two ways. Motivated by natural scenarios where the leader's reputation factors into how the followers choose their response, we consider followers with memory. Specifically, we model followers that base their response on not just the leader's current commitment but on an aggregate of their past commitments. In developing learning strategies that the leader can employ against such followers, we make the second relaxation and assume boundedly rational followers. In particular, we focus on followers employing quantal responses. Interestingly, we observe that the smoothness property offered by the quantal response (QR) model helps in addressing the challenge posed by learning against followers with memory. Utilizing techniques from online learning, we develop algorithms that guarantee $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret for quantal responding memory-less followers and $O(\sqrt{BT})$ regret for followers with bounded memory of length $B$ with both scaling polynomially in game parameters.</description>

      <title>Strategic Facility Location via Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The facility location with strategic agents is a canonical problem in the literature on mechanism design without money. Recently, Agrawal et. al. considered this problem in the context of machine learning augmented algorithms, where the mechanism designer is also given a prediction of the optimal facility location. An ideal mechanism in this framework produces an outcome that is close to the social optimum when the prediction is accurate (consistency) and gracefully degrades as the prediction deviates from the truth, while retaining some of the worst-case approximation guarantees (robustness). The previous work only addressed this problem in the two-dimensional Euclidean space providing optimal trade-offs between robustness and consistency guarantees for deterministic mechanisms.
  We consider the problem for \emph{general} metric spaces. Our only assumption is that the metric is continuous, meaning that any pair of points must be connected by a continuous shortest path. We introduce a novel mechanism that in addition to agents' reported locations takes a predicted optimal facility location $\hat{o}$. We call this mechanism $\texttt{Harmonic}$, as it selects one of the reported locations $\tilde{\ell}_i$ with probability inversely proportional to $d(\hat{o},\tilde{\ell}_i)+ \Delta$ for a constant parameter $\Delta$. While \harm \ mechanism is not truthful, we can \emph{characterize the set of undominated strategies} for each agent $i$ as solely consisting of the points on a shortest path from their true location $\ell_i$ to the predicted location $\hat{o}$. We further derive \emph{consistency and robustness guarantees on the Price of Anarchy (PoA)} for the game induced by the mechanism.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Primitives of Transaction Fee Mechanism Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transaction Fee Mechanism Design studies auctions run by untrusted miners for transaction inclusion in a blockchain. Under previously-considered desiderata, an auction is considered `good' if, informally-speaking, each party (i.e., the miner, the users, and coalitions of both miners and users) has no incentive to deviate from the fixed and pre-determined protocol.
  In this paper, we propose a novel desideratum for transaction fee mechanisms. We say that a TFM is off-chain influence proof when the miner cannot achieve additional revenue by running a separate auction off-chain. While the previously-highlighted EIP-1559 is the gold-standard according to prior desiderata, we show that it does not satisfy off-chain influence proofness. Intuitively, this holds because a Bayesian revenue-maximizing miner can strictly increase profits by persuasively threatening to censor any bids that do not transfer a tip directly to the miner off-chain.
  On the other hand, we reconsider the Cryptographic (multi-party computation assisted) Second Price Auction mechanism, which is technically not `simple for miners' according to previous desiderata (since miners may wish to set a reserve by fabricating bids). We show that, in a slightly different model where the miner is allowed to set the reserve directly, this auction satisfies simplicity for users and miners, and off-chain influence proofness.
  Finally, we prove a strong impossibility result: no mechanism satisfies all previously-considered properties along with off-chain influence proofness, even with unlimited supply, and even after soliciting input from the miner.</description>

      <title>Stackelberg vs. Nash in the Lottery Colonel Blotto Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resource competition problems are often modeled using Colonel Blotto games. However, Colonel Blotto games only simulate scenarios where players act simultaneously. In many real-life scenarios, competition is sequential, such as cybersecurity, cloud services, business investments, and more. To model such sequential competition, we model the Lottery Colonel Blotto game as a Stackelberg game. We solve the Stackelberg equilibrium in the Lottery Colonel Blotto game in which the first mover's strategy is actually a solution to a bi-level optimization problem. We develop a constructive method that allows for a series of game reductions. This method enables us to compute the leader's optimal commitment strategy in a polynomial number of iterations. Furthermore, we identify the conditions under which the Stackelberg equilibrium aligns with the Nash equilibria. Finally, we show that by making the optimal first move, the leader's utility can be unbounded compared to its utility in Nash equilibria. We find that the player with a smaller budget has a greater incentive to become the leader in the game. Surprisingly, even when the leader adopts the optimal commitment strategy, the follower's utility may improve compared to that in Nash equilibria.</description>

      <title>Eco-driving Incentive Mechanisms for Mitigating Emissions in Urban Transportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes incentive mechanisms that promote eco-driving in transportation networks with the over-arching objective of minimizing emissions. The transportation system operator provides the drivers with energy-efficient driving guidance throughout their trips, and their eco-driving levels are measured by how closely they follow this guidance via vehicle telematics. Drivers choose their eco-driving levels to optimize a combination of their travel times and their emissions. To obtain optimal budget allocation and recommendations for the incentive mechanism, the system operator gathers drivers' preferences, or types, to assess each driver's trip urgency and natural willingness to eco-drive. In a setting where drivers truthfully report their types, we introduce the first-best incentive mechanism and show that the obedience condition holds (i.e., drivers find it optimal to comply with the system operator's recommendations) when the recommended eco-driving profile constitutes a Nash equilibrium. Moreover, in a setting where drivers can strategically report their types, we introduce the second-best incentive mechanism and show that the proposed mechanism is incentive-compatible (i.e., drivers find it optimal to be truthful). Under this mechanism, we also show that all equilibrium outcomes are at least as good as the recommended eco-driving profile in terms of the system operator's objective. Overall, this work offers a framework for designing eco-driving incentive mechanisms while considering both the strategic behavior of individual drivers and the network effects of collective decision-making.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Symmetric Bimatrix Games with Common Payoffs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study symmetric bimatrix games that also have the common-payoff property, i.e., the two players receive the same payoff at any outcome of the game. Due to the symmetry property, these games are guaranteed to have symmetric Nash equilibria, where the two players play the same (mixed) strategy. While the problem of computing such symmetric equilibria in general symmetric bimatrix games is known to be intractable, namely PPAD-complete, this result does not extend to our setting. Indeed, due to the common-payoff property, the problem lies in the lower class CLS, ruling out PPAD-hardness. In this paper, we show that the problem remains intractable, namely it is CLS-complete. On the way to proving this result, as our main technical contribution, we show that computing a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point of a quadratic program remains CLS-hard, even when the feasible domain is a simplex.</description>

      <title>Strategic Classification With Externalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new variant of the strategic classification problem: a principal reveals a classifier, and $n$ agents report their (possibly manipulated) features to be classified. Motivated by real-world applications, our model crucially allows the manipulation of one agent to affect another; that is, it explicitly captures inter-agent externalities. The principal-agent interactions are formally modeled as a Stackelberg game, with the resulting agent manipulation dynamics captured as a simultaneous game. We show that under certain assumptions, the pure Nash Equilibrium of this agent manipulation game is unique and can be efficiently computed. Leveraging this result, PAC learning guarantees are established for the learner: informally, we show that it is possible to learn classifiers that minimize loss on the distribution, even when a random number of agents are manipulating their way to a pure Nash Equilibrium. We also comment on the optimization of such classifiers through gradient-based approaches. This work sets the theoretical foundations for a more realistic analysis of classifiers that are robust against multiple strategic actors interacting in a common environment.</description>

      <title>Aggregation of Antagonistic Contingent Preferences: When Is It Possible?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a two-alternative voting game where voters' preferences depend on an unobservable world state and each voter receives a private signal correlated to the true world state. We consider the collective decision when voters can collaborate in a group and have antagonistic preferences -- given the revealed world state, voters will support different alternatives. We identify sharp thresholds for the fraction of the majority-type voters necessary for preference aggregation.
  We specifically examine the majority vote mechanism (where each voter has one vote, and the alternative with more votes wins) and pinpoint a critical threshold, denoted as $\theta_{\texttt{maj}}$, for the majority-type proportion. When the fraction of majority-type voters surpasses $\theta_{\texttt{maj}}$, there is a symmetric strategy for the majority-type that leads to strategic equilibria favoring informed majority decisions. Conversely, when the majority-type proportion falls below $\theta_{\texttt{maj}}$, equilibrium does not exist, rendering the aggregation of informed majority decisions impossible.
  Additionally, we propose an easy-to-implement mechanism that establishes a lower threshold $\theta^\ast$ (with $\theta^\ast \leq \theta_{\texttt{maj}}$) for both equilibria and informed majority decision aggregation. We demonstrate that $\theta^\ast$ is optimal by proving a general impossibility result: if the majority-type proportion is below $\theta^\ast$, with mild assumptions, no mechanism can aggregate the preferences, meaning that no equilibrium leads to the informed majority decision for any mechanism.</description>

      <title>An $\alpha$-regret analysis of Adversarial Bilateral Trade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.06846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study sequential bilateral trade where sellers and buyers valuations are completely arbitrary (i.e., determined by an adversary). Sellers and buyers are strategic agents with private valuations for the good and the goal is to design a mechanism that maximizes efficiency (or gain from trade) while being incentive compatible, individually rational and budget balanced. In this paper we consider gain from trade which is harder to approximate than social welfare.
  We consider a variety of feedback scenarios and distinguish the cases where the mechanism posts one price and when it can post different prices for buyer and seller. We show several surprising results about the separation between the different scenarios. In particular we show that (a) it is impossible to achieve sublinear $\alpha$-regret for any $\alpha&lt;2$, (b) but with full feedback sublinear $2$-regret is achievable (c) with a single price and partial feedback one cannot get sublinear $\alpha$ regret for any constant $\alpha$ (d) nevertheless, posting two prices even with one-bit feedback achieves sublinear $2$-regret, and (e) there is a provable separation in the $2$-regret bounds between full and partial feedback.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium Analysis of Customer Attraction Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.07174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a game model called "customer attraction game" to demonstrate the competition among online content providers. In this model, customers exhibit interest in various topics. Each content provider selects one topic and benefits from the attracted customers. We investigate both symmetric and asymmetric settings involving agents and customers. In the symmetric setting, the existence of pure Nash equilibrium (PNE) is guaranteed, but finding a PNE is PLS-complete. To address this, we propose a fully polynomial time approximation scheme to identify an approximate PNE. Moreover, the tight Price of Anarchy (PoA) is established. In the asymmetric setting, we show the nonexistence of PNE in certain instances and establish that determining its existence is NP-hard. Nevertheless, we prove the existence of an approximate PNE. Additionally, when agents select topics sequentially, we demonstrate that finding a subgame-perfect equilibrium is PSPACE-hard. Furthermore, we present the sequential PoA for the two-agent setting.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Extragradient with Random Reshuffling: Improved Convergence for Variational Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Stochastic Extragradient (SEG) method is one of the most popular algorithms for solving finite-sum min-max optimization and variational inequality problems (VIPs) appearing in various machine learning tasks. However, existing convergence analyses of SEG focus on its with-replacement variants, while practical implementations of the method randomly reshuffle components and sequentially use them. Unlike the well-studied with-replacement variants, SEG with Random Reshuffling (SEG-RR) lacks established theoretical guarantees. In this work, we provide a convergence analysis of SEG-RR for three classes of VIPs: (i) strongly monotone, (ii) affine, and (iii) monotone. We derive conditions under which SEG-RR achieves a faster convergence rate than the uniform with-replacement sampling SEG. In the monotone setting, our analysis of SEG-RR guarantees convergence to an arbitrary accuracy without large batch sizes, a strong requirement needed in the classical with-replacement SEG. As a byproduct of our results, we provide convergence guarantees for Shuffle Once SEG (shuffles the data only at the beginning of the algorithm) and the Incremental Extragradient (does not shuffle the data). We supplement our analysis with experiments validating empirically the superior performance of SEG-RR over the classical with-replacement sampling SEG.</description>

      <title>A Family of Switching Pursuit Strategies for a Multi-Pursuer Single-Evader Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19954v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new family of pursuit strategies for multi-pursuer single-evader games in a planar environment. They leverage conditions under which the minimum-time solution of the game becomes equivalent to that of a suitable two-pursuer single-evader game. This enables the design of strategies in which the pursuers first aim to meet such conditions, and then transition to a two-pursuer game once they are satisfied. As a consequence, naive strategies that are in general unsuccessful, can be turned into winning strategies by switching to the appropriate two-pursuer game. Moreover, it is shown via numerical simulations that the switching mechanism significantly enhances the performance of existing pursuit algorithms, like those based on Voronoi partitions.</description>

Abstract: We study the classical contest design problem of allocating a budget across different prizes to maximize effort in a finite type-space environment. For any contest, we characterize the unique symmetric equilibrium. In this equilibrium, different agent types mix over contiguous intervals so that more efficient agents always exert greater effort than less efficient agents. We then solve for the expected equilibrium effort, investigate the effect of increasing competition under linear costs, and identify conditions under which this effect persists under general costs. As a result, we find that the winner-takes-all contest is optimal under linear and concave costs. Lastly, we obtain an equilibrium convergence result for the continuum type-space, and since the finite type-space encompasses the complete information environment as a special case, our analysis offers a unified approach to studying contests in these classical environments.</description>
