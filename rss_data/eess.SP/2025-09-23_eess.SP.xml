      <title>On Multi-entity, Multivariate Quickest Change Point Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a framework for online Change Point Detection (CPD) from multi-entity, multivariate time series data, motivated by applications in crowd monitoring where traditional sensing methods (e.g., video surveillance) may be infeasible. Our approach addresses the challenge of detecting system-wide behavioral shifts in complex, dynamic environments where the number and behavior of individual entities may be uncertain or evolve. We introduce the concept of Individual Deviation from Normality (IDfN), computed via a reconstruction-error-based autoencoder trained on normal behavior. We aggregate these individual deviations using mean, variance, and Kernel Density Estimates (KDE) to yield a System-Wide Anomaly Score (SWAS). To detect persistent or abrupt changes, we apply statistical deviation metrics and the Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) technique to these scores. Our unsupervised approach eliminates the need for labeled data or feature extraction, enabling real-time operation on streaming input. Evaluations on both synthetic datasets and crowd simulations, explicitly designed for anomaly detection in group behaviors, demonstrate that our method accurately detects significant system-level changes, offering a scalable and privacy-preserving solution for monitoring complex multi-agent systems. In addition to this methodological contribution, we introduce new, challenging multi-entity multivariate time series datasets generated from crowd simulations in Unity and coupled nonlinear oscillators. To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no publicly available dataset of this type designed explicitly to evaluate CPD in complex collective and interactive systems, highlighting an essential gap that our work addresses.</description>

      <title>Multi-Target Detection for Cognitive MIMO Radar Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we develop centralized and decentralized signal fusion techniques for constant false alarm rate (CFAR) multi-target detection with a cognitive radar network in unknown noise and clutter distributions. Further, we first develop a detection statistic for co-located monostatic MIMO radar in unknown noise and clutter distributions which is asymptotically CFAR as the number of received pulses over all antennas grows large, and we provide conditions under which this detection statistic is valid. We leverage reinforcement learning (RL) for improved multi-target detection performance, where the radar learns likely target locations in a search area. These results are then generalized to the setting of cognitive radar networks, where radars collaborate to learn where targets are likely to appear in a search area. We show a fundamental tradeoff between the spatial and temporal domain for CFAR detection in unknown noise and clutter distributions; in other words, we show a tradeoff between the number of radar antennas and the number of temporal samples. We show the benefits and tradeoffs with centralized and decentralized detection with a network of cognitive radars.</description>

      <title>Automatic Model Extraction of the Match Standard in Symmetric--Reciprocal--Match Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the modeling of parasitics of the match standard in the symmetric-reciprocal-match (SRM) calibration method of vector network analyzers (VNAs). In the general SRM procedure, the match standard is assumed to be fully known. Here, we demonstrate that the match can be modeled with an arbitrary frequency-dependent model using a non-linear global optimization procedure. To highlight the validity of the suggested approach, numerical tests were conducted, demonstrating the ability to recover the match standard parasitic model down to software numerical precision. Additionally, we performed microstrip line measurements to compare the SRM calibration with match modeling to the multiline thru-reflect-line (TRL) calibration one, showing that automatic model extraction can achieve accuracy similar to using a match standard defined through multiline TRL calibration.</description>

      <title>A Secure Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing for Wireless Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a secure affine frequency division multiplexing (SE-AFDM) for wireless communication systems to enhance communication security. Besides configuring the parameter c1 to obtain communication reliability under doubly selective channels, we also utilize the time-varying parameter c2 to improve the security of the communications system. The derived input-output relation shows that the legitimate receiver can eliminate the nonlinear impact introduced by the time-varying c2 without losing the bit error rate (BER) performance. Moreover, it is theoretically proved that the eavesdropper cannot separate the time-varying c2 and random information symbols, such that the BER performance of the eavesdropper is severely deteriorated. Meanwhile, the analysis of the effective signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the eavesdropper illustrates that the SINR decreases as the value range of c2 expands. Numerical results verify that the proposed SE-AFDM waveform has significant security while maintaining good BER performance in high-mobility scenarios.</description>

      <title>Integrated Cellular and LEO-based Positioning and Synchronization under User Mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the localization, synchronization, and speed estimation of a mobile user equipment (UE) leveraging integrated terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks (NTNs), in particular low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites. We focus on a minimal setup in which the UE received signal from only one base station (BS) and one LEO satellite. We derive a generic signal model accounting for mobility, clock and frequency offsets, based on which a hierarchy of simplified models are proposed and organized by computational complexity. Estimation algorithms are developed for each model to facilitate efficient and accurate parameter recovery. Rigorous simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed models, demonstrating their suitability across diverse scenarios. The findings highlight how the trade-off between complexity and performance can be optimized for varying deployment environments and application requirements, offering valuable insights for 6G positioning and synchronization systems under user mobility.</description>

      <title>Detection Capability Comparison Between Intensity Detection and Splitting Detection for Rydberg-Atomic Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rydberg atomic quantum receivers have been seen as novel radio frequency measurements and the high sensitivity to a large range of frequencies makes it attractive for communications reception. However, their unique physical characteristics enable two fundamental signal readout schemes: intensity-based detection and splitting-based detection. The former measures the electric fields through laser intensity, while the latter utilizes Autler-Townes splitting. In this work, we systematically categorize and model existing signal readout methods, classifying them into these two paradigms. Then, we derive the maximum likelihood estimation procedures and corresponding Cram\'er-Rao lower bounds (CRLB) for each detection modality. Through the analysis of the CRLB, we propose strategy for both readout schemes to enhance sensitivity and minimize estimation variance: acquiring data in regions with maximal slope magnitudes. While this approach has been implemented in intensity-based detection (e.g., superheterodyne schemes), its application to splitting-based detection remains unexplored. Implementation of non-uniform frequency scanning, with preferential sampling at regions exhibiting maximum peak slopes combined with our proposed maximum likelihood splitting estimation method, achieves significantly reduced estimation variance compared to conventional polynomial fitting. The comparative analysis reveals the optimal detection performance of the two detection schemes. This work also contributes to enhancing the accuracy of microwave calibration. Numerical results reveal that both fundamental signal readout methods achieve lower estimation variance based on our proposed maximum likelihood estimation approach.</description>

      <title>Highly Parallel Singular Value Decomposition for Low-Latency MIMO Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Singular value decomposition (SVD) is widely used in wireless systems, including multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) processing and dimension reduction in distributed MIMO (D-MIMO). However, the iterative nature of decomposition methods results in increased execution time as system size grows, posing challenges for real-time and low-latency applications. To address this, we analyze the latency of state-of-art SVD methods, and highlight the efficiency of a 4-step highly parallel method based on Gram matrix tridiagonalization. Furthermore, we develop a time complexity (processing latency) analysis framework with hardware profiling, allowing scalable and realistic evaluation without full implementation. The numerical results demonstrate the superior time efficiency of the selected parallel method, particularly in massive MIMO scenarios.</description>

      <title>Normal mode parameters estimation by a VLA in single-shooting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an orthogonality-constrained modal search (OCMS) method for estimating modal wavenumbers and modal depth functions using a vertical linear array (VLA). Under the assumption of a known sound speed profile, OCMS leverages the orthogonality of distinct modal depth functions to extract both the modal depth functions and their corresponding wavenumbers, even when the VLA and a monochromatic sound source remain stationary.The performance of OCMS is evaluated through numerical simulations under varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), different VLA apertures, varying numbers of VLA elements, VLA tilt and sound speed profile (SSP) uncertainty. The results demonstrate that OCMS is robust against noise, VLA aperture variations, and changes in the number of VLA elements, meanwhile, the algorithm maintains reliable performance when SSP uncertainty &lt; 1 m/s and VLA tilt angle &lt;5{\deg}. Furthermore, the effectiveness of OCMS is validated using SwellEx96 experimental data. The relative error between the modal wavenumbers derived from experimental data and those computed via Kraken is on the order of $10^{-4}$.</description>

      <title>Quaternion LMS for Graph Signal Recovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter generalizes the Graph Signal Recovery (GSR) problem in Graph Signal Processing (GSP) to the Quaternion domain. It extends the Quaternion Least Mean Square (QLMS) in adaptive filtering literature, and Graph LMS (GLMS) algorithm in GSP literature, to an algorithm called Quaternion GLMS (QGLMS). The basic adaptation formula using Quaternion-based algebra is derived. Moreover, mean convergence analysis and mean-square convergence analysis are mathematically performed. Hence, a sufficient condition on the step-size parameter of QGLMS is suggested. Also, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in graph signal reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Convolutional Neural Networks for Prior Learning in Graph Signal Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph signal recovery (GSR) is a fundamental problem in graph signal processing, where the goal is to reconstruct a complete signal defined over a graph from a subset of noisy or missing observations. A central challenge in GSR is that the underlying statistical model of the graph signal is often unknown or too complex to specify analytically. To address this, we propose a flexible, data-driven framework that learns the signal prior directly from training samples. We develop a Bayesian convolutional neural network (BCNN) architecture that models the prior distribution of graph signals using graph-aware filters based on Chebyshev polynomials. By interpreting the hidden layers of the CNN as Gibbs distributions and employing Gaussian mixture model (GMM) nonlinearities, we obtain a closed-form and expressive prior. This prior is integrated into a variational Bayesian (VB) inference framework to estimate the posterior distribution of the signal and noise precision. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world graph datasets demonstrate that the proposed BCNN-GSR algorithm achieves accurate and robust recovery across a variety of signal distributions. The method generalizes well to complex, non-Gaussian signal models and remains computationally efficient, making it suitable for practical large-scale graph recovery tasks.</description>

      <title>Data-Free Knowledge Distillation for LiDAR-Aided Beam Tracking in MmWave Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal sensing reduces beam training overhead but is constrained by machine learning complexity and dataset demands. To address this, we propose a data-free (DF) knowledge distillation (KD) framework for efficient LiDAR-aided mmWave beam tracking, i.e., predicting the best current and future beams. Specifically, we propose a knowledge inversion framework, where a generator synthesizes LiDAR input data from random noise, guided by a loss function defined on the features and outputs of a pre-trained teacher model. The student model is then trained using the synthetic data and knowledge distilled from the teacher. The generator loss combines three terms, called metadata loss, activation loss, and entropy loss. For student training, in addition to the standard Kullback-Leibler divergence loss, we also consider a mean-squared error (MSE) loss between the teacher and student logits. Simulation results show that the proposed DF-KD (slightly) outperforms the teacher in Top-1 and Top-5 accuracies. Moreover, we observe that the metadata loss contributes significantly to the generator performance, and that the MSE loss for the student can effectively replace the standard KD loss while requiring fewer fine-tuned hyperparameters.</description>

      <title>Enabling Drone Detection with SWARM Repeater-Assisted MIMO ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As definitions about new architectural aspects, use cases, and standards for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) continue to appear, cellular systems based on massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna technology are also experiencing a parallel evolution through the integration of novel network components. This evolution should support emerging ISAC use cases and services. In particular, this paper explores a recent vision for cost-efficient cellular network densification through the deployment of swarms of repeaters. Leveraging their ability to retransmit signals instantaneously, we investigate how these repeaters can enhance radar sensing capabilities for drone detection in a swarm repeater-assisted MIMO ISAC system. Our results demonstrate that, by optimizing the gains of repeaters given a sufficient maximum amplification gain, increasing the number of repeaters can lead to gains in sensing performance.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Sensing and Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Environmental sensing can significantly enhance mmWave communications by assisting beam training, yet its benefits must be balanced against the associated sensing costs. To this end, we propose a unified machine learning framework that dynamically determines when to sense and leverages sensory data for beam prediction. Specifically, we formulate a joint sensing and beamforming problem that maximizes the av- erage signal-to-noise ratio under an average sensing budget. Lyapunov optimization is employed to enforce the sensing constraint, while a deep Q-Network determines the sensing slots. A pretrained deep neural network then maps the sens- ing data to optimal beams in the codebook. Simulations based on the real-world DeepSense dataset demonstrate that the pro- posed approach substantially reduces sensing overhead while maintaining satisfactory communications performance.</description>

      <title>On the Performance of THz Wireless Systems over $\alpha$-$\mathcal{F}$ Channels with Beam Misalignment and Mobility</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the performance of terahertz~(THz) wireless systems over the $\alpha$-$\mathcal{F}$ fading channels with beam misalignment and mobility. New expressions are derived for the probability density, cumulative distribution, and moment generating functions, as well as higher-order moments of the instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio. Building upon the aforementioned expressions, we extract novel formulas for the outage probability, symbol error probability, and average channel capacity. Asymptotic metrics are also deduced, which provide useful insights. Monte Carlo simulations results are presented to support the derived analytical framework.</description>

      <title>Faster-Than-Nyquist Signalling - Theoretical Limits on Capacity and Techniques to Approach Capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Faster-Than-Nyquist (FTN) Signalling is a non-orthogonal transmission scheme that violates the Nyquist zero-ISI criterion providing higher throughput and better spectral efficiency than a Nyquist transmission scheme. In this thesis, the inter symbol interference (ISI) introduced by FTN signalling is studied, and conditions on pulse shapes and $\tau$ (time acceleration factor) are derived so that the ISI can be avoided completely. Further, these conditions are reinforced by investigating the theoretical limits on the capacities of FTN systems. Finally, the use of power allocation and adaptive loading techniques are explored in reducing the effect of ISI and increasing the throughput of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) FTN systems. The implementation of these techniques and simulation results are also demonstrated.</description>

      <title>A Novel Site-Specific Inference Model for Urban Canyon Channels: From Measurements to Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of intelligent transportation and smart city applications, urban canyon has become a critical scenario for the design and evaluation of wireless communication systems. Due to its unique environmental layout, the channel characteristics in urban canyon are strongly a street geometry and building distribution, thereby exhibiting significant site-specific channel condition. However, this feature has not been well captured in existing channel models. In this paper, we propose a site-specific channel inference model based on environmental geometry, the model is parameterized using sub-6GHz channel measurements. Multipath components (MPCs) are extracted and clustered according to geometric propagation, which are explicitly derived from the influence of canyon width, thereby establishing an interpretable mapping between the physical environment and statistical characteristics of MPCs. A step-by-step implementation scheme is presented. Subsequently, the proposed site-specific channel inference model is validated by comparing second-order statistics of channels, derived from the model and measurements. The results show that the proposed model achieves high accuracy and robustness in different urban canyon scenarios.</description>

      <title>STFT-AECNN: An Attention-Enhanced CNN for Efficient {\Phi}-OTDR Event Recognition in IoT-Enabled Distributed Acoustic Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase-sensitive optical time-domain reflectometry ({\Phi}-OTDR) has emerged as a promising sensing technology in Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructures, enabling large-scale distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) for smart city surveillance, industrial pipeline monitoring, and critical infrastructure protection. However, accurately recognizing events from massive {\Phi}-OTDR data streams remains challenging, as existing deep learning methods either disrupt the inherent spatiotemporal structure of signals or incur prohibitive computational costs, limiting their applicability in resource-constrained IoT scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel STFT-based Attention-Enhanced Convolutional Neural Network (STFT-AECNN), which represents multi-channel time-series data as stacked spectrograms to fully exploit their spatiotemporal characteristics while enabling efficient 2D CNN processing. A Spatial Efficient Attention Module (SEAM) is further introduced to adaptively emphasize the most informative channels, and a joint Cross-Entropy and Triplet loss is adopted to enhance the discriminability of the learned feature space. Extensive experiments on the public BJTU {\Phi}-OTDR dataset demonstrate that STFT-AECNN achieves a peak accuracy of 99.94% while maintaining high computational efficiency. These results highlight its potential for real-time, scalable, and robust event recognition in IoT-enabled DAS systems, paving the way for reliable and intelligent IoT sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Tensor Train Completion from Fiberwise Observations Along a Single Mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor completion is an extension of matrix completion aimed at recovering a multiway data tensor by leveraging a given subset of its entries (observations) and the pattern of observation. The low-rank assumption is key in establishing a relationship between the observed and unobserved entries of the tensor. The low-rank tensor completion problem is typically solved using numerical optimization techniques, where the rank information is used either implicitly (in the rank minimization approach) or explicitly (in the error minimization approach). Current theories concerning these techniques often study probabilistic recovery guarantees under conditions such as random uniform observations and incoherence requirements. However, if an observation pattern exhibits some low-rank structure that can be exploited, more efficient algorithms with deterministic recovery guarantees can be designed by leveraging this structure. This work shows how to use only standard linear algebra operations to compute the tensor train decomposition of a specific type of ``fiber-wise" observed tensor, where some of the fibers of a tensor (along a single specific mode) are either fully observed or entirely missing, unlike the usual entry-wise observations. From an application viewpoint, this setting is relevant when it is easier to sample or collect a multiway data tensor along a specific mode (e.g., temporal). The proposed completion method is fast and is guaranteed to work under reasonable deterministic conditions on the observation pattern. Through numerical experiments, we showcase interesting applications and use cases that illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Trace Is In Sentences: Unbiased Lightweight ChatGPT-Generated Text Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of ChatGPT has raised concerns about its misuse, highlighting the need for robust detection of AI-generated text. Current word-level detectors are vulnerable to paraphrasing or simple prompts (PSP), suffer from biases induced by ChatGPT's word-level patterns (CWP) and training data content, degrade on modified text, and often require large models or online LLM interaction. To tackle these issues, we introduce a novel task to detect both original and PSP-modified AI-generated texts, and propose a lightweight framework that classifies texts based on their internal structure, which remains invariant under word-level changes. Our approach encodes sentence embeddings from pre-trained language models and models their relationships via attention. We employ contrastive learning to mitigate embedding biases from autoregressive generation and incorporate a causal graph with counterfactual methods to isolate structural features from topic-related biases. Experiments on two curated datasets, including abstract comparisons and revised life FAQs, validate the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>Subspace Clustering of Subspaces: Unifying Canonical Correlation Analysis and Subspace Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for clustering a collection of tall matrices based on their column spaces, a problem we term Subspace Clustering of Subspaces (SCoS). Unlike traditional subspace clustering methods that assume vectorized data, our formulation directly models each data sample as a matrix and clusters them according to their underlying subspaces. We establish conceptual links to Subspace Clustering and Generalized Canonical Correlation Analysis (GCCA), and clarify key differences that arise in this more general setting. Our approach is based on a Block Term Decomposition (BTD) of a third-order tensor constructed from the input matrices, enabling joint estimation of cluster memberships and partially shared subspaces. We provide the first identifiability results for this formulation and propose scalable optimization algorithms tailored to large datasets. Experiments on real-world hyperspectral imaging datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior clustering accuracy and robustness, especially under high noise and interference, compared to existing subspace clustering techniques. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework in challenging high-dimensional applications where structure exists beyond individual data vectors.</description>

      <title>Tractable Approximation of Labeled Multi-Object Posterior Densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-object estimation in state-space models (SSMs) wherein the system state is represented as a finite set has attracted significant interest in recent years. In Bayesian inference, the posterior density captures all information on the system trajectory since it considers the past history of states. In most multi-object SSM applications, closed-form multi-object posteriors are not available for non-standard multi-object models. Thus, functional approximation is necessary because these posteriors are very high-dimensional. This work provides a tractable multi-scan Generalized Labeled Multi-Bernoulli (GLMB) approximation that matches the trajectory cardinality distribution of the labeled multi-object posterior density. The proposed approximation is also proven to minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence over a special class of multi-scan GLMB model. Additionally, we develop a tractable algorithm for computing the approximate multi-object posteriors over finite windows. Numerical experiments, including simulation results on a multi-object SSM with social force model and uninformative observations, are presented to validate the applicability of the approximation method.</description>

      <title>Integrating Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces and Power Control for Dynamic Edge Inference via Over-The-Air Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for Edge Inference (EI) that bypasses the conventional practice of treating the wireless channel as noise. We utilize Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces (SIMs) to control wireless propagation, enabling the channel itself to perform over-the-air computation. This eliminates the need for symbol estimation at the receiver, significantly reducing computational and communication overhead. Our approach models the transmitter-channel-receiver system as an end-to-end Deep Neural Network (DNN) where the response of the SIM elements are trainable parameters. To address channel variability, we incorporate a dedicated DNN module responsible for dynamically adjusting transmission power leveraging user location information. Our performance evaluations showcase that the proposed metasurfaces-integrated DNN framework with deep SIM architectures are capable of balancing classification accuracy and power consumption under diverse scenarios, offering significant energy efficiency improvements.</description>

      <title>Optimum Spectrum Extension for PAPR Reduction of DFT-s-OFDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uplink coverage in cellular networks is constrained by the maximum UE transmit power, making peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) reduction essential. While DFT-s-OFDM with frequency-domain spectral shaping (FDSS) achieves significantly lower PAPR than OFDM, especially with pi/2-BPSK, the PAPR remains too high for higher-rate transmission. Spectrum extension (SE) combined with FDSS (FDSS-SE) can further reduce the PAPR for higher-order QAM. This paper considers FDSS-SE with parametrized FDSS windows spanning a range of possible power ripples, as well as arbitrary circular shifts of the subcarrier coefficients. We optimize both the frequency shift and the SE size, and show that there exists an optimal SE size for reducing the PAPR and another one for increasing the rate. Analysis and simulations reveal that both optima largely depend on the window attenuation but are nearly invariant in proportion to the bandwidth. While the PAPR-optimal SE size is nearly invariant to the constellation order of regular QAM, the rate-optimal SE size depends also on the SNR. These insights provide practical guidelines for beyond-5G uplink coverage enhancement, highlighting that SE size should be individually configured according to the user's FDSS window and link quality.</description>

      <title>WaveletGaussian: Wavelet-domain Diffusion for Sparse-view 3D Gaussian Object Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a powerful representation for image-based object reconstruction, yet its performance drops sharply in sparse-view settings. Prior works address this limitation by employing diffusion models to repair corrupted renders, subsequently using them as pseudo ground truths for later optimization. While effective, such approaches incur heavy computation from the diffusion fine-tuning and repair steps. We present WaveletGaussian, a framework for more efficient sparse-view 3D Gaussian object reconstruction. Our key idea is to shift diffusion into the wavelet domain: diffusion is applied only to the low-resolution LL subband, while high-frequency subbands are refined with a lightweight network. We further propose an efficient online random masking strategy to curate training pairs for diffusion fine-tuning, replacing the commonly used, but inefficient, leave-one-out strategy. Experiments across two benchmark datasets, Mip-NeRF 360 and OmniObject3D, show WaveletGaussian achieves competitive rendering quality while substantially reducing training time.</description>

      <title>Stability and Generalization of Adversarial Diffusion Training</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Algorithmic stability is an established tool for analyzing generalization. While adversarial training enhances model robustness, it often suffers from robust overfitting and an enlarged generalization gap. Although recent work has established the convergence of adversarial training in decentralized networks, its generalization properties remain unexplored. This work presents a stability-based generalization analysis of adversarial training under the diffusion strategy for convex losses. We derive a bound showing that the generalization error grows with both the adversarial perturbation strength and the number of training steps, a finding consistent with single-agent case but novel for decentralized settings. Numerical experiments on logistic regression validate these theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>A Low-cost Quasi-planar Array Probe for Photoacoustic Imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is a novel hybrid imaging technique that combines the benefits of both optical and acoustic imaging modalities, which provides functional and molecular optical contrasts of deep tissue. Commonly used ultrasound transducers for PAI include linear and planar arrays, which can provide two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) image reconstruction, respectively. However, linear arrays cannot provide reconstruction of 3D images, which makes it impossible to locate chromophores in 3D space. Although planar array can provide fast 3D imaging in real time, it usually requires thousands of analog-to-digital conversion channels for data acquisition, which is costly. To fill the gap between 2D and 3D PAI, we propose a quasi-planar array that uses double 16-elements-linear arrays arranged in parallel to achieve real-time 3D imaging. We first conducted simulation studies to prove that the quasi-planar probe can perform 3D imaging to localize simple chromophores. Then, the agarose phantom experiment demonstrated that the probe can reconstruct 3D imaging of multiple absorbers in different depths. A potential application of this device is to provide a low-cost 3D PAI solution for fast tracking of needle tip during needle biopsy, which will be further explored in our future work.</description>

      <title>UAV-Enabled Passive 6D Movable Antenna for ISAC: Joint Location, Orientation, and Reflection Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Improving the fundamental performance trade-off in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems has been deemed as one of the most significant challenges. To address it, we propose in this letter a novel ISAC system that leverages an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-mounted intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) and the UAV's maneuverability in six-dimensional (6D) space, i.e., three-dimensional (3D) location and 3D rotation, thus referred to as passive 6D movable antenna (6DMA). We aim to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for sensing a single target while ensuring a minimum SNR at a communication user equipment (UE), by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming at the ISAC base station (BS), the 3D location and orientation as well as the reflection coefficients of the IRS. To solve this challenging non-convex optimization problem, we propose a two-stage approach. In the first stage, we aim to optimize the IRS's 3D location, 3D orientation, and reflection coefficients to enhance both the channel correlations and power gains for sensing and communication. Given their optimized parameters, the optimal transmit beamforming at the ISAC BS is derived in closed form. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed passive 6DMA-enabled ISAC system significantly improves the sensing and communication trade-off by simultaneously enhancing channel correlations and power gains, and outperforms other baseline schemes.</description>

      <title>Chirp-Permuted AFDM: A Versatile Waveform Design for ISAC in 6G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20825v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel multicarrier waveform, termed chirp-permuted affine frequency division multiplexing (CP-AFDM), which introduces a unique chirp-permutation domain on top of the chirp subcarriers of the conventional AFDM. Rigorous analysis of the signal model and waveform properties, supported by numerical simulations, demonstrates that the proposed CP-AFDM preserves all core characteristics of affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) - including robustness to doubly-dispersive channels, peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), and full delay-Doppler representation - while further enhancing ambiguity function resolution and peak-to-sidelobe ratio (PSLR) in the Doppler domain. These improvements establish CP-AFDM as a highly attractive candidate for emerging sixth generation (6G) use cases demanding both reliability and sensing-awareness. Moreover, by exploiting the vast degree of freedom in the chirp-permutation domain, two exemplary multifunctional applications are introduced: an index modulation (IM) technique over the permutation domain which achieves significant spectral efficiency gains, and a physical-layer security scheme that ensures practically perfect security through permutation-based keying, without requiring additional transmit energy or signaling overhead.</description>

Abstract: Frequency-modulated continuous wave radars have gained increasing popularity in the automotive industry. Its robustness against adverse weather conditions makes it a suitable choice for radar object detection in advanced driver assistance systems. These real-time embedded systems have requirements for the compactness and efficiency of the model, which have been largely overlooked in previous work. In this work, we propose mRadNet, a novel radar object detection model with compactness in mind. mRadNet employs a U-net style architecture with MetaFormer blocks, in which separable convolution and attention token mixers are used to capture both local and global features effectively. More efficient token embedding and merging strategies are introduced to further facilitate the lightweight design. The performance of mRadNet is validated on the CRUW dataset, improving state-of-the-art performance with the least number of parameters and FLOPs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.01153v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A near-field integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) framework is proposed, which introduces an additional distance dimension for both sensing and communications compared to the conventional far-field system. In particular, the Cramer-Rao bound for the near-field joint distance and angle sensing is derived, which is minimized subject to the minimum communication rate requirement of each user. Both fully digital antennas and hybrid digital and analog antennas are investigated. For fully digital antennas, a globally optimal solution of the ISAC waveform is obtained via semidefinite relaxation. For hybrid antennas, a high-quality solution is obtained through two-stage optimization. Numerical results demonstrate the performance gain introduced by the additional distance dimension of the near-field ISAC over the far-field ISAC.</description>

Abstract: We address the tasks of Bayesian state estimation and forecasting for a model-free process in an unsupervised learning setup. For a model-free process, we do not have any a-priori knowledge of the process dynamics. In the article, we propose DANSE -- a Data-driven Nonlinear State Estimation method. DANSE provides a closed-form posterior of the state of the model-free process, given linear measurements of the state. In addition, it provides a closed-form posterior for forecasting. A data-driven recurrent neural network (RNN) is used in DANSE to provide the parameters of a prior of the state. The prior depends on the past measurements as input, and then we find the closed-form posterior of the state using the current measurement as input. The data-driven RNN captures the underlying non-linear dynamics of the model-free process. The training of DANSE, mainly learning the parameters of the RNN, is executed using an unsupervised learning approach. In unsupervised learning, we have access to a training dataset comprising only a set of measurement data trajectories, but we do not have any access to the state trajectories. Therefore, DANSE does not have access to state information in the training data and can not use supervised learning. Using simulated linear and non-linear process models (Lorenz attractor and Chen attractor), we evaluate the unsupervised learning-based DANSE. We show that the proposed DANSE, without knowledge of the process model and without supervised learning, provides a competitive performance against model-driven methods, such as the Kalman filter (KF), extended KF (EKF), unscented KF (UKF), a data-driven deep Markov model (DMM) and a recently proposed hybrid method called KalmanNet. In addition, we show that DANSE works for high-dimensional state estimation.</description>

      <title>Distributed Hybrid Sketching for $\ell_2$-Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20301</link>

Abstract: Linear algebraic operations are ubiquitous in engineering applications, and arise often in a variety of fields including statistical signal processing and machine learning. With contemporary large datasets, to perform linear algebraic methods and regression tasks, it is necessary to resort to both distributed computations as well as data compression. In this paper, we study \textit{distributed} $\ell_2$-subspace embeddings, a common technique used to efficiently perform linear regression. In our setting, data is distributed across multiple computing nodes and a goal is to minimize communication between the nodes and the coordinator in the distributed centralized network, while maintaining the geometry of the dataset. Furthermore, there is also the concern of keeping the data private and secure from potential adversaries. In this work, we address these issues through randomized sketching, where the key idea is to apply distinct sketching matrices on the local datasets. A novelty of this work is that we also consider \textit{hybrid sketching}, \textit{i.e.} a second sketch is applied on the aggregated locally sketched datasets, for enhanced embedding results. One of the main takeaways of this work is that by hybrid sketching, we can interpolate between the trade-offs that arise in off-the-shelf sketching matrices. That is, we can obtain gains in terms of embedding dimension or multiplication time. Our embedding arguments are also justified numerically.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Self-Supervised Framework for Long-Sequence EEG Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals generally exhibit low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and high inter-subject variability, making generalization across subjects and domains challenging. Recent advances in deep learning, particularly self-supervised learning with Transformer-based architectures, have shown promise in EEG representation learning. However, their quadratic computational complexity increases memory usage and slows inference, making them inefficient for modeling long-range dependencies. Moreover, most existing approaches emphasize either explicit window segmentation of the temporal signal or spectral-only input embedding while neglecting raw temporal dynamics. In this paper, we propose EEGM2, a self-supervised framework that overcomes these limitations. EEGM2 adopts a U-shaped encoder-decoder architecture integrated with Mamba-2 to achieve linear computational complexity, thereby reducing memory usage and improving inference speed. Meanwhile, the selective information propagation mechanism of Mamba-2 enables the model to effectively capture and preserve long-range dependencies in raw EEG signals, where traditional RNN or CNN architectures often struggle. Moreover, EEGM2 employs a self-supervised pre-training objective that reconstructs raw EEG using a combined L1 and spectral (Fourier-based) loss, enhancing generalization by jointly preserving temporal dynamics and spectral characteristics. Experimental results demonstrate that EEGM2 achieves state-of-the-art performance in both short- and long-sequence modeling and classification. Further evaluations show that EEGM2 consistently outperforms existing models, demonstrating strong generalization across subjects and tasks, as well as transferability across domains. Overall, EEGM2 offers an efficient and scalable solution suitable for deployment on resource-constrained brain-computer interface (BCI) devices.</description>

      <title>Robust Energy-Efficient DRL-Based Optimization in UAV-Mounted RIS Systems with Jitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we propose an energy-efficient design for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-mounted reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) communication system with nonlinear energy harvesting (EH) and UAV jitter. A joint optimization problem is formulated to maximize the EH efficiency of the UAV-mounted RIS by controlling the user powers, RIS phase shifts, and time-switching factor, subject to quality of service and practical EH constraints. The problem is nonconvex and time-coupled due to UAV angular jitter and nonlinear EH dynamics, making it intractable for conventional optimization methods. To address this, we reformulate the problem as a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) environment and develop a smoothed softmax dual deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm. The proposed method incorporates action clipping, entropy regularization, and softmax-weighted Q-value estimation to improve learning stability and exploration. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm converges reliably under various UAV jitter levels and achieves an average EH efficiency of 45.07\%, approaching the 53.09\% upper bound of exhaustive search, and outperforming other DRL baselines.</description>

      <title>DWTGS: Rethinking Frequency Regularization for Sparse-view 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sparse-view 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) presents significant challenges in reconstructing high-quality novel views, as it often overfits to the widely-varying high-frequency (HF) details of the sparse training views. While frequency regularization can be a promising approach, its typical reliance on Fourier transforms causes difficult parameter tuning and biases towards detrimental HF learning. We propose DWTGS, a framework that rethinks frequency regularization by leveraging wavelet-space losses that provide additional spatial supervision. Specifically, we supervise only the low-frequency (LF) LL subbands at multiple DWT levels, while enforcing sparsity on the HF HH subband in a self-supervised manner. Experiments across benchmarks show that DWTGS consistently outperforms Fourier-based counterparts, as this LF-centric strategy improves generalization and reduces HF hallucinations.</description>

      <title>Q-DPTS: Quantum Differentially Private Time Series Forecasting via Variational Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time series forecasting is vital in domains where data sensitivity is paramount, such as finance and energy systems. While Differential Privacy (DP) provides theoretical guarantees to protect individual data contributions, its integration especially via DP-SGD often impairs model performance due to injected noise. In this paper, we propose Q-DPTS, a hybrid quantum-classical framework for Quantum Differentially Private Time Series Forecasting. Q-DPTS combines Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) with per-sample gradient clipping and Gaussian noise injection, ensuring rigorous $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differential privacy. The expressiveness of quantum models enables improved robustness against the utility loss induced by DP mechanisms. We evaluate Q-DPTS on the ETT (Electricity Transformer Temperature) dataset, a standard benchmark for long-term time series forecasting. Our approach is compared against both classical and quantum baselines, including LSTM, QASA, QRWKV, and QLSTM. Results demonstrate that Q-DPTS consistently achieves lower prediction error under the same privacy budget, indicating a favorable privacy-utility trade-off. This work presents one of the first explorations into quantum-enhanced differentially private forecasting, offering promising directions for secure and accurate time series modeling in privacy-critical scenarios.</description>

      <title>FUN-SSL: Full-band Layer Followed by U-Net with Narrow-band Layers for Multiple Moving Sound Source Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dual-path processing along the temporal and spectral dimensions has shown to be effective in various speech processing applications. While the sound source localization (SSL) models utilizing dual-path processing such as the FN-SSL and IPDnet demonstrated impressive performances in localizing multiple moving sources, they require significant amount of computation. In this paper, we propose an architecture for SSL which introduces a U-Net to perform narrow-band processing in multiple resolutions to reduce computational complexity. The proposed model replaces the full-narrow network block in the IPDnet consisting of one full-band LSTM layer along the spectral dimension followed by one narrow-band LSTM layer along the temporal dimension with the FUN block composed of one Full-band layer followed by a U-net with Narrow-band layers in multiple scales. On top of the skip connections within each U-Net, we also introduce the skip connections between FUN blocks to enrich information. Experimental results showed that the proposed FUN-SSL outperformed previously proposed approaches with computational complexity much lower than that of the IPDnet.</description>
