      <title>Experimental Study on the Rotation-induced Reduction of Penetration Resistance in Sand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soil-dwelling organisms have evolved diverse strategies for efficient subterranean movement. For example, the seeds of Erodium cicutarium and Pelargonium species employ continuous rotational motion for self-burial, while the angled worm lizard Agamodon angeliceps tunnels by oscillating its head around its trunk's axis. These rotational movements significantly reduce penetration resistance. This study presents comprehensive experiments investigating the effects of various factors on rotational penetration forces and energy consumption. Results reveal that force reduction follow an approximately hyperbolic decay with the tangential-to-axial velocity ratio ($u$). Penetrator geometry, particularly roundness and conical tip shape, is found to significantly influence reduction at low velocity ratios, whereas relative density and material type exhibit moderate impact. Reduction is also observed to increase with interfacial friction angle but decreases with confining pressure and depth. Energy consumption analysis shows that while penetration force-related energy decreases with $u$, total energy consumption increases due to rotational torque. For self-burrowing robot designs, lower velocity ratios are recommended to balance penetration force reduction and energy efficiency effectively.</description>

      <title>Modifying Range-Doppler geometry frameworks to process Spotlight SAR imagery in Polar Format</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a simple method to enable processing of Spotlight Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery distributed in Polar Format (PFA) using standard Range-Doppler (RDA) geometry algorithms. Our approach is applicable to PFA SAR images characterized by a constant value of the Center of Aperture (COA) time. We present simplified expressions for forward (image-to-ground) and inverse (ground-to-image) geometry mapping using Sensor Independent Complex Data (SICD) conventions. We discuss simple changes needed to current open source SAR software that implement Range-Doppler algorithms, to enable support within them for Spotlight data distributed in SICD format. We include a proof-of-concept script that utilizes the Python packages sarpy and isce3 to demonstrate the correctness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>DISTINGUISH Workflow: A New Paradigm of Dynamic Well Placement Using Generative Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The real-time process of directional changes while drilling, known as geosteering, is crucial for hydrocarbon extraction and emerging directional drilling applications such as geothermal energy, civil infrastructure, and CO2 storage. The geo-energy industry seeks an automatic geosteering workflow that continually updates the subsurface uncertainties and captures the latest geological understanding given the most recent observations in real-time.
  We propose "DISTINGUISH": a real-time, AI-driven workflow designed to transform geosteering by integrating Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for geological parameterization, ensemble methods for model updating, and global discrete dynamic programming (DDP) optimization for complex decision-making during directional drilling operations. The DISTINGUISH framework relies on offline training of a GAN model to reproduce relevant geology realizations and a Forward Neural Network (FNN) to model Logging-While-Drilling (LWD) tools' response for a given geomodel.
  This paper introduces a first-of-its-kind workflow that progressively reduces GAN-geomodel uncertainty around and ahead of the drilling bit and adjusts the well plan accordingly. The workflow automatically integrates real-time LWD data with a DDP-based decision support system, enhancing predictive models of geology ahead of drilling and leading to better steering decisions. We present a simple yet representative benchmark case and document the performance target achieved by the DISTINGUISH workflow prototype. This benchmark will be a foundation for future methodological advancements and workflow refinements.</description>

      <title>Coal Strength with Dewatering and Coal Seam Gas Depletion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the response of coal mechanical properties to dewatering and gas depletion is critical for estimating borehole stability and designing infill coal seam gas (CSG) wells. Despite its importance, the full impact of these processes on coal strength remains little explored. This study aims to quantify these effects through a combination of results from micro-CT imaging, sonic testing, and mechanical testing on coal samples. Micro-CT imaging provides insights into coal's internal structure by focusing on parameters such as fracture porosity and fracture intensity (P32 factor). Sonic testing measures dynamic properties, including P-wave, S-wave velocities (Vp and Vs) and dynamic Young's modulus (Ed), under both dry and wet conditions. Mechanical testing with acoustic emission (AE) monitoring evaluates static properties like Young's modulus (Es) and uniaxial compressive strength (UCS). The key findings are: (i) Micro-CT imaging shows a strong correlation between coal fracture porosity and P32, offering detailed insights into the coal micro-structure; (ii) mechanical testing reveals that dry samples exhibit a 10% higher Es and 31% greater UCS than wet samples, suggesting that dewatering increases coal strength but potentially also promotes embrittlement; and (iii) wet samples show higher Vp and Ed in sonic tests, indicating water saturation significantly influences sonic measurements. These findings improve the understanding of dewatering and gas depletion effects, laying the groundwork for more advanced geomechanical models in coal seam gas (CSG) operations.</description>
