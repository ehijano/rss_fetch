      <title>Parallel-Field Hall effect in ZrTe$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parallel-field Hall effect is the appearance of a Hall voltage $V_{\rm H}$ that is transverse to the current $I$ when the magnetic field $B$ is applied parallel to $I$ (i.e. $B \parallel I \perp V_{\rm H}$). Such an effect is symmetry forbidden in most cases and hence is very unusual. Interestingly, the existence of a finite parallel-field Hall effect was reported for the layered topological semimetal ZrTe$_5$ and was proposed to be due to Berry curvature. However, it is forbidden for the known symmetry of ZrTe$_5$ and the possible existence of a misaligned out-of-plane magnetic field was not completely ruled out. Here, we elucidate the existence of the parallel-field Hall effect in ZrTe$_5$ with careful magnetic-field alignment. We interpret this result to originate from symmetry breaking and quantitatively explain the observed parallel-field Hall signal by considering a tilting of the Fermi surface allowed by broken symmetry.</description>

      <title>Exploring Multiferroic Behavior in CaZnFeOsO$_6$: A Novel Layered 3$d$-5$d$ Double Perovskite Compound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel multiferroic double perovskite compound, CaZnFeOsO$_6$ (CZFOO), exhibiting combined ferroelectric and ferrimagnetic properties. Through ab initio density functional theory calculations, we predict CZFOO as a unique example of an A-site and B-site ordered double perovskite structure, AA'BB'O$_6$. In this compound, Fe$^{3+}$ and Os$^{5+}$ ions generate substantial magnetization, while Ca$^{2+}$ and Zn$^{2+}$ ions create a layerwise polar environment, resulting in a synergistic combination for multiferroicity. We determine the magnitude of the spontaneous polarization, $\vert P_s \vert$, to be 16.8 $\mu$ C/cm$^2$, and the magnetic moment is approximately 2 $\mu_B$ per formula unit. The remarkable ferroelectric and ferrimagnetic behaviors exhibited by CZFOO make it a promising candidate for various device applications. Despite the significant magnetization and polarization observed, surpassing those of other double perovskites, we find a weak spin-orbit coupling, leading to the absence of any significant magnetoelectric effect in CZFOO. Our findings shed light on the potential of CZFOO as a multiferroic material and provide insights into the intricate interplay between ferroelectricity and ferrimagnetism in double perovskite compounds.</description>

Abstract: Metal-halide semiconductors have great potential for real-life photovoltaic applications; however, surface defects induce several challenges to the thermodynamic stability. Here, we employed density functional theory calculations within van der Waals corrections (D3) to investigate the role of monovalent cations (Li, Na, K, Rb and Cs) in the passivation of 2D perovskite ultrathin films.</description>

      <title>Second and third harmonic generation of acoustic waves in a nonlinear elastic solid in one space dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation of second and third harmonics by an acoustic wave propagating along one dimension in a weakly nonlinear elastic medium that is loaded harmonically in time with frequency $\omega_0$ at a single point in space, is analyzed by successive approximations starting with the linear case. It is noted that nonlinear waves have a speed of propagation that depends on their amplitude. It is also noted that both a free medium as well as a loaded medium generate higher harmonics, but that although the second harmonic of the free medium scales like the square of the linear wave, this is no longer the case when the medium is externally loaded. The shift in speed of propagation due to the nonlinearities is determined imposing that there be no resonant terms in a successive approximation solution scheme to the homogeneous problem. The result is then used to solve the inhomogeneous case also by successive approximations, up to the third order. At second order, the result is a second harmonic wave whose amplitude is modulated by a long wave, whose wavelength is inversely proportional to the shift in the speed of propagation of the linear wave due to nonlinearities. The amplitude of the long modulating wave scales like the amplitude of the linear wave to the four thirds. At short distances from the source a scaling proportional to the amplitude of the linear wave squared is recovered, as is a second harmonic amplitude that grows linearly with distance from the source and depends on the third-order elastic constant only. The third order solution is the sum of four amplitude-modulated waves, two of them oscillate with frequency $\omega_0$ and the other two, third harmonics, with $3\omega_0$. In each pair, one term scales like the amplitude of the linear wave to the five-thirds, and the other to the seven-thirds.</description>

      <title>GAP-DFT: A graph-based alchemical perturbation density functional theory for catalytic high-entropy alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-entropy alloys (HEAs) exhibit exceptional catalytic performance due to their complex surface structures. However, the vast number of active binding sites in HEAs, as opposed to conventional alloys, presents a significant computational challenge in catalytic applications. To tackle this challenge, robust methods must be developed to efficiently explore the configurational space of HEA catalysts. Here, we introduce a novel approach that combines alchemical perturbation density functional theory (APDFT) with a graph-based correction scheme to explore the binding energy landscape HEAs. Our results demonstrate that APDFT can accurately predict binding energies for isoelectronic permutations in HEAs at minimal computational cost, significantly accelerating configurational space sampling. However, APDFT errors increase substantially when permutations occur near binding sites. To address this issue, we developed a graph-based Gaussian process regression model to correct discrepancies between APDFT and conventional density functional theory values. Our approach enables the prediction of binding energies for hundreds of thousands of configurations with a mean average error of 30 meV, requiring a handful of ab initio simulations.</description>

      <title>Substrate-induced spin-torque-like signal in spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oxide thin films and interfaces with strong spin-orbit coupling have recently shown exceptionally high charge-to-spin conversion, making them potential spin-source materials for spintronics. Epitaxial strain engineering using oxide substrates with different lattice constants and symmetries has emerged as a mean to further enhance charge-to-spin conversion. However, high relative permittivity and dielectric loss of commonly used oxide substrates, such as SrTiO3, can cause significant current shunting in substrates at high frequency, which may strongly affect spin-torque measurement and potentially result in an inaccurate estimation of charge-to-spin conversion efficiency. In this study, we systematically evaluate the influence of various oxide substrates for the widely-used spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR) measurement. Surprisingly, we observed substantial spin-torque signals in samples comprising only ferromagnetic metal on oxide substrates with high relative permittivity (e.g., SrTiO3 and KTaO3), where negligible signal should be initially expected. Notably, this unexpected signal shows a strong correlation with the capacitive reactance of oxide substrates and the leakage radio frequency (RF) current within the substrate. By revising the conventional ST-FMR analysis model, we attribute this phenomenon to a 90-degree phase difference between the RF current flowing in the metal layer and in the substrate. We suggest that extra attention should be paid during the ST-FMR measurements, as this artifact could dominate over the real spin-orbit torque signal from high-resistivity spin-source materials grown on substrate with high relative permittivity.</description>

      <title>Interplay between Nucleation and Kinetics in Dynamic Twinning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we apply a phase-field modeling framework to elucidate the interplay between nucleation and kinetics in the dynamic evolution of twinning interfaces. The key feature of this phase-field approach is the ability to transparently and explicitly specify nucleation and kinetic behavior in the model, in contrast to other regularized interface models. We use this to study 2 distinct problems where it is essential to explicitly specify the kinetic and nucleation behavior governing twin evolution.
  First, we study twinning interfaces in 2-d. When these interfaces are driven to move, we find that significant levels of twin nucleation occur ahead of the moving interface. Essentially, the finite interface velocity and the relaxation time of the stresses ahead of the interface allows for nucleation to occur before the interface is able to propagate to that point. Second, we study the growth of needle twins in antiplane elasticity. We show that both nucleation and anisotropic kinetics are essential to obtain predictions of needle twins. While standard regularized interface approaches do not permit the transparent specification of anisotropic kinetics, this is readily possible with the phase-field approach that we have used here.</description>

      <title>High-quality imaging of large areas through path-difference ptychography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tilting planar samples for multi-zone-axes observation is a routine procedure in electron microscopy. However, this process invariably introduces optical path differences in the electron beam across different sample positions, significantly compromising image quality, particularly over large fields of view. To address this challenge, we developed path difference ptychography (PDP), a method capable of decoupling path differences from the four-dimensional data during reconstruction. This enables the acquisition of high-quality, large-scale images, facilitating a more comprehensive understanding and analysis of materials microstructure. Moreover, PDP has the potential to promote the widespread application of ptychographic tomography in the analysis of planar samples.</description>

      <title>Dielectric Reliability and Interface Trap Characterization in MOCVD grown In-situ Al$_2$O$_3$ on $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the in-situ growth of Al$_2$O$_3$ on $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ using metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) at a high temperature of 800{\deg}C. The Al$_2$O$_3$ is grown within the same reactor as the $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$, employing trimethylaluminum (TMAl) and O$_2$ as precursors without breaking the vacuum. We characterize the shallow and deep-level traps through stressed capacitance-voltage (C-V) and photo-assisted C-V methods. The high-temperature deposited dielectric demonstrates an impressive breakdown field of approximately 10 MV/cm. Furthermore, we evaluate the reliability and lifetime of the dielectrics using time-dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) measurements. By modifying the dielectric deposition process to include a high-temperature (800{\deg}C) thin interfacial layer and a low-temperature (600{\deg}C) bulk layer, we report a 10-year lifetime under a stress field of 3.5 MV/cm along a breakdown field of 7.8 MV/cm.</description>

      <title>Non-trivial Topological Surface States Regulation of 1T-OsCoTe$_2$ Enables Selective C-C Coupling for Highly Efficient Photochemical CO$_2$ Reduction Toward C$_{2+}$ hydrocarbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite ongoing research, the rational design of nontrivial topological semimetal surface states for the selective photocatalytic CO$_2$ conversion into valuable products remains full of challenges. Herein, we present the synthesis of 1T-OsCoTe$_2$ for the photoreduction upgrading of CO$_2$ to tricarbon alkane C$_3$H$_8$,by the integration of experimental work and theory calculation. Experimental studies suggested a high electron based selectivity of 71.2% for C$_3$H$_8$ and an internal quantum efficiency of 54.6% at 380 nm. In-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy demonstrated that Co and Os atoms coordinated with Te atoms enable an efficient Os-Te-Co electron transfer to activate the generation of *CH$_3$,*CHOCO and *CH$_2$OCOCO. Density functional theory calculations further confirmed Os-Te-Co electron bridging on the improved CO$_2$ conversion kinetics. To our knowledge, this is the first report suggesting the role of Os atoms in accelerating the photocatalytic CO$_2$ conversion activity of the topological semimetal 1T-OsCoTe$_2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological semimetals with protected surface states mark a new paradigm of research beyond the early landmarks of band-structure engineering, allowing fabrication of efficient catalyst to harness the rich metallic surface states to activate specific chemical processes. Herein, we demonstrate a facile solid-phase method for in-situ doping of Ir at the Os sites in the Os3Sn7, an alloy with topological states, which significantly improves the photocatalytic performance for the reduction of CO2 to CO and CH4. Experimental evidence combined with theoretical calculations reveal that the nontrivial topological surface states greatly accelerate charge-separation/electron-enrichment and adsorption/activation of CO2 molecules, rendering highly efficient reaction channels to stimulate the formation of *COOH and *CO, as well CHO*. This work shows the promise of achieving high photocatalytic performances with synthesizing topological catalysts and provides hints on the design of novel topological catalysts with superior photoactivity towards the CO2 reduction reaction.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we derive a Cauer network reluctivity model for soft magnetic composite materials. The Cauer network components are closed-form expressions consisting only of such parameters that have a clear physical meaning. The parameters include particle permeability, particle conductivity, insulation permeability, insulation thickness, volume fraction, mean particle diameter, variance of particle diameters, and maximal particle diameter. The particle volumes are assumed to be beta-distributed. Since the model is a network, it is immediately available in both frequency- and time domains.</description>

      <title>High-areal-capacity Na-ion battery electrode with uncompromised energy and power densities by simultaneous electrospinning-spraying fabrication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are cost-effective alternatives to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), but their low energy density remains a challenge. Current electrode designs fail to simultaneously achieve high areal loading, high active content, and superior performance. In response, this work introduces an ideal electrode structure, featuring a continuous conductive network with active particles securely trapped in the absence of binder, fabricated using a universal technique that combines electrospinning and electrospraying (co-ESP). We found that the particle size must be larger than the network's pores for optimised performance, an aspect overlooked in previous research. The free-standing co-ESP Na2V3(PO4)3 (NVP) cathodes demonstrated state-of-the-art 296 mg cm-2 areal loading with 97.5 wt.% active content, as well as remarkable rate-performance and cycling stability. Co-ESP full cells showed uncompromised energy and power densities (231.6 Wh kg-1 and 7152.6 W kg-1), leading among reported SIBs with industry-relevant areal loadings. The structural merit is analysed using multi-scale X-ray computed tomography, providing valuable design insights.Finally, the superior performance is validated in the pouch cells, highlighting the electrode's scalability and potential for commercial application.</description>

      <title>Spin-orbit-splitting-driven nonlinear Hall effect in NbIrTe4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Berry curvature dipole (BCD) serves as a one of the fundamental contributors to emergence of the nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE). Despite intense interest due to its potential for new technologies reaching beyond the quantum efficiency limit, the interplay between BCD and NLHE has been barely understood yet in the absence of a systematic study on the electronic band structure. Here, we report NLHE realized in NbIrTe4 that persists above room temperature coupled with a sign change in the Hall conductivity at 150 K. First-principles calculations combined with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements show that BCD tuned by the partial occupancy of spin-orbit split bands via temperature is responsible for the temperature-dependent NLHE. Our findings highlight the correlation between BCD and the electronic band structure, providing a viable route to create and engineer the non-trivial Hall effect by tuning the geometric properties of quasiparticles in transition-metal chalcogen compounds.</description>

      <title>Surface reconstruction limited magnetism of the nodal loop semimetal Ca$_3$P$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nodal loop semimetals are topological materials with drumhead surface states characterized by reduced kinetic energy. If the Fermi energy of such a system is near these nondispersive states interaction among charge carriers substantially impacts their electronic structure. The emergence of magnetism in these surface states is one of the possible consequences. Ca3P2 an already synthesized material possesses a remarkably large nodal loop which is situated exactly at the Fermi level of the bulk system. In the present work, we investigate how surface magnetism is impacted by surface reconstruction and lattice termination in finite slabs in this material. We show that a slight deviation from the stoichiometric occupation of Ca sites results in the stabilization of magnetic patterns.</description>

      <title>Bridging experiment and theory of relaxor ferroelectrics at the atomic scale with multislice electron ptychography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Introducing structural and/or chemical heterogeneity into otherwise ordered crystals can dramatically alter material properties. Lead-based relaxor ferroelectrics are a prototypical example, with decades of investigation having connected chemical and structural heterogeneity to their unique properties. While theory has pointed to the formation of an ensemble of ``slush''-like polar domains, the lack of direct, spatially resolved volumetric data comparable to simulations presents a significant challenge in measuring the spatial distribution and correlation of local chemistry and structure with the physics underlying relaxor behavior. Here, we address this challenge through three-dimensional volumetric characterization of the prototypical relaxor ferroelectric \ce{0.68Pb(Mg$_{1/3}$Nb$_{2/3}$)O3-0.32PbTiO$_3$} using multislice electron ptychography. Direct comparison with molecular dynamics simulations reveals the intimate relationship between the polar structure and unit-cell level charge imbalance induced by chemical disorder. Further, polar nanodomains are maintained through local correlations arising from residual short-range chemical order. Acting in concert with the chemical heterogeneities, it is also shown that compressive strain enhances out-of-plane correlations and ferroelectric-like order without affecting the in-plane relaxor-like structure. Broadly, these findings provide a pathway to enable detailed atomic scale understanding for hierarchical control of polar domains in relaxor ferroelectric materials and devices, and also present significant opportunities to tackle other heterogeneous systems using complementary theoretical and experimental studies.</description>

      <title>Development of a Dual-Spectroscopic System to Rapidly Measure Diisopropyl Methyl Phosphonate (DIMP) Decomposition and Temperature in a Reactive Powder Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of systems to measure and optimize emerging energetic material performance is critical for CWA defeat. This study documents a combination of two spectroscopic systems designed to monitor decomposition of a CWA simulant and temperature. The first system is a custom benchtop Polygonal Rotating Mirror Infrared Spectrometer (PRiMIRS) incorporating a fully customizable sample cell to observe decomposition of DIMP as it interacts with combusting composite metal particles. The second is TDLAS used to monitor increases in background gas temperatures as the composite metal powders combust. The PRiMIRS system demonstrates a very high SNR at Hz, reasonable SNR when operating at 100 Hz, and capabilities of resolving spectral features with a FWHM resolution of 15 cm^-1. TDLAS was able to monitor temperature rises between room temperature and 230C +/- 5C at 100 Hz.For testing, liquid DIMP was inserted in a preheated SS cell to generate DIMP vapor and (Al-8Mg):Zr metal powders were ignited in a SS mount with a resistively heated nichrome wire at one end of the cell. The ignited particles propagated across the cell containing DIMP vapor. The path averaged gas temperature in the preheated SS cell rises rapidly (100ms) and decays slowly (&lt; 5 s) but remains below 230C during particle combustion, a temperature at which the thermal decomposition of DIMP is not observed over similarly short timescales (seconds). However, when combusting particles were introduced to the DIMP vapor (heterogenous environment), spectral signatures indicative of decomposition products such as IMP and IPA were observed within seconds.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear scintillation effects in the intrinsic luminescence from Sc$_{1.318}$Y$_{0.655}$Si$_{1.013}$O$_{4.987}$ crystal excited by electrons and gamma-quanta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spectral and kinetic properties of intrinsic luminescence from (Y$_2$Sc$_1$)$_{0.(3)}$(Sc)[Si]O$_5$ crystal are studied. The emission is excited by electrons and gamma-quanta. The composition (Y$_2$Sc$_1$)$_{0.(3)}$(Sc)[Si]O$_5$ is the congruent one for Sc$_2$SiO$_5$-Y$_2$SiO$_5$ solid solutions. It is found, that the crystal emits fairly bright intrinsic cathodololuminescence (CL) and radioluminescence (RL) at room temperature. In particular, the light yield of scintillation excited by -quanta with the energies of 661.7 keV is of 12000 photons/MeV. An increase in the beam flux by $\sim$20 times leads to the shift in the maximum CL energy spectral density from 315 to 340 nm and to the decrease in the CL decay time at 415 nm from 1377 +/- 3 ns to 1165 +/- 1 ns. Simultaneously, the decay time of RL excited by a photoelectron with the energy of 644.7 keV is of 1310 +/- 10 ns while a Compton electron with the energy of 477 keV excites RL with the decay time of 1050 +/- 10 ns. Also, we observed differences in the CL yield dependencies on the volume-averaged density of electronic excitations (EEs) at different wavelengths. An explanation of the results is given considering the nonlinear scintillation phenomena induced by an interaction between EEs. It is based on a conception that an increase in EE volume density leads to an increase in EEs nonradiative quenching due to these interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of topological defects in exciton behavior in (6,5) semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes using density functional theory. Our study identifies the helical Stone-Wales defect as a prominent trap for triplet excitons, characterized by a large zero-field splitting consistent with experimental data and a small singlet-triplet gap. The weak electron-phonon coupling, as evidenced by a Huang-Rhys factor of 0.74, renders it a promising single-photon emitter, with the zero-phonon line predicted at 1.6 $\mu$m, within the telecom range. These insights into defect-engineered electronic structure and exciton dynamics offer promising opportunities for improving the performance of carbon nanotube-based quantum light sources and optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Nonmonotonic Hall effect of Weyl semimetals under magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hall effect of topological quantum materials often reveals essential new physics and possesses potential for application. Magnetic Weyl semimetal is one especially interesting example that hosts an interplay between the spontaneous time-reversal symmetry-breaking topology and the external magnetic field. However, it is less known beyond the anomalous Hall effect thereof, which is unable to account for plenty of magnetotransport measurements. We propose a new Hall effect characteristically nonmonotonic with respect to the external field, intrinsic to the three-dimensional Weyl topology and free from chemical potential fine-tuning. Two related mechanisms from the Landau level bending and chiral Landau level shifting are found, together with their relation to Shubnikov-de Hass effect. This field-dependent Hall response, universal to thin films and bulk samples, provides a concrete physical picture for existing measurements and is promising to guide future experiments.</description>

      <title>Optical and microstructural studies of femtosecond laser treated amorphous germanium thin coatings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of the relaxation mechanism of amorphous germanium after femtosecond laser irradiation is presented in this work. In particular, a thin germanium coating was deposited onto a glass substrate through the electron beam vacuum coating method. The substrate was kept at room temperature during the coating process, which resulted in a deposited layer characterized by an amorphous microstructure, as observed from the X-ray diffraction. The germanium layer was then irradiated with a femtosecond laser at 1030 nm wavelength, while varying the net fluence from 15 J cm-2 to 90 J cm-2. Moreover, an extended two temperature model was used to extract the electronic and lattice temperature of the laser heated germanium coating, showing a 32% contribution from heating due to the thermal accumulation effect. The microstructural and morphological studies of the irradiated samples were carried out using X-ray diffraction and high-resolution scanning electron microscopy. From the X-ray diffraction results, it was observed that at higher laser fluence there is an emergence of crystallinity on the germanium layer, with no evidence of oxidation. On the surface, the morphology was observed to evolve to granular sphere, attributed to melting of the material. Finally, an increase in absorbance with laser fluence was observed and the optical band gap of the coating was calculated.</description>

      <title>High quality epitaxial piezoelectric and ferroelectric wurtzite Al$_{1-x}$Sc$_x$N thin films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Piezoelectric and ferroelectric wurtzite are promising to reshape modern microelectronics because they can be easily integrated with mainstream semiconductor technology. Sc doped AlN (Al$_{1-x}$Sc$_x$N) has attracted much attention for its enhanced piezoelectric and emerging ferroelectric properties, yet the commonly used sputtering results in polycrystalline Al$_{1-x}$Sc$_x$N films with high leakage current. Here we report the pulsed laser deposition of single crystalline epitaxial Al$_{1-x}$Sc$_x$N thin films on sapphire and 4H-SiC substrates. Pure wurtzite phase is maintained up to $x = 0.3$ with minimal oxygen contamination. Polarization is estimated to be 140 $\mu$C/cm$^2$ via atomic scale microscopy imaging and found to be switchable via a scanning probe. The piezoelectric coefficient is found to be 5 times of undoped one when $x = 0.3$, making it desirable for high frequency radiofrequency (RF) filters and three-dimensional nonvolatile memories.</description>

Abstract: Neural networks are gaining widespread relevance for their versatility, holding the promise to yield a significant methodological shift in different domain of applied research. Here, we provide a simple pedagogical account of the basic functioning of a feedforward neural network. Then we move forward to reviewing two recent applications of machine learning to Earth and Materials Science. We will in particular begin by discussing a neural network based geothermobarometer, which returns reliable predictions of the pressure/temperature conditions of magma storage. Further, we will turn to illustrate how machine learning tools, tested on the list of minerals from the International Mineralogical Association, can help in the search for novel superconducting materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Responsiveness to multiple stimuli and adaptivity are paramount for designing smart multifunctional materials. In soft, partially ordered systems, these features can often be achieved via self-assembly, allowing for the combination of diverse components in a complex nanostructured material. Here, we demonstrate an example of a liquid that simultaneously displays both ferroelectric and ferromagnetic types of order. This material is a nanostructured liquid crystalline hybrid comprising ferrimagnetic barium hexaferrite nanoplatelets suspended in a ferroelectric nematic host. Director-mediated interactions drive the self-assembly of nanoplatelets in an intricate network. Due to the couplings between the polar electric and magnetic types of order, this material demonstrates magnetically driven electric and nonlinear optical responses, as well as electrically driven magnetic response. Such multiferroic liquids are highly promising for applications in energy harvesting, nonlinear optics, and sensors.</description>

      <title>How to use the dispersion in the $\chi^{(3)}$ tensor for broadband generation of polarization-entangled photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polarization-entangled photon pairs are a widely used resource in quantum optics and technologies, and are often produced using a nonlinear process. Most sources based on spontaneous parametric downconversion have relatively narrow optical bandwidth because the pump, signal and idler frequencies must satisfy a phase-matching condition. Extending the bandwidth, for example to achieve spectral multiplexing, requires changing some experimental parameters such as temperature, crystal angle, poling period, etc. Here, we demonstrate broadband (tens of THz for each photon) generation of polarization-entangled photon pairs by spontaneous four-wave mixing in a diamond crystal, with a simple colinear geometry requiring no further optical engineering. Our approach leverages the quantum interference between electronic and vibrational contributions to the $\chi^{(3)}$ tensor. Entanglement is characterized in a single realization of a Bell test over the entire bandwidth using fiber dispersion spectroscopy and fast single-photon detectors. The results agree with the biphoton wavefunction predicted from the knowledge of the $\chi^{(3)}$ and Raman tensors and demonstrate the general applicability of our approach to other crystalline materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magnetite/water interface is commonly found in nature and plays a crucial role in various technological applications. However, our understanding of its structural and dynamical properties at the molecular scale remains still limited. In this study, we develop an efficient Behler-Parrinello neural network potential (NNP) for the magnetite/water system, paying particular attention to the accurate generation of reference data with density functional theory. Using this NNP, we performed extensive molecular dynamics simulations of the magnetite (001) surface across a wide range of water coverages, from the single molecule to bulk water. Our simulations revealed several new ground states of low coverage water on the Subsurface Cation Vacancy (SCV) model and yielded a density profile of water at the surface that exhibits marked layering. By calculating mean square displacements, we obtained quantitative information on the diffusion of water molecules on the SCV for different coverages, revealing significant anisotropy. Additionally, our simulations provided qualitative insights into the dissociation mechanisms of water molecules at the surface.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mode-coupling theory (MCT) of the glass transition ranks among the most successful first-principles kinetic theories to describe glassy dynamics. However, MCT does not fully account for crucial aspects of the dynamics near the glass transition. To facilitate improving the theory, we critically test the approximations inherent in MCT for a supercooled mixture using Brownian dynamics simulations. Although each MCT approximation significantly impacts the predicted dynamics, our findings show that long-time cancellations of errors occur due to static and dynamic approximations of four-point correlation functions, with the validity of these approximations remaining relatively constant across different temperatures. Notably, the MCT form of the memory functional maintains remarkably high accuracy even in the supercooled regime when evaluated with the intermediate scattering function from simulations. The primary discrepancies between theoretical predictions and experimental results arise from the self-consistent nature of the MCT equations, which amplify minor errors in the memory kernel. This suggests that minor corrections to the memory functional could substantially enhance the theory's predictive accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the rejuvenation of thin films of polystyrene (PS) as they are heated from stable glassy states - prepared either through vapour deposition or physical aging. For films with thickness $h \gtrsim 200$ nm, the rejuvenation of vapour deposited stable PS glass films follow behaviour well-documented for other stable glasses. For films with thickness $h \lesssim 160$nm the behaviour of the vapour deposited films becomes more complicated. This behaviour is characterized for different film thicknesses. The results are compared with vapour deposited films that are aged after rejuvenation or spincast and aged. Collectively, the results of these studies strongly suggest two distinct mechanisms that can result in rejuvenation, and hence two distinct relaxation processes that can couple to the material density. The two physical mechanisms can provide insight into poorly understood or apparently contradictory aspects of $T_g$ measurements in thin PS films.</description>

      <title>Tuning intrinsic anomalous Hall effect from large to zero in two ferromagnetic states of SmMn2Ge2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19581v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) in a ferromagnetic metal is completely determined by its band structure. Since the spin orientation direction is an important band-structure tuning parameter, it is highly desirable to study the anomalous Hall effect in a system with multiple spin reorientation transitions. We study a layered tetragonal room temperature ferromagnet SmMn2Ge2, which gives us the opportunity to measure magnetotransport properties where the long c-axis and the short a-axis can both be magnetically easy axes depending on the temperature range we choose. We show a moderately large fully intrinsic AHC up to room temperature when the crystal is magnetized along the c-axis. Interestingly, the AHC can be tuned to completely extrinsic with extremely large values when the crystal is magnetized along the a-axis, regardless of whether the a-axis is magnetically easy or hard axis. First-principles calculations show that nodal line states originate from Mn-d orbitals just below the Fermi energy (EF) in the electronic band structure when the spins are oriented along the c-axis. Intrinsic AHC originates from the Berry curvature effect of the gapped nodal lines in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. AHC almost disappears when the spins are aligned along the a-axis because the nodal line states shift above EF and become unoccupied. Since the AHC can be tuned from fully extrinsic to intrinsic even at 300 K, SmMn2Ge2 becomes a potential candidate for room-temperature spintronics applications.</description>

Abstract: Silicon microelectronics, consisting of complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology, have changed nearly all aspects of human life from communication to transportation, entertainment, and healthcare. Despite the widespread and mainstream use, current silicon-based devices suffer significant reliability issues at temperatures exceeding 125 C. The emergent technological frontiers of space exploration, geothermal energy harvesting, nuclear energy, unmanned avionic systems, and autonomous driving will rely on control systems, sensors, and communication devices which operate at temperatures as high as 500 C and beyond. At these extreme temperatures, active (heat exchanger, phase change cooling) or passive (fins and thermal interface materials) cooling strategies add significant mass and complication which is often infeasible. Thus, new material solutions beyond conventional silicon CMOS devices are necessary for high temperature, resilient electronic systems. Accomplishing this will require a united effort to explore development, integration, and ultimately manufacturing of non-silicon-based logic and memory technologies, non-traditional metals for interconnects, and ceramic packaging technology.</description>

      <title>Grain boundary segregation prediction with a dual-solute model</title>

Abstract: Solute segregation along grain boundaries (GBs) profoundly affects their thermodynamic and kinetic behaviors in polycrystalline materials. Recently, the spectral approach has emerged as a powerful tool to predict GB segregation. However, previous GB segregation predictions using this method relied heavily on single-solute segregation energy spectrum without solute-solute interactions, which were often incorporated through a fitting parameter. In this work, we developed a dual-solute model whose segregation energy spectrum intrinsically incorporates solute-solute interactions. It was first validated for GB segregation prediction in the Al-Mg system and then extended to several other distinct binary alloy systems. The dual-solute model shows significant improvement over the single-solute model and can accurately predict the real segregation states obtained by hybrid Molecular Dynamics/Monte Carlo simulations within a broad temperature range with different solute concentrations before forming secondary phases. This dual-solute model provides an effective method for accurately predicting GB segregation in nanocrystalline metals.</description>

      <title>Fitting to magnetic forces improves the reliability of magnetic Moment Tensor Potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07069v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We developed a method for fitting machine-learning interatomic potentials with magnetic degrees of freedom, namely, magnetic Moment Tensor Potentials (mMTP). The main feature of our method consists in fitting mMTP to magnetic forces (negative derivatives of energies with respect to magnetic moments) as obtained spin-polarized density functional theory calculations. We test our method on the bcc Fe-Al system with different compositions. Specifically, we calculate formation energies, equilibrium lattice parameter, and total cell magnetization. Our findings demonstrate an accurate correspondence between the values calculated with mMTP and those obtained by DFT at zero temperature. Additionally, using molecular dynamics, we estimate the finite-temperature lattice parameter and capture the cell expansion as was previously revealed in experiment. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fitting to magnetic forces increases the reliability of structure relaxation (or, equilibration), in the sense of ensuring that every relaxation run ends up with a successfully relaxed structure (the failure may otherwise be caused by falsely driving a configuration away from the region covered in the training set).</description>

      <title>Finite-temperature properties of antiferroelectric perovskite $\rm PbZrO_3$ from deep learning interatomic potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09011v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The prototypical antiferroelectric perovskite $\rm PbZrO_3$ (PZO) has garnered considerable attentions in recent years due to its significance in technological applications and fundamental research. Many unresolved issues in PZO are associated with large length- and time-scales, as well as finite temperatures, presenting significant challenges for first-principles density functional theory studies. Here, we introduce a deep learning interatomic potential of PZO, enabling investigation of finite-temperature properties through large-scale atomistic simulations. Trained using an elaborately designed dataset, the model successfully reproduces a large number of phases, in particular, the recently discovered 80-atom antiferroelectric $Pnam$ phase and ferrielectric $Ima2$ phase, providing precise predictions for their structural and dynamical properties. Using this model, we investigated phase transitions of multiple phases, including $Pbam$/$Pnam$, $Ima2$ and $R3c$, which show high similarity to the experimental observation. Our simulation results also highlight the crucial role of free-energy in determining the low-temperature phase of PZO, reconciling the apparent contradiction: $Pbam$ is the most commonly observed phase in experiments, while theoretical calculations predict other phases exhibiting even lower energy. Furthermore, in the temperature range where the $Pbam$ phase is thermodynamically stable, typical double polarization hysteresis loops for antiferroelectrics were obtained, along with a detailed elucidation of the structural evolution during the electric-field induced transitions between the non-polar $Pbam$ and polar $R3c$ phases.</description>

      <title>Damage mechanisms in polyalkenes irradiated with ultra-short XUV/x-ray laser pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although polymers are widely used in laser-irradiation research, their microscopic response to high-intensity ultrafast XUV or X-ray irradiation is still largely unknown. Here we comparatively study homologous series of alkenes. XTANT-3 hybrid simulation toolkit is used to determine their damage kinetics and irradiation threshold doses. The code simultaneously models the nonequilibrium electron kinetics, the energy transfer between electrons and atoms via nonadiabatic electron-ion (electron-phonon) coupling, nonthermal modification of the interatomic potential due to electronic excitation, and the ensuing atomic response and damage formation. It is shown that the lowest damage threshold is associated with local defect creation such as dehydrogenation, various group detachment from the backbone, or polymer strand cross-linking. At higher doses, the disintegration of the molecules leads to a transient metallic liquid state. We identify nonthermal effects as the leading mechanism of damage, whereas the thermal (electron-ion coupling) channel influences the kinetics only slightly in the case of femtosecond-pulse irradiation. Despite notably different properties of the studied alkene polymers, the ultrafast-X-ray damage threshold doses are found to be very close to ~0.05 eV/atom in all three materials: polyethylene, polypropylene, and polybutylene.</description>

      <title>Evaluating fracture energy predictions using phase-field and gradient-enhanced damage models for elastomers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the phase field method has been increasingly used for brittle fractures in soft materials like polymers, elastomers, and biological tissues. When considering finite deformations to account for the highly deformable nature of soft materials, the convergence of the phase-field method becomes challenging, especially in scenarios of unstable crack growth. To overcome these numerical difficulties, several approaches have been introduced, with artificial viscosity being among the most widely utilized. This study investigates the energy release rate due to crack propagation in hyperelastic nearly-incompressible materials and compares the phase-field method and a novel gradient-enhanced damage (GED) approach. First, we simulate unstable loading scenarios using the phase-field method, which leads to convergence problems. To address these issues, we introduce artificial viscosity to stabilize the problem and analyze its impact on the energy release rate utilizing a domain J-integral approach giving quantitative measurements during crack propagation. It is observed that the measured energy released rate during crack propagation does not comply with the imposed critical energy release rate, and shows non-monotonic behavior. In the second part of the paper, we introduce a novel stretch-based GED model as an alternative to the phase-field method for modeling crack evolution in elastomers. It is demonstrated that in this method, the energy release rate can be obtained as an output of the simulation rather than as an input which could be useful in the exploration of rate-dependent responses, as one could directly impose chain-level criteria for damage initiation. We show that while this novel approach provides reasonable results for fracture simulations, it still suffers from some numerical issues that strain-based GED formulations are known to be susceptible to.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Coexistence of Spin States in [Fe-(tpy-ph)$_2$]$^{2+}$ Complexes on Au(111) using ab initio calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07014v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we systematically study the electronic structure and stability of spin states of the [Fe-(tpy-ph)$_2$]$^{2+}$ molecule in both gas phase and on a Au(111) substrate using density functional theory +U (DFT+U) calculations. We find that the stability of the Fe$^{2+}$ ion's spin states is significantly influenced by the Hubbard U parameter. In the gas phase, the low-spin (LS, S=0) state is found to be energetically favorable for U(Fe) $\leq$ 3 eV, whereas the high-spin (HS, S=2) state is stabilized for U(Fe) &gt; 3 eV. Interaction with the Au(111) substrate is found to elevate the critical U for the spin-state transition to 3.5 eV. Additionally, we perform L-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) calculations based on time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) for both HS and LS states. The calculated XAS suggests that the HS state more closely aligns with the experimental observations, indicating the potential coexistence of the HS state as the initial state during the X-ray excitation process. These findings enrich our understanding of spin-state dynamics in [Fe-(tpy-ph)$_2$]$^{2+}$.</description>

      <title>High Strain Rate Compressive Deformation Behavior of Nickel Microparticles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanical properties of metals at extreme conditions is essential for the advancement of miniaturized technologies. As dimensions decrease, materials will experience higher strain rates at the same applied velocities. Moreover, the interplay effects of strain rates and temperatures are often overlooked and could have critical effects in applications. In this study, for the first time, the rate-dependent and temperature-dependent mechanical response of nickel microparticles have been investigated. The microparticles were obtained by solid-state dewetting of nickel thin films deposited on c-sapphire. They exhibit self-similar shapes with identical sets of planes, facilitating straightforward comparison between particles. This research represents the first in-depth analysis of the mechanical properties of nickel single crystal dewetted microparticles across six orders of magnitude at room temperature and three orders of magnitude at 128 K. Molecular dynamic simulations (MD) were conducted in parallel on particles with the same faceting. In this work, the gap between experiments and simulations has been reduced to over one order of magnitude in size and 3 orders of magnitude in the strain rates. The thermal activation parameter analysis and MD simulations were employed to ascertain whether homogeneous or heterogeneous dislocation nucleation was the dominant mechanism controlling deformation in the particles.</description>

      <title>Universal platform of point-gap topological phases from topological materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.08110v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Whereas point-gap topological phases are responsible for exceptional phenomena intrinsic to non-Hermitian systems, their realization in quantum materials is still elusive. Here we propose a simple and universal platform of point-gap topological phases constructed from Hermitian topological insulators and superconductors. We show that (d-1)-dimensional point-gap topological phases are realized by making a boundary in d-dimensional topological insulators and superconductors dissipative. A crucial observation of the proposal is that adding a decay constant to boundary modes in d-dimensional topological insulators and superconductors is topologically equivalent to attaching a (d-1)-dimensional point-gap topological phase to the boundary. We furthermore establish the proposal from the extended version of the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem, relating dissipative gapless modes to point-gap topological numbers. From the bulk-boundary correspondence of the point-gap topological phases, the resultant point-gap topological phases exhibit exceptional boundary states or in-gap higher-order non-Hermitian skin effects.</description>

      <title>Universal collective Larmor-Silin mode emerging in magnetized correlated Dirac fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14358v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Employing large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we find in magnetized interacting Dirac fermion model, there emerges a new and universal collective Larmor-Silin spin wave mode in the transverse dynamical spin susceptibility. Such mode purely originates from the interaction among Dirac fermions and distinguishes itself from the usual particle-hole continuum with finite lifetime and clear dispersion, both at small and large momenta in a large portion of the Brillouin zone. Our unbiased numerical results offer the dynamic signature of this new collective excitations in interacting Dirac fermion systems, and provide experimental guidance for inelastic neutron scattering, electron spin resonance and other spectroscopic approaches in the investigation of such universal collective modes in quantum Moire materials, topological insulators and quantum spin liquid materials under magnetic field, with quintessential interaction nature beyond the commonly assumed noninteracting Dirac fermion or spinon approximations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I present a tensorial approach to the description of $\vec{k}/-\vec{k}$-symmetric, time-reversal-odd splitting of electronic bands in magnetic materials, which can be of non-relativistic origin and was recently given the name of `altermagnetism'. I demonstrate that tensors provide a general framework to discuss magnetic symmetry using both spin groups and magnetic point groups, which have often been contrasted in recent literature. I also provide a natural classification of altermagnets in terms of the lowest-order tensorial forms that are permitted in each of the 69 altermagnetic point groups. This approach clarifies the connection between altermagnetism and well-known bulk properties, establishing that the vast majority of altermagnetic materials must also be piezomagnetic and MOKE-active, and provides a rational criterion to search for potential altermagnets among known materials and to test them when the magnetic structure is unknown or ambiguous.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional Dirac semimetals (DSMs) have been shown to exhibit one-dimensional hinge modes which are termed the higher-order hinge Fermi-arc (HOFA) states. They are the topological consequences of Dirac points. Superconducting states from Dirac semimetals can inherit the Dirac points to form nodal Dirac superconducting states, raising a question of whether there exists a topological superconducting bulk-hinge correspondence similar to DSMs. In this work, we discuss the nodal superconducting states from half-filled DSMs respecting non-magnetic (Type-II) Shubnikov space group (SSG) $P6/mmm1'$. We find that the BdG Dirac points can lead to higher-order topological Dirac superconducting (HOTDSC) states instead of the expected higher-order Majorana-arc (HOMA) states. The HOTDSC states can be regarded as a crossing between the HOFAs in normal states and the BdG shadow states. We demonstrate that HOTDSC states can be indicated by relative topologies of BdG Dirac points by utilizing the theory of magnetic topological quantum chemistry (MTQC).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multilayer nanoscale systems incorporating buried ultrathin tunnel oxides, 2D materials, and solid electrolytes are crucial for next-generation logics, memory, quantum and neuro-inspired computing. Still, an ultrathin layer control at angstrom scale is challenging for cutting-edge applications. Here we introduce a scalable approach utilizing focused ion-beam annealing for buried ultrathin oxides engineering with angstrom-scale thickness control. Our molecular dynamics simulations of Ne+ irradiation on Al/a-AlOx/Al structure confirms the pivotal role of ion generated crystal defects. We experimentally demonstrate its performance on Josephson junction tunning in the resistance range of 2 to 37% with a standard deviation of 0.86% across 25x25 mm chip. Moreover, we showcase +-17 MHz frequency control (+-0.172 A tunnel barrier thickness) for superconducting transmon qubits with coherence times up to 500 us, which is promising for useful fault-tolerant quantum computing. This work ensures ultrathin multilayer nanosystems engineering at the ultimate scale by depth-controlled crystal defects generation.</description>
