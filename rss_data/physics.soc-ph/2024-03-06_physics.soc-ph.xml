      <title>Entanglement: Balancing Punishment and Compensation, Repeated Dilemma Game-Theoretic Analysis of Maximum Compensation Problem for Bypass and Least Cost Paths in Fact-Checking, Case of Fake News with Weak Wallace's Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research note is organized with respect to a novel approach to solving problems related to the spread of fake news and effective fact-checking. Focusing on the least-cost routing problem, the discussion is organized with respect to the use of Metzler functions and Metzler matrices to model the dynamics of information propagation among news providers. With this approach, we designed a strategy to minimize the spread of fake news, which is detrimental to informational health, while at the same time maximizing the spread of credible information. In particular, through the punitive dominance problem and the maximum compensation problem, we developed and examined a path to reassess the incentives of news providers to act and to analyze their impact on the equilibrium of the information market. By applying the concept of entanglement to the context of information propagation, we shed light on the complexity of interactions among news providers and contribute to the formulation of more effective information management strategies. This study provides new theoretical and practical insights into issues related to fake news and fact-checking, and will be examined against improving informational health and public digital health.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Theory of Interactions -- I. The General Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding realistic complex systems requires confronting significant conceptual, theoretical and experimental limitations rooted in the persistence of views that originated in the mechanics of simple moving bodies. We define the category of complex multiscale stochastic systems as a useful device for capturing the minimally required complexity of many types of phenomena. In doing so, we provide evidence indicating that determinism, continuity and reversibility can lead to theoretical inadequacies that manifest as intractability, inaccuracies or non-representativeness when applied to complex systems. We take the view that interactions are fundamental and summarize their portrayal across many disciplines. Despite their centrality, interactions remain largely neglected as subjects of research interest of their own. We hypothesize that a generalized theory of interactions may help organize evidence from multiple scientific domains towards a more unified realistic view of systems.</description>

      <title>A Generalised Theory of Interactions -- II. The Theoretical Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After discussing the significance of interactions to understand complex multiscale stochastic systems (CMSS), we turn our attention to the construction of a Generalised Theory of Interactions (GToI). We define interactions as discrete, localised events where the thermodynamically irreversible exchange of degrees of freedom involves signal propagation and relaxation phenomena. We proceed to define the mechanics of such space, as well as how these approximately map onto dynamical manifolds. By characterising various systems through the effect of transformations across interaction space, we develop a view of systems where features such as emergence and information representation become apparent. Our theory appears to capture structural and dynamical features of CMSS efficiently by making explicit the extent of the dynamical range of action in them; we identify the boundaries of such range with statistical limits corresponding to physical laws, and derive a generalised form of the Correspondence Principle.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Stereotypes: Race and Running</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The athletic achievements of African athletes in global running championships have long been subject to scientific and sociological inquiry. During the 1990s, a popular narrative emerged, suggesting that West African lineage conferred inherent sprinting advantages, and that North, South and East African's are specialized for longer distances. Part and parcel to this narrative was the enthusiastic belief that it would very soon be substantiated by a genotyping revolution that would enable prognostication of individual athletic potential. We revisit this hypothesis in the post-genomic era. First, we compare the global running records used to generate the racialist hypotheses with performances over the last twenty years (2004- 2023). Focusing on the 100m reveals intriguing trends, including the ascendancy of Jamaica as a sprint powerhouse and the elevation of South African and East Asian sprinters to the global stage, a direct challenge to the racialist paradigm. In line with an in-depth analysis of the influences on elite runners, we build a regression model to predict 100m performance based on environmental and psychological factors. Next, we direct our attention to 1500m, where the last two British champions have been part of a European resurgence that has not been seen in decades. Examining three different time periods, we identify a thirty year national slowdown (1989-2018). Adapting our model to this time period reveals striking evidence that racial perception has greater impact on performance than racial physiology. Synthesizing these findings, we introduce a psychocultural hypothesis, positing that interactions between racial perceptions and social dynamics shape the global distribution of running performance. We contrast this hypothesis with the racialist paradigm and propose extending it beyond sport where it offers insight across many domains.</description>

      <title>Opinion inertia and coarsening in the Persistent Voter model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Persistent Voter model (PVM), a variant of the Voter model (VM) that includes transient, dynamically-induced zealots. Due to peer reinforcement, the internal confidence $\eta_i$ of a normal voter increases by steps of size $\Delta\eta$ and once it gets above a given threshold, it becomes a zealot. Then, its opinion remains frozen until enough interactions with the opposite opinion occur and its confidence is reset. No longer a zealot, the regular voter may change opinion once again. This opinion inertia mechanism, albeit simplified, is responsible for an effective surface tension and the PVM has a crossover from a fluctuation-driven dynamics, as in the VM, to a curvature-driven one, as in the Ising Model at low temperature (IM0). The average time $\tau$ to attain consensus is non-monotonic on $\Delta\eta$ and has a minimum at $\Delta\eta_{\min}$. In this paper we clarify the mechanisms that accelerate the system towards consensus close to $\Delta\eta_{\min}$. Close to the crossover at $\Delta\eta_{\min}$, the intermediate region around the domains where the regular voters accumulate (the active region, AR) is large and the surface tension, albeit small, is still enough to keep the shape and reduce the fragmentation of the domains. The large size of the AR in the region of $\Delta\eta_{\min}$ has two important effects that accelerates the dynamics. First, it dislodges the zealots in the bulk of the domains and second, it maximally suppresses the slowly-evolving stripes that normally form in Ising-like models. This suggests the importance of understanding the role of the AR, where the change of opinion is facilitated, and the interplay between regular voters and zealots when attempting to disrupt polarized states.</description>

      <title>When selection pays: structured public goods game with a generalized interaction mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The public goods game is a broadly used paradigm for studying the evolution of cooperation in structured populations. According to the basic assumption, the interaction graph determines the connections of a player where the focal actor forms a common venture with the nearest neighbors. In reality, however, not all of our partners are involved in every games. To elaborate this observation, we propose a model where individuals choose just some selected neighbors from the complete set to form a group for public goods. We explore the potential consequences by using a pair-approximation approach in a weak-selection limit. We theoretically analyze how the number of total neighbors and the actual size of the restricted group influence the critical enhancement factor where cooperation becomes dominant over defection. Furthermore, we systematically compare our model with the traditional setup and show that the critical enhancement factor is lower than in the case when all players are present in the social dilemma. Hence the suggested restricted interaction mode offers a better condition for the evolution of cooperation. Our theoretical findings are supported by numerical calculations.</description>

      <title>Quantum for Good and the Societal Impact of Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing promises to help humanity solve problems that would otherwise be intractable on classical computers. Unlike today's machines, quantum computers use a novel computing process that leverages the foundational quantum mechanical laws of nature. This unlocks unparalleled compute power for certain applications and promises to help solve some of our generation's gravest challenges, including the climate crisis, food insecurity, and widespread disease. No one entity will be able to realize this end state alone. Developing a fault-tolerant quantum supercomputer and a vibrant ecosystem around it will require deep partnerships between industry, governments, and academia. It will also require collective action to enable and promote positive applications of quantum computing and ensure that the safe and responsible use of the technology is at the center of its development and deployment. Achieving these objectives will require focusing on three priorities:
  1. Impact. Ensure quantum computing benefits all of humankind by developing quantum solutions to solve critical, global problems.
  2. Use. Protect against malicious use by accelerating the deployment of quantum-safe cryptography and developing governance processes and controls for the responsible use of quantum machines.
  3. Access. Democratize the potential for economic growth across all of society through skilling, workforce and ecosystem development, and digital infrastructure.
  This paper discusses each in turn.</description>

      <title>Exploring language endangerment: historical, geographical, and economic insights from multilayer language-country bipartite network analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language endangerment is a phenomenon in which approximately 40% of languages spoken worldwide are predicted to disappear within the next few decades, resulting in the loss of cultures associated with these languages. To take effective measures against language endangerment, it is essential to quantitatively understand its characteristics because it is a phenomenon in which historical, geographical, and economic factors are intricately intertwined. In this study, multilayer language-country bipartite networks are constructed using information about which countries each language is spoken in and two types of linguistic features, namely the existence of a writing system and the function within a country. In addition, percolation simulations are conducted to measure how language and country networks break down according to the extinction of languages and to identify vulnerable connections in them. In the language network of officially used languages with their writing system, the community analysis indicated that there were communities composed of languages spoken over geographically separated distances. The strength of languages revealed that the official languages in the former colonial nations, namely English, French, Spanish, Dutch, Portuguese, and Russian, still played significant roles in the formation of these communities. In the language and country networks of unofficially used languages without their writing system, the percolation simulation revealed that languages were likely to severely disappear in the Americas, and that linguistic diversity was vulnerable in affluent countries. The findings show that the analysis of multilayer language-country bipartite networks has enabled a quantitative understanding of the language endangerment occurring worldwide from historical, geographical, and economic perspectives.</description>

      <title>Microscopic origin of abrupt transition in interdependent superconducting networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paradigm of interdependent networks has recently been manifested in experimentally testable lab setup of interdependent superconducting networks. This system experiences an abrupt transition due to the thermal dissipation between the networks but its underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here we study the critical behavior and the underlying mechanism of the transition, unveiling its unique microscopic nature. The microscopic characteristics of the transition result in a macroscopic long-living plateau that lasts for thousands of seconds and increases with the size of the system. We characterize the critical behavior of the transition and find that the critical exponents are consistent with those predicted theoretically for percolation of abstract interdependent networks and interdependent ferromagnetic networks, supporting a common universal origin of interdependent systems.</description>

      <title>Using Smartphones to Study Vaccination Decisions in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most important tools available to limit the spread and impact of infectious diseases is vaccination. It is therefore important to understand what factors determine people's vaccination decisions. To this end, previous behavioural research made use of, (i) controlled but often abstract or hypothetical studies (e.g., vignettes) or, (ii) realistic but typically less flexible studies that make it difficult to understand individual decision processes (e.g., clinical trials). Combining the best of these approaches, we propose integrating real-world Bluetooth contacts via smartphones in several rounds of a game scenario, as a novel methodology to study vaccination decisions and disease spread. In our 12-week proof-of-concept study conducted with $N$ = 494 students, we found that participants strongly responded to some of the information provided to them during or after each decision round, particularly those related to their individual health outcomes. In contrast, information related to others' decisions and outcomes (e.g., the number of vaccinated or infected individuals) appeared to be less important. We discuss the potential of this novel method and point to fruitful areas for future research.</description>

      <title>Moments of undersampled distributions: Application to the size of epidemics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The total number of fatalities of an epidemic outbreak is a dramatic but extremely informative quantity. Knowledge of the statistics of this quantity allows the calculation of the mean total number of fatalities conditioned to the fact that the outbreak has surpassed a given number of fatalities, which is very relevant for risk assessment. However, the fact that the total number of fatalities seems to be characterized by a power-law tailed distribution with exponent (of the survival function) smaller than one poses an important theoretical difficulty, due to the non-existence of a mean value for such distributions. Cirillo and Taleb [Nature Phys. 16, 606 (2020)] propose a transformation from a so-called dual variable, which displays a power-law tail, to the total number of fatalities, which becomes bounded by the total world population. Here, we (i) show that such a transformation is ad hoc and unphysical; (ii) propose alternative transformations and distributions (also ad hoc); (iii) argue that the right framework for this problem is statistical physics, through finite-size scaling; and (iv) demonstrate that the real problem is not the non-existence of the mean value for power-law tailed distributions but the fact that the tail of the different theoretical distributions (which is what distinguishes one model from the other) is far from being well sampled with the available number of empirical data. Our results are also valid for many other hazards displaying (apparent) power-law tails in their size.</description>

      <title>Inferring Structure of Cortical Neuronal Networks from Firing Data: A Statistical Physics Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the relation between cortical neuronal network structure and neuronal activity is a fundamental unresolved question in neuroscience, with implications to our understanding of the mechanism by which neuronal networks evolve over time, spontaneously or under stimulation. It requires a method for inferring the structure and composition of a network from neuronal activities. Tracking the evolution of networks and their changing functionality will provide invaluable insight into the occurrence of plasticity and the underlying learning process. We devise a probabilistic method for inferring the effective network structure by integrating techniques from Bayesian statistics, statistical physics and principled machine learning. The method and resulting algorithm allow one to infer the effective network structure, identify the excitatory and inhibitory nature of its constituents, and predict neuronal spiking activities by employing the inferred structure. We validate the method and algorithm's performance using synthetic data, spontaneous activity of an in silico emulator and realistic in vitro neuronal networks of modular and homogeneous connectivity, demonstrating excellent structure inference and activity prediction. We also show that our method outperforms commonly used existing methods for inferring neuronal network structure. Inferring the evolving effective structure of neuronal networks will provide new insight into the learning process due to stimulation in general and will facilitate the development of neuron-based circuits with computing capabilities.</description>
