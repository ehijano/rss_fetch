      <title>On Universal Deformations and Material Preferred Directions in Anisotropic Cauchy Elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study universal deformations in anisotropic Cauchy elasticity. We show that the universality constraints of hyperelasticity and Cauchy elasticity for transversely isotropic, orthotropic, and monoclinic solids are equivalent. This implies that for each of these symmetry classes the universal deformations and the corresponding universal material preferred directions of hyperelastic and Cauchy elastic solids are identical. This is consistent with previous findings for isotropic solids. Universal deformations and material preferred directions are therefore independent of the existence or absence of a strain energy function.</description>

      <title>A reinterpretation of classical magnetism via the regular representation of displacement current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The displacement current, introduced by Maxwell, has led to persistent confusion regarding its role in generating magnetic fields. To find a new way to understand classical magnetism, in this work, the displacement current is first decomposed into a localized internal part and an external field component by developing a discal regularization over the dipole distribution. Due to a surprising cancellation of the electric current by the internal displacement current, the magnetic field in the Coulomb gauge can be reformulated, in terms of the external component of the displacement current, as an instantaneous Biot-Savart law. The new expression allows for a reinterpretation of the generation of magnetic fields, viewing it as a magnetic effect related to the external displacement current, rather than directly to the electric current. The consistency of the Biot-Savart law with the Amp\`{e}re-Maxwell law is thus confirmed, eliminating a dogged dispute in history. This result offers a potential recognition of the displacement current enigma. The regularization method is also applied to the polarization model to develop and refine the Clausius-Mossotti equation within the special Wigner-Seitz primitive-cell regularization.</description>

      <title>Many-Body Time Evolution from a Correlation-Efficient Quantum Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the correlation-efficient time-evolution (CETE) algorithm for simulating quantum many-body dynamics. CETE recasts each step of time evolution as a time-independent correlation problem: the ansatz begins from a mean-field single Slater determinant and is then correlated to capture the true time-evolved state. We derive this exact ansatz from a contraction of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation onto the space of two electrons. Unlike conventional evolution by sequential short-time propagators, which must both correlate and decorrelate the state as the degree of correlation fluctuates in time, CETE correlates only once. This substantially reduces circuit depth, extending accessible simulation times on near-term quantum devices. We demonstrate the approach by simulating the time evolution of the hydrogen molecule's electronic wavefunction, highlighting the potential for the CETE algorithm to simulate strongly correlated systems on near-term devices.</description>

      <title>Geometric integrators for adiabatically closed simple thermodynamic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A variational formulation for non-equilibrium thermodynamics was developed by Gay-Balmaz and Yoshimura. In a recent article, the first two authors of the present paper introduced partially cosymplectic structures as a geometric framework for thermodynamic systems, recovering the evolution equations obtained variationally. In this paper, we develop a discrete variational principle for adiabatically closed simple thermodynamic systems, which can be utilised to construct numerical integrators for the dynamics of such systems. The effectiveness of our method is illustrated with several examples.</description>

      <title>On the First Quantum Correction to the Second Virial Coefficient of a Generalized Lennard-Jones Fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive an explicit analytic expression for the first quantum correction to the second virial coefficient of a $d$-dimensional fluid whose particles interact via the generalized Lennard-Jones $(2n,n)$ potential. By introducing an appropriate change of variable, the correction term is reduced to a single integral that can be evaluated in closed form in terms of parabolic cylinder or generalized Hermite functions. The resulting expression compactly incorporates both dimensionality and stiffness, providing direct access to the low- and high-temperature asymptotic regimes. In the special case of the standard Lennard-Jones fluid ($d=3$, $n=6$), the formula obtained is considerably more compact than previously reported representations based on hypergeometric functions. The knowledge of this correction allows us to determine the first quantum contribution to the Boyle temperature, whose dependence on dimensionality and stiffness is explicitly analyzed. Moreover, the same methodology can be systematically extended to obtain higher-order quantum corrections.</description>

      <title>Poincare invariant interaction between two Dirac particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spinning electron-electron interaction is described in classical terms by means of two possible classical interactions: The instantaneous Coulomb interaction between the charge centers of both particles and the Poincar\'e invariant interaction developed in a previous work. The numerical integrations are performed with several Mathematica notebooks that are available for the interested readers in the reference Section. One difference of these interactions is that the Poincar\'e invariant interaction does not satisfy the action-reaction principle in the synchronous description and, therefore, there is no conservation of the mechanical linear momentum. It is the total linear momentum of the system what is conserved.
  In this synchronous description the interaction is not mediated by the retarded fields but is described in terms of the instantaneous positions, velocities and accelerations of the center of charge of both particles. In the Poincar\'e invariant description the net binding force that holds linked two Dirac particles is stronger than in the Coulomb case, thus forming a stable spin 1 system of 2 Dirac particles. This bosonic state of spin 1 does not correspond to a Cooper pair because the separation between the centers of mass of the Dirac particles is below Compton's wavelength, smaller than the correlation distance of the Cooper pair. Since the Poincar\'e invariant interaction is relativistically invariant it can be used for analyzing high energy scattering processes.</description>
