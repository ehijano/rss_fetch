      <title>Construction of holomorphic quilts in Cartesian product of closed surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we modify the proof of holomorphic quilts from Wehrheim and Woodward in \cite{wehrheim2009floer} to construct a specific type of immersed holomorphic quilt, where the symplectic manifolds are closed surfaces. The application is to compare Lagrangian Floer theory with quilted Lagrangian Floer theory, as they relate through Lagrangian correspondence. A potential example is provided to support Bottman and Wehrheim's conjecture \cite{bottman2018gromov} regarding the isomorphism between Lagrangian Floer homology and quilted Lagrangian Floer homology after twisting by bounding cochains.</description>

      <title>Turk's head knots and links: a survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We collect and discuss various results on an important family of knots and links called Turk's head knots and links $Th (p,q)$. In the mathematical literature, they also appear under different names such as rosette knots and links or weaving knots and links. Unless being the unknot or the alternating torus links $T(2,q)$, the Turk's head links $Th (p,q)$ are all known to be alternating, fibered, hyperbolic, invertible, non-split, periodic, and prime. The Turk's head links $Th (p,q)$ are also both positive and negative amphichiral if $p$ is chosen to be odd. Moreover, we highlight and present several more results, focusing on Turk's head knots $Th (3,q)$. We finally list several open problems and conjectures for Turk's head knots and links. We conclude with a short appendix on torus knots and links, which might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Totally tangential $\mathbb{C}$-links and electromagnetic knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The set of real-analytic Legendrian links with respect to the standard contact structure on the 3-sphere $S^3$ corresponds both to the set of totally tangential $\mathbb{C}$-links as defined by Rudolph and to the set of stable knotted field lines in Bateman electromagnetic fields of Hopf type. It is known that every isotopy class has a real-analytic Legendrian representative, so that every link type $L$ admits a holomorphic function $G:\mathbb{C}^2\to\mathbb{C}$ whose zeros intersect $S^3$ tangentially in $L$ and there is a Bateman electromagnetic field $\mathbf{F}$ with closed field lines in the shape of $L$. However, so far the family of torus links are the only examples where explicit expressions of $G$ and $\mathbf{F}$ have been found. In this paper, we present an algorithm that finds for every given link type $L$ a real-analytic Legendrian representative, parametrised in terms of trigonometric polynomials. We then prove that (good candidates for) examples of $G$ and $\mathbf{F}$ can be obtained by solving a system of linear equations, which is homogeneous in the case of $G$ and inhomogeneous in the case of $\mathbf{F}$. We also use the real-analytic Legendrian parametrisations to study the dynamics of knots in Bateman electromagnetic fields of Hopf type. In particular, we show that no compact subset of $\mathbb{R}^3$ can contain an electromagnetic knot indefinitely.</description>

      <title>Limit of geometric quantizations on K\"ahler manifolds with T-symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A compact K\"ahler manifold $\left( M,\omega ,J\right) $ with $T$-symmetry admits a natural mixed polarization $\mathcal{P}_{\mathrm{mix}}$ whose real directions come from the $T$-action. In \cite{LW1}, we constructed a one-parameter family of K\"ahler structures $\left( \omega ,J_{t}\right) $'s with the same underlying K\"a hler form $\omega $ and $J_{0}=J$, such that (i) there is a $T$-equivariant biholomorphism between $\left( M,J_{0}\right) $ and $\left( M,J_{t}\right) $ and (ii) K\"ahler polarizations $\mathcal{P} _{t}$'s corresponding to $J_{t}$'s converge to $\mathcal{P}_{\mathrm{mix}}$ as $t$ goes to infinity.
  In this paper, we study the quantum analog of above results. Assume $L$ is a pre-quantum line bundle on $\left( M,\omega \right) $. Let $\mathcal{H}_{t}$ and $ \mathcal{H}_{\mathrm{mix}}$ be quantum spaces defined using polarizations $\mathcal{P}_{t}$ and $\mathcal{P}_{\mathrm{mix}}$ respectively. In particular, $\mathcal{H}_{t}=H_{\bar{\partial}_{t}}^{0}\left( M,L\right) $. They are both representations of $T$. We show that (i) there is a $T$-equivariant isomorphism between $\mathcal{H}_{0}$ and $\mathcal{H}_{\mathrm{mix}}$ and (ii) for regular $T$-weight $\lambda $, corresponding $\lambda $-weight spaces $ \mathcal{H}_{t,\lambda }$'s converge to $\mathcal{H}_{\mathrm{mix},\lambda }$ as $t$ goes to infinity.</description>

      <title>On complex Lie algebroids with constant real rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We associate a real distribution to any complex Lie algebroid that we call distribution of real elements and a new invariant that we call real rank given by the pointwise rank of this distribution. When the real rank is constant we obtain a real Lie algebroid inside the original complex Lie algebroid. Under another regularity condition we associate a complex Lie subalgebroid that we call the minimum complex subalgebroid. We also we provide a local splitting for complex Lie algebroids with constant real rank. In the end, we introduce the complex matched pair of skew-algebroids, these pairs produce complex Lie algebroid structures on the complexification of a vector bundle. We use this operation to characterize all the complex Lie algebroid structures on the complexification of real vector bundles.</description>
