      <title>A wireless method to obtain the longitudinal beam impedance from scattering parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coaxial wire method is a common and appreciated technique to assess the beam coupling impedance of an accelerator element from scattering parameters. Nevertheless, the results obtained from wire measurements could be inaccurate due to the presence of the stretched conductive wire that artificially creates the conditions for the propagation of a Transverse ElectroMagnetic (TEM) mode. The aim of this work is to establish a solid technique to obtain the beam coupling impedance from electromagnetic simulations, without modifications of the device under test. In this framework, we identified a new relation to get the longitudinal resistive wall beam coupling impedance of a circular chamber directly from the scattering parameters and demonstrated that it reduces to the exact theoretical expression. Furthermore, a possible generalization of the method to arbitrary cross-section chamber geometries has been studied and validated with numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Generation of THz waves through interaction of the wakefield of two-color laser pulses with magnetized plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present study explores radiation in THz spectrum region through the interaction of the wakefield of two-color laser pulses with magnetized plasma. The interaction of the two-color laser with plasma electrons induces transverse nonlinear current in two dimensions, resulting in generation of a wakefield and a forward wave. The investigation revealed that during the non-relativistic regime of laser-plasma interaction, interdependence exists between the electric fields of the forward wave and the wake. Conversely, in the relativistic regime, the dynamic of interaction changes, and plasma electrons are influenced not only by the electric field of the laser pulse but also by relativistic effects like Lorentz contraction, responding to both the electric and magnetic field components. This leads to generation of wake and forward wave radiations. The interplay between various laser and plasma parameters is analyzed, shedding light on the conditions leading to radiation angular distribution patterns in the forward and backward directions. The impact of spatial laser profile, a DC external magnetic field, polarization states, and plasma interaction length on the generated wake and forward wave patterns has been investigated. Through systematic variation of these parameters, the objective is to elucidate the controlled directional features of the resulting fields and radiation patterns.</description>

      <title>Spatial coherence of synchrotron radiation degraded by grating monochromators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a physical and theoretical description of the significant degradation of X-ray spatial coherence properties due to the use of grating monochromators at synchrotron facilities. We present a comprehensive study of the effects of spatial coherence degradation as a function of grating parameters under different focusing and propagation conditions. The focus is on the effect of spatial coherence degradation caused by the grating alone, starting from a fully coherent incident photon beam generated by a filament source. The mathematical description and theoretical analysis of the spatial coherence degradation is presented in the framework of statistical optics.</description>
