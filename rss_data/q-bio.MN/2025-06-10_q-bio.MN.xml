      <title>On Quantum Random Walks in Biomolecular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biomolecular networks, such as protein-protein interactions, gene-gene associations, and cell-cell interactions, offer valuable insights into the complex organization of biological systems. These networks are key to understanding cellular functions, disease mechanisms, and identifying therapeutic targets. However, their analysis is challenged by the high dimensionality, heterogeneity, and sparsity of multi-omics data. Random walk algorithms are widely used to propagate information through disease modules, helping to identify disease-associated genes and uncover relevant biological pathways. In this work, we investigate the limitations of classical random walks and explore the potential of quantum random walks (QRWs) for biomolecular network analysis. We evaluate QRWs in two network-based applications. First, in a gene-gene interaction network associated with asthma, autism, and schizophrenia, QRWs more accurately rank disease-associated genes compared to classical methods. Second, in a structured multi-partite cell-cell interaction network derived from mouse brown adipose tissue, QRWs identify key driver genes in malignant cells that are overlooked by classical random walks. Our findings suggest that quantum random walks offer a promising alternative to classical approaches, with improved sensitivity to network structure and better performance in identifying biologically relevant features. This highlights their potential in advancing network medicine and systems biology.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic limits on general far-from-equilibrium molecular templating networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cells produce RNA and proteins via molecular templating networks. We show that information transmission in such networks is bounded by functions of a simple thermodynamic property of the network, regardless of complexity. Surprisingly, putative systems operating at this bound do not have a high flux around the network. Instead, they have low entropy production, with each product in a ``pseudo-equilibrium'' determined by a single pathway. These pseudo-equilibrium limits constrain information transmission for the overall network, even if individual templates are arbitrarily specific.</description>

      <title>A CRISP approach to QSP: XAI enabling fit-for-purpose models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02750v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP) promises to accelerate drug development, enable personalized medicine, and improve the predictability of clinical outcomes. Realizing this potential requires effectively managing the complexity of mathematical models representing biological systems. Here, we present and validate a novel QSP workflow--CRISP (Contextualized Reduction for Identifiability and Scientific Precision)--that addresses a central challenge in QSP: the problem of complexity and over-parameterization, in which models contain irrelevant parameters that obscure interpretation and hinder predictive reliability. The CRISP workflow begins with a literature-derived model, constructed to be comprehensive and unbiased by integrating prior mechanistic insights. At the core of the workflow is the Manifold Boundary Approximation Method (MBAM), a reduction technique that simplifies models while preserving mechanistic structure and predictive fidelity. By applying MBAM in a context-specific manner, CRISP links parsimonious models directly to predictions of interest, clarifying causal structure and enhancing interpretability. The resulting models are computationally efficient and well-suited to key QSP tasks, including virtual population generation, experimental design, toxicology, and target discovery. We demonstrate the utility of CRISP on case studies involving the coagulation cascade and SHIV infection, and identify promising directions for improving the efficacy of bNAb therapies for HIV. Together, these results establish CRISP as a general-purpose QSP workflow for turning complex mechanistic models into tools for precise scientific reasoning to guide pharmacological and regulatory decision-making.</description>
