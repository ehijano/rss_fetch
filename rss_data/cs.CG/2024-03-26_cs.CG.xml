      <title>Maximum Polygon Packing: The CG:SHOP Challenge 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an overview of the 2024 Computational Geometry Challenge targeting the problem \textsc{Maximum Polygon Packing}: Given a convex region $P$ in the plane, and a collection of simple polygons $Q_1, \ldots, Q_n$, each $Q_i$ with a respective value $c_i$, find a subset $S \subseteq \{1, \ldots,n\}$ and a feasible packing within $P$ of the polygons $Q_i$ (without rotation) for $i \in S$, maximizing $\sum_{i \in S} c_i$. Geometric packing problems, such as this, present significant computational challenges and are of substantial practical importance.</description>

      <title>Sweeping Arrangements of Non-Piercing Curves in Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a finite set of Jordan curves in the plane. For any curve $\gamma \in \Gamma$, we denote the bounded region enclosed by $\gamma$ as $\tilde{\gamma}$. We say that $\Gamma$ is a non-piercing family if for any two curves $\alpha , \beta \in \Gamma$, $\tilde{\alpha} \setminus \tilde{\beta}$ is a connected region. A non-piercing family of curves generalizes a family of $2$-intersecting curves in which each pair of curves intersect in at most two points. Snoeyink and Hershberger (``Sweeping Arrangements of Curves'', SoCG '89) proved that if we are given a family $\mathcal{C}$ of $2$-intersecting curves and a fixed curve $C\in\mathcal{C}$, then the arrangement can be \emph{swept} by $C$, i.e., $C$ can be continuously shrunk to any point $p \in \tilde{C}$ in such a way that the we have a family of $2$-intersecting curves throughout the process. In this paper, we generalize the result of Snoeyink and Hershberger to the setting of non-piercing curves. We show that given an arrangement of non-piercing curves $\Gamma$, and a fixed curve $\gamma\in \Gamma$, the arrangement can be swept by $\gamma$ so that the arrangement remains non-piercing throughout the process. We also give a shorter and simpler proof of the result of Snoeyink and Hershberger and cite applications of their result, where our result leads to a generalization.</description>

      <title>Hashing geographical point data using the space-filling H-curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct geohashing procedure based on using of space-filling H-curve. This curve provides a way to construct geohash with less computations than the construction based on usage of Hilbert curve. At the same time, H-curve has better clustering properties.</description>

      <title>Fast ellipsoidal conformal and quasi-conformal parameterization of genus-0 closed surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Surface parameterization plays a fundamental role in many science and engineering problems. In particular, as genus-0 closed surfaces are topologically equivalent to a sphere, many spherical parameterization methods have been developed over the past few decades. However, in practice, mapping a genus-0 closed surface onto a sphere may result in a large distortion due to their geometric difference. In this work, we propose a new framework for computing ellipsoidal conformal and quasi-conformal parameterizations of genus-0 closed surfaces, in which the target parameter domain is an ellipsoid instead of a sphere. By combining simple conformal transformations with different types of quasi-conformal mappings, we can easily achieve a large variety of ellipsoidal parameterizations with their bijectivity guaranteed by quasi-conformal theory. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Deep Point Cloud Normal Estimation via Triplet Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.10494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.10494v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Normal estimation on 3D point clouds is a fundamental problem in 3D vision and graphics. Current methods often show limited accuracy in predicting normals at sharp features (e.g., edges and corners) and less robustness to noise. In this paper, we propose a novel normal estimation method for point clouds. It consists of two phases: (a) feature encoding which learns representations of local patches, and (b) normal estimation that takes the learned representation as input and regresses the normal vector. We are motivated that local patches on isotropic and anisotropic surfaces have similar or distinct normals, and that separable features or representations can be learned to facilitate normal estimation. To realise this, we first construct triplets of local patches on 3D point cloud data, and design a triplet network with a triplet loss for feature encoding. We then design a simple network with several MLPs and a loss function to regress the normal vector. Despite having a smaller network size compared to most other methods, experimental results show that our method preserves sharp features and achieves better normal estimation results on CAD-like shapes.</description>
