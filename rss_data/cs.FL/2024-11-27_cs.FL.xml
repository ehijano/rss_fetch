      <title>Temporally Non-Uniform Cellular Automata (t-NUCA): Reversibility and Cyclic behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a variant of non-uniform cellular automata, named as Temporally Non-Uniform Cellular Automata (t-NUCAs), which temporally use two rules, $f$ and $g$ in a sequence $\mathcal{R}$. To observe reversibility in t-NUCAs, we study their injectivity and surjectivity properties. Unlike classical CAs, some irreversible t-NUCAs show the behavior similar to reversible t-NUCAs. To study this behavior, we define restricted surjectivity of t-NUCA and introduce restricted reversibility which shows reversibility of t-NUCA for a set of initial configurations. By further investigating the remaining irreversible t-NUCAs, some t-NUCAs are found which have many-to-one mapping in their configuration space, but do not have non-reachable (Garden-of-Eden) configurations. We name these t-NUCAs as weakly reversible t-NUCAs. Under finite lattice size, a t-NUCA, like any classical CA, shows cyclic behavior. We explore this cyclic behavior and discuss its relation with rule sequence. Finally, we note down the possible longest cycle length of a t-NUCA, based on the lattice size and rule sequence.</description>

      <title>Tracy, Traces, and Transducers: Computable Counterexamples and Explanations for HyperLTL Model-Checking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: HyperLTL model-checking enables the automated verification of information-flow properties for security-critical systems. However, it only provides a binary answer. Here, we introduce two paradigms to compute counterexamples and explanations for HyperLTL model-checking, thereby considerably increasing its usefulness. Both paradigms are based on the maxim ``counterexamples/explanations are Skolem functions for the existentially quantified trace variables''.
  Our first paradigm is complete (everything can be explained), but restricted to ultimately periodic system traces. The second paradigm works with (Turing machine) computable Skolem functions and is therefore much more general, but also shown incomplete (not everything can computably be explained). Finally, we prove that it is decidable whether a given finite transition system and a formula have computable Skolem functions witnessing that the system satisfies the formula. Our algorithm also computes transducers implementing computable Skolem functions, if they exist.</description>
