      <title>Network Representation and Modular Decomposition of Combinatorial Structures: A Galled-Tree Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In phylogenetics, reconstructing rooted trees from distances between taxa is a common task. B\"ocker and Dress generalized this concept by introducing symbolic dated maps $\delta:X \times X \to \Upsilon$, where distances are replaced by symbols, and showed that there is a one-to-one correspondence between symbolic ultrametrics and labeled rooted phylogenetic trees. Many combinatorial structures fall under the umbrella of symbolic dated maps, such as 2-dissimilarities, symmetric labeled 2-structures, or edge-colored complete graphs, and are here referred to as strudigrams. Strudigrams have a unique decomposition into non-overlapping modules, which can be represented by a modular decomposition tree (MDT). In the absence of prime modules, strudigrams are equivalent to symbolic ultrametrics, and the MDT fully captures the relationships $\delta(x,y)$ between pairs of vertices $x,y$ in $X$ through the label of their least common ancestor in the MDT. However, in the presence of prime vertices, this information is generally hidden. To provide this missing structural information, we aim to locally replace the prime vertices in the MDT to obtain networks that capture full information about the strudigrams. While starting with the general framework of prime-vertex replacement networks, we then focus on a specific type of such networks obtained by replacing prime vertices with so-called galls, resulting in labeled galled-trees. We introduce the concept of galled-tree explainable (GATEX) strudigrams, provide their characterization, and demonstrate that recognizing these structures and reconstructing the labeled networks that explain them can be achieved in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>Intersecting sets in probability spaces and Shelah's classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, given a sufficiently long sequence of events in a probability space all of measure at least $\varepsilon$, some $n$ of them will have a common intersection. A more subtle pattern: for any $0 &lt; p &lt; q &lt; 1$, we cannot find events $A_i$ and $B_i$ so that $\mu \left( A_i \cap B_j \right) \leq p$ and $\mu \left( A_j \cap B_i\right) \geq q$ for all $1 &lt; i &lt; j &lt; n$, assuming $n$ is sufficiently large. This is closely connected to model-theoretic stability of probability algebras. We survey some results from our recent work on more complicated patterns that arise when our events are indexed by multiple indices. In particular, how such results are connected to higher arity generalizations of de Finetti's theorem in probability, structural Ramsey theory, hypergraph regularity in combinatorics, and model theory.</description>

      <title>On an entropic analogue of additive energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances have linked various statements involving sumsets and cardinalities with corresponding statements involving sums of random variables and entropies. In this vein, this paper shows that the quantity $2{\bf H}\{X, Y\} - {\bf H}\{X+Y\}$ is a natural entropic analogue of the additive energy $E(A,B)$ between two sets. We develop some basic theory surrounding this quantity, and demonstrate its role in the proof of Tao's entropy variant of the Balog--Szemer\'edi--Gowers theorem. We examine the regime where entropic additive energy is small, and discuss a family of random variables related to Sidon sets. In finite fields, one can define an entropic multiplicative energy as well, and we formulate sum-product-type conjectures relating these two entropic energies.</description>

      <title>Exact results on traces of sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For non-negative integers $n$, $m$, $a$ and $b$, we write $\left( n,m \right) \rightarrow \left( a,b \right)$ if for every family $\mathcal{F}\subseteq 2^{[n]}$ with $|\mathcal{F}|\geqslant m$ there is an $a$-element set $T\subseteq [n]$ such that $\left| \mathcal{F}_{\mid T} \right| \geqslant b$, where $\mathcal{F}_{\mid T}=\{ F \cap T : F \in \mathcal{F} \}$. A longstanding problem in extremal set theory asks to determine $m(s)=\lim_{n\rightarrow +\infty}\frac{m(n,s)}{n}$, where $m(n,s)$ denotes the maximum integer $m$ such that $\left( n,m \right) \rightarrow \left( n-1,m-s \right)$ holds for non-negatives $n$ and $s$. In this paper, we establish the exact value of $m(2^{d-1}-c)$ for all $1\leqslant c\leqslant d$ whenever $d\geqslant 50$, thereby solving an open problem posed by Piga and Sch\"{u}lke. To be precise, we show that $$m(n,2^{d-1}-c)=\frac{2^{d}-c}{d}n \mbox{ for } 1\leq c\leq d-1 \mbox{ and } d\mid n, \mbox{ and }
  m(n,2^{d-1}-d)=\frac{2^{d}-d-0.5}{d}n \mbox{ for } 2d\mid n $$ holds for $d\geq 50$. Furthermore, we provide a proof that confirms a conjecture of Frankl and Watanabe from 1994, demonstrating that $m(11)=5.3$.</description>

      <title>Counting $r\times s$ rectangles in nondecreasing and Smirnov words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rectangle capacity, a word statistic that was recently introduced by the author and Mansour, counts, for two fixed positive integers $r$ and $s$, the number of occurrences of a rectangle of size $r\times s$ in the bargraph representation of a word. In this work we find the bivariate generating function for the distribution on nondecreasing words of the number of $r\times s$ rectangles and the generating function for their total number over all nondecreasing words. We also obtain the analog results for Smirnov words, which are words that have no consecutive equal letters. This complements our recent results concerned with general words (i.e., not restricted) and Catalan words.</description>

Abstract: We show that Chow polynomials and augmented Chow polynomials of matroids, and more generally of finite graded posets admitting R-labellings, are obtained as evaluations of their Poincar\'e-extended ab-indices. This implies in particular explicit combinatorial gamma-positive expansions for both.</description>

Abstract: Let $a,b,c$ be distinct positive integers such that $a&lt;b&lt;c$ and $\gcd(a,b,c)=1$. For any non-negative integer $n$, the denumerant function $d(n;a,b,c)$ denotes the number of solutions of the equation $ax_1+bx_2+cx_3=n$ in non-negative integers $x_1,x_2,x_3$. We present an algorithm that computes $d(n;a,b,c)$ with a time complexity of $O(\log b)$.</description>

      <title>A polynomial time algorithm for Sylvester waves when entries are bounded</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sylvester's denumerant \( d(t; \boldsymbol{a}) \) is a quantity that counts the number of nonnegative integer solutions to the equation \( \sum_{i=1}^{N} a_i x_i = t \), where \( \boldsymbol{a} = (a_1, \dots, a_N) \) is a sequence of distinct positive integers with \( \gcd(\boldsymbol{a}) = 1 \). We present a polynomial time algorithm in $N$ for computing \( d(t; \boldsymbol{a}) \) when \( \boldsymbol{a} \) is bounded and \( t \) is a parameter. The proposed algorithm is rooted in the use of cyclotomic polynomials and builds upon recent results by Xin-Zhang-Zhang on the efficient computation of generalized Todd polynomials. The algorithm has been implemented in \texttt{Maple} under the name \texttt{Cyc-Denum} and demonstrates superior performance when \( a_i \leq 500 \) compared to Sills-Zeilberger's \texttt{Maple} package \texttt{PARTITIONS}.</description>

      <title>The generic anisotropy of strongly edge decomposable spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generic anisotropy is an important property in the study of Stanley-Reisner rings of homology spheres, which was introduced by Papadakis and Petrotou. This property can be used to prove the strong Lefschetz property as well as McMullen's $g$-conjecture for homology spheres. It is conjectured that for an arbitrary field $\mathbb{F}$, any $\mathbb{F}$-homology sphere is generically anisotropic over $\mathbb{F}$. In this paper, we prove this conjecture for all strongly edge decomposable spheres.</description>

      <title>On the Hecke Module of $\text{GL}_n(k[[z]])\backslash \text{GL}_n(k((z)))/\text{GL}_n(k((z^2)))$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Every double coset in $\text{GL}_m(k[[z]])\backslash \text{GL}_m(k((z)))/\text{GL}_m(k((z^2)))$ is uniquely represented by a block diagonal matrix with diagonal blocks in $\{1,z, \begin{pmatrix} 1&amp; z\\ 0 &amp;z^i
  \end{pmatrix} (i&gt;1)\}$ if $char(k) \neq 2$ and $k$ is a finite field. These cosets form a (spherical) Hecke module $\mathcal{H}(G,H,K)$ over the (spherical) Hecke algebra $\mathcal{H}(G,K)$ of double cosets in $K\backslash G/H$, where $K=\text{GL}_m(k[[z]])$ and $H=\text{GL}_m(k((z^2)))$ and $G=\text{GL}_m(k((z)))$. Similarly to Hall polynomial $h_{\lambda,\nu}^{\mu}$ from the Hecke algebra $\mathcal{H}(G,K)$, coefficients $h_{\lambda,\nu}^{\mu}$ arise from the Hecke module. We will provide a closed formula for $h_{\lambda,\nu}^\mu$, under some restrictions over ${\lambda,\nu,\mu}$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{S}_n$ denote the symmetric group on $[n]=\{1,\ldots,n\}$ with the uniform probability measure. For a permutation $\pi \in \mathbb{S}_n$ let $X_{\pi}$ denote the simplicial complex on the vertex set $[n]$ whose simplices are all $\{i_0,\ldots, i_m\} \subset [n]$ such that $i_0&lt;\cdots&lt;i_m$ and $\pi(i_0)&lt;\cdots &lt; \pi(i_m)$. For $r \geq 0$ let $p_r(n)$ denote the probability that $X_{\pi}$ is not topologically $r$-connected for $\pi \in \mathbb{S}_n$. It is shown that for fixed $r \geq 0$ there exist constants $0&lt;C_r, C_r' &lt; \infty$ such that \[ C_r \frac{(\log n)^r}{n} \leq p_r(n) \leq C_r' \frac{(\log n)^{2r}}{n}. \]</description>

      <title>Metaheuristics for finding threshold graphs with maximum spectral radius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of characterizing graphs with the maximum spectral radius among the connected graphs with given numbers of vertices and edges. It is well-known that the candidates for extremal graphs are threshold graphs, but only a few partial theoretical results have been obtained so far. Therefore, we approach to this problem from a novel perspective that involves incomplete enumeration of different threshold graphs with a given characteristic. Our methodology defines the considered problem as an optimization task and utilizes two metaheuristic methods, Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS), which relies on iterative improvements of a single current best solution and Bee Colony Optimization (BCO), a population-based metaheuristic from the Swarm Intelligence (SI) class. We use compact solution representation and several auxiliary data structures that should enable efficient search of the solution space. In addition, we define several types of transformations that preserve the feasibility of the resulting solution. The proposed methods are compared on the graphs with a moderate number of vertices. Preliminary results are in favor of the VNS approach, however, we believe that both methods could be improved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proves a conjecture generated by the artificial intelligence conjecturing program called \emph{TxGraffiti}. More specifically, we show that if $G$ is a connected, cubic, and claw-free graph, then $Z(G) \le \gamma(G) + 2$, where $Z(G)$ and $\gamma(G)$ denote the zero forcing number and the domination number of $G$, respectively. Furthermore, we provide a complete characterization of graphs that achieve this bound. Notably, this bound improves the known upper bounds for the zero forcing number of connected, cubic, and claw-free graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The location-domination number is conjectured to be at most half of the order for twin-free graphs with no isolated vertices. We prove that this conjecture holds and is tight for subcubic graphs. We also show that the same upper bound holds for subcubic graphs with open twins of degree 3 and closed twins of any degree, but not for subcubic graphs with open twins of degree 1 or 2. These results then imply that the same upper bound holds for all cubic graphs (with or without twins) except $K_4$ and $K_{3,3}$.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of quantized barycenters of lattice polytopes with applications to algebraic geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article addresses a combinatorial problem with applications to algebraic geometry. To a convex lattice polytope $P$ and each of its integer dilations $kP$ one may associate the barycenter of its lattice points. This sequence of $k$-quantized barycenters converge to the (classical) barycenter of the polytope considered as a convex body. A basic question arises: is there a complete asymptotic expansion for this sequence? If so, what are its terms? This article initiates the study of this question. First, we establish the existence of such an expansion as well as determine the first two terms. Second, for Delzant lattice polytopes we use toric algebra to determine all terms using mixed volumes of virtual rooftop polytopes, or alternatively in terms of higher Donaldson--Futaki invariants. Third, for reflexive polytopes we show the quantized barycenters are colinear to first order, and actually colinear in the case of polygons. The proofs use Ehrhart theory, convexity arguments, and toric algebra. As applications we derive the complete asymptotic expansion of the Fujita--Odaka stability thresholds $\delta_k$ on arbitrary polarizations on (possibly singular) toric varieties. In fact, we show they are rational functions of $k$ for sufficiently large $k$. This gives the first general result on Tian's stabilization problem for $\delta_k$-invariants for (possibly singular) toric Fanos: $\delta_k$ stabilize in $k$ if and only if they are all equal to $1$, and when smooth if and only if asymptotically Chow semistable. We also relate the asymptotic expansions to higher Donaldson--Futaki invariants of test configurations motivated by Ehrhart theory, and unify in passing previous results of Donaldson, Ono, Futaki, and Rubinstein--Tian--Zhang.</description>

      <title>On P\'olya-Young urn models and growth processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work is devoted to P\'olya-Young urns, a class of periodic P\'olya urns of importance in the analysis of Young tableaux. We provide several extension of the previous results of Banderier, Marchal and Wallner [Ann. Prob. (2020)] on P\'olya-Young urns and also generalize the previously studied model. We determine the limit law of the generalized model, involving the the local time of noise-reinforced Bessel processes. We also uncover a martingale structure, which leads directly to almost-sure convergence of the random variable of interest. This allows us to add second order asymptotics by providing a central limit theorem for the martingale tail sum, as well as a law of the iterated logarithm. We also turn to random vectors and obtain the limit law of P\'olya-Young urns with multiple colors. Additionally, we introduce several growth processes and combinatorial objects, which are closely related to urn models. We define increasing trees with periodic immigration and we related the dynamics of the P\'olya-Young urns to label-based parameters in such tree families. Furthermore, we discuss a generalization of Stirling permutations and obtain a bijection to increasing trees with periodic immigration. Finally, we introduce a chinese restaurant process with competition and relate it to increasing trees, as well as P\'olya-Young urns.</description>

      <title>Cuts in Graphs with Matroid Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: {\sc Vertex $(s, t)$-Cut} and {\sc Vertex Multiway Cut} are two fundamental graph separation problems in algorithmic graph theory. We study matroidal generalizations of these problems, where in addition to the usual input, we are given a representation $R \in \mathbb{F}^{r \times n}$ of a linear matroid $\mathcal{M} = (V(G), \mathcal{I})$ of rank $r$ in the input, and the goal is to determine whether there exists a vertex subset $S \subseteq V(G)$ that has the required cut properties, as well as is independent in the matroid $\mathcal{M}$. We refer to these problems as {\sc Independent Vertex $(s, t)$-cut}, and {\sc Independent Multiway Cut}, respectively. We show that these problems are fixed-parameter tractable ({\sf FPT}) when parameterized by the solution size (which can be assumed to be equal to the rank of the matroid $\mathcal{M}$). These results are obtained by exploiting the recent technique of flow augmentation [Kim et al.~STOC '22], combined with a dynamic programming algorithm on flow-paths \'a la [Feige and Mahdian,~STOC '06] that maintains a representative family of solutions w.r.t.~the given matroid [Marx, TCS '06; Fomin et al., JACM]. As a corollary, we also obtain {\sf FPT} algorithms for the independent version of {\sc Odd Cycle Transversal}. Further, our results can be generalized to other variants of the problems, e.g., weighted versions, or edge-deletion versions.</description>

      <title>Exact Minimum Weight Spanners via Column Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a weighted graph $G$, a minimum weight $\alpha$-spanner is a least-weight subgraph $H\subseteq G$ that preserves minimum distances between all node pairs up to a factor of $\alpha$. There are many results on heuristics and approximation algorithms, including a recent investigation of their practical performance [20]. Exact approaches, in contrast, have long been denounced as impractical: The first exact ILP (integer linear program) method [48] from 2004 is based on a model with exponentially many path variables, solved via column generation. A second approach [2], modeling via arc-based multicommodity flow, was presented in 2019. In both cases, only graphs with 40-100 nodes were reported to be solvable.
  In this paper, we briefly report on a theoretical comparison between these two models from a polyhedral point of view, and then concentrate on improvements and engineering aspects. We evaluate their performance in a large-scale empirical study. We report that our tuned column generation approach, based on multicriteria shortest path computations, is able to solve instances with over 16000 nodes within 13 minutes. Furthermore, now knowing optimal solutions for larger graphs, we are able to investigate the quality of the strongest known heuristic on reasonably sized instances for the first time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compare two generalisations of the notion of hook lengths for partitions. We apply this in the context of the modular representation theory of Ariki-Koike algebras. We show that the Schur element of a simple module is divisible by the Schur element of the associated (generalised) core. In the case of Hecke algebras of type $A$, we obtain an even stronger result: the Schur element of a simple module is equal to the product of the Schur element of its core and the Schur element of its quotient.</description>

      <title>A bound on the joint spectral radius using the diagonals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.00598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.00598v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The primary aim of this paper is to establish bounds on the joint spectral radius for a finite set of nonnegative matrices based on their diagonal elements. The efficacy of this approach is evaluated in comparison to existing and related results in the field. In particular, let $\Sigma$ be any finite set of $D\times D$ nonnegative matrices with the largest value $U$ and the smallest value $V$ over all positive entries. For each $i=1,\dots,D$, let $m_i$ be any number so that there exist $A_1,\dots,A_{m_i}\in\Sigma$ satisfying $(A_1\dots A_{m_i})_{i,i} &gt; 0$, or let $m_i=1$ if there are no such matrices. We prove that the joint spectral radius $\rho(\Sigma)$ is bounded by \[
  \max_i \sqrt[m_i]{\max_{A_1,\dots,A_{m_i}\in\Sigma} (A_1\dots A_{m_i})_{i,i}} \le \rho(\Sigma) \le \max_i \sqrt[m_i]{\left(\frac{UD}{V}\right)^{3D^2} \max_{A_1,\dots,A_{m_i}\in\Sigma} (A_1\dots A_{m_i})_{i,i}}. \]</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.06950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of graph discrepancy problems, initiated by Erd\H{o}s in the 1960s, has received renewed attention in recent years. In general, given a $2$-edge-coloured graph $G$, one is interested in embedding a copy of a graph $H$ in $G$ with large discrepancy (i.e. the copy of $H$ contains significantly more than half of its edges in one colour). Motivated by this line of research, Gishboliner, Krivelevich and Michaeli considered an oriented version of graph discrepancy for Hamilton cycles. In particular, they conjectured the following generalization of Dirac's theorem: if $G$ is an oriented graph on $n\geq3$ vertices with $\delta(G)\geq n/2$, then $G$ contains a Hamilton cycle with at least $\delta(G)$ edges pointing forward. In this paper, we present a full resolution to this conjecture.</description>

      <title>Structural and Combinatorial Properties of 2-swap Word Permutation Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01648v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the graph induced by the $\textit{2-swap}$ permutation on words with a fixed Parikh vector. A $2$-swap is defined as a pair of positions $s = (i, j)$ where the word $w$ induced by the swap $s$ on $v$ is $v[1] v[2] \dots v[i - 1] v[j] v[i+1] \dots v[j - 1] v[i] v[j + 1] \dots v[n]$. With these permutations, we define the $\textit{Configuration Graph}$, $G(P)$ defined over a given Parikh vector. Each vertex in $G(P)$ corresponds to a unique word with the Parikh vector $P$, with an edge between any pair of words $v$ and $w$ if there exists a swap $s$ such that $v \circ s = w$. We provide several key combinatorial properties of this graph, including the exact diameter of this graph, the clique number of the graph, and the relationships between subgraphs within this graph. Additionally, we show that for every vertex in the graph, there exists a Hamiltonian path starting at this vertex. Finally, we provide an algorithm enumerating these paths from a given input word of length $n$ with a delay of at most $O(\log n)$ between outputting edges, requiring $O(n \log n)$ preprocessing.</description>

Abstract: In \cite[Proposition 8.21 Page-169]{F}, using the methods of topological dynamics, H. Furstenberg introduced the notion of central set and proved the famous Central Sets Theorem. D. De, N. Hindman and D. Strauss have introduced $C$-set in \cite{DHS}, satisfying the strong central set theorem. Using the algebraic structure of the Stone-\v{C}ech compactification of a discrete semigroup, N. Hindman and D. Strauss proved that the Cartesian product of two $C$-sets is a $C$-set. In \cite{G20}, S. Goswami has proved the same result using the elementary characterization of $C$-sets. In this article, we prove that the product of two $C$-sets is a $C$-set, using the dynamical characterization of $C$-sets. Recently, in \cite{G24}, S. Goswami has proved that Cartesian product of two $CR$-sets is a $CR$-set, which was a question posed by N. Hindman, H. Hosseini, D. Strauss and M. Tootkaboni in \cite{HHST}. Here we also prove that the Cartesian product of two essential $CR$-sets is an essential $CR$-set.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building upon the foundational work of Thomas and Williams on the modular sweep map, Garsia and Xin have developed a straightforward algorithm for the inversion of the sweep map on rational $(m,n)$-Dyck paths, where $(m,n)$ represents coprime pairs of integers. Our research reveals that their innovative approach readily generalizes to encompass a broader spectrum of Dyck paths. To this end, we introduce a family of Order sweep maps applicable to general Dyck paths, which are differentiated by their respective sweep orders at level $0$. We demonstrate that each of these Order sweep maps constitutes a bijective transformation. Our findings encapsulate the sweep maps for both general Dyck paths and their incomplete counterparts as specific instances within this more extensive framework.</description>

      <title>Planar Cycle-Extendable Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For most problems pertaining to perfect matchings, one may restrict attention to matching covered graphs -- that is, connected nontrivial graphs with the property that each edge belongs to some perfect matching. There is extensive literature on these graphs that are also known as $1$-extendable graphs (since each edge extends to a perfect matching) including an ear decomposition theorem due to Lovasz and Plummer.
  A cycle $C$ of a graph $G$ is conformal if $G-V(C)$ has a perfect matching; such cycles play an important role in the study of perfect matchings, especially when investigating the Pfaffian orientation problem. A matching covered graph $G$ is cycle-extendable if -- for each even cycle $C$ -- the cycle $C$ is conformal, or equivalently, each perfect matching of $C$ extends to a perfect matching of $G$, or equivalently, $C$ is the symmetric difference of two perfect matchings of $G$, or equivalently, $C$ extends to an ear decomposition of $G$. In the literature, these are also known as cycle-nice or as $1$-cycle resonant graphs.
  Zhang, Wang, Yuan, Ng and Cheng [Discrete Mathematics, 345:7 (2022), 112876] provided a characterization of claw-free cycle-extendable graphs. Guo and Zhang [Discrete Mathematics, 275:1-3 (2004), 151-164] and independently Zhang and Li [Discrete Applied Mathematics, 160:13-14 (2012), 2069-2074], provided characterizations of bipartite planar cycle-extendable graphs. In this paper, we establish a characterization of all planar cycle-extendable graphs -- in terms of $K_2$ and four infinite families.</description>

Abstract: We use representation theory of the symmetric group S_n to prove Poisson limit theorems for the distribution of fixed points for three types of non-uniform permutations. First, we give results for the commutator of g and x where g and x are uniform in S_n. Second, we give results for the commutator of g and x where g in uniform in S_n and x is fixed. Third, we give results for permutations obtained by multiplying n*log(n)/i + cn many random i-cycles. Some of our results are known by other, quite different, methods.</description>

Abstract: Given a positive integer $t$, let $P_{t,2}$ be the digraph consisting of $t$ directed paths of length 2 with the same initial and terminal vertices.

For sufficiently large $n$, we prove that $ex(n, P_{t+1})=g(n,t)$ when $\lfloor(n-t)/{2} \rfloor$ is odd and $ex(n, P_{t+1,2})\in \{g(n,t)-1, g(n,t)\}$ when $\lfloor(n-t)/{2} \rfloor$ is even, where $g(n,t)=\left\lceil(n+t)/{2}\right\rceil \left\lfloor(n-t)/{2}\right\rfloor+tn+1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.03499v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our first result realizes the toric variety of every marked chain-order polytope (MCOP) of the Gelfand--Tsetlin poset as an explicit Gr\"obner (sagbi) degeneration of the flag variety. This generalizes the Sturmfels/Gonciulea--Lakshmibai/Kogan--Miller construction for the Gelfand--Tsetlin degeneration to the MCOP setting. The key idea of our approach is to use pipe dreams to define realizations of toric varieties in Pl\"ucker coordinates. We then use this approach to generalize two more well-known constructions to arbitrary MCOPs: standard monomial theories such as those given by semistandard Young tableaux and PBW-monomial bases in irreducible representations such as the FFLV bases. In an addendum we introduce the notion of semi-infinite pipe dreams and use it to obtain an infinite family of poset polytopes each providing a toric degeneration of the semi-infinite Grassmannian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To a subshift over a finite alphabet, one can naturally associate an infinite family of finite graphs, called its Rauzy graphs. We show that for a subshift of subexponential complexity the Rauzy graphs converge to the line $\mathbf{Z}$ in the sense of Benjamini-Schramm convergence if and only if its complexity function $p(n)$ is unbounded and satisfies $\lim_n\frac{p(n+1)}{p(n)} = 1$. We then apply this criterion to many examples of well-studied dynamical systems. If the subshift is moreover uniquely ergodic then we show that the limit of labelled Rauzy graphs if it exists can be identified with the unique invariant measure. In addition we consider an example of a non uniquely ergodic system recently studied by Cassaigne and Kabor\'e and identify a continuum of invariant measures with subsequential limits of labelled Rauzy graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a family of monomial ideals, called block diagonal matching field ideals, which arise as monomial Gr\"obner degenerations of determinantal ideals. Our focus is on the minimal free resolutions of these ideals and all of their powers. Initially, we establish their linear quotient property and compute their Betti numbers, illustrating that their minimal free resolution is supported on a regular CW complex. Our proof relies on the results of Herzog and Takayama, demonstrating that ideals with a linear quotient property have a minimal free resolution, and on the construction by Dochtermann and Mohammadi of cellular realizations of these resolutions. We begin by proving the linear quotient property for each power of such an ideal. Subsequently, we show that their corresponding decomposition map is regular, resulting in a minimal cellular resolution. Finally, we demonstrate that distinct decomposition maps lead to different cellular complexes with the same face numbers.</description>

      <title>Metric Dimension and Resolvability of Jaccard Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11424v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A subset of points in a metric space is said to resolve it if each point in the space is uniquely characterized by its distance to each point in the subset. In particular, resolving sets can be used to represent points in abstract metric spaces as Euclidean vectors. Importantly, due to the triangle inequality, points close by in the space are represented as vectors with similar coordinates, which may find applications in classification problems of symbolic objects under suitably chosen metrics. In this manuscript, we address the resolvability of Jaccard spaces, i.e., metric spaces of the form $(2^X,\text{Jac})$, where $2^X$ is the power set of a finite set $X$, and $\text{Jac}$ is the Jaccard distance between subsets of $X$. Specifically, for different $a,b\in 2^X$, $\text{Jac}(a,b)=|a\Delta b|/|a\cup b|$, where $|\cdot|$ denotes size (i.e., cardinality) and $\Delta$ denotes the symmetric difference of sets. We combine probabilistic and linear algebra arguments to construct highly likely but nearly optimal (i.e., of minimal size) resolving sets of $(2^X,\text{Jac})$. In particular, we show that the metric dimension of $(2^X,\text{Jac})$, i.e., the minimum size of a resolving set of this space, is $\Theta(|X|/\ln|X|)$. In addition, we show that a much smaller subset of $2^X$ suffices to resolve, with high probability, all different pairs of subsets of $X$ of cardinality at most $\sqrt{|X|}/\ln|X|$, up to a factor.</description>

Abstract: Let $X_1, \ldots, X_n$ be probability spaces, let $X$ be their direct product, let $\phi_1, \ldots, \phi_m: X \longrightarrow {\Bbb C}$ be random variables, each depending only on a few coordinates of a point $x=(x_1, \ldots, x_n)$, and let $f=\phi_1 + \ldots + \phi_m$. The expectation $E\thinspace e^{\lambda f}$, where $\lambda \in {\Bbb C}$, appears in statistical physics as the partition function of a system with multi-spin interactions, and also in combinatorics and computer science, where it is known as the partition function of edge-coloring models, tensor network contractions or a Holant polynomial. Assuming that each $\phi_i$ is 1-Lipschitz in the Hamming metric of $X$, that each $\phi_i(x)$ depends on at most $r \geq 2$ coordinates $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ of $x \in X$, and that for each $j$ there are at most $c \geq 1$ functions $\phi_i$ that depend on the coordinate $x_j$, we prove that $E\thinspace e^{\lambda f} \ne 0$ provided $| \lambda | \leq \ (3 c \sqrt{r-1})^{-1}$ and that the bound is sharp up to a constant factor. Taking a scaling limit, we prove a similar result for functions $\phi_1, \ldots, \phi_m: {\Bbb R}^n \longrightarrow {\Bbb C}$ that are 1-Lipschitz in the $\ell^1$ metric of ${\Bbb R}^n$ and where the expectation is taken with respect to the standard Gaussian measure in ${\Bbb R}^n$. As a corollary, the value of the expectation can be efficiently approximated, provided $\lambda$ lies in a slightly smaller disc.</description>
