      <title>A configuration space model for algebraic function spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the space of algebraic maps between two smooth projective varieties, under certain conditions, admit a configuration space model, thereby obtaining an algebro-geometric analogue of Bendersky-Gitler's result on topological function spaces. Our result is a natural higher dimensional counterpart of \cite[Theorem 3]{Ban24}.</description>

      <title>King's Conjecture and Birational Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We state and prove a birational realization of King's Conjecture for a category glued from the derived categories of all birational models in the GKZ fan of a toric variety. Our perspective extends ideas of Beilinson and Bondal to all semiprojective toric varieties. As a result, we obtain new and birationally-uniform applications to resolutions of the diagonal, categorical and noncommutative resolutions, monads, Frobenius generation, and window categories.</description>

      <title>Embedding polynomial systems into vertically parametrised families: A case study on ODEbase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vertically parametrised polynomial systems are a particular nice class of parametrised polynomial systems for which a lot of interesting algebraic information is encoded in its combinatorics. Given a fixed polynomial system, we empirically study what constitutes a good vertically parametrised polynomial system that gives rise to it and how to construct said vertically parametrised polynomial system. For data, we use all polynomial systems in ODEbase, which we have transcribed to an OSCAR readable format, and made available as a Julia package OscarODEbase.</description>

      <title>Cluster algebras and quantum cohomology rings: A-type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a cluster algebra structure within the quantum cohomology ring of a quiver variety associated with an $A$-type quiver. Specifically, let $Fl:=Fl(N_1,\ldots,N_{n+1})$ denote a partial flag variety of length $n$, and $QH_S^*(Fl)[t]:=QH_S^*(Fl)\otimes \mathbb C[t]$ be its equivariant quantum cohomology ring extended by a formal variable $t$, regarded as a $\mathbb Q$-algebra. We establish an injective $\mathbb Q$-algebra homomorphism from the $A_n$-type cluster algebra to the algebra $QH_S^*(Fl)[t]$. Furthermore, for a general quiver with potential, we propose a framework for constructing a homomorphism from the associated cluster algebra to the quantum cohomology ring of the corresponding quiver variety.
  The second main result addresses the conjecture of all-genus Seiberg duality for $A_n$-type quivers. For any quiver with potential mutation-equivalent to an $A_n$-type quiver, we consider the associated variety defined as the critical locus of the potential function. We prove that all-genus Gromov-Witten invariants of such a variety coincide with those of the flag variety.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we will characterize the structure of the negative part of the Zariski decomposition of $K_{\cF}+D$ for a foliated surface $(X,\cF)$ associated with a $\bQ$-divisor $D$ whenever $K_{\cF}+D$ is pseudoeffective. As applications, we will study the effective behavior of the multiple linear system $|m(K_{\cF}+D)|$ for any sufficiently divisible integer $m&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>Motives meet SymPy: studying $\lambda$-ring expressions in Python</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new Python package called "motives", a symbolic manipulation package based on SymPy capable of handling and simplifying motivic expressions in the Grothendieck ring of Chow motives and other types of $\lambda$-rings. The package is able to manipulate and compare arbitrary expressions in $\lambda$-rings and, in particular, it contains explicit tools for manipulating motives of several types of commonly used moduli schemes and moduli stacks of decorated bundles on curves. We have applied this new tool to advance in the verification of Mozgovoy's conjectural formula for the motive of the moduli space of twisted Higgs bundles, proving that it holds in rank 2 and 3 for any curve of genus up to 18 and any twisting bundle of small degree.</description>

      <title>The space of augmented stability conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a triangulated category $\mathcal{C}$, we construct a partial compactification, denoted $\mathcal{A}\mathrm{Stab}(\mathcal{C})$, of the quotient of its stability manifold by $\mathbb{C}$. The purpose of $\mathcal{A}\mathrm{Stab}(\mathcal{C})$ is to shed light on the structure of semiorthogonal decompositions of $\mathcal{C}$. A point of $\mathcal{A}\mathrm{Stab}(\mathcal{C})$, called an augmented stability condition on $\mathcal{C}$, consists of a newly introduced homological structure called a multiscale decomposition, along with stability conditions on subquotient categories of $\mathcal{C}$ associated to this multiscale decomposition. A generic multiscale decomposition corresponds to a semiorthogonal decomposition along with a configuration of points in $\mathbb{C}$. We give a conjectural description of open neighborhoods of certain boundary points, called the "manifold-with-corners conjecture," and we prove it in a special case. We show that this conjecture implies the existence of proper good moduli spaces of Bridgeland semistable objects in $\mathcal{C}$ when $\mathcal{C}$ is smooth and proper, and discuss some first examples where the manifold-with-corners conjecture holds.</description>

      <title>Computing the Roots of Twisting Sheaves over the Projective Line arising from Monodromy Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a monodromy representation $\rho$ of the projective line minus $m$ points, one can extend the resulting vector bundle with connection map canonically to a vector bundle with logarithmic connection map over all of the projective line. Now, since vector bundles split as twisting sheaves over the projective line, the focus of this work regards knowing the exact decomposition; i.e. computing the roots. Particularly, we compute the roots for all finite-dimensional $\rho$ when $m = 2$ and for all $\rho$ of dimension less than $3$ when $m = 3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct pathological examples of MMP singularities in every positive characteristic using quotients by $\alpha_p$-actions. In particular, we obtain non-$S_3$ terminal singularities, as well as locally stable (respectively stable) families whose general fibers are smooth (respectively klt, Cohen--Macaulay and $F$-injective) and whose special fibers are non-$S_2$. The dimensions of these examples are bounded below by a linear function of the characteristic.</description>

      <title>A short proof of the multiple cover formula for point insertions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A few years ago, G. Oberdieck conjectured a multiple cover fomula that determines the number of curves of fixed genus and degree passing through a configuration of points in an abelian surface. This formula was proved by the author using tropical techniques and Nishinou's correspondence theorem. Using the same techniques, we give a much shorter proof of the multiple cover formula for point insertions, relying on the same geometrical idea, but avoiding any kind of tropical enumeration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the cone of concentration matrices related to linear concentration models and Wishart laws. We prove that this cone is a Monge--Amp\`ere domain and that the log-likelihood function generates its potential function at the identity. The tangent sheaf carries the structure of a pre-Lie algebra. We also show that the moduli space of diagonal matrices parameterizing the polyhedral spectrahedron satisfies the Associativity Equations, a notion central in mirror symmetry, and that its compactification is a toric variety associated to a permutohedron, reminiscent to Losev--Manin spaces. Finally we introduce Frobenius residuals: these are connected components of the compactified Frobenius manifold of diagonal matrices, generated by the Bia\l{}ynicki--Birula cells. We prove that the Maximum Likelihood degree is indexed by components lying on those Frobenius residuals.</description>

      <title>Quantum periods, toric degenerations and intrinsic mirror symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a Fano variety $X$, and $U$ an affine log Calabi-Yau variety given as the complement of an anticanonical divisor $D \subset X$, we prove that for any snc compactification $Y$ of $U$ dominating $X$ with $D' = Y\setminus U$, there exists an element $W_D \in R_{(Y,D')}$ of the intrinsic mirror algebra whose classical periods give the regularized quantum periods of $X$. Using this result, we deduce various corollaries regarding Fano mirror symmetry, in particular integrality of regularized quantum periods in large generality and the existence of Laurent mirrors to all Fano varieties whose mirrors contain a dense torus. When $U$ is an affine cluster variety satisfying the Fock-Goncharov conjecture, we use this result to produce a family of polytopes indexed by seeds of $U$ determined by enumerative invariants of the pair $(X,D)$ which give a family of Newton-Okounkov bodies and toric degenerations of $X$. Moreover, we give an explicit description of the superpotential in the Grassmanian setting, in particular recovering the Plucker coordinate mirror found by Marsh and Rietsch. Finally, we use the main result to show that the quantum period sequence is equivalent to all theta function structure constants for $R_{(X,D)}$ when $D$ is a smooth anticanonical divisor.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a variety $Y_{n,k}$, which we call the \textit{affine $\Delta$-Springer fiber}, generalizing the affine Springer fiber studied by Hikita, whose Borel-Moore homology has an $S_n$ action and a bigrading that corresponds to the Delta Conjecture symmetric function $\mathrm{rev}_q\,\omega \Delta'_{e_{k-1}}e_n$ under the Frobenius character map. We similarly provide a geometric interpretation for the Rational Shuffle Theorem in the integer slope case $(km,k)$. The variety $Y_{n,k}$ has a map to the affine Grassmannian whose fibers are the $\Delta$-Springer fibers introduced by Levinson, Woo, and the third author. Part of our proof of our geometric realization relies on our previous work on a Schur skewing operator formula relating the Rational Shuffle Theorem to the Delta Conjecture.</description>

Abstract: Let $F$ be a non-archimedean local field. Let $\overline{F}$ be an algebraic closure of $F$. Let $G$ be a connected reductive group over $F$. Let $\varphi$ be an elliptic $L$-parameter. For every irreducible representation $\pi$ of $G(F)$ with Fargues--Scholze $L$-parameter $\varphi$, we prove that there exists a finite set of irreducible representations $\{\pi_i\}_{i \in I}$ containing $\pi$, such that $\pi_i$ has Fargues--Scholze $L$-parameter $\varphi$ for all $i \in I$ and a certain non-zero $\mathbb{Z}$-linear combination $\Theta_{\pi_0}$ of the Harish-Chandra characters of $\{\pi_i\}_{i \in I}$ is stable under $G(\overline{F})$ conjugation, as a function on the elliptic regular semisimple elements of $G(F)$. Moreover, if $F$ has characteristic zero, $\Theta_{\pi_0}$ is a non-zero stable distribution on $G(F)$.</description>

      <title>Relative Pose Observability Analysis Using Dual Quaternions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relative pose (position and orientation) estimation is an essential component of many robotics applications. Fiducial markers, such as the AprilTag visual fiducial system, yield a relative pose measurement from a single marker detection and provide a powerful tool for pose estimation. In this paper, we perform a Lie algebraic nonlinear observability analysis on a nonlinear dual quaternion system that is composed of a relative pose measurement model and a relative motion model. We prove that many common dual quaternion expressions yield Jacobian matrices with advantageous block structures and rank properties that are beneficial for analysis. We show that using a dual quaternion representation yields an observability matrix with a simple block triangular structure and satisfies the necessary full rank condition.</description>

      <title>In Search of a Hidden Curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three enumeration problems are discussed in these lectures. One is a detailed account on simple Hurwitz numbers, explaining how the problem was solved by discovering a key curve. This key ignites the generating functions of Hurwitz numbers and drives them into polynomials. The unexpected polynomiality then brings us simple proofs of the Witten-Kontsevich theorem and the $\lambda_g$-theorem of Faber-Pandharipande. An analogous problem associated with Catalan numbers is also presented, which has a simpler feature in terms of analysis. The third enumeration problem is a quest of identifying a hidden curve behind the Ap\'ery sequence, which remains to be discovered.
  It is examined how a counting problem leads to a \emph{spectral curve} through a differential equation, of Picard-Fuchs type but can be nonlinear. The counting problem is a geometric question associated with the \emph{genus $0$, one marked point} case. Going from the $(0,1)$-case to arbitrary $(g,n)$-case is explained as a process of \emph{quantization} of the spectral curve.
  This perspective of quantization is discussed in a geometric setting, when the differential equations have holomorphic coefficients, in terms of Higgs bundles, opers, and Gaiotto's conformal limit construction. In this context, however, there are no counting problems behind the scene.</description>

      <title>Initial ideals of weighted forms and the genus of locally Cohen-Macaulay curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let C be a locally Cohen-Macaulay curve in complex projective 3-space. The maximum genus problem predicts the largest possible arithmetic genus g(d,s) that C can achieve assuming that it has degree d and does not lie on surfaces of degree less than s. In this paper, we prove that this prediction is correct when d=s or d is at least 2s-1. We obtain this result by proving another conjecture, by Beorchia, Lella, and the second author, about initial ideals associated to certain homogeneous forms in a non-standard graded polynomial ring.</description>

      <title>On Kato's ramification filtration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a Henselian discrete valued field $K$ of characteristic $p&gt;0$, Kato defined a ramification filtration $\{{\rm fil}_nH^q(K,\mathbb Q_p/\mathbb Z_p(q-1))\}_{n \ge 0}$ on $H^q(K,\mathbb Q_p/\mathbb Z_p(q-1))$. One can also define a ramification filtration on $H^q(U,\mathbb Z/p^m(q-1))$ using the local Kato-filtration, where $U$ is the complement of a simple normal crossing divisor in a regular scheme $X$ of characteristic $p&gt;0$. The main objective of this thesis is to provide a cohomological description of these filtrations using de Rham-Witt sheaves and present several applications.
  To achieve our goal, we study a theory of the filtered de Rham-Witt complex of $F$-finite regular schemes of characteristic $p&gt;0$ and prove several properties which are well known for the classical de Rham-Witt complex of regular schemes. As applications, we prove a refined version of Jannsen-Saito-Zhao's duality over finite fields, and a similar duality for smooth projective curves over local fields. As another application, we prove a Lefschetz theorem for unramified and ramified Brauer group (with modulus) of smooth projective $F$-finite schemes over a field of characteristic $p&gt;0$. Further applications are given in [49] and [50].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a complete discretely valued field with residue field $\bar K$ of dimension $1$ (not necessarily perfect). This occurs if and only if $K$ has dimension $2$. We prove the following statements on the arithmetic of such fields:
  - The "period equals index" property holds for central simple $K$-algebras.
  - For every prime $p$, every class in the Milnor $\mathrm{K}$-theory modulo $p$ is represented by a symbol.
  - Serre's Conjecture II holds for the field $K$. That is, for every semisimple and simply connected $K$-group $G$, the set $H^1(K,G)$ is trivial.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2011.12223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Works by O'Grady allow to associate to a 2-dimensional Gushel-Mukai variety, which is a K3 surface, a double EPW sextic. We characterize the K3 surfaces whose associated double EPW sextic is smooth. As a consequence, we are able to produce symplectic actions on some families of smooth double EPW sextics which are hyper-K\"ahler manifolds. We also provide bounds for the automorphism group of Gushel-Mukai varieties in dimension 2 and higher.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.04238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a closed formula for the integral of a power of a single $\psi$-class on strata of $k$-differentials. In many cases, these integrals correspond to intersection numbers on twisted double ramification cycles. Then we conjecture an expression of a refinement of double ramification cycles according to the parity of spin structures. Assuming that this conjecture is valid, we also compute the integral of a single $\psi$-class on the even and odd components of strata of $k$-differentials. As an application of these results we give a closed formula for the Euler characteristic of components of minimal strata of abelian differentials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.00940v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a log Calabi Yau pair (X,D) with X\D smooth affine, satisfying either assumption 1.1 of "The canonical wall structure and intrinsic mirror symmetry" or contains a Zariski dense torus, we prove under the condition that D is the support of a nef divisor, that the structure constants defining a trace form on the mirror algebra constructed by Gross-Siebert are given by the naive curve counts defined by Keel-Yu in definition 1.1 of "The Frobenius structure theorem for log Calabi-Yau varieties containing a torus". As a corollary, we deduce the equality of the mirror algebras constructed by Gross-Siebert and Keel-Yu in the case X\D contains a Zariski dense torus. In addition, we use this result to prove a mirror conjecture proposed by Mandel in "Fano mirror periods from the Frobenius structure conjecture" for Fano pairs satisfying assumption 1.1.</description>

Abstract: Given a log smooth scheme $(X,D)$, and a log \'etale modification $(\tilde{X},\tilde{D}) \rightarrow (X,D)$, we relate the punctured Gromov-Witten theory of $(\tilde{X},\tilde{D})$ to the punctured Gromov-Witten theory of $(X,D)$, generalizing results of Abramovich and Wise in the non-punctured setting in "Birational invariance in log Gromov-Witten Theory". Using the main comparison results, we show a form of log \'etale invariance for the logarithmic mirror algebras and canonical scattering diagrams constructed in "Intrinsic Mirror Symmetry" and "The Canonical Wall Structure and Intrinsic Mirror Symmetry" respectively.</description>

Furthermore, we demonstrate that its rank is subgeneric for all $n&gt;(2s-1)^2$.</description>

Abstract: We study the constructible Witt theory of \'etale sheaves of $\Lambda$-modules on a scheme $X$ for coefficient rings $\Lambda$ having finite characteristic not equal to 2 and prime to the residue characteristics of the scheme $X$. Our construction is based on the recent advances by Cisinski and D\'eglise on six-functor formalism for derived categories of \'etale motives and offers a background for the study of constructible Witt theory as a cohomological invariant for schemes. In the case of smooth complex algebraic varieties and finite coefficient rings, we show that the algebraic constructible Witt theory studied in this paper can be identified with the topological constructible Witt theory.</description>

Abstract: We study the singularities of varieties obtained as infinitesimal quotients by $1$-foliations in positive characteristic. (1) We show that quotients by (log) canonical $1$-foliations preserve the (log) singularities of the MMP. (2) We prove that quotients by multiplicative derivations preserve many properties, amongst which most $F$-singularities. (3) We formulate a notion of families of $1$-foliations, and investigate the corresponding families of quotients.</description>

Abstract: For any sheaf of sets $\mathcal F$ on $Sm/k$, it is well known that the universal $\mathbb A^1$-invariant quotient of $\mathcal F$ is given as the colimit of sheaves $\mathcal S^n(\mathcal F)$ where $\mathcal S(F)$ is the sheaf of naive $\mathbb A^1$-connected components of $\mathcal F$. We show that these infinite iterations of naive $\mathbb A^1$-connected components in the construction of universal $\mathbb A^1$-invariant quotient for a scheme are certainly required. For every $n$, we construct an $\mathbb A^1$-connected variety $X_n$ such that $\mathcal S^n(X_n)\neq \mathcal S^{n+1}(X_n)$ and $\mathcal S^{n+2}(X_n)=*$.</description>

Abstract: We initiate the study of finite abelian groups that faithfully act on 3-dimensional rationally connected varieties. We show that these groups can be naturally divided into three types: the groups of product type are finite abelian groups that are products of two groups which belong to the Cremona group of rank 1 and 2, respectively; the group of K3 type consists of cyclic extensions of finite abelian groups acting on a K3 surface; the third type consists of groups that act on terminal Fano threefolds with empty anti-canonical linear system. The classification of groups of product type follows from a result of J. Blanc. For the groups of K3 type, we show that there are only finitely many of them. We also formulate a conjecture regarding the groups of the third type.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kontsevich suggested that the Landau-Ginzburg model presents a good formalism for homological mirror symmetry. In this paper we propose to investigate the LG theory from the viewpoint of Koopman-von Neumann's construction. New advances are thus provided, namely regarding a conjecture of Kontsevich-Soibelman (on a version of the Strominger-Yau-Zaslow mirror problem). We show that there exists a Monge-Amp\`ere domain Y, generated by a space of probability densities parametrising mirror dual Calabi-Yau manifolds. This provides torus fibrations over Y. The mirror pairs are obtained via the Berglund-Hubsch-Krawitz construction. We also show that the Monge-Amp\`ere manifolds are pre-Frobenius manifolds. Our method allows to recover certain results concerning Lagrangian torus fibrations. We illustrate our construction on a concrete toy model, which allows us, additionally to deduce a relation between von Neumann algebras, Monge-Amp\`ere manifolds and pre-Frobenius manifolds.</description>

Abstract: We define the hypergeometric exponential sum associated to a finite family of representations of a reductive group over a finite field. We introduce the hypergeometric $\ell$-adic sheaf to describe the behavior of the hypergeometric exponential sum. It is a perverse sheaf, and it is the counterpart in characteristic $p$ of the $A$-hypergeometric $\mathcal D$-module introduced by Kapranov. Using the theory of the Fourier transform for vector bundles over a general base developed by Wang, we are able to study the hypergeometric $\ell$-adic sheaf via the hypergeometric $\mathcal D$-module. We apply our results to the estimation of the hypergeometric exponential sum.</description>

Abstract: We consider a definition of the Fukaya category of a singular hypersurface proposed by Auroux, given by localizing the Fukaya category of a nearby fiber at Seidel's natural transformation, and show that this possesses several desirable properties. Firstly, we prove an A-side analog of Orlov's derived Kn\"orrer periodicity theorem by showing that Auroux's category is derived equivalent to the Fukaya-Seidel category of a higher-dimensional Landau-Ginzburg model. Secondly, we describe how this definition implies homological mirror symmetry for some large complex structure limit degenerations of abelian varieties.</description>

      <title>Homological mirror symmetry for functors between Fukaya categories of very affine hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.03227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that homological mirror symmetry for very affine hypersurfaces respects certain natural symplectic operations (as functors between partially wrapped Fukaya categories), verifying conjectures of Auroux. These conjectures concern compatibility between mirror symmetry for a very affine hypersurface and its complement, itself also a very affine hypersurface. We find that the complement of a very affine hypersurface has in fact two natural mirrors, one of which is a derived scheme. These two mirrors are related via a non-geometric equivalence mediated by Kn\"orrer periodicity; Auroux's conjectures require some modification to take this into account. Our proof also introduces new techniques for presenting Liouville manifolds as gluings of Liouville sectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10736v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In local relative $p$-adic Hodge theory, we show that the Galois cohomology of a finite height crystalline representation (up to a twist) is essentially computed via the (Fontaine--Messing) syntomic complex with coefficients in the associated $F$-isocrystal. In global applications, for smooth ($p$-adic formal) schemes, we establish a comparison between the syntomic complex with coefficients in a locally free Fontaine--Laffaille module and the $p$-adic nearby cycles of the associated \'etale local system on the (rigid) generic fibre.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00650v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let E and E' be elliptic curves over Q with complex multiplication by the ring of integers of an imaginary quadratic field K and let Y=Kum(ExE') be the minimal desingularisation of the quotient of ExE' by the action of -1. We study the Brauer groups of such surfaces Y and use them to furnish new examples of transcendental Brauer-Manin obstructions to weak approximation.</description>

      <title>Alcove walk models for parabolic Mirkovi\'c-Vilonen intersections and branching to Levi subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17174v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article establishes alcove walk models for intersections of Schubert varieties and partially semi-infinite orbits in the affine Grassmannian of a split reductive group (we call such intersections parabolic Mirkovi\'c-Vilonen intersections). More precisely, we describe explicit cellular pavings of these intersections, indexed by certain positively-folded alcove walks. We prove a parametrization of the irreducible components of maximal possible dimension, in terms of alcove walks of maximal possible dimension. We then deduce a new combinatorial description of branching to Levi subgroups of irreducible highest weight representations, and in particular we give a new algorithm for computing the characters of such representations.</description>

      <title>Mabuchi K\"ahler solitons versus extremal K\"ahler metrics and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the Yau-Tian-Donaldson type correspondence for $v$-solitons established by Han-Li, we show that a smooth complex $n$-dimensional Fano variety admits a Mabuchi soliton provided it admits an extremal K\"ahler metric whose scalar curvature is strictly less than $2(n+1)$. Combined with previous observations by Mabuchi and Nakamura in the other direction, this gives a characterization of the existence of Mabuchi solitons in terms of the existence of extremal K\"ahler metrics on Fano manifolds. An extension of this correspondence to $v$-solitons is also obtained.</description>

      <title>The two-loop Amplituhedron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The loop-Amplituhedron $\mathcal{A}^{(L)}_{n}$ is a semialgebraic set in the product of Grassmannians $\mathrm{Gr}_{\mathbb{R}}(2,4)^L$. Recently, many aspects of this geometry for the case of $L=1$ have been elucidated, such as its algebraic and face stratification, its residual arrangement and the existence and uniqueness of the adjoint. This paper extends this analysis to the simplest higher loop case given by the two-loop four-point Amplituhedron $\mathcal{A}^{(2)}_4$.</description>

      <title>On the geometry of K\"ahler--Frobenius manifolds and their classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this article is to show that flat compact K\"ahler manifolds exhibit the structure of a Frobenius manifold, a structure originating in 2D Topological Quantum Field Theory and closely related to Joyce structure. As a result, we classify all such manifolds. It can be deduced that K\"ahler--Frobenius manifolds include certain Calabi--Yau manifolds, complex tori $T=\mathbb{C}^n/\mathbb{Z}^n$, generalized (orientable) Hantzsche--Wendt manifolds, hyperelliptic manifolds and manifolds of type $T/G$, where $G$ is a finite group acting on $T$ freely and containing no translations. An explicit study is provided for the two-dimensional case. Additionally, we can prove that Chern's conjecture for K\"ahler pre-Frobenius manifolds holds. Lastly, we establish that certain classes of K\"ahler-Frobenius manifolds share a direct relationship with theta functions which are important objects in number theory as well as complex analysis.</description>
