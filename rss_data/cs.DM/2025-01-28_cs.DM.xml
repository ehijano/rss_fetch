      <title>Fully-Automated Code Generation for Efficient Computation of Sparse Matrix Permanents on GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Registers are the fastest memory components within the GPU's complex memory hierarchy, accessed by names rather than addresses. They are managed entirely by the compiler through a process called register allocation, during which the compiler attempts to cache predictable data from thread-local memory into thread-private registers. Computing the permanent of a sparse matrix poses a challenge for compilers, as optimizing this process is hindered by the unpredictable distribution of nonzero elements, which only become known at runtime. In this work, we employ fully-automated code generation to address this, producing highly optimized kernels tailored to the matrix's sparsity pattern. State-of-the-art permanent computation algorithms require each thread to store a private array, denoted x, of size n. We first propose a technique that fully stores these arrays in registers, with inclusion and exclusion kernels generated for each column. To minimize control divergence and reduce the number of unique kernels within a warp, we exploit the internal structure of Gray codes, which are also used in the state-of-the-art algorithm. Our second technique reduces register pressure by utilizing both registers and global memory and introduces a matrix ordering and partitioning strategy for greater efficiency. On synthetic matrices, this approach achieves a 31x speedup over state-of-the-art CPU implementations on 112 cores, and an 8x speedup compared to our traditional GPU implementation. For real-world matrices, these speedups are 24.9x and 4.9x.</description>

      <title>Degree Realization by Bipartite Multigraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of realizing a given degree sequence by a multigraph can be thought of as a relaxation of the classical degree realization problem (where the realizing graph is simple). This paper concerns the case where the realizing multigraph is required to be bipartite.
  The problem of characterizing degree sequences that can be realized by a bipartite (simple) graph has two variants. In the simpler one, termed BDR$^P$, the partition of the degree sequence into two sides is given as part of the input. A complete characterization for realizability in this variant was given by Gale and Ryser over sixty years ago. However, the variant where the partition is not given, termed BDR, is still open.
  For bipartite multigraph realizations, there are also two variants. For BDR$^P$, where the partition is given as part of the input, a complete characterization was known for determining whether there is a multigraph realization whose underlying graph is bipartite, such that the maximum number of copies of an edge is at most $r$. We present a complete characterization for determining if there is a bipartite multigraph realization such that the total number of excess edges is at most $t$. We show that optimizing these two measures may lead to different realizations, and that optimizing by one measure may increase the other substantially. As for the variant BDR, where the partition is not given, we show that determining whether a given (single) sequence admits a bipartite multigraph realization is NP-hard. On the positive side, we provide an algorithm that computes optimal realizations for the case where the number of balanced partitions is polynomial, and present sufficient conditions for the existence of bipartite multigraph realizations that depend only on the largest degree of the sequence.</description>

      <title>Compressing CFI Graphs and Lower Bounds for the Weisfeiler-Leman Refinements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $k$-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman ($k$-WL) algorithm is a simple combinatorial algorithm that was originally designed as a graph isomorphism heuristic. It naturally finds applications in Babai's quasipolynomial time isomorphism algorithm, practical isomorphism solvers, and algebraic graph theory. However, it also has surprising connections to other areas such as logic, proof complexity, combinatorial optimization, and machine learning.
  The algorithm iteratively computes a coloring of the $k$-tuples of vertices of a graph. Since F\"urer's linear lower bound [ICALP 2001], it has been an open question whether there is a super-linear lower bound for the iteration number for $k$-WL on graphs. We answer this question affirmatively, establishing an $\Omega(n^{k/2})$-lower bound for all $k$.</description>

      <title>Big Ramsey degrees using parameter spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.00967v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the universal homogeneous partial order has finite big Ramsey degrees and discuss several corollaries. Our proof relies on parameter spaces and the Carlson-Simpson theorem rather than on (a strengthening of) the Halpern-L\"auchli theorem and the Milliken tree theorem, which are typically used to bound big Ramsey degrees in the existing literature (originating from the work of Laver and Milliken).
  This new technique has many additional applications. We show that the homogeneous universal triangle-free graph has finite big Ramsey degrees, providing a short proof of a recent result by Dobrinen. Moreover, generalizing an indivisibility (vertex partition) result of Nguyen van Th\'e and Sauer, we give an upper bound on big Ramsey degrees of metric spaces with finitely many distances. This leads to a new combinatorial argument for the oscillation stability of the Urysohn Sphere.</description>

      <title>Maintaining $\mathsf{CMSO}_2$ properties on dynamic structures with bounded feedback vertex number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.06232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\varphi$ be a sentence of $\mathsf{CMSO}_2$ (monadic second-order logic with quantification over edge subsets and counting modular predicates) over the signature of graphs. We present a dynamic data structure that for a given graph $G$ that is updated by edge insertions and edge deletions, maintains whether $\varphi$ is satisfied in $G$. The data structure is required to correctly report the outcome only when the feedback vertex number of $G$ does not exceed a fixed constant $k$, otherwise it reports that the feedback vertex number is too large. With this assumption, we guarantee amortized update time ${\cal O}_{\varphi,k}(\log n)$. If we additionally assume that the feedback vertex number of $G$ never exceeds $k$, this update time guarantee is worst-case.
  By combining this result with a classic theorem of Erd\H{o}s and P\'osa, we give a fully dynamic data structure that maintains whether a graph contains a packing of $k$ vertex-disjoint cycles with amortized update time ${\cal O}_{k}(\log n)$. Our data structure also works in a larger generality of relational structures over binary signatures.</description>

      <title>Multivariate Analytic Combinatorics for Cost Constrained Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.06105v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analytic combinatorics in several variables is a branch of mathematics that deals with deriving the asymptotic behavior of combinatorial quantities by analyzing multivariate generating functions. We study information-theoretic questions about sequences in a discrete noiseless channel under cost constraints. Our main contributions involve the relationship between the graph structure of the channel and the singularities of the bivariate generating function whose coefficients are the number of sequences satisfying the constraints. We use these new results to invoke theorems from multivariate analytic combinatorics to obtain the asymptotic behavior of the number of cost-limited strings that are admissible by the channel. This builds a new bridge between analytic combinatorics in several variables and labeled weighted graphs, bringing a new perspective and a set of powerful results to the literature of cost-constrained channels. Along the way, we show that the cost-constrained channel capacity is determined by a cost-dependent singularity of the bivariate generating function, generalizing Shannon's classical result for unconstrained capacity, and provide a new proof of the equivalence of the combinatorial and probabilistic definitions of the cost-constrained capacity.</description>

      <title>Improved Integrality Gap in Max-Min Allocation: or Topology at the North Pole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.01143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.01143v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the max-min allocation problem a set $P$ of players are to be allocated disjoint subsets of a set $R$ of indivisible resources, such that the minimum utility among all players is maximized. We study the restricted variant, also known as the Santa Claus problem, where each resource has an intrinsic positive value, and each player covets a subset of the resources. Bez\'akov\'a and Dani showed that this problem is NP-hard to approximate within a factor less than $2$, consequently a great deal of work has focused on approximate solutions. The principal approach for obtaining approximation algorithms has been via the Configuration LP (CLP) of Bansal and Sviridenko. Accordingly, there has been much interest in bounding the integrality gap of this CLP. The existing algorithms and integrality gap estimations are all based one way or another on the combinatorial augmenting tree argument of Haxell for finding perfect matchings in certain hypergraphs. Our main innovation in this paper is to introduce the use of topological methods for the restricted max-min allocation problem, to replace the combinatorial argument. This approach yields substantial improvements in the integrality gap of the CLP. In particular we improve the previously best known bound of $3.808$ to $3.534$. We also study the $(1,\varepsilon)$-restricted version, in which resources can take only two values, and improve the integrality gap in most cases.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of the big Ramsey degrees of the generic partial order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.10088v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a result of 33 intercontinental Zoom calls, we characterise big Ramsey degrees of the generic partial order. This is an infinitary extension of the well known fact that finite partial orders endowed with linear extensions form a Ramsey class (this result was announced by Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il and R\"odl in 1984 with first published proof by Paoli, Trotter and Walker in 1985). Towards this, we refine earlier upper bounds obtained by Hubi\v{c}ka based on a new connection of big Ramsey degrees to the Carlson-Simpson theorem and we also introduce a new technique of giving lower bounds using an iterated application of the upper-bound theorem.</description>

      <title>Geodetic Graphs: Experiments and New Constructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1962 Ore initiated the study of geodetic graphs. A graph is called geodetic if the shortest path between every pair of vertices is unique. In the subsequent years a wide range of papers appeared investigating their peculiar properties. Yet, a complete classification of geodetic graphs is out of reach.
  In this work we present a program enumerating all geodetic graphs of a given size. Using our program, we succeed to find all geodetic graphs with up to 25 vertices and all regular geodetic graphs with up to 32 vertices. This leads to the discovery of two new infinite families of geodetic graphs.</description>

      <title>All You Need is Resistance: On the Equivalence of Effective Resistance and Certain Optimal Transport Problems on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15261v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fields of effective resistance and optimal transport on graphs are filled with rich connections to combinatorics, geometry, machine learning, and beyond. In this article we put forth a bold claim: that the two fields should be understood as one and the same, up to a choice of $p$. We make this claim precise by introducing the parameterized family of $p$-Beckmann distances for probability measures on graphs and relate them sharply to certain Wasserstein distances. Then, we break open a suite of results including explicit connections to optimal stopping times and random walks on graphs, graph Sobolev spaces, and a Benamou-Brenier type formula for $2$-Beckmann distance. We further explore empirical implications in the world of unsupervised learning for graph data and propose further study of the usage of these metrics where Wasserstein distance may produce computational bottlenecks.</description>

      <title>The Selection Problem in Multi-Query Optimization: a Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: View materialization, index selection, and plan caching are well-known techniques for optimization of query processing in database systems. The essence of these tasks is to select and save a subset of the most useful candidates (views/indexes/plans) for reuse within given space/time budget constraints. In this paper, we propose a unified view on these selection problems. We make a detailed analysis of the root causes of their complexity and summarize techniques to address them. Our survey provides a modern classification of selection algorithms known in the literature, including the latest ones based on Machine Learning. We provide a ground for reuse of the selection techniques between different optimization scenarios and highlight challenges and promising directions in the field. Based on our analysis we derive a method to exponentially accelerate some of the state-of-the-art selection algorithms.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Algorithm for Permutation Iteration Using a Singly Linked List</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10102v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new algorithm for iterating over all permutations of a sequence. The algorithm leverages elementary $O(1)$ operations on recursive lists. As a result, no new nodes are allocated during the computation. Instead, all elements are rearranged within the original nodes of the singly linked list throughout the process. While permutations are generated in an unusual order, the transitions between consecutive permutations remain smooth. A proof of concept written in the Lisp programming language is proposed and discussed.</description>
