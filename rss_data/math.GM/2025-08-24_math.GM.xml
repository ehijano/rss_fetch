      <title>Alternative Approaches for Counting Weakly Increasing Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents two alternative approaches for counting the number of two-row weakly increasing matrices, which are $2\times n$ matrices whose entries are integers from $1$ to $k$ and are weakly increasing along all rows and columns, for any positive integers $n$ and $k$. The first approach establishes a bijection between the set of such matrices and the set of Kekul\'e structures for certain hexagonal benzenoids. The second approach reduces the problem to counting the number of pairs of non-intersecting lattice paths. These approaches reveal interesting connections between combinatorial problems that arise in different domains.</description>

      <title>Partitioning to solve Bin Packing Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Bin Packing Problem involves efficiently packing items into a limited number of bins without exceeding their capacity. In this paper, we try to answer a specific question in this field. Mathematically the combinatorial optimization problem of this classical Bin Packing can be formulated as follows
  "Will it be possible to distribute $n$ items with sizes $a_1, \cdots ,a_n$ in total $k$ numbers of bins such that each of the bins consists of exactly $\ell$ number of items whose combined item size is $\mathbb{C}$ provided none of the items left after the allocation? In other words, can we achieve the optimal arrangement $\mathbb{C} =\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i$ such that $k\ell=n$ also holds under the given size restriction on bins?"
  We propose an algorithm that determines whether a Bin Packing arrangement is possible while ensuring that each packed bin is distinct. We use tools from standard mathematical concepts such as partitioning of natural number and multiset to derive the algorithm. This algorithm is efficient, easy to implement, and ensures the desired packing in all applicable cases.</description>

      <title>The problem of finding three numbers such that the sum or difference of any two of them is a square number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Euler explored the problem of finding three numbers such that the sum or difference of any two of them is a perfect square. He discovered a parametric solution represented by polynomials of degree 18 and identified the smallest of these solutions. Additionally, we derive two parametric solutions using the elliptic curve method and find all solutions within the range of $10^8$.</description>

      <title>Legendre duality for certain summations over the Farey pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10592v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Each irreducible fraction $p/q&gt;0$ corresponds to a primitive vector $(p,q)\in\mathbb Z^2$ with positive coordinates. Such a vector $(p,q)$ can be uniquely written as the sum of two primitive vectors $(a,b),(c,d)\in\mathbb Z_{\geq 0}^2$ spanning a parallelogram of oriented area one.
  We present new summation formulas over the set of such parallelograms. These formulas depend explicitly on $a,b,c,d$ and thus define a summation over primitive vectors $(p,q)=(a+c,b+d)$ indirectly. Equivalently, these sums may be interpreted as running over Farey pairs, i.e. pairs of fractions $0\leq c/d&lt;a/b\leq 1$ satisfying $ad-bc=1$.
  The input for our formulas is the graph of a strictly concave function $g$. The terms are the areas of certain triangles formed by tangents to the graph of $g$. Several of these formulas for different $g$ yield values involving $\pi$. For $g$ a parabola we recover the classical Mordell-Tornheim series (also called the Witten series). As a nice application we also discuss formulas for continued fractions for an arbitrary real number $\alpha$ involving coefficients of the continued fraction and the differences between the convergents and $\alpha$.
  Using Hata's work, we show that the terms in the above formulas are the coefficients of the Legendre transform of $g$ in a certain Schauder basis, allowing us to interpret our formulas as Parseval-type identities. We hope that the Legendre duality sheds new light on Hata's approach.
  Raising the terms in the above summation formula to the power $s$ we obtain a function $F_g(s)$. We prove that for a strictly concave $g$, the function $F_g(s)$ converges for $s&gt;2/3$ and diverges at $s=2/3$.</description>
