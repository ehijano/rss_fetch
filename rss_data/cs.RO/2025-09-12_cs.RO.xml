      <title>Multi Robot Coordination in Highly Dynamic Environments: Tackling Asymmetric Obstacles and Limited Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coordinating a fully distributed multi-agent system (MAS) can be challenging when the communication channel has very limited capabilities in terms of sending rate and packet payload. When the MAS has to deal with active obstacles in a highly partially observable environment, the communication channel acquires considerable relevance. In this paper, we present an approach to deal with task assignments in extremely active scenarios, where tasks need to be frequently reallocated among the agents participating in the coordination process. Inspired by market-based task assignments, we introduce a novel distributed coordination method to orchestrate autonomous agents' actions efficiently in low communication scenarios. In particular, our algorithm takes into account asymmetric obstacles. While in the real world, the majority of obstacles are asymmetric, they are usually treated as symmetric ones, thus limiting the applicability of existing methods. To summarize, the presented architecture is designed to tackle scenarios where the obstacles are active and asymmetric, the communication channel is poor and the environment is partially observable. Our approach has been validated in simulation and in the real world, using a team of NAO robots during official RoboCup competitions. Experimental results show a notable reduction in task overlaps in limited communication settings, with a decrease of 52% in the most frequent reallocated task.</description>

      <title>Rapid Manufacturing of Lightweight Drone Frames Using Single-Tow Architected Composites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The demand for lightweight and high-strength composite structures is rapidly growing in aerospace and robotics, particularly for optimized drone frames. However, conventional composite manufacturing methods struggle to achieve complex 3D architectures for weight savings and rely on assembling separate components, which introduce weak points at the joints. Additionally, maintaining continuous fiber reinforcement remains challenging, limiting structural efficiency. In this study, we demonstrate the lightweight Face Centered Cubic (FFC) lattice structured conceptualization of drone frames for weight reduction and complex topology fabrication through 3D Fiber Tethering (3DFiT) using continuous single tow fiber ensuring precise fiber alignment, eliminating weak points associated with traditional composite assembly. Mechanical testing demonstrates that the fabricated drone frame exhibits a high specific strength of around four to eight times the metal and thermoplastic, outperforming other conventional 3D printing methods. The drone frame weighs only 260 g, making it 10% lighter than the commercial DJI F450 frame, enhancing structural integrity and contributing to an extended flight time of three minutes, while flight testing confirms its stability and durability under operational conditions. The findings demonstrate the potential of single tow lattice truss-based drone frames, with 3DFiT serving as a scalable and efficient manufacturing method.</description>

      <title>KoopMotion: Learning Almost Divergence Free Koopman Flow Fields for Motion Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel flow field-based motion planning method that drives a robot from any initial state to a desired reference trajectory such that it converges to the trajectory's end point. Despite demonstrated efficacy in using Koopman operator theory for modeling dynamical systems, Koopman does not inherently enforce convergence to desired trajectories nor to specified goals -- a requirement when learning from demonstrations (LfD). We present KoopMotion which represents motion flow fields as dynamical systems, parameterized by Koopman Operators to mimic desired trajectories, and leverages the divergence properties of the learnt flow fields to obtain smooth motion fields that converge to a desired reference trajectory when a robot is placed away from the desired trajectory, and tracks the trajectory until the end point. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we show evaluations of KoopMotion on the LASA human handwriting dataset and a 3D manipulator end-effector trajectory dataset, including spectral analysis. We also perform experiments on a physical robot, verifying KoopMotion on a miniature autonomous surface vehicle operating in a non-static fluid flow environment. Our approach is highly sample efficient in both space and time, requiring only 3\% of the LASA dataset to generate dense motion plans. Additionally, KoopMotion provides a significant improvement over baselines when comparing metrics that measure spatial and temporal dynamics modeling efficacy.</description>

      <title>Kinetostatics and Particle-Swarm Optimization of Vehicle-Mounted Underactuated Metamorphic Loading Manipulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fixed degree-of-freedom (DoF) loading mechanisms often suffer from excessive actuators, complex control, and limited adaptability to dynamic tasks. This study proposes an innovative mechanism of underactuated metamorphic loading manipulators (UMLM), integrating a metamorphic arm with a passively adaptive gripper. The metamorphic arm exploits geometric constraints, enabling the topology reconfiguration and flexible motion trajectories without additional actuators. The adaptive gripper, driven entirely by the arm, conforms to diverse objects through passive compliance. A structural model is developed, and a kinetostatics analysis is conducted to investigate isomorphic grasping configurations. To optimize performance, Particle-Swarm Optimization (PSO) is utilized to refine the gripper's dimensional parameters, ensuring robust adaptability across various applications. Simulation results validate the UMLM's easily implemented control strategy, operational versatility, and effectiveness in grasping diverse objects in dynamic environments. This work underscores the practical potential of underactuated metamorphic mechanisms in applications requiring efficient and adaptable loading solutions. Beyond the specific design, this generalized modeling and optimization framework extends to a broader class of manipulators, offering a scalable approach to the development of robotic systems that require efficiency, flexibility, and robust performance.</description>

      <title>LIPM-Guided Reinforcement Learning for Stable and Perceptive Locomotion in Bipedal Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving stable and robust perceptive locomotion for bipedal robots in unstructured outdoor environments remains a critical challenge due to complex terrain geometry and susceptibility to external disturbances. In this work, we propose a novel reward design inspired by the Linear Inverted Pendulum Model (LIPM) to enable perceptive and stable locomotion in the wild. The LIPM provides theoretical guidance for dynamic balance by regulating the center of mass (CoM) height and the torso orientation. These are key factors for terrain-aware locomotion, as they help ensure a stable viewpoint for the robot's camera. Building on this insight, we design a reward function that promotes balance and dynamic stability while encouraging accurate CoM trajectory tracking. To adaptively trade off between velocity tracking and stability, we leverage the Reward Fusion Module (RFM) approach that prioritizes stability when needed. A double-critic architecture is adopted to separately evaluate stability and locomotion objectives, improving training efficiency and robustness. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on a bipedal robot in both simulation and real-world outdoor environments. The results demonstrate superior terrain adaptability, disturbance rejection, and consistent performance across a wide range of speeds and perceptual conditions.</description>

      <title>AEOS: Active Environment-aware Optimal Scanning Control for UAV LiDAR-Inertial Odometry in Complex Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D perception and localization on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are fundamentally limited by the narrow field of view (FoV) of compact LiDAR sensors and the payload constraints that preclude multi-sensor configurations. Traditional motorized scanning systems with fixed-speed rotations lack scene awareness and task-level adaptability, leading to degraded odometry and mapping performance in complex, occluded environments. Inspired by the active sensing behavior of owls, we propose AEOS (Active Environment-aware Optimal Scanning), a biologically inspired and computationally efficient framework for adaptive LiDAR control in UAV-based LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO). AEOS combines model predictive control (MPC) and reinforcement learning (RL) in a hybrid architecture: an analytical uncertainty model predicts future pose observability for exploitation, while a lightweight neural network learns an implicit cost map from panoramic depth representations to guide exploration. To support scalable training and generalization, we develop a point cloud-based simulation environment with real-world LiDAR maps across diverse scenes, enabling sim-to-real transfer. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world environments demonstrate that AEOS significantly improves odometry accuracy compared to fixed-rate, optimization-only, and fully learned baselines, while maintaining real-time performance under onboard computational constraints.

      <title>Occupancy-aware Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Valet Parking in Uncertain Dynamic Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately reasoning about future parking spot availability and integrated planning is critical for enabling safe and efficient autonomous valet parking in dynamic, uncertain environments. Unlike existing methods that rely solely on instantaneous observations or static assumptions, we present an approach that predicts future parking spot occupancy by explicitly distinguishing between initially vacant and occupied spots, and by leveraging the predicted motion of dynamic agents. We introduce a probabilistic spot occupancy estimator that incorporates partial and noisy observations within a limited Field-of-View (FoV) model and accounts for the evolving uncertainty of unobserved regions. Coupled with this, we design a strategy planner that adaptively balances goal-directed parking maneuvers with exploratory navigation based on information gain, and intelligently incorporates wait-and-go behaviors at promising spots. Through randomized simulations emulating large parking lots, we demonstrate that our framework significantly improves parking efficiency, safety margins, and trajectory smoothness compared to existing approaches.</description>

      <title>RENet: Fault-Tolerant Motion Control for Quadruped Robots via Redundant Estimator Networks under Visual Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-based locomotion in outdoor environments presents significant challenges for quadruped robots. Accurate environmental prediction and effective handling of depth sensor noise during real-world deployment remain difficult, severely restricting the outdoor applications of such algorithms. To address these deployment challenges in vision-based motion control, this letter proposes the Redundant Estimator Network (RENet) framework. The framework employs a dual-estimator architecture that ensures robust motion performance while maintaining deployment stability during onboard vision failures. Through an online estimator adaptation, our method enables seamless transitions between estimation modules when handling visual perception uncertainties. Experimental validation on a real-world robot demonstrates the framework's effectiveness in complex outdoor environments, showing particular advantages in scenarios with degraded visual perception. This framework demonstrates its potential as a practical solution for reliable robotic deployment in challenging field conditions. Project website: https://RENet-Loco.github.io/</description>

      <title>OmniEVA: Embodied Versatile Planner via Task-Adaptive 3D-Grounded and Embodiment-aware Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have opened new opportunities for embodied intelligence, enabling multimodal understanding, reasoning, and interaction, as well as continuous spatial decision-making. Nevertheless, current MLLM-based embodied systems face two critical limitations. First, Geometric Adaptability Gap: models trained solely on 2D inputs or with hard-coded 3D geometry injection suffer from either insufficient spatial information or restricted 2D generalization, leading to poor adaptability across tasks with diverse spatial demands. Second, Embodiment Constraint Gap: prior work often neglects the physical constraints and capacities of real robots, resulting in task plans that are theoretically valid but practically infeasible.To address these gaps, we introduce OmniEVA -- an embodied versatile planner that enables advanced embodied reasoning and task planning through two pivotal innovations: (1) a Task-Adaptive 3D Grounding mechanism, which introduces a gated router to perform explicit selective regulation of 3D fusion based on contextual requirements, enabling context-aware 3D grounding for diverse embodied tasks. (2) an Embodiment-Aware Reasoning framework that jointly incorporates task goals and embodiment constraints into the reasoning loop, resulting in planning decisions that are both goal-directed and executable. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that OmniEVA not only achieves state-of-the-art general embodied reasoning performance, but also exhibits a strong ability across a wide range of downstream scenarios. Evaluations of a suite of proposed embodied benchmarks, including both primitive and composite tasks, confirm its robust and versatile planning capabilities.

      <description>arXiv:2509.09364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With academic and commercial interest for humanoid robots peaking, multiple platforms are being developed. Through a high level of customization, they showcase impressive performance. Most of these systems remain closed-source or have high acquisition and maintenance costs, however. In this work, we present AGILOped - an open-source humanoid robot that closes the gap between high performance and accessibility. Our robot is driven by off-the-shelf backdrivable actuators with high power density and uses standard electronic components. With a height of 110 cm and weighing only 14.5 kg, AGILOped can be operated without a gantry by a single person. Experiments in walking, jumping, impact mitigation and getting-up demonstrate its viability for use in research.</description>

      <title>VLA-Adapter: An Effective Paradigm for Tiny-Scale Vision-Language-Action Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models typically bridge the gap between perceptual and action spaces by pre-training a large-scale Vision-Language Model (VLM) on robotic data. While this approach greatly enhances performance, it also incurs significant training costs. In this paper, we investigate how to effectively bridge vision-language (VL) representations to action (A). We introduce VLA-Adapter, a novel paradigm designed to reduce the reliance of VLA models on large-scale VLMs and extensive pre-training. To this end, we first systematically analyze the effectiveness of various VL conditions and present key findings on which conditions are essential for bridging perception and action spaces. Based on these insights, we propose a lightweight Policy module with Bridge Attention, which autonomously injects the optimal condition into the action space. In this way, our method achieves high performance using only a 0.5B-parameter backbone, without any robotic data pre-training. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world robotic benchmarks demonstrate that VLA-Adapter not only achieves state-of-the-art level performance, but also offers the fast inference speed reported to date. Furthermore, thanks to the proposed advanced bridging paradigm, VLA-Adapter enables the training of a powerful VLA model in just 8 hours on a single consumer-grade GPU, greatly lowering the barrier to deploying the VLA model.

      <title>A Hybrid Hinge-Beam Continuum Robot with Passive Safety Capping for Real-Time Fatigue Awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cable-driven continuum robots offer high flexibility and lightweight design, making them well-suited for tasks in constrained and unstructured environments. However, prolonged use can induce mechanical fatigue from plastic deformation and material degradation, compromising performance and risking structural failure. In the state of the art, fatigue estimation of continuum robots remains underexplored, limiting long-term operation. To address this, we propose a fatigue-aware continuum robot with three key innovations: (1) a Hybrid Hinge-Beam structure where TwistBeam and BendBeam decouple torsion and bending: passive revolute joints in the BendBeam mitigate stress concentration, while TwistBeam's limited torsional deformation reduces BendBeam stress magnitude, enhancing durability; (2) a Passive Stopper that safely constrains motion via mechanical constraints and employs motor torque sensing to detect corresponding limit torque, ensuring safety and enabling data collection; and (3) a real-time fatigue-awareness method that estimates stiffness from motor torque at the limit pose, enabling online fatigue estimation without additional sensors. Experiments show that the proposed design reduces fatigue accumulation by about 49% compared with a conventional design, while passive mechanical limiting combined with motor-side sensing allows accurate estimation of structural fatigue and damage. These results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed architecture for safe and reliable long-term operation.</description>

      <title>BagIt! An Adaptive Dual-Arm Manipulation of Fabric Bags for Object Bagging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bagging tasks, commonly found in industrial scenarios, are challenging considering deformable bags' complicated and unpredictable nature. This paper presents an automated bagging system from the proposed adaptive Structure-of-Interest (SOI) manipulation strategy for dual robot arms. The system dynamically adjusts its actions based on real-time visual feedback, removing the need for pre-existing knowledge of bag properties. Our framework incorporates Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) for estimating SOI states, optimization techniques for SOI generation, motion planning via Constrained Bidirectional Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (CBiRRT), and dual-arm coordination using Model Predictive Control (MPC). Extensive experiments validate the capability of our system to perform precise and robust bagging across various objects, showcasing its adaptability. This work offers a new solution for robotic deformable object manipulation (DOM), particularly in automated bagging tasks.

      <title>SMapper: A Multi-Modal Data Acquisition Platform for SLAM Benchmarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancing research in fields like Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and autonomous navigation critically depends on reliable and reproducible multimodal datasets. While several influential datasets have driven progress in these domains, they often suffer from limitations in sensing modalities, environmental diversity, and the reproducibility of the underlying hardware setups. To address these challenges, this paper introduces SMapper, a novel open-hardware, multi-sensor platform designed explicitly for, though not limited to, SLAM research. The device integrates synchronized LiDAR, multi-camera, and inertial sensing, supported by a robust calibration and synchronization pipeline that ensures precise spatio-temporal alignment across modalities. Its open and replicable design allows researchers to extend its capabilities and reproduce experiments across both handheld and robot-mounted scenarios. To demonstrate its practicality, we additionally release SMapper-light, a publicly available SLAM dataset containing representative indoor and outdoor sequences. The dataset includes tightly synchronized multimodal data and ground-truth trajectories derived from offline LiDAR-based SLAM with sub-centimeter accuracy, alongside dense 3D reconstructions. Furthermore, the paper contains benchmarking results on state-of-the-art LiDAR and visual SLAM frameworks using the SMapper-light dataset. By combining open-hardware design, reproducible data collection, and comprehensive benchmarking, SMapper establishes a robust foundation for advancing SLAM algorithm development, evaluation, and reproducibility.</description>

      <title>A Neuromorphic Incipient Slip Detection System using Papillae Morphology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting incipient slip enables early intervention to prevent object slippage and enhance robotic manipulation safety. However, deploying such systems on edge platforms remains challenging, particularly due to energy constraints. This work presents a neuromorphic tactile sensing system based on the NeuroTac sensor with an extruding papillae-based skin and a spiking convolutional neural network (SCNN) for slip-state classification. The SCNN model achieves 94.33% classification accuracy across three classes (no slip, incipient slip, and gross slip) in slip conditions induced by sensor motion. Under the dynamic gravity-induced slip validation conditions, after temporal smoothing of the SCNN's final-layer spike counts, the system detects incipient slip at least 360 ms prior to gross slip across all trials, consistently identifying incipient slip before gross slip occurs. These results demonstrate that this neuromorphic system has stable and responsive incipient slip detection capability.</description>

      <title>ObjectReact: Learning Object-Relative Control for Visual Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual navigation using only a single camera and a topological map has recently become an appealing alternative to methods that require additional sensors and 3D maps. This is typically achieved through an "image-relative" approach to estimating control from a given pair of current observation and subgoal image. However, image-level representations of the world have limitations because images are strictly tied to the agent's pose and embodiment. In contrast, objects, being a property of the map, offer an embodiment- and trajectory-invariant world representation. In this work, we present a new paradigm of learning "object-relative" control that exhibits several desirable characteristics: a) new routes can be traversed without strictly requiring to imitate prior experience, b) the control prediction problem can be decoupled from solving the image matching problem, and c) high invariance can be achieved in cross-embodiment deployment for variations across both training-testing and mapping-execution settings. We propose a topometric map representation in the form of a "relative" 3D scene graph, which is used to obtain more informative object-level global path planning costs. We train a local controller, dubbed "ObjectReact", conditioned directly on a high-level "WayObject Costmap" representation that eliminates the need for an explicit RGB input. We demonstrate the advantages of learning object-relative control over its image-relative counterpart across sensor height variations and multiple navigation tasks that challenge the underlying spatial understanding capability, e.g., navigating a map trajectory in the reverse direction. We further show that our sim-only policy is able to generalize well to real-world indoor environments.

      <title>MOFU: Development of a MOrphing Fluffy Unit with Expansion and Contraction Capabilities and Evaluation of the Animacy of Its Movements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robots for therapy and social interaction are often intended to evoke "animacy" in humans. While many robots imitate appearance and joint movements, little attention has been given to whole-body expansion-contraction, volume-changing movements observed in living organisms, and their effect on animacy perception. We developed a mobile robot called "MOFU (Morphing Fluffy Unit)," capable of whole-body expansion-contraction with a single motor and covered with a fluffy exterior. MOFU employs a "Jitterbug" structure, a geometric transformation mechanism that enables smooth volume change in diameter from 210 to 280 mm using one actuator. It is also equipped with a differential two-wheel drive mechanism for locomotion. To evaluate the effect of expansion-contraction movements, we conducted an online survey using videos of MOFU's behavior. Participants rated impressions with the Godspeed Questionnaire Series. First, we compared videos of MOFU in a stationary state with and without expansion-contraction and turning, finding that expansion-contraction significantly increased perceived animacy. Second, we hypothesized that presenting two MOFUs would increase animacy compared with a single robot; however, this was not supported, as no significant difference emerged. Exploratory analyses further compared four dual-robot motion conditions. Third, when expansion-contraction was combined with locomotion, animacy ratings were higher than locomotion alone. These results suggest that volume-changing movements such as expansion and contraction enhance perceived animacy in robots and should be considered an important design element in future robot development aimed at shaping human impressions.</description>

      <title>Dexplore: Scalable Neural Control for Dexterous Manipulation from Reference-Scoped Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hand-object motion-capture (MoCap) repositories offer large-scale, contact-rich demonstrations and hold promise for scaling dexterous robotic manipulation. Yet demonstration inaccuracies and embodiment gaps between human and robot hands limit the straightforward use of these data. Existing methods adopt a three-stage workflow, including retargeting, tracking, and residual correction, which often leaves demonstrations underused and compound errors across stages. We introduce Dexplore, a unified single-loop optimization that jointly performs retargeting and tracking to learn robot control policies directly from MoCap at scale. Rather than treating demonstrations as ground truth, we use them as soft guidance. From raw trajectories, we derive adaptive spatial scopes, and train with reinforcement learning to keep the policy in-scope while minimizing control effort and accomplishing the task. This unified formulation preserves demonstration intent, enables robot-specific strategies to emerge, improves robustness to noise, and scales to large demonstration corpora. We distill the scaled tracking policy into a vision-based, skill-conditioned generative controller that encodes diverse manipulation skills in a rich latent representation, supporting generalization across objects and real-world deployment. Taken together, these contributions position Dexplore as a principled bridge that transforms imperfect demonstrations into effective training signals for dexterous manipulation.</description>

      <title>SimpleVLA-RL: Scaling VLA Training via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for robotic manipulation. Despite substantial progress enabled by large-scale pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), these models face two fundamental challenges: (i) the scarcity and high cost of large-scale human-operated robotic trajectories required for SFT scaling, and (ii) limited generalization to tasks involving distribution shift. Recent breakthroughs in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) can dramatically enhance step-by-step reasoning capabilities, raising a natural question: Can RL similarly improve the long-horizon step-by-step action planning of VLA? In this work, we introduce SimpleVLA-RL, an efficient RL framework tailored for VLA models. Building upon veRL, we introduce VLA-specific trajectory sampling, scalable parallelization, multi-environment rendering, and optimized loss computation. When applied to OpenVLA-OFT, SimpleVLA-RL achieves SoTA performance on LIBERO and even outperforms $\pi_0$ on RoboTwin 1.0\&amp;2.0 with the exploration-enhancing strategies we introduce. SimpleVLA-RL not only reduces dependence on large-scale data and enables robust generalization, but also remarkably surpasses SFT in real-world tasks. Moreover, we identify a novel phenomenon ``pushcut'' during RL training, wherein the policy discovers previously unseen patterns beyond those seen in the previous training process.

      <title>ProgD: Progressive Multi-scale Decoding with Dynamic Graphs for Joint Multi-agent Motion Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate motion prediction of surrounding agents is crucial for the safe planning of autonomous vehicles. Recent advancements have extended prediction techniques from individual agents to joint predictions of multiple interacting agents, with various strategies to address complex interactions within future motions of agents. However, these methods overlook the evolving nature of these interactions. To address this limitation, we propose a novel progressive multi-scale decoding strategy, termed ProgD, with the help of dynamic heterogeneous graph-based scenario modeling. In particular, to explicitly and comprehensively capture the evolving social interactions in future scenarios, given their inherent uncertainty, we design a progressive modeling of scenarios with dynamic heterogeneous graphs. With the unfolding of such dynamic heterogeneous graphs, a factorized architecture is designed to process the spatio-temporal dependencies within future scenarios and progressively eliminate uncertainty in future motions of multiple agents. Furthermore, a multi-scale decoding procedure is incorporated to improve on the future scenario modeling and consistent prediction of agents' future motion. The proposed ProgD achieves state-of-the-art performance on the INTERACTION multi-agent prediction benchmark, ranking $1^{st}$, and the Argoverse 2 multi-world forecasting benchmark.</description>

      <title>Global Optimization of Stochastic Black-Box Functions with Arbitrary Noise Distributions using Wilson Score Kernel Density Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many optimization problems in robotics involve the optimization of time-expensive black-box functions, such as those involving complex simulations or evaluation of real-world experiments. Furthermore, these functions are often stochastic as repeated experiments are subject to unmeasurable disturbances. Bayesian optimization can be used to optimize such methods in an efficient manner by deploying a probabilistic function estimator to estimate with a given confidence so that regions of the search space can be pruned away. Consequently, the success of the Bayesian optimization depends on the function estimator's ability to provide informative confidence bounds. Existing function estimators require many function evaluations to infer the underlying confidence or depend on modeling of the disturbances. In this paper, it is shown that the confidence bounds provided by the Wilson Score Kernel Density Estimator (WS-KDE) are applicable as excellent bounds to any stochastic function with an output confined to the closed interval [0;1] regardless of the distribution of the output. This finding opens up the use of WS-KDE for stable global optimization on a wider range of cost functions. The properties of WS-KDE in the context of Bayesian optimization are demonstrated in simulation and applied to the problem of automated trap design for vibrational part feeders.</description>

      <title>Model-Agnostic Open-Set Air-to-Air Visual Object Detection for Reliable UAV Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open-set detection is crucial for robust UAV autonomy in air-to-air object detection under real-world conditions. Traditional closed-set detectors degrade significantly under domain shifts and flight data corruption, posing risks to safety-critical applications. We propose a novel, model-agnostic open-set detection framework designed specifically for embedding-based detectors. The method explicitly handles unknown object rejection while maintaining robustness against corrupted flight data. It estimates semantic uncertainty via entropy modeling in the embedding space and incorporates spectral normalization and temperature scaling to enhance open-set discrimination. We validate our approach on the challenging AOT aerial benchmark and through extensive real-world flight tests. Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate consistent improvements over baseline methods, achieving up to a 10\% relative AUROC gain compared to standard YOLO-based detectors. Additionally, we show that background rejection further strengthens robustness without compromising detection accuracy, making our solution particularly well-suited for reliable UAV perception in dynamic air-to-air environments.</description>

      <title>Classification of Driver Behaviour Using External Observation Techniques for Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Road traffic accidents remain a significant global concern, with human error, particularly distracted and impaired driving, among the leading causes. This study introduces a novel driver behavior classification system that uses external observation techniques to detect indicators of distraction and impairment. The proposed framework employs advanced computer vision methodologies, including real-time object tracking, lateral displacement analysis, and lane position monitoring. The system identifies unsafe driving behaviors such as excessive lateral movement and erratic trajectory patterns by implementing the YOLO object detection model and custom lane estimation algorithms. Unlike systems reliant on inter-vehicular communication, this vision-based approach enables behavioral analysis of non-connected vehicles. Experimental evaluations on diverse video datasets demonstrate the framework's reliability and adaptability across varying road and environmental conditions.</description>

      <title>Curriculum-Based Multi-Tier Semantic Exploration via Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Navigating and understanding complex and unknown environments autonomously demands more than just basic perception and movement from embodied agents. Truly effective exploration requires agents to possess higher-level cognitive abilities, the ability to reason about their surroundings, and make more informed decisions regarding exploration strategies. However, traditional RL approaches struggle to balance efficient exploration and semantic understanding due to limited cognitive capabilities embedded in the small policies for the agents, leading often to human drivers when dealing with semantic exploration. In this paper, we address this challenge by presenting a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) architecture that is specifically designed for resource efficient semantic exploration. A key methodological contribution is the integration of a Vision-Language Model (VLM) common-sense through a layered reward function. The VLM query is modeled as a dedicated action, allowing the agent to strategically query the VLM only when deemed necessary for gaining external guidance, thereby conserving resources. This mechanism is combined with a curriculum learning strategy designed to guide learning at different levels of complexity to ensure robust and stable learning. Our experimental evaluation results convincingly demonstrate that our agent achieves significantly enhanced object discovery rates and develops a learned capability to effectively navigate towards semantically rich regions. Furthermore, it also shows a strategic mastery of when to prompt for external environmental information. By demonstrating a practical and scalable method for embedding common-sense semantic reasoning with autonomous agents, this research provides a novel approach to pursuing a fully intelligent and self-guided exploration in robotics.</description>

      <title>Visual Grounding from Event Cameras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Event cameras capture changes in brightness with microsecond precision and remain reliable under motion blur and challenging illumination, offering clear advantages for modeling highly dynamic scenes. Yet, their integration with natural language understanding has received little attention, leaving a gap in multimodal perception. To address this, we introduce Talk2Event, the first large-scale benchmark for language-driven object grounding using event data. Built on real-world driving scenarios, Talk2Event comprises 5,567 scenes, 13,458 annotated objects, and more than 30,000 carefully validated referring expressions. Each expression is enriched with four structured attributes -- appearance, status, relation to the viewer, and relation to surrounding objects -- that explicitly capture spatial, temporal, and relational cues. This attribute-centric design supports interpretable and compositional grounding, enabling analysis that moves beyond simple object recognition to contextual reasoning in dynamic environments. We envision Talk2Event as a foundation for advancing multimodal and temporally-aware perception, with applications spanning robotics, human-AI interaction, and so on.</description>

      <title>Single-Stage Optimization of Open-loop Stable Limit Cycles with Smooth, Symbolic Derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10647v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Open-loop stable limit cycles are foundational to legged robotics, providing inherent self-stabilization that minimizes the need for computationally intensive feedback-based gait correction. While previous methods have primarily targeted specific robotic models, this paper introduces a general framework for rapidly generating limit cycles across various dynamical systems, with the flexibility to impose arbitrarily tight stability bounds. We formulate the problem as a single-stage constrained optimization problem and use Direct Collocation to transcribe it into a nonlinear program with closed-form expressions for constraints, objectives, and their gradients.
  Our method supports multiple stability formulations. In particular, we tested two popular formulations for limit cycle stability in robotics: (1) based on the spectral radius of a discrete return map, and (2) based on the spectral radius of the monodromy matrix, and tested five different constraint-satisfaction formulations of the eigenvalue problem to bound the spectral radius. We compare the performance and solution quality of the various formulations on a robotic swing-leg model, highlighting the Schur decomposition of the monodromy matrix as a method with broader applicability due to weaker assumptions and stronger numerical convergence properties.
  As a case study, we apply our method on a hopping robot model, generating open-loop stable gaits in under 2 seconds on an Intel Core i7-6700K, while simultaneously minimizing energy consumption even under tight stability constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11405v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stability guarantees are crucial when ensuring that a fully autonomous robot does not take undesirable or potentially harmful actions. We recently proposed the Neural Contractive Dynamical Systems (NCDS), which is a neural network architecture that guarantees contractive stability. With this, learning-from-demonstrations approaches can trivially provide stability guarantees. However, our early work left several unanswered questions, which we here address. Beyond providing an in-depth explanation of NCDS, this paper extends the framework with more careful regularization, a conditional variant of the framework for handling multiple tasks, and an uncertainty-driven approach to latent obstacle avoidance. Experiments verify that the developed system has the flexibility of ordinary neural networks while providing the stability guarantees needed for autonomous robotics.</description>

Abstract: We present a neural radiance field (NeRF) based large-scale reconstruction system that fuses lidar and vision data to generate high-quality reconstructions that are geometrically accurate and capture photorealistic texture. Our system adopts the state-of-the-art NeRF representation to incorporate lidar. Adding lidar data adds strong geometric constraints on the depth and surface normals, which is particularly useful when modelling uniform texture surfaces which contain ambiguous visual reconstruction cues. A key contribution of this work is a novel method to quantify the epistemic uncertainty of the lidar-visual NeRF reconstruction by estimating the spatial variance of each point location in the radiance field given the sensor observations from the cameras and lidar. This provides a principled approach to evaluate the contribution of each sensor modality to the final reconstruction. In this way, reconstructions that are uncertain (due to e.g. uniform visual texture, limited observation viewpoints, or little lidar coverage) can be identified and removed. Our system is integrated with a real-time lidar SLAM system which is used to bootstrap a Structure-from-Motion (SfM) reconstruction procedure. It also helps to properly constrain the overall metric scale which is essential for the lidar depth loss. The refined SLAM trajectory can then be divided into submaps using Spectral Clustering to group sets of co-visible images together. This submapping approach is more suitable for visual reconstruction than distance-based partitioning. Our uncertainty estimation is particularly effective when merging submaps as their boundaries often contain artefacts due to limited observations. We demonstrate the reconstruction system using a multi-camera, lidar sensor suite in experiments involving both robot-mounted and handheld scanning. Our test datasets cover a total area of more than 20,000 square metres.</description>

      <title>V-HOP: Visuo-Haptic 6D Object Pose Tracking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17434v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humans naturally integrate vision and haptics for robust object perception during manipulation. The loss of either modality significantly degrades performance. Inspired by this multisensory integration, prior object pose estimation research has attempted to combine visual and haptic/tactile feedback. Although these works demonstrate improvements in controlled environments or synthetic datasets, they often underperform vision-only approaches in real-world settings due to poor generalization across diverse grippers, sensor layouts, or sim-to-real environments. Furthermore, they typically estimate the object pose for each frame independently, resulting in less coherent tracking over sequences in real-world deployments. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel unified haptic representation that effectively handles multiple gripper embodiments. Building on this representation, we introduce a new visuo-haptic transformer-based object pose tracker that seamlessly integrates visual and haptic input. We validate our framework in our dataset and the Feelsight dataset, demonstrating significant performance improvement on challenging sequences. Notably, our method achieves superior generalization and robustness across novel embodiments, objects, and sensor types (both taxel-based and vision-based tactile sensors). In real-world experiments, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art visual trackers by a large margin. We further show that we can achieve precise manipulation tasks by incorporating our real-time object tracking result into motion plans, underscoring the advantages of visuo-haptic perception.

Abstract: In many robotics applications, multiple robots are working in a shared workspace to complete a set of tasks as fast as possible. Such settings can be treated as multi-modal multi-robot multi-goal path planning problems, where each robot has to reach a set of goals. Existing approaches to this type of problem solve this using prioritization or assume synchronous task completion, and are thus neither optimal nor complete. We formalize this problem as a single centralized path planning problem and present planners that are probabilistically complete and asymptotically optimal. The planners plan in the composite space of all robots and are modifications of standard sampling-based planners with the required changes to work in our multi-modal, multi-robot, multi-goal setting. We validate the planners on a diverse range of problems including scenarios with various robots, planning horizons, and collaborative tasks such as handovers, and compare the planners against a suboptimal prioritized planner.
  Videos and code for the planners and the benchmark is available at https://vhartmann.com/mrmg-planning/.</description>

Abstract: Datasets for object detection often do not account for enough variety of glasses, due to their transparent and reflective properties. Specifically, open-vocabulary object detectors, widely used in embodied robotic agents, fail to distinguish subclasses of glasses. This scientific gap poses an issue for robotic applications that suffer from accumulating errors between detection, planning, and action execution. This paper introduces a novel method for acquiring real-world data from RGB-D sensors that minimizes human effort. We propose an auto-labeling pipeline that generates labels for all the acquired frames based on the depth measurements. We provide a novel real-world glass object dataset GlassNICOLDataset that was collected on the Neuro-Inspired COLlaborator (NICOL), a humanoid robot platform. The dataset consists of 7850 images recorded from five different cameras. We show that our trained baseline model outperforms state-of-the-art open-vocabulary approaches. In addition, we deploy our baseline model in an embodied agent approach to the NICOL platform, on which it achieves a success rate of 81% in a human-robot bartending scenario.</description>

      <title>RESPLE: Recursive Spline Estimation for LiDAR-Based Odometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11580v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel recursive Bayesian estimation framework using B-splines for continuous-time 6-DoF dynamic motion estimation. The state vector consists of a recurrent set of position control points and orientation control point increments, enabling efficient estimation via a modified iterated extended Kalman filter without involving error-state formulations. The resulting recursive spline estimator (RESPLE) is further leveraged to develop a versatile suite of direct LiDAR-based odometry solutions, supporting the integration of one or multiple LiDARs and an IMU. We conduct extensive real-world evaluations using public datasets and our own experiments, covering diverse sensor setups, platforms, and environments. Compared to existing systems, RESPLE achieves comparable or superior estimation accuracy and robustness, while attaining real-time efficiency. Our results and analysis demonstrate RESPLE's strength in handling highly dynamic motions and complex scenes within a lightweight and flexible design, showing strong potential as a universal framework for multi-sensor motion estimation. We release the source code and experimental datasets at https://github.com/ASIG-X/RESPLE .</description>

      <title>Imagine, Verify, Execute: Memory-guided Agentic Exploration with Vision-Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07815v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exploration is essential for general-purpose robotic learning, especially in open-ended environments where dense rewards, explicit goals, or task-specific supervision are scarce. Vision-language models (VLMs), with their semantic reasoning over objects, spatial relations, and potential outcomes, present a compelling foundation for generating high-level exploratory behaviors. However, their outputs are often ungrounded, making it difficult to determine whether imagined transitions are physically feasible or informative. To bridge the gap between imagination and execution, we present IVE (Imagine, Verify, Execute), an agentic exploration framework inspired by human curiosity. Human exploration is often driven by the desire to discover novel scene configurations and to deepen understanding of the environment. Similarly, IVE leverages VLMs to abstract RGB-D observations into semantic scene graphs, imagine novel scenes, predict their physical plausibility, and generate executable skill sequences through action tools. We evaluate IVE in both simulated and real-world tabletop environments. The results show that IVE enables more diverse and meaningful exploration than RL baselines, as evidenced by a 4.1 to 7.8x increase in the entropy of visited states. Moreover, the collected experience supports downstream learning, producing policies that closely match or exceed the performance of those trained on human-collected demonstrations.</description>

Abstract: Robotic odour source localization (OSL) is a critical capability for autonomous systems operating in complex environments. However, current OSL methods often suffer from ambiguities, particularly when robots misattribute odours to incorrect objects due to limitations in olfactory datasets and sensor resolutions. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel machine learning method using diffusion-based molecular generation to enhance odour localization accuracy that can be used by itself or with automated olfactory dataset construction pipelines. This generative process of our diffusion model expands the chemical space beyond the limitations of both current olfactory datasets and training methods, enabling the identification of potential odourant molecules not previously documented. The generated molecules can then be more accurately validated using advanced olfactory sensors, enabling them to detect more compounds and inform better hardware design. By integrating visual analysis, language processing, and molecular generation, our framework enhances the ability of olfaction-vision models on robots to accurately associate odours with their correct sources, thereby improving navigation and decision-making through better sensor selection for a target compound in critical applications such as explosives detection, narcotics screening, and search and rescue. Our methodology represents a foundational advancement in the field of artificial olfaction, offering a scalable solution to challenges posed by limited olfactory data and sensor ambiguities.

      <title>Learning-Based Modeling of a Magnetically Steerable Soft Suction Device for Endoscopic Endonasal Interventions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This letter introduces a novel learning-based modeling framework for a magnetically steerable soft suction device designed for endoscopic endonasal brain tumor resection. The device is miniaturized (4 mm outer diameter, 2 mm inner diameter, 40 mm length), 3D printed using biocompatible SIL 30 material, and integrates embedded Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors for real-time shape feedback. Shape reconstruction is represented using four Bezier control points, enabling a compact and smooth model of the device's deformation. A data-driven model was trained on 5,097 experimental samples covering a range of magnetic field magnitudes (0-14 mT), actuation frequencies (0.2-1.0 Hz), and vertical tip distances (90-100 mm), using both Neural Network (NN) and Random Forest (RF) architectures. The RF model outperformed the NN across all metrics, achieving a mean root mean square error of 0.087 mm in control point prediction and a mean shape reconstruction error of 0.064 mm. Feature importance analysis further revealed that magnetic field components predominantly influence distal control points, while frequency and distance affect the base configuration. This learning-based approach effectively models the complex nonlinear behavior of hyperelastic soft robots under magnetic actuation without relying on simplified physical assumptions. By enabling sub-millimeter shape prediction accuracy and real-time inference, this work represents an advancement toward the intelligent control of magnetically actuated soft robotic tools in minimally invasive neurosurgery.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visual-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a popular paradigm for learning robot manipulation policies that can follow language instructions and generalize to novel scenarios. Recent work has begun to explore the incorporation of latent actions, an abstract representation of visual change between two frames, into VLA pre-training. In this paper, we introduce villa-X, a novel Visual-Language-Latent-Action (ViLLA) framework that advances latent action modeling for learning generalizable robot manipulation policies. Our approach improves both how latent actions are learned and how they are incorporated into VLA pre-training. Together, these contributions enable villa-X to achieve superior performance across simulated environments including SIMPLER and LIBERO, as well as on two real-world robot setups including gripper and dexterous hand manipulation. We believe the ViLLA paradigm holds significant promise, and that our villa-X provides a strong foundation for future research.</description>

      <title>Multi-Robot Navigation in Social Mini-Games: Definitions, Taxonomy, and Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13459v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ``Last Mile Challenge'' has long been considered an important, yet unsolved, challenge for autonomous vehicles, public service robots, and delivery robots. A central issue in this challenge is the ability of robots to navigate constrained and cluttered environments that have high agency (e.g., doorways, hallways, corridor intersections), often while competing for space with other robots and humans. We refer to these environments as ``Social Mini-Games'' (SMGs). Traditional navigation approaches designed for MRN do not perform well in SMGs, which has led to focused research on dedicated SMG solvers. However, publications on SMG navigation research make different assumptions (on centralized versus decentralized, observability, communication, cooperation, etc.), and have different objective functions (safety versus liveness). These assumptions and objectives are sometimes implicitly assumed or described informally. This makes it difficult to establish appropriate baselines for comparison in research papers, as well as making it difficult for practitioners to find the papers relevant to their concrete application. Such ad-hoc representation of the field also presents a barrier to new researchers wanting to start research in this area. SMG navigation research requires its own taxonomy, definitions, and evaluation protocols to guide effective research moving forward. This survey is the first to catalog SMG solvers using a well-defined and unified taxonomy and to classify existing methods accordingly. It also discusses the essential properties of SMG solvers, defines what SMGs are and how they appear in practice, outlines how to evaluate SMG solvers, and highlights the differences between SMG solvers and general navigation systems. The survey concludes with an overview of future directions and open challenges in the field. Our project is open-sourced at https://socialminigames.github.io/.</description>

      <title>No Need to Look! Locating and Grasping Objects by a Robot Arm Covered with Sensitive Skin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Locating and grasping of objects by robots is typically performed using visual sensors. Haptic feedback from contacts with the environment is only secondary if present at all. In this work, we explored an extreme case of searching for and grasping objects in complete absence of visual input, relying on haptic feedback only. The main novelty lies in the use of contacts over the complete surface of a robot manipulator covered with sensitive skin. The search is divided into two phases: (1) coarse workspace exploration with the complete robot surface, followed by (2) precise localization using the end-effector equipped with a force/torque sensor. We systematically evaluated this method in simulation and on the real robot, demonstrating that diverse objects can be located, grasped, and put in a basket. The overall success rate on the real robot for one object was 85.7% with failures mainly while grasping specific objects. The method using whole-body contacts is six times faster compared to a baseline that uses haptic feedback only on the end-effector. We also show locating and grasping multiple objects on the table. This method is not restricted to our specific setup and can be deployed on any platform with the ability of sensing contacts over the entire body surface. This work holds promise for diverse applications in areas with challenging visual perception (due to lighting, dust, smoke, occlusion) such as in agriculture when fruits or vegetables need to be located inside foliage and picked.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In robotic systems, the performance of reinforcement learning depends on the rationality of predefined reward functions. However, manually designed reward functions often lead to policy failures due to inaccuracies. Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) addresses this problem by inferring implicit reward functions from expert demonstrations. Nevertheless, existing methods rely heavily on large amounts of expert demonstrations to accurately recover the reward function. The high cost of collecting expert demonstrations in robotic applications, particularly in multi-robot systems, severely hinders the practical deployment of IRL. Consequently, improving sample efficiency has emerged as a critical challenge in multi-agent inverse reinforcement learning (MIRL). Inspired by the symmetry inherent in multi-agent systems, this work theoretically demonstrates that leveraging symmetry enables the recovery of more accurate reward functions. Building upon this insight, we propose a universal framework that integrates symmetry into existing multi-agent adversarial IRL algorithms, thereby significantly enhancing sample efficiency. Experimental results from multiple challenging tasks have demonstrated the effectiveness of this framework. Further validation in physical multi-robot systems has shown the practicality of our method.</description>

      <title>Joint Model-based Model-free Diffusion for Planning with Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model-free diffusion planners have shown great promise for robot motion planning, but practical robotic systems often require combining them with model-based optimization modules to enforce constraints, such as safety. Naively integrating these modules presents compatibility challenges when diffusion's multi-modal outputs behave adversarially to optimization-based modules. To address this, we introduce Joint Model-based Model-free Diffusion (JM2D), a novel generative modeling framework. JM2D formulates module integration as a joint sampling problem to maximize compatibility via an interaction potential, without additional training. Using importance sampling, JM2D guides modules outputs based only on evaluations of the interaction potential, thus handling non-differentiable objectives commonly arising from non-convex optimization modules. We evaluate JM2D via application to aligning diffusion planners with safety modules on offline RL and robot manipulation. JM2D significantly improves task performance compared to conventional safety filters without sacrificing safety. Further, we show that conditional generation is a special case of JM2D and elucidate key design choices by comparing with SOTA gradient-based and projection-based diffusion planners.

      <title>The Oxford Spires Dataset: Benchmarking Large-Scale LiDAR-Visual Localisation, Reconstruction and Radiance Field Methods</title>

Abstract: This paper introduces a large-scale multi-modal dataset captured in and around well-known landmarks in Oxford using a custom-built multi-sensor perception unit as well as a millimetre-accurate map from a Terrestrial LiDAR Scanner (TLS). The perception unit includes three synchronised global shutter colour cameras, an automotive 3D LiDAR scanner, and an inertial sensor - all precisely calibrated. We also establish benchmarks for tasks involving localisation, reconstruction, and novel-view synthesis, which enable the evaluation of Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) methods, Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Multi-view Stereo (MVS) methods as well as radiance field methods such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting. To evaluate 3D reconstruction the TLS 3D models are used as ground truth. Localisation ground truth is computed by registering the mobile LiDAR scans to the TLS 3D models. Radiance field methods are evaluated not only with poses sampled from the input trajectory, but also from viewpoints that are from trajectories which are distant from the training poses. Our evaluation demonstrates a key limitation of state-of-the-art radiance field methods: we show that they tend to overfit to the training poses/images and do not generalise well to out-of-sequence poses. They also underperform in 3D reconstruction compared to MVS systems using the same visual inputs. Our dataset and benchmarks are intended to facilitate better integration of radiance field methods and SLAM systems. The raw and processed data, along with software for parsing and evaluation, can be accessed at https://dynamic.robots.ox.ac.uk/datasets/oxford-spires/.</description>

      <title>LLMs for sensory-motor control: Combining in-context and iterative learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04867v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a method that enables large language models (LLMs) to control embodied agents by directly mapping continuous observation vectors to continuous action vectors. At the outset, the LLMs generate a control strategy based on a textual description of the agent, its environment, and the intended goal. This strategy is then iteratively refined through a learning process in which the LLMs are repeatedly prompted to improve the current strategy, using performance feedback and sensory-motor data collected during its evaluation. The method is validated on classic control tasks from the Gymnasium library and the inverted pendulum task from the MuJoCo library. The approach proves effective with relatively compact models such as Gpt-oss:120b and Qwen2.5:72b. In most cases, it successfully identifies optimal or near-optimal solutions by integrating symbolic knowledge derived through reasoning with sub-symbolic sensory-motor data gathered as the agent interacts with its environment.</description>

      <title>GEMINUS: Dual-aware Global and Scene-Adaptive Mixture-of-Experts for End-to-End Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14456v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving requires adaptive and robust handling of complex and diverse traffic environments. However, prevalent single-mode planning methods attempt to learn an overall policy while struggling to acquire diversified driving skills to handle diverse scenarios. Therefore, this paper proposes GEMINUS, a Mixture-of-Experts end-to-end autonomous driving framework featuring a Global Expert and a Scene-Adaptive Experts Group, equipped with a Dual-aware Router. Specifically, the Global Expert is trained on the overall dataset, possessing robust performance. The Scene-Adaptive Experts are trained on corresponding scene subsets, achieving adaptive performance. The Dual-aware Router simultaneously considers scenario-level features and routing uncertainty to dynamically activate expert modules. Through the effective coupling of the Global Expert and the Scene-Adaptive Experts Group via the Dual-aware Router, GEMINUS achieves both adaptability and robustness across diverse scenarios. GEMINUS outperforms existing methods in the Bench2Drive closed-loop benchmark and achieves state-of-the-art performance in Driving Score and Success Rate, even with only monocular vision input. The code is available at https://github.com/newbrains1/GEMINUS.</description>

      <title>Beyond Pairwise Comparisons: Unveiling Structural Landscape of Mobile Robot Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19805v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the computational power of mobile robot systems is a fundamental challenge in distributed computing. While prior work has focused on pairwise separations between models, we explore how robot capabilities, light observability, and scheduler synchrony interact in more complex ways.
  We first show that the Exponential Times Expansion (ETE) problem is solvable only in the strongest model -- fully-synchronous robots with full mutual lights ($\mathcal{LUMT}^F$). We then introduce the Hexagonal Edge Traversal (HET) and TAR(d)* problems to demonstrate how internal memory and lights interact with synchrony: under weak synchrony, internal memory alone is insufficient, while full synchrony can substitute for both lights and memory.
  In the asynchronous setting, we classify problems such as LP-MLCv, VEC, and ZCC to show fine-grained separations between $\mathcal{FSTA}$ and $\mathcal{FCOM}$ robots. We also analyze Vertex Traversal Rendezvous (VTR) and Leave Place Convergence (LP-Cv), illustrating the limitations of internal memory in symmetric settings.
  These results extend the known separation map of 14 canonical robot models, revealing structural phenomena only visible through higher-order comparisons. Our work provides new impossibility criteria and deepens the understanding of how observability, memory, and synchrony collectively shape the computational power of mobile robots.</description>

      <title>Robix: A Unified Model for Robot Interaction, Reasoning and Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Robix, a unified model that integrates robot reasoning, task planning, and natural language interaction within a single vision-language architecture. Acting as the high-level cognitive layer in a hierarchical robot system, Robix dynamically generates atomic commands for the low-level controller and verbal responses for human interaction, enabling robots to follow complex instructions, plan long-horizon tasks, and interact naturally with human within an end-to-end framework. Robix further introduces novel capabilities such as proactive dialogue, real-time interruption handling, and context-aware commonsense reasoning during task execution. At its core, Robix leverages chain-of-thought reasoning and adopts a three-stage training strategy: (1) continued pretraining to enhance foundational embodied reasoning abilities including 3D spatial understanding, visual grounding, and task-centric reasoning; (2) supervised finetuning to model human-robot interaction and task planning as a unified reasoning-action sequence; and (3) reinforcement learning to improve reasoning-action consistency and long-horizon task coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Robix outperforms both open-source and commercial baselines (e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Pro) in interactive task execution, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse instruction types (e.g., open-ended, multi-stage, constrained, invalid, and interrupted) and various user-involved tasks such as table bussing, grocery shopping, and dietary filtering.</description>

      <title>LiDAR-BIND-T: Improved and Temporally Consistent Sensor Modality Translation and Fusion for Robotic Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper extends LiDAR-BIND, a modular multi-modal fusion framework that binds heterogeneous sensors (radar, sonar) to a LiDAR-defined latent space, with mechanisms that explicitly enforce temporal consistency. We introduce three contributions: (i) temporal embedding similarity that aligns consecutive latent representations, (ii) a motion-aligned transformation loss that matches displacement between predictions and ground truth LiDAR, and (iii) windowed temporal fusion using a specialised temporal module. We further update the model architecture to better preserve spatial structure. Evaluations on radar/sonar-to-LiDAR translation demonstrate improved temporal and spatial coherence, yielding lower absolute trajectory error and better occupancy map accuracy in Cartographer-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping). We propose different metrics based on the Fr\'echet Video Motion Distance (FVMD) and a correlation-peak distance metric providing practical temporal quality indicators to evaluate SLAM performance. The proposed temporal LiDAR-BIND, or LiDAR-BIND-T, maintains plug-and-play modality fusion while substantially enhancing temporal stability, resulting in improved robustness and performance for downstream SLAM.</description>

      <title>3D and 4D World Modeling: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: World modeling has become a cornerstone in AI research, enabling agents to understand, represent, and predict the dynamic environments they inhabit. While prior work largely emphasizes generative methods for 2D image and video data, they overlook the rapidly growing body of work that leverages native 3D and 4D representations such as RGB-D imagery, occupancy grids, and LiDAR point clouds for large-scale scene modeling. At the same time, the absence of a standardized definition and taxonomy for ``world models'' has led to fragmented and sometimes inconsistent claims in the literature. This survey addresses these gaps by presenting the first comprehensive review explicitly dedicated to 3D and 4D world modeling and generation. We establish precise definitions, introduce a structured taxonomy spanning video-based (VideoGen), occupancy-based (OccGen), and LiDAR-based (LiDARGen) approaches, and systematically summarize datasets and evaluation metrics tailored to 3D/4D settings. We further discuss practical applications, identify open challenges, and highlight promising research directions, aiming to provide a coherent and foundational reference for advancing the field. A systematic summary of existing literature is available at https://github.com/worldbench/survey</description>
