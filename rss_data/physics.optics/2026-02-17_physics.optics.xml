      <title>Non-Hermitian Complex Coupling for Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong coupling in wave-based systems often causes level repulsion, leading to mode splitting and reduced response at the target frequency. This problem is pronounced in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), where strong mutual inductance between a receive coil (RC) and a metamaterial (MM) degrades B1 performance. Here, we introduce a non-Hermitian complex-coupling decoupling strategy based on a dual-resonator model. By engineering a phase delay in the coupling pathway, an imaginary coupling component is created, driving the system from the PT-symmetric to the anti-PT-symmetric phase and enabling eigenmode degeneracy without added dissipation. Implemented through a high-permittivity ceramic layer, this mechanism restores single-mode resonance in the MM - RC system and suppresses frequency splitting. Simulations show a ~14-fold B1 enhancement compared with the strongly repulsive regime. This passive, compact, and hardware-compatible approach offers a general route for coupling control in electromagnetic, acoustic, optical, and quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Optical effects in modified Maxwell electrodynamics under a uniform electromagnetic background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate optical effects in modified Maxwell electrodynamics (ModMax) in the presence of an external electromagnetic field. Considering uniform and constant magnetic and electric backgrounds, the solutions for the refractive indices are revisited. Using these results, we obtain the propagating modes and the phase shift (birefringence) for plane wave solutions in the presence of a pure magnetic background field. Afterwards, we investigate the Goos-H\"anchen effect considering the interface between a simple dielectric and a medium whose electromagnetic response tensors are ruled by the ModMax electrodynamics. Further, based on the general reflection problem, we discuss the complex Kerr rotation with both the electric $(E)$ and magnetic $(B)$ background fields, considering two main cases: i) $B&gt;E$ and ii) $E&gt;B$. Our findings indicate that the $\gamma$ parameter and ratios $(B/E)$ and $(E/B)$ play a central role in describing the Kerr signals (rotation and ellipticity) of systems with optical effects induced by non-linear electromagnetic effects.</description>

      <title>Surface defects in carbon-doped hexagonal boron nitride for negative-contrast direct laser writing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiative defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are active in a broad spectral range from deep ultraviolet to near-infrared wavelengths. Representatives of these defects act as bright single photon sources, spin-1 systems, and multiproperty atomic-scale sensors. They are predominantly investigated in bulk hBN films, where defects are decoupled from surface and interfacial effects. Here, we demonstrate a novel class of surface defects optically active in the green/yellow visible spectral range, which exhibit photophysical properties distinct from their bulk counterparts. High-power resonant laser illumination quenched the emission from the ensemble of such defects, which was attributed to a light-driven structural reconfiguration. The quenched defects were found to recover their emissive capabilities via a thermal cycling process, revealing an activation energy of 24.5 meV for the structural transition. Alternatively, permanent quenching of the defects was triggered by surface chemistry, involving lithiation-enabled attachment of functional groups. These mechanisms were utilized to realize negative-contrast direct laser writing, designing arbitrary geometric emissive patterns on demand in a microscopic configuration. The surface-active radiative centers in hBN appear particularly attractive for exploring environmental sensitivity, surface science, and coupling to photonic structures or electronic devices by taking unique advantage of the two-dimensional characteristics of the host lattice.</description>

      <title>High-Fidelity Spatial Photonic Ising Machines via Precise Wavefront Shaping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ising machines are emerging as a powerful physical alternative to digital processors for solving combinatorial optimization problems. Among them, spatial photonic Ising machines (SPIMs) offer compact, room-temperature hardware with inherently parallel, energy efficient, single-shot optical evaluation of the Ising Hamiltonian. However, scalability has been fundamentally limited by optical aberrations and non-uniform illumination, which corrupt phase-based spin encoding and distort coupling representation, forcing operation to a restricted spatial light modulator (SLM) region. Here we introduce a high-precision full-aperture calibration scheme that overcomes these constraints. By implementing wavefront retrieval and correction with &lt; {\lambda}/40 accuracy, we restore faithful phase encoding across the entire SLM area. Furthermore, we introduce a novel interaction-normalization method, which compensates for amplitude curvature and enables uniform coupling representation. Together, these advances establish a high-fidelity, full-area SPIM architecture that unlocks true scalability and enables larger and more reliable photonic Ising computations.</description>

      <title>Broadband High-Speed Dual-Comb Spectroscopy Enabled by a Dynamic 1550 nm Bidirectional Dissipative Soliton Fiber Laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a high-energy, bidirectional, dissipative soliton mode-locked fiber laser operating in the 1550 nm normal-dispersion regime. By leveraging intracavity dispersion management and a Lyot filtering mechanism, the laser achieves flat-top optical spectra with 10-dB bandwidths exceeding 20 nm in both directions. Single-pulse energies of 2.7 nJ and 1.5 nJ are achieved for the clockwise and counter-clockwise directions, respectively. Furthermore, the all-fiber configuration exhibits superior noise performance and inherent common-mode noise suppression. To facilitate broadband and high-speed dual-comb spectroscopy, we employ a dynamic repetition rate difference control technique via pump power modulation, enabling zero-crossing dynamic scanning. This approach achieves a spectral measurement bandwidth of approximately 16 nm at an acquisition rate of 500 Hz. Compared to static operation, this represents a nearly two-order-of-magnitude improvement in acquisition speed and achieves a fivefold measurement bandwidth beyond the Nyquist aliasing limit. Experimental results demonstrate that the system maintains robust coherence even under dynamic modulation. By implementing a phase-correction algorithm, a mutual coherence time of 0.5 s is successfully achieved, yielding a spectral resolution exceeding 7.2 GHz. This work fills a gap in high-energy dissipative soliton dual-comb sources at 1550 nm and provides an ideal solution for low-cost, high-sensitivity dual-comb spectroscopy requiring both broad bandwidth and high speed.</description>

      <title>Translationally deformed topological charge nanolaser with an ultrasmall mode volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing vortex nanolasers is highly desirable for on-chip multidimensional large-capacity information processing. Topological optical modes hold great promise for achieving coherent emission with diverse functionalities. However, the development of robust and ultracompact topological charge lasing operation remains insufficiently explored. Here, we theoretically propose a translationally deformed topological charge vortex nanocavity with a low mode volume of 0.32 $(\lambda/n)^3$, and experimentally demonstrate the corresponding lasing emission with a low lasing threshold of around 0.74 $\mu$W. The designed topological nanocavity, constructed by translationally deformed photonic crystals, supports an ultracompact optical mode carrying a topological charge characterized by polarization winding. The well-defined topological charge characteristics of the fabricated device are revealed in both near- and far-field polarization-resolved optical profiles. Our work opens a promising avenue for versatile topological photonic integration and gives new potential for exploring intriguing structured light-matter interactions under the topological photonics scenario.</description>

      <title>Prompt-to-prescription: towards generative design of diffraction-limited refractive optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of high-performance optical systems remains a specialized domain gated by the limited availability of expert engineers, creating a bottleneck that stalls innovation despite the growing demand for imaging hardware. While deep learning has improved parameter optimization, it has yet to address the fundamental challenge of conceptualizing valid optical architectures from functional requirements. Here, we present an end-to-end generative framework that couples the semantic reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) with a differentiable ray-tracing engine to democratize the synthesis of diffraction-limited optical prescriptions. By treating optical design as a semantic-to-physical translation task, the system autonomously interprets prompts ranging from high-level end-user requests to rigorous technical specifications. We demonstrate the framework's versatility across three distinct regimes: (1) finite-conjugate industrial metrology systems, where the model autonomously enforces application-specific constraints such as telecentricity to achieve diffraction-limited performance; (2) a suite of infrared objectives (NIR, SWIR, and LWIR), demonstrating the framework's ability to synthesize valid topologies and optical prescriptions for non-visible spectral bands, and (3) complex aspheric mobile lenses, where the system successfully navigates the high-dimensional optimization landscape to produce high-resolution designs suitable for modern sensors. Validated against industry-standard simulation tools, these results establish a new paradigm for automated optical engineering, bridging the gap between semantic intent and physical realization.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Ultraviolet Dual-Comb Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optical frequency comb has made a significant impact in precision spectroscopy and on our ability to probe atomic, molecular and, recently, nuclear transitions to further our understanding of their fundamental properties and how their dynamics and complex interactions affect the observed world. To expand the energy scales and types of systems that can be studied, frequency comb sources from terahertz to vacuum ultraviolet frequencies and beyond have been pursued. Dual-comb spectroscopy, enabled by the development of these frequency comb sources, allows broadband absorption measurements of complicated spectra, exceeding the limitations of direct, single-comb spectroscopy. To date, however, the dual-comb approach has not been able to directly access many important transitions that lie at challenging vacuum ultraviolet wavelengths. Here, we demonstrate dual-comb spectroscopy in the vacuum ultraviolet utilizing intracavity high harmonic generation. This multi-harmonic source is used to measure molecular absorbance spectra at $\lambda=210$~nm and $\lambda=149$~nm from room-temperature samples of acetylene and ammonia, respectively. These measurements resolve the Doppler broadened structure of congested molecular spectra with absolute frequency accuracy. Noise contributions to the vacuum ultraviolet dual-comb spectroscopy measurements are characterized, guiding future efforts and technological development in this region.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.13945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moir\'e patterns have recently become a very active field in nanophotonics. Those structures exhibit novel photonic properties unattainable with traditional photonic crystals. Especially, moir\'e magic configurations have been shown to allow intriguing slow light modes with zero group velocity. Starting from macroscopic moir\'e patterns in the everyday life, we will then shift to the subwavelength scale of moir\'e photonic crystals and detail some of their unusual properties.</description>

      <title>Polarization-Multiplexed Chaotic LiDAR Based on a VCSEL with Delayed Orthogonal Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) systems are pivotal for precise distance and velocity measurement, yet widespread deployment requires solutions that balance their performance, robustness, and simplicity. Here, we propose a novel chaotic LiDAR system based on a semiconductor vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) with delayed orthogonal polarization feedback. By exploiting the intrinsic competition between the transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) modes, the system generates a polarization-multiplexed dynamics: a chaotic TM mode serves as the reference, while a feedback-modulated TE mode probes the target. This all-in-one source eliminates the need for external optical modulators or complex coherent detection. The system's dynamics is finely tunable via a half-wave ($\lambda$/2) plate in the feedback loop and the laser injection current, enabling real-time optimization of the cross-correlation signal-to-noise ratio. Experimental results demonstrate precise linear ranging with a resolution of approximately 1.2 cm. Furthermore, the system exhibits strong inherent resistance to external optical interference, maintaining accurate ranging even in the presence of a secondary laser source. This compact, tunable, and interference-resilient platform offers a promising pathway toward low-cost, high-performance LiDAR for applications in autonomous navigation, robotics, and industrial metrology.</description>

      <title>Polarization fringes in optical systems: a compendium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectral and spatial fringes in polarized light are produced by the interference of transmitted and reflected waves at the interface between materials with different indexes of refraction. These instrumental artifacts can affect the accuracy of optical designs conceived for high-sensitivity spectroscopy and polarimetry. We review the fundamental mechanisms that are responsible for these artifacts and the possible design pathways that allow us to mitigate them. In order to do so, we also present an approximate treatment of the problem of the transmission and reflection of light through (possibly absorptive) birefringent layers, relying on a few fundamental results that can be found in the already extensive literature on the subject. Unfortunately, many of these results remain the domain of a niche of investigators working in the field of thin films and optical coatings, and are often overlooked even by experienced designers of spectro-polarimetric instrumentation. The treatment presented in this work is limited to isotropic materials and uniaxial crystals, which are the most common types of optics employed in polarimetric instrumentation, and it fundamentally relies on the approximation of small birefringence for its implementation. An extensive set of modeling examples is provided to highlight the salient characteristics of polarization fringes, as well as to assess how approximate treatments such as this compare to exact but more computational expensive formulations of the problem such as Berreman's calculus.</description>

      <title>Controlled non-volatile modulation of optical dispersion in monolayer tungsten disulfide via ferroelectric polarization patterning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The manipulation of optical properties, including reflection, refraction, polarization, phase, and frequency, has long been central to advancing photonic and optoelectronic technologies. However, existing electro-optical approaches rely on volatile mechanisms that require continuous power consumption. Here, we demonstrate strong, nonvolatile modulation of optical dispersion in monolayer tungsten disulfide (ML WS2) using patterned ferroelectric domains in aluminum scandium nitride (AlScN). By locally poling ferroelectric domains into opposite states, we achieve substantial manipulation of the complex refractive index (Delta n &gt; 0.7, Delta k &gt; 0.4) and excitonic energy shifts (~50 meV) in ML WS2, comparable to previous gate-tuning approaches while eliminating continuous power consumption. We introduce an asymmetric screening model that reveals how ferroelectric polarization induces carrier-density-dependent Coulomb screening, leading to distinct excitonic behaviors between electron- and hole-doped regions. Furthermore, we demonstrate a gate-free lateral p-n homojunction with a rectification ratio of 6e10^3, formed through spatial carrier redistribution. These findings establish ferroelectric/2D heterostructures as a powerful platform for nonvolatile optical dispersion engineering, enabling energy-efficient, reconfigurable photonic and optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Revealing Hidden Topology of Complex Vector Beams via Plasmonic Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structured light beams with space-variant polarization can be efficiently generated using voltage-tunable nematic liquid-crystal (Q-plate). By appropriately selecting the input state and the retardation of the Q-plate, an optical field acquires a spatially structured polarization distribution that is capable of encoding non-trivial topological information across the beam profile. These features can be directly read out through interaction with plasmonic nano-structures, such as circular and spiral slits. Here we show that, upon illumination, polarization-dependent excitation of surface plasmons converts the hidden topology of the polarization structure into observable intensity distributions, including plasmonic vortices and characteristic interference patterns, while the tunability of the input parameters enables a rich variety of distinct topological forms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extracellular matrix (ECM) constitutes a key basement structure to human organisms by acting as a complex network of large proteins and carbohydrates that provide structural support to surrounding cells. Remodeling in the extracellular matrix's structural fibers leads to insight into the development of diseases such as cancer, fibrosis and carcinoma. While standard tissues visualization in the ECM involves multiple lengthy histopathological staining protocols, Mueller matrix-based polarimetry provides label-free tissue slices' microstructural information and optical properties. This work aims to identify three types of fiber tissues commonly found in the ECM of gastrointestinal tissue specimens by analyzing their polarization properties. To address decomposition methods' reliance on restrictive hypotheses and inability with an individual polarization-based parameter to determine the nature of a given biological tissue; this study employs Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) method to offer greater discriminative power and flexibility. Subsequently, polarization-based features will be extracted and compared between fiber regions statistically to discern potential diagnostic differences. By providing colorized images, this work aims to demonstrate the feasibility of distinguishing different fibers with polarization approach, offering insights for future clinical development while complementing existing staining methods for pathological tissue specimens.</description>

      <title>Short period InGaAs/AlInAs THz quantum cascade laser in thin double metal cavities operating up to 188K</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a two-well terahertz (THz) quantum cascade laser designed for high temperature operation based on the InGaAs/AlInAs material system. The lighter effective mass and higher energy barriers increase the gain at high temperatures (T &gt; 150K). When processed in copper-based double metal waveguides the devices show laser action up to a maximum operating temperature of 188K with a maximum current density of 1.4kA/cm$^2$. The low Joule heating due to reduced active region thickness and low electrical bias allows operation at 10% duty cycle up to a temperature of 170K.</description>

      <title>Generalized Zernike Phase-Contrast Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zernike phase-contrast imaging is unique among imaging techniques in that it enables the upper limit of Fisher information allowed by quantum mechanics. Here we show that, in a departure from an ideal setting, using an incident beam of finite width, and a $\pi/2$ phase plate having a finite cutoff, the technique can still deliver $&gt;95\%$ of the quantum limit. We point out that the Zernike method is, in principle, applicable to any incident beam. As an example, we sketch an approximate implementation of the method for an incident speckle beam, and show that it too can deliver $&gt;95\%$ of the quantum limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on a novel dual-structure scaffold fabricated using two-photon polymerisation (2PP), integrating electrically conductive and non-conductive regions within a single architecture, targeting neural tissue regeneration. Poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) was combined with 20 nm gold nanoparticles to create a conductive microstructure, encapsulated within a biocompatible PEGDA lattice designed to support neuronal growth possibility after neural injuries. Electrical resistance measurements confirmed the feasibility of integrating conductive pathways into precision-fabricated microarchitectures.</description>

      <title>Near-infrared lensless holographic microscopy on a visible sensor enables label-free high-throughput imaging in strong scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lensless digital holographic microscopy (LDHM) relies on interference between an unscattered reference wave and a weakly scattered object wave - an assumption that rapidly fails in turbid samples under multiple scattering. To overcome this limitation, we present near-infrared LDHM (NIR-LDHM), a in-line holographic platform that operates up to the silicon cutoff (~1100 nm) using a conventional board-level CMOS sensor designed for visible (VIS) imaging. Using tissue-mimicking milk scattering layers and calibrated resolution targets, we quantify reconstruction performance versus wavelength, scattering strength, and sample-sensor distance. NIR-LDHM maintains resolvable features through scattering layers up to ~1.4 mm, whereas visible regime fails to resolve features below ~350 um. Importantly, despite a detector quantum efficiency of only 0.19% at 1100 nm, robust reconstructions are obtained under low-photon-budget conditions. We further identify advantageous mechanism by which increasing the sample-sensor distance from ~3 to 12 mm improves lateral resolution by twofold under strong scattering. Finally, we demonstrate wide-field, label-free amplitude-phase imaging of uncleared mouse tissues, resolving internal structure in brain and liver slices up to ~250 um and ~60 um, respectively. By extending lensless complex-field microscopy into strongly scattering regimes with minimal hardware changes, this work has relevance to computational imaging through complex media and biophotonics.</description>

      <title>A robust and efficient method to calculate electromagnetic modes on a cylindrical step-index nanofibre</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate calculation of guided electromagnetic modes in optical nanofibres is critical for applications in nanophotonics, from quantum interfaces to vectorial light sensing. Standard textbook methods rely on solving a $4\times4$ matrix eigenvalue problem to find the modal fields. While widely used, this approach has a subtle but significant flaw: the final determination of the field amplitudes requires finding the numerical null space of a theoretically singular matrix, an ill-conditioned problem that introduces large relative errors in the small but physically crucial longitudinal field components. In this work, we introduce a fundamentally more robust and efficient semi-analytical method. By starting from the foundational symmetries of the cylindrical waveguide and employing a judicious normalisation of the field amplitudes, we demonstrate that the problem can be analytically reduced to a much simpler $2\times2$ system. This reformulation yields two decisive advantages: the dispersion relation is obtained numerically from a simple and well-behaved transcendental equation, and more importantly, the modal field amplitudes are subsequently determined \emph{analytically}. Our approach completely bypasses the numerical null space calculation, thereby ensuring the accuracy of the full vectorial field structure. This method provides a powerful and reliable tool for the design and analysis of nanofibre-based devices, particularly for applications in chiral quantum optics and nanophotonics where precise knowledge of field polarisation and specifically of the longitudinal components is paramount.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.13736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthetic frequency dimension offers a powerful approach to simulate lattice models and control photon dynamics. However, extending this concept into the quantum regime, particularly at the single-photon level, has remained challenging in photonic platforms. Here, we demonstrate quantum-state initialization and detection of single-photon evolutions within a synthetic frequency lattice by integrating a superconducting qubit with a 16-meter aluminum coaxial cable. A tunable superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID)-based modulator is employed to synthesize lattice couplings and artificial gauge fields. We observe single-photon quantum random walks and Bloch oscillations, as well as nonadiabatic, unidirectional frequency conversion under rapid temporal modulation of the lattice Hamiltonian, together with band-structure measurements. The lattice connectivity can be readily reconfigured to construct higher-dimensional lattices using multiple drive tones. Our results establish superconducting quantum circuits as a versatile platform for programmable Hamiltonians and extensible synthetic lattices with flexible single-photon control.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of High-Gain Harmonic Lasing in a Terahertz Free-Electron Laser</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.13743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compact Free-Electron Lasers (FELs) offering broad, continuous spectral tunability are traditionally constrained by fixed-parameter magnetic structures and the necessity for high-energy electron beams. High-gain Harmonic Lasing (HL) has long been proposed as a solution to overcome these limitations; however, a robust experimental verification of this principle has remained absent. Here, we report the first experimental demonstration of high-gain HL. By employing a frequency-tunable electron beam density modulation to dominate the fundamental instability, we achieved sustained FEL amplification at the 3rd and 5th harmonics of the wiggler. The HL mode generated output power comparable to conventional fundamental operation with enhanced stability and narrower spectral bandwidth. Notably, we demonstrate that HL extends the spectral coverage by a factor of two under fixed facility constraints, achieving pulse energies up to 540 {\mu}J. These results establish high-gain HL as a versatile mechanism for advancing compact, wavelength-flexible FEL facilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frequency-bin encoding has recently emerged as a powerful approach for photonic quantum information processing, offering high dimensionality, gate-parallelization, and compatibility with existing telecommunication infrastructure. However, its scalable deployment has so far been hindered by the lack of an integrated platform capable of unifying quantum state generation, coherent frequency mixing, and programmable spectral control.\\ Here, we report the first fully integrated quantum frequency processor, monolithically integrating on the same silicon photonic chip a microresonator-based biphoton quantum frequency comb source, a pump-rejection filter, high-speed phase modulators, and a four-channel, line-by-line pulse shaper. We demonstrate key functionalities, such as tunable frequency beamsplitters with success probabilities exceeding $94\%$ and fidelities above $99.9\%$, as well as the ability to synthesize more general single-qubit gates. Finally, we generate and coherently manipulate high-dimensional frequency-bin entangled states entirely on chip, showcasing control over two-photon quantum walks and performing the first on-chip frequency-bin quantum state tomography of a Bell-state with a fidelity of $95.7(3)\%$. By integrating all key functional elements on the same $4\times7\,\textrm{mm}^2$ chip, with the possibility of scaling to a larger number of modes, our work marks an important step toward large-scale frequency-domain photonic processors for both classical and quantum applications.</description>

      <title>Convergent-Beam X-ray Crystallography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular and polymeric crystals show a wide range of functional properties that arise from the interplay between the atomic-scale structure of their constituent molecules and the organization of these molecules within the crystal lattice at macroscopic length scales. X-ray diffraction can provide structural information at these disparate length scales, but usually only through experiments that address one or the other of molecular (or unit-cell) structure versus crystal structure. Consequently, the accuracy of determined molecular or polymer structures may be limited by unaccounted crystal inhomogeneities of the crystal lattice and the characterization of crystalline materials might not reveal the underlying causes of crystal morphology. Here we introduce X-ray convergent-beam diffraction to obtain spatially-resolved structural information from crystals by projection topographic imaging. Using highly focusing X-ray multilayer Laue lenses, we show that Bragg reflections can be mapped into tomographic images of the crystal, for the characterization of strain and defects at high resolution. We demonstrate how the crystal morphology obtained this way can be accounted for when determining structure factors as a function of position in the crystal. The approach may assist in studies such as diffusion and binding in MOFS, protein-drug binding, crystal growth, and the mechanical responses of photo-reactive or thermally driven dynamic crystals.</description>

      <title>A hardware-native time-frequency GKP logical qubit toward fault-tolerant photonic operation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We realize a hardware-native time--frequency Gottesman--Kitaev--Preskill (GKP) logical qubit encoded in the continuous phase space of single photons, establishing a propagating photonic implementation of bosonic grid encoding. Finite-energy grid states are generated deterministically using coherently driven entangled nonlinear biphoton sources that produce single-photon frequency-comb supermodes. An optical-frequency-comb reference anchors the time--frequency phase space and enforces commuting displacement stabilizers directly at the hardware level, continuously defining the logical subspace. Timing jitter, spectral drift, and phase noise map naturally onto Gaussian displacement errors within this lattice, yielding intrinsic correctability inside a stabilizer cell. Logical operations correspond to experimentally accessible phase and delay controls, enabling deterministic state preparation and manipulation. Building on the modal time--frequency GKP framework, we identify a concrete pathway toward active syndrome extraction and deterministic displacement recovery using ancillary grid states and interferometric time--frequency measurements. These primitives establish a hardware-compatible route for integrating the time--frequency GKP logical layer into erasure-aware and fusion-based fault-tolerant photonic architectures.</description>

      <title>Effective Caldirola-Kanai Model for Accelerating Twisted Dirac States in Nonuniform Axial Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study relativistic twisted (orbital-angular-momentum) states of a massive charged particle propagating through an axially symmetric, longitudinally inhomogeneous solenoid field and a co-directed accelerating or decelerating electric field. Starting from the Dirac equation and using controlled spinless and paraxial approximations, we show that the transverse envelope obeys an effective nonstationary Schr\"odinger equation governed by a Caldirola--Kanai Hamiltonian. The longitudinal energy gain or loss encoded in $f(z)=[E_0-V(z)]^2-m^2$ generates an effective gain or damping rate $\widetilde{\gamma}(z)=\partial_z f(z)/[2f(z)]$ and a $z$-dependent oscillator frequency $\widetilde{\omega}(z)=p_0\Omega(z)/\sqrt{f(z)}$. Exploiting the Ermakov mapping (unitary equivalence of Caldirola--Kanai systems), we obtain a closed-form propagated twisted wave function by transforming the stationary Landau basis. The transverse evolution is controlled by a single scaling function $b(z)$ that satisfies a generalized Ermakov--Pinney equation with coefficients determined by $E_z(z)$ and $B_z(z)$. In the limiting cases of uniform acceleration with $B_z=0$ and of solenoid focusing with negligible acceleration, our solution reduces to previously known analytic results, providing a direct bridge to established models.</description>

      <title>Large Transverse Thermoelectric Effect in Weyl Semimetal TaIrTe$_4$ Engineered for Photodetection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anomalous local photocurrent generation via second-order nonlinear and thermoelectric responses is a signature of many topological semimetals. The emergence of these photocurrents is inherently linked to symmetry breaking and anisotropy of their crystal lattices. Studies of type-II Weyl semimetals of group C$_{2v}$ (WTe$_2$, MoTe$_2$, TaIrTe$_4$) have reported anomalous, nonlocal photocurrents localized to crystals edges or far from electrodes, which are highly dependent on the geometry of the material sample. While originally attributed to a nonlinear charge current response, it was recently shown that these currents could instead be attributed to the anisotropic Seebeck coefficients of the materials. Here, we confirm that anomalous photocurrents observed in TaIrTe$_4$ under either visible or far-infrared far-field illumination originate from the large transverse thermoelectric effect. We engineer the mutual orientation of crystal edges and electrodes as well as the thermal environment of TaIrTe$_4$ to control and amplify its spatial photocurrent response. We show that substrate engineering can locally enhance photocurrent. This framework of thermal device engineering can enable broadband photo detection schemes by leveraging spectral and spatial dependence of photocurrents for applications like wavefront sensing, beam positioning, and edge detection.</description>

Abstract: A fascinating effect belonging to the field of vacuum forces and fluctuations is that of quantum friction. It refers to the prediction of a dissipative force acting on a moving object due to the quantum vacuum field. In this work, we investigate rotational quantum friction where a diatomic polar molecule rotates around its own center of mass in free space. We quantize the rotational motion and investigate the resulting dissipation due to spontaneous decay. We find in the Markovian regime that a friction torque $\propto \Omega^3$ persists even for zero temperature, and in agreement with the classical result in the limit of large rotational quantum number $l$. Within the non-Markovian short-time regime we find a friction $\propto\Omega$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07479v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As photonic and electronic technologies approach nanometre length scales and terahertz operating speeds, electrical conductivity can no longer be treated as a purely local material parameter. In this regime, charge transport becomes intrinsically nonlocal, with conductivity depending on both frequency and momentum, $\sigma(\omega,q)$, fundamentally limiting field confinement, dispersion, and loss in nanoscale devices. Here, we directly measure the nonlocal nanoscale conductivity of graphene using terahertz scattering-type near-field optical microscopy. By combining broadband THz near-field spectroscopy with quantitative electrodynamic modelling, we extract the complex conductivity of single- and few-layer graphene with $\sim$50 nm spatial resolution. We find that nonlocal response dominates the terahertz conductivity of monolayer graphene even at length scales comparable to practical device dimensions. These results establish nonlocal conductivity as a measurable and design-relevant material property in the terahertz regime, providing a quantitative foundation for predicting performance limits in ultracompact photonic and electronic systems.</description>

      <title>Depth-multiplexing spectral domain OCT for full eye length imaging with a single modulation unit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Clinical measurement of a patient's axial eye length is emerging as a crucial approach to track progression and monitor management of myopia. However, the preferred method for such measurements is swept-source OCT, whose cost prohibits broad use, especially in lower-income communities. Spectral domain (SD) OCT is a more affordable option, but it has limited imaging depth range, so is not suitable for full eye length measurement. Depth-multiplexing (DM) techniques for SD-OCT provide a workaround by capturing images at multiple depths within the eye. However, these methods typically require multiple light modulation units or detectors for simultaneous imaging across depths, adding complexity and cost. In response, we propose a novel DM-SD-OCT approach that utilizes a single light modulation unit for depth encoding. We capture images at multiple depths within the eye simultaneously with a single line scan camera, then computationally demix the contributions from different depths. Here, we demonstrate acquisition and demixing of signals from three distinct depths within the eye and validate experimentally in human subjects. Our method thus offers a cost-effective solution for comprehensive eye length measurement in clinical myopia research.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous amplification and shaping of excimer lasers using Stimulated Brillouin Scattering in the strongly damped limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Attaining practical Inertial Fusion Energy (IFE) depends on how efficiently one can couple the driver energy to the nuclear fusion fuel for compression and ignition. While the excimer lasers provide an efficient alternative compared to existing laser technology, it is unclear how the lasers can be harnessed to form a pulse with desired pulse shape and intensity. Stimulated Brillouin Scattering (SBS) provides a path to compressing long, energetic pulses to short intense ones. We consider the equations governing SBS in the Strongly Damped Limit (SDL) and find that it is possible to almost completely specify the final pulse shape by providing an appropriate initial seed pulse. We provide analytic expressions for reverse-engineering the initial seed shape and delineate physical limits concerning the prepulse level.</description>

      <title>Regimes and Transitions of the Nonlinear Temporal Talbot Effect: Underlying Mechanism for A-Type Breathers, Soliton Crystals, and Soliton Gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A frequency comb generated from a phase-modulated continuous-wave laser is simultaneously subject to the temporal Talbot effect and modulational instability (MI) when propagating through a piece of optical fiber. The temporal Talbot effect refers to the dispersion-driven self-imaging of optical pulses and is, per se, linear in optical field amplitudes. MI is a nonlinear effect. Despite growing interest and a variety of possible applications, a concise theory of the nonlinear temporal Talbot effect that incorporates nonlinear effects is not yet available; the self-imaging of optical patterns under the influence of nonlinearity remains largely unexplored. Here, I derive a dispersion relation for frequency-comb spatial modes. It integrates the contributions of the linear temporal Talbot effect, self-phase modulation, and MI-driven cross-phase modulation and four-wave mixing (FWM) between frequency-comb lines, paving the way to the development of a concise theory of the nonlinear temporal Talbot effect. With the help of Soliton Radiation Beat Analysis, a technique for retrieving the soliton content of optical fields in fibers, I demonstrate that the temporal Talbot effect seeds the spatio-temporal distribution of the field by driving higher-order spatial-mode interference. Nonlinear effects modify this interference, linking Talbot effect to Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou recurrence of optical pulses and producing input-power-dependent regime transitions between the linear Talbot effect, A-type breathers, soliton crystals, and soliton gas. I show that A-type breathers arise from regular FWM at lower input powers, whereas soliton crystals emerge from cascaded FWM at higher powers. This study advances the fields of Nonlinear Optics and Wave Theory.</description>

      <title>A three-dimensional polarization-insensitive grating coupler tailored for 3D nanoprinting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficiently coupling light from optical fibers into photonic integrated circuits is a key step toward practical photonic devices. While a notable coupling can be achieved by out of plane couplers such as grating couplers, their basic planar geometry typically tends to be sensitive to the polarization of light. This is partly due to the fact that the design spaces of such grating structures typically fabricated with techniques such as electron beam lithography are only two dimensional with a simple extrusion into the vertical dimension. This makes it challenging to optimize for both polarizations simultaneously, as performance typically degrades when trying to achieve high efficiency in both. As a result, conventional approaches either suffer from increased losses or require additional filtering components to account for different polarizations. In this work, we present a fully three dimensional, polarization insensitive grating coupler which has a highly efficient simulated coupling efficiency of over 80% in both polarizations. This performance matches that of state of the art couplers that are performant for one polarization only. This comes at the cost of a moderately larger size due to the lower refractive index materials typically available in 3D nanoprinting. Our design method uses density based topology optimization with a multi objective approach that combines electromagnetic simulations with a fictitious heat conduction model acting as a soft constraint to promote structural integrity. This ensures that the designed structures are feasible for fabrication. Our work opens new possibilities for robust 3D photonic devices, enabling advanced integration, fabrication, and applications across next generation photonics and electronics.</description>

      <title>Programmable emergence through hierarchical self-organisation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predictively steering self-organising systems with hierarchical structure toward intended outcomes across widely separated dynamical scales remains a fundamental challenge. Despite decades of progress, hierarchy remains a descriptive property rather than a mechanism for control. Here, we show how a high-dimensional stochastic system can be steered toward preselected target states by exploiting its internal hierarchy of timescales. Fast variables lock to slower collective variables; iterating this locking across scales progressively reduces the effective dynamics to a small set of externally controllable parameters. This enables directing the system while maintaining dynamical insulation from noise across scales, thereby turning hierarchy from an observation into a mechanism for programmable emergence. We experimentally demonstrate this approach in a fully tractable platform: a mode-locked laser, in which we assemble and stabilise more than 100 pulses into harmonic patterns over timescales spanning 10 orders of magnitude. Phenomena such as nucleation, quantum-noise-induced annihilation, long-range interactions and annealing-like ordering are predicted and exploited to transition the system to preselected states. Our results establish a route to programming emergent behaviour in driven-dissipative systems, with implications ranging from optics to materials.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Evanescent Wave Interaction for Enhanced Optical NO2 Detection with Carbon Nanotube-Coated Side-Polished Fiber</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03071v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gas monitoring systems based on side-polished optical fibers (SPFs) coated with functional nanomaterials are gaining growing attention for their diverse applications. The response of these sensors is commonly interpreted in terms of absorption modulation of the sensing layer. Here we demonstrate that, in such systems, gas-induced reshaping of the guided optical mode can dominate the transduction mechanism and even reverse the sign of the optical response. Using SPFs functionalized with single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) thin films, we observe a pronounced polarization- and film thickness-dependent response to NO2 exposure. This behavior contradicts established mechanisms of SWCNT-NO2 interactions and cannot be explained solely by gas-induced changes in intrinsic nanotube absorption. Numerical analyses show that an accurate description of the response requires accounting of modification of fiber mode profile induced by alterations in the SWCNT refractive index. The identified mechanism provides a general framework for designing fiber-optic and integrated photonic sensors based on evanescent-field interactions with functional nanomaterials.</description>

Abstract: This paper examines the connection between photonic band-gap formation in two types of two-dimensional photonic crystals and the emergence of reverse electromagnetic energy flows generated by linearly polarized plane waves incident on a photonic-crystal slab. We show that these reverse energy flows, observed in both transmitted and reflected fields, originate from vortex structures in the Poynting vector. The resulting energy-flow patterns exhibit striking analogies to vortex formation in fluid motion past obstacles. The geometry and dynamics of the Poynting-vector vortices determine whether the incident electromagnetic energy is impeded, leading to the formation of photonic band gaps, or instead guided through the structure, enabling transmission.</description>

Abstract: Inverting design method of solving passive graded materials from predefined amplitude and phase was developed along the line of transformation optics (TO), which however precluded the presence of source and sink in the pragmatic world. So in this Letter we extend such an inverse method to non-Hermitian media, offering more freedom to manipulate the wave flows. Our principle of a curved-space analogue picture powered with gain and loss, is exemplified by three types: amplitude controlling, phase conversion, and direction shunting. These examples showcase precise wave manipulation in a surprisingly simple manner, which goes beyond convectional paradigms of TO and is readily implementable in realistic photonic platform.</description>

      <title>Resonant optical tunnelling in planar three-layer photonic microstructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.11868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a unified analytical framework for resonant optical tunnelling in three-layer photonic systems embedded in a transparent dielectric medium. Compact expressions for the transmission coefficient are derived using a generalized Fresnel-coefficient formalism, enabling us to distinguish between two fundamentally different tunnelling regimes determined by the nature of the waves supported in the core layer. When harmonic waves propagate within the core, resonances satisfy the conventional Fabry-Perot phase condition. In contrast, when evanescent or damped waves are supported, resonant tunnelling arises from an amplitude-matching condition governed by the magnitude of the composite reflection coefficient. This distinction leads to qualitatively different transmission characteristics and markedly different tunnelling behaviors. For clarity, transparent materials are treated first (including ideal metals), and the role of absorption is subsequently analyzed, revealing the transition from unitary resonant tunnelling to attenuated optical tunnelling. Angular-spectral maps illustrate the general features of each configuration and demonstrate that resonant tunnelling may occur in structures whose thickness exceeds several wavelengths. The results provide a consistent physical interpretation of resonant tunnelling phenomena in both dielectric and metal-dielectric multilayer systems.</description>

Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect describes the phenomenon of exponential localization of single-particle eigenstates near the boundary of the system. We consider its generalization to the many-body regime by investigating a general class of interacting fermion lattice models in Markovian open quantum systems. Therein, the elementary excitations from the "vacuum" (steady state) are given by two types of dissipative fermionic modes composed of single-fermion operators, which govern the long-time nonequilibrium dynamics. We perturbatively calculate the self-energy matrix of these bare modes in the presence of interactions, and utilize the non-Bloch band theory to derive an exact integral representation. By imposing complex momentum conservation, we obtain a simplified expression for corrections to Liouvillian spectrum that agrees well with numerical calculations to high precision. We further perform perturbative analysis of Liouvillian eigenstates and identify signatures of interaction-enhanced NHSE at the quasiparticle level, manifested as renormalization of the generalized Brillouin zone. Our results establish a diagrammatic framework for dissipative interacting fermions with non-Hermitian skin effect in a description of full-fledged Lindblad master equations, which resembles Fermi liquid theory in terms of interaction-dressed quasiparticles.</description>

Abstract: Neutral atom arrays and optical cavity QED systems have developed in parallel as central pillars of modern experimental quantum science. While each platform has demonstrated exceptional capabilities-such as high-fidelity quantum logic in atom arrays, and strong light-matter coupling in cavities-their combination holds promise for realizing fast and non-destructive atom measurement, building large-scale quantum networks, and engineering hybrid atom-photon Hamiltonians. However, to date, experiments integrating the two platforms have been limited to spatially interfacing the entire atom array with one global cavity mode, a configuration that constrains addressability, parallelism, and scalability. Here we introduce the cavity array microscope, an experimental platform where each individual atom is strongly coupled to its own individual cavity across a two-dimensional array of over 40 modes. Our approach requires no nanophotonic elements, and instead uses a new free-space cavity geometry with intra-cavity lenses to realize above-unity peak cooperativity with micron-scale mode waists and spacings, compatible with typical atom array length scales while keeping atoms far from dielectric surfaces. We achieve homogeneous atom-cavity coupling, and show fast, non-destructive, parallel readout on millisecond timescales, including through a fiber array as a proof-of-principle for networking applications. As an outlook, we realize a next-generation iteration of the platform with over 500 cavities and a nearly 10 times improvement in finesse. Our work unlocks the regime of many-cavity QED, and opens an unexplored frontier of large-scale quantum networking with atom arrays.</description>

Abstract: The Generalized Brillouin Zone (GBZ) encodes how lattice momentum is complex-deformed due to non-Hermitian skin accumulation, and has proved essential in restoring bulk-boundary correspondences. However, we find that generically, the GBZ is neither unique nor well-defined if more than one skin localization direction or strength exists, even in systems with no asymmetric hoppings. Instead, open boundary condition (OBC) eigenstates become complicated superpositions of multiple competing skin modes from "fragments" of all possible GBZs solutions. We develop a formalism that computes the fragmented GBZ in a scalable manner, with fragmentation extent quantified through our newly-defined composition IPR and spectral relative entropy. GBZ fragmentation is revealed to fundamentally challenge the notion of discontinuous phase transitions, since topological winding contributions from different GBZ fragments can "melt away" at different rates. Phenomenologically, GBZ fragmentation also leads to edge localization in all observables in energetically weighted ensembles such as thermal ensembles. This contrasts with conventional GBZs where the skin localization completely cancels in biorthogonal expectations. Occurring universally in multi-mode non-Hermitian media, as we concretely demonstrate with photonic crystal simulations, GBZ fragmentation points towards a new paradigm that is essential for understanding the band structure and the topological and dynamical properties of diverse generic non-Hermitian systems.</description>

Abstract: High-fidelity and parallel realization in scalable platforms of the two-qubit entangling gates fundamental to universal quantum computing constitutes one of the largest challenges in implementing fault-tolerant quantum computation. Integrated optical addressing of trapped-ion qubits offers routes to scaling the high-fidelity optical control demonstrated to date in small systems. Here we show that in addition to scaling, capabilities practically enabled by integrated optics can substantially alleviate laser powers required for both light-shift (LS) and Molmer-Sorensen (MS) geometric phase gates acting on long-lived ground-state qubit encodings in a broad range of ion species. In the proposed gate schemes utilizing carrier nulling via ion positioning at phase-stable standing-wave (SW) nodes, our calculations suggest that suppressed spontaneous photon scattering at the SW node allows for gate drives operating at smaller Raman detunings, resulting in approximately an order-of-magnitude reduction in power requirement (and significantly larger in certain parameter regimes) for gates of a given duration and scattering-limited fidelity as compared to conventional running wave (RW)-based approaches. The SW schemes have the additional benefit of simultaneously eliminating undesired coherent couplings that typically limit gate speeds. Our work quantifies power requirements for multiple ion species and enhancements to be expected from carrier-nulled configurations practically enabled by integrated delivery, and informs experiments and systems for realization of fast and power-efficient laser-based entangling gates in scalable platforms.</description>

Abstract: We investigate topological band structures of a kagome system coupled to a circularly polarized cavity mode, using a model based on a muffin-tin potential and quantum light-matter interaction. We show that Chern insulating phases emerge in the cavity-embedded kagome system due to the light-matter interaction that breaks time-reversal symmetry. We also find that a nearly flat band can be topologically nontrivial with a nonzero Chern number. By varying the light-matter interaction, we also reveal that topological phase transitions occur between different Chern insulating phases in the ultrastrong coupling regime. The phase transitions change the sign of the Chern number, switching the direction of the edge current. We demonstrate the existence of topological edge modes in the cavity-embedded kagome Chern insulators by constructing a low-energy effective tight-binding model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The electromagnetic Green's function is a crucial ingredient for the theoretical study of modern photonic quantum devices, but is often difficult or even impossible to calculate directly. We present a numerically efficient framework for calculating the scattered electromagnetic Green's function of a multi-cavity system with spatially separated open cavities (with arbitrary shape, dispersion and loss) and finite retardation times. The framework is based on a Dyson scattering equation that enables the construction of the Green's function from the quasinormal modes of the individual resonators within a few-mode approximation and a finite number of iteration steps without requiring nested integrals. The approach shows excellent agreement with the full numerical Green's function for the example of two coupled dipoles located in the gaps of two metal dimers serving as quasinormal mode cavities, and is easily extended to arbitrarily large separations and multiple cavities.</description>

Abstract: The generation of relativistic vortex electron beams via photoemission requires ultraviolet laser beams with well-controlled orbital angular momentum (OAM) and compatibility with radio-frequency (RF) photoinjector drive-laser systems. High-OAM vortex beams at a wavelength of 266 nm are generated using three fabricated diffractive optical elements integrated into an operational photoinjector beamline: a reflective fork grating, a high-topological-charge spiral phase plate, and binary axicons. The spiral phase plate produces a high-purity Laguerre-Gaussian mode with an OAM of l = 64 and a conversion efficiency of 80%, whereas binary axicons generate low-divergence quasi-Bessel beams forming a superposition of multiple OAM states with a finite OAM bandwidth imposed by their binary phase structure. Fork gratings provide flexible access to lower OAM values and enable robust modal diagnostics. The generated beams are characterized using cylindrical-lens mode conversion and radial intensity analysis, demonstrating practical control of both the OAM content and spectral bandwidth of ultraviolet structured light for accelerator-based applications.</description>
