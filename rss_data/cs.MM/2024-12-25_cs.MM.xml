      <title>Muse: A Multimodal Conversational Recommendation Dataset with Scenario-Grounded User Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current conversational recommendation systems focus predominantly on text. However, real-world recommendation settings are generally multimodal, causing a significant gap between existing research and practical applications. To address this issue, we propose Muse, the first multimodal conversational recommendation dataset. Muse comprises 83,148 utterances from 7,000 conversations centered around the Clothing domain. Each conversation contains comprehensive multimodal interactions, rich elements, and natural dialogues. Data in Muse are automatically synthesized by a multi-agent framework powered by multimodal large language models (MLLMs). It innovatively derives user profiles from real-world scenarios rather than depending on manual design and history data for better scalability, and then it fulfills conversation simulation and optimization. Both human and LLM evaluations demonstrate the high quality of conversations in Muse. Additionally, fine-tuning experiments on three MLLMs demonstrate Muse's learnable patterns for recommendations and responses, confirming its value for multimodal conversational recommendation. Our dataset and codes are available at \url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Muse-0086}.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised Spatio-Temporal Graph Mask-Passing Attention Network for Perceptual Importance Prediction of Multi-point Tactility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While visual and auditory information are prevalent in modern multimedia systems, haptic interaction, e.g., tactile and kinesthetic interaction, provides a unique form of human perception. However, multimedia technology for contact interaction is less mature than non-contact multimedia technologies and requires further development. Specialized haptic media technologies, requiring low latency and bitrates, are essential to enable haptic interaction, necessitating haptic information compression. Existing vibrotactile signal compression methods, based on the perceptual model, do not consider the characteristics of fused tactile perception at multiple spatially distributed interaction points. In fact, differences in tactile perceptual importance are not limited to conventional frequency and time domains, but also encompass differences in the spatial locations on the skin unique to tactile perception. For the most frequently used tactile information, vibrotactile texture perception, we have developed a model to predict its perceptual importance at multiple points, based on self-supervised learning and Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network. Current experimental results indicate that this model can effectively predict the perceptual importance of various points in multi-point tactile perception scenarios.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Data Provenance Gap Across Text, Speech and Video</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Progress in AI is driven largely by the scale and quality of training data. Despite this, there is a deficit of empirical analysis examining the attributes of well-established datasets beyond text. In this work we conduct the largest and first-of-its-kind longitudinal audit across modalities--popular text, speech, and video datasets--from their detailed sourcing trends and use restrictions to their geographical and linguistic representation. Our manual analysis covers nearly 4000 public datasets between 1990-2024, spanning 608 languages, 798 sources, 659 organizations, and 67 countries. We find that multimodal machine learning applications have overwhelmingly turned to web-crawled, synthetic, and social media platforms, such as YouTube, for their training sets, eclipsing all other sources since 2019. Secondly, tracing the chain of dataset derivations we find that while less than 33% of datasets are restrictively licensed, over 80% of the source content in widely-used text, speech, and video datasets, carry non-commercial restrictions. Finally, counter to the rising number of languages and geographies represented in public AI training datasets, our audit demonstrates measures of relative geographical and multilingual representation have failed to significantly improve their coverage since 2013. We believe the breadth of our audit enables us to empirically examine trends in data sourcing, restrictions, and Western-centricity at an ecosystem-level, and that visibility into these questions are essential to progress in responsible AI. As a contribution to ongoing improvements in dataset transparency and responsible use, we release our entire multimodal audit, allowing practitioners to trace data provenance across text, speech, and video.</description>

      <title>A Multimodal Emotion Recognition System: Integrating Facial Expressions, Body Movement, Speech, and Spoken Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional psychological evaluations rely heavily on human observation and interpretation, which are prone to subjectivity, bias, fatigue, and inconsistency. To address these limitations, this work presents a multimodal emotion recognition system that provides a standardised, objective, and data-driven tool to support evaluators, such as psychologists, psychiatrists, and clinicians. The system integrates recognition of facial expressions, speech, spoken language, and body movement analysis to capture subtle emotional cues that are often overlooked in human evaluations. By combining these modalities, the system provides more robust and comprehensive emotional state assessment, reducing the risk of mis- and overdiagnosis. Preliminary testing in a simulated real-world condition demonstrates the system's potential to provide reliable emotional insights to improve the diagnostic accuracy. This work highlights the promise of automated multimodal analysis as a valuable complement to traditional psychological evaluation practices, with applications in clinical and therapeutic settings.</description>

      <title>RDPM: Solve Diffusion Probabilistic Models via Recurrent Token Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have emerged as the de facto approach for high-fidelity image synthesis, operating diffusion processes on continuous VAE latent, which significantly differ from the text generation methods employed by Large Language Models (LLMs). In this paper, we introduce a novel generative framework, the Recurrent Diffusion Probabilistic Model (RDPM), which enhances the diffusion process through a recurrent token prediction mechanism, thereby pioneering the field of Discrete Diffusion. By progressively introducing Gaussian noise into the latent representations of images and encoding them into vector-quantized tokens in a recurrent manner, RDPM facilitates a unique diffusion process on discrete-value domains. This process iteratively predicts the token codes for subsequent timesteps, transforming the initial standard Gaussian noise into the source data distribution, aligning with GPT-style models in terms of the loss function. RDPM demonstrates superior performance while benefiting from the speed advantage of requiring only a few inference steps. This model not only leverages the diffusion process to ensure high-quality generation but also converts continuous signals into a series of high-fidelity discrete tokens, thereby maintaining a unified optimization strategy with other discrete tokens, such as text. We anticipate that this work will contribute to the development of a unified model for multimodal generation, specifically by integrating continuous signal domains such as images, videos, and audio with text. We will release the code and model weights to the open-source community.</description>

      <title>DiTCtrl: Exploring Attention Control in Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer for Tuning-Free Multi-Prompt Longer Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sora-like video generation models have achieved remarkable progress with a Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer MM-DiT architecture. However, the current video generation models predominantly focus on single-prompt, struggling to generate coherent scenes with multiple sequential prompts that better reflect real-world dynamic scenarios. While some pioneering works have explored multi-prompt video generation, they face significant challenges including strict training data requirements, weak prompt following, and unnatural transitions. To address these problems, we propose DiTCtrl, a training-free multi-prompt video generation method under MM-DiT architectures for the first time. Our key idea is to take the multi-prompt video generation task as temporal video editing with smooth transitions. To achieve this goal, we first analyze MM-DiT's attention mechanism, finding that the 3D full attention behaves similarly to that of the cross/self-attention blocks in the UNet-like diffusion models, enabling mask-guided precise semantic control across different prompts with attention sharing for multi-prompt video generation. Based on our careful design, the video generated by DiTCtrl achieves smooth transitions and consistent object motion given multiple sequential prompts without additional training. Besides, we also present MPVBench, a new benchmark specially designed for multi-prompt video generation to evaluate the performance of multi-prompt generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance without additional training.</description>

      <title>SwinGS: Sliding Window Gaussian Splatting for Volumetric Video Streaming with Arbitrary Length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have garnered significant attention in computer vision and computer graphics due to its high rendering speed and remarkable quality. While extant research has endeavored to extend the application of 3DGS from static to dynamic scenes, such efforts have been consistently impeded by excessive model sizes, constraints on video duration, and content deviation. These limitations significantly compromise the streamability of dynamic 3D Gaussian models, thereby restricting their utility in downstream applications, including volumetric video, autonomous vehicle, and immersive technologies such as virtual, augmented, and mixed reality.
  This paper introduces SwinGS, a novel framework for training, delivering, and rendering volumetric video in a real-time streaming fashion. To address the aforementioned challenges and enhance streamability, SwinGS integrates spacetime Gaussian with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to adapt the model to fit various 3D scenes across frames, in the meantime employing a sliding window captures Gaussian snapshots for each frame in an accumulative way. We implement a prototype of SwinGS and demonstrate its streamability across various datasets and scenes. Additionally, we develop an interactive WebGL viewer enabling real-time volumetric video playback on most devices with modern browsers, including smartphones and tablets. Experimental results show that SwinGS reduces transmission costs by 83.6% compared to previous work with ignorable compromise in PSNR. Moreover, SwinGS easily scales to long video sequences without compromising quality.</description>

      <title>The Practice of Averaging Rate-Distortion Curves over Testsets to Compare Learned Video Codecs Can Cause Misleading Conclusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08772v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper aims to demonstrate how the prevalent practice in the learned video compression community of averaging rate-distortion (RD) curves across a test video set can lead to misleading conclusions in evaluating codec performance. Through analytical analysis of a simple case and experimental results with two recent learned video codecs, we show how averaged RD curves can mislead comparative evaluation of different codecs, particularly when videos in a dataset have varying characteristics and operating ranges. We illustrate how a single video with distinct RD characteristics from the rest of the test set can disproportionately influence the average RD curve, potentially overshadowing a codec's superior performance across most individual sequences. Using two recent learned video codecs on the UVG dataset as a case study, we demonstrate computing performance metrics, such as the BD rate, from the average RD curve suggests conclusions that contradict those reached from calculating the average of per-sequence metrics. Hence, we argue that the learned video compression community should also report per-sequence RD curves and performance metrics for a test set should be computed from the average of per-sequence metrics, similar to the established practice in traditional video coding, to ensure fair and accurate codec comparisons.</description>

      <title>Diff-Instruct*: Towards Human-Preferred One-step Text-to-image Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Diff-Instruct* (DI*), an image data-free approach for building one-step text-to-image generative models that align with human preference while maintaining the ability to generate highly realistic images. We frame human preference alignment as online reinforcement learning using human feedback (RLHF), where the goal is to maximize the reward function while regularizing the generator distribution to remain close to a reference diffusion process. Unlike traditional RLHF approaches, which rely on the KL divergence for regularization, we introduce a novel score-based divergence regularization, which leads to significantly better performances. Although the direct calculation of this preference alignment objective remains intractable, we demonstrate that we can efficiently compute its gradient by deriving an equivalent yet tractable loss function. Remarkably, we used Diff-Instruct* to train a Stable Diffusion-XL-based 1-step model, the 2.6B DI*-SDXL-1step text-to-image model, which can generate images of a resolution of 1024x1024 with only 1 generation step. DI*-SDXL-1step model uses only 1.88% inference time and 29.30% GPU memory cost to outperform 12B FLUX-dev-50step significantly in PickScore, ImageReward, and CLIPScore on Parti prompt benchmark and HPSv2.1 on Human Preference Score benchmark, establishing a new state-of-the-art benchmark of human-preferred 1-step text-to-image generative models. Besides the strong quantitative performances, extensive qualitative comparisons also confirm the advantages of DI* in terms of maintaining diversity, improving image layouts, and enhancing aesthetic colors. We have released our industry-ready model on the homepage: \url{https://github.com/pkulwj1994/diff_instruct_star}.</description>

      <title>L3TC: Leveraging RWKV for Learned Lossless Low-Complexity Text Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16642v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning-based probabilistic models can be combined with an entropy coder for data compression. However, due to the high complexity of learning-based models, their practical application as text compressors has been largely overlooked. To address this issue, our work focuses on a low-complexity design while maintaining compression performance. We introduce a novel Learned Lossless Low-complexity Text Compression method (L3TC). Specifically, we conduct extensive experiments demonstrating that RWKV models achieve the fastest decoding speed with a moderate compression ratio, making it the most suitable backbone for our method. Second, we propose an outlier-aware tokenizer that uses a limited vocabulary to cover frequent tokens while allowing outliers to bypass the prediction and encoding. Third, we propose a novel high-rank reparameterization strategy that enhances the learning capability during training without increasing complexity during inference. Experimental results validate that our method achieves 48% bit saving compared to gzip compressor. Besides, L3TC offers compression performance comparable to other learned compressors, with a 50x reduction in model parameters. More importantly, L3TC is the fastest among all learned compressors, providing real-time decoding speeds up to megabytes per second. Our code is available at https://github.com/alipay/L3TC-leveraging-rwkv-for-learned-lossless-low-complexity-text-compression.git.</description>
