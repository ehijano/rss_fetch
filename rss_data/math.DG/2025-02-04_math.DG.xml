      <title>A definition of the mass aspect function for weakly regular asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In contrast to the well-known and unambiguous notion of ADM mass for asymptotically Euclidean manifolds, the notion of mass for asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds admits several interpretations. Historically, there are two approaches to defining the mass in the asymptotically hyperbolic setting: the mass aspect function of Wang defined on the conformal boundary at infinity, and the mass functional of Chru\'sciel and Herzlich which may be thought of as the closest asymptotically hyperbolic analogue of the ADM mass. In this paper we unify these two approaches by introducing an ADM-style definition of the mass aspect function that applies to a broad range of asymptotics and in very low regularity. Additionally, we show that the mass aspect function can be computed using the Ricci tensor. Finally, we demonstrate that this function exhibits favorable covariance properties under changes of charts at infinity, which includes a proof of the asymptotic rigidity of hyperbolic space in the context of weakly regular metrics.</description>

      <title>An Introduction to Calabi-Yau Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to develop the theory of Courant algebroids with integrable para-Hermitian vector bundle structures by invoking the theory of Lie bialgebroids. We consider the case where the underlying manifold has an almost para-complex structure, and use this to define a notion of para-holomorphic algebroid. We investigate connections on para-holomorphic algebroids and determine an appropriate sense in which they can be para-complex. Finally, we show through a series of examples how the theory of exact para-holomorphic algebroids with a para-complex connection is a generalization of both para-K\"{a}hler geometry and the theory of Poisson-Lie groups.</description>

      <title>Fundamental groups of compact K\"ahler manifolds with semi-positive holomorphic sectional curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that a compact K\"ahler manifold $X$ with semi-positive holomorphic sectional curvature admits a locally trivial fibration $\phi \colon X \to Y$, where the fiber $F$ is a rationally connected projective manifold and the base $Y$ is a finite \'etale quotient of a torus. This result extends the structure theorem, previously established for projective manifolds, to compact K\"ahler manifolds. A key part of the proof involves analyzing the foliation generated by truly flat tangent vectors and showing the abelianness of the topological fundamental group $\pi_{1}(X)$, with a focus on varieties of special type.</description>

      <title>Sharp regularity of sub-Riemannian length-minimizing curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A longstanding open question in sub-Riemannian geometry is the smoothness of (the arc-length parameterization of) length-minimizing curves. In [6], this question is negative answered, with an example of a $C^2$ but not $C^3$ length-minimizer of a real-analytic (even polynomial) sub-Riemannian structure. In this paper, we study a class of examples of sub-Riemannian structures that generalizes that presented in [6], and we prove that length-minimizing curves must be at least of class $C^2$ within these examples. In particular, we prove that Theorem 1.1 in [6] is sharp.</description>

      <title>A normalized Ricci flow on surfaces with boundary towards the complete hyperbolic metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(\overline{M},g_0)$ be a $2$-D compact surface with boundary $\partial M$ and its interior $M$. We show that for a large class of initial and boundary data, the initial-boundary value problem of the normalized Ricci flow $(1.10)-(1.12)$, with prescribed geodesic curvature $\psi$ on $\partial M$, has a unique solution for all $t&gt;0$, and it converges to the complete hyperbolic metric locally uniformly in $M$. Here the natural condition that $\psi&gt;0$ causes the main difficulty in the a priori estimates in the corresponding initial-boundary problem $(1.15)-(1.17)$ of the parabolic equations, for which an auxiliary Cauchy-Dirichlet problem is introduced. We also provide examples of the boundary data $\psi$ which fits well with the natural asymptotic behavior of the geodesic curvature, but the solution to $(1.10)-(1.12)$ fails to converge to the complete hyperbolic metric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the two-plectic geometry of the six-sphere induced by pulling back a canonical $G_2$-invariant three-form from $\mathbb{R}^7$ . Notably we explicitly prove non-flatness of this structure and show that its infinitesimal automorphisms are given by the exceptional Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}_2$. Several interesting classes of solutions of the dynamical Hamilton-de Donder-Weyl equations with one- and two-dimensional sources are exhibited.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we successfully establish a Courant-type nodal domain theorem for both the Dirichlet eigenvalue problem and the closed eigenvalue problem of the Witten-Laplacian. Moreover, we also characterize the properties of the nodal lines of the eigenfunctions of the Witten-Laplacian on smooth Riemannian $2$-manifolds. Besides, for a Riemann surface with genus $g$, an upper bound for the multiplicity of closed eigenvalues of the Witten-Laplacian can be provided.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find new estimates and a new asymptotic decoupling phenomenon for solutions to Hitchin's self-duality equations at high energy. These generalize previous results for generically regular semisimple Higgs bundles to arbitrary Higgs bundles. We apply our estimates to the Hitchin WKB problem and to high energy harmonic maps to symmetric spaces and buildings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the classes of holomorphic $p$-contact manifolds and holomorphic $s$-symplectic manifolds that generalise the classical holomorphic contact and holomorphic symplectic structures. After observing their basic properties and exhibiting a wide range of examples, we give three types of general conceptual results involving the former class of manifolds: structure theorems; hyperbolicity results; unobstructedness theorems, generalising to our context the classical Bogomolov-Tian-Todorov theorem, for two types of small deformations of complex structures that generalise the small essential deformations previously introduced for the Iwasawa manifold and for Calabi-Yau page-$1$-$\partial\bar\partial$-manifolds.</description>

      <title>Supervised Quadratic Feature Analysis: An Information Geometry Approach to Dimensionality Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supervised dimensionality reduction aims to map labeled data to a low-dimensional feature space while maximizing class discriminability. Despite the availability of methods for learning complex non-linear features (e.g. Deep Learning), there is an enduring demand for dimensionality reduction methods that learn linear features due to their interpretability, low computational cost, and broad applicability. However, there is a gap between methods that optimize linear separability (e.g. LDA), and more flexible but computationally expensive methods that optimize over arbitrary class boundaries (e.g. metric-learning methods). Here, we present Supervised Quadratic Feature Analysis (SQFA), a dimensionality reduction method for learning linear features that maximize the differences between class-conditional first- and second-order statistics, which allow for quadratic discrimination. SQFA exploits the information geometry of second-order statistics in the symmetric positive definite manifold. We show that SQFA features support quadratic discriminability in real-world problems. We also provide a theoretical link, based on information geometry, between SQFA and the Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) classifier.</description>

      <title>Semilinear wave equations on extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit global existence and decay for small-data solutions of semilinear wave equations on extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole backgrounds satisfying the classical null condition, a problem which was previously addressed by the first author in joint work with Aretakis and Gajic (Ann. of PDE, 2020). In this paper, we develop a new approach based on propagating a significantly weaker set of estimates, which allows for a simpler and more streamlined proof. Our proof does not require tracking sharp estimates for the solution in the near-horizon region, which means that it is compatible with, but does not imply, the non-decay and growth hierarchy of derivatives of the solution along the event horizon expected from the Aretakis instability. In particular, this approach is in principle compatible with other settings where stronger horizon instabilities are expected, such as nonlinear charged scalar fields on extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om, or nonlinear waves on extremal Kerr. We also sketch how our proof applies to semilinear problems on spacetimes settling down to extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om, such as those constructed in our joint work with Kehle (arXiv:2410.16234, 2024).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we introduce the notion of Floer function which has the property that the Hessian is a Fredholm operator of index zero in a scale of Hilbert spaces. Since the Hessian has a complicated transformation under chart transition, in general this is not an intrinsic condition. Therefore we introduce the concept of Floerfolds for which we show that the notion of Floer function is intrinsic.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Implementation of Edge-Based Discretization without Forming Dual Control Volumes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper shows that lumped directed-area vectors at edges and dual control volumes required to implement the edge-based discretization can be computed without explicitly defining the dual control volume around each node for triangular and tetrahedral grids. It is a simpler implementation because there is no need to form a dual control volume by connecting edge-midpoints, face centroids, and element centroids, and also reduces the time for computing lumped directed-area vectors for a given grid, especially for tetrahedral grids. The speed-up achieved by the proposed algorithm may not be large enough to greatly impact the overall simulation time, but the proposed algorithm is expected to serve as a major stepping stone towards extending the edge-based discretization to four dimensions and beyond (e.g., space-time simulations). Efficient algorithms for computing lumped directed-area vectors and dual volumes without forming dual volumes are presented, and their implementations are described and compared with traditional algorithms in terms of complexity as well as actual computing time for a given grid.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a quantitative isoperimetric inequality for the nearly spherical subset of the Bergman ball in $\mathbb{C}^n$. We prove the Fuglede theorem for such sets. This result is a counterpart of a similar result obtained for the hyperbolic unit ball and it makes the first result on the isoperimetric phenomenon in the Bergman ball.</description>

      <title>Fujita's conjectures and compactification of homology trivial complex manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Takao Fujita proposed in 1980 three closely related conjectures called $A_n$, $B_n$ and $C_n$, which relate the K\"{a}hler smooth compactification of contractible complex manifolds to the uniqueness of K\"{a}hler structure on cohomology complex projective spaces. Recently Peternell solved $A_n$ and $B_n$ when $n$ are even. In this note we push forward his arguments to show that the conjectures $A_n$ and $B_n$ are true when $n\neq3 \pmod{4}$. Moreover, the contractility condition can be weakened to homology triviality. A related application is given and some remarks are discussed.</description>

      <title>Nearly geodesic surfaces are filling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A surface $S$ in a manifold $M$ is filling if $M-S$ consists of contractible components. We prove for any closed hyperbolic $3$-manifold $M$, there exists an $\epsilon_0&gt;0$ such that every homotopy class of $(1+\epsilon)$-quasi-Fuchsian surfaces with $0&lt;\epsilon \leq \epsilon_0$ is filling. As a corollary, the set of embedded surfaces in $M$ satisfies a dichotomy: it consists of at most finitely many totally geodesic surfaces and surfaces with a quasi-Fuchsian constant lower bound $1+\epsilon_0$. Each of these nearly geodesic surfaces separates any pair of distinct points at the boundary of infinity of the universal cover. Crucial tools include the rigidity results of Mozes-Shah, Ratner, and Shah. This work is inspired by a question of Wu and Xue whether random geodesics on random hyperbolic surfaces are filling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study small eigenvalues of Toeplitz operators on polarized complex projective manifolds. For Toeplitz operators whose symbols are supported on proper subsets, we prove the existence of eigenvalues that decay exponentially with respect to the semiclassical parameter. We moreover, establish a connection between the logarithmic distribution of these eigenvalues and the Mabuchi geodesic between the fixed polarization and the Lebesgue envelope associated with the polarization and the non-zero set of the symbol. As an application of our approach, we also obtain analogous results for Toeplitz matrices.</description>

Abstract: We present numerical experiments that test the predictions of a conjecture of Gaiotto-Moore-Neitzke and Gaiotto concerning the monodromy map for opers, the nonabelian Hodge correspondence, and the restriction of Hitchin's hyperk\"ahler metric to the Hitchin section. These experiments are conducted in the setting of polynomial holomorphic differentials on the complex plane, where the predictions take the form of conjectural formulas for the Stokes data and the Hitchin metric tensor. Overall, the results of our experiments support the conjecture.</description>

      <title>Locally constrained flows and sharp Michael-Simon inequalities in hyperbolic space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.12582v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Brendle [6] successfully establishes the sharp Michael-Simon inequality for mean curvature on Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative sectional curvature ($\mathcal{K} \geq 0$), and the proof relies on the Alexandrov-Bakelman-Pucci method. Nevertheless, this result cannot be extended to hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^{n+1}$ ($\mathcal{K} = -1$), as demonstrated by Counterexample 1.7.
  In the present paper, we propose Conjectures 1.8 and 1.9 concerning the hyperbolic version of the sharp Michael-Simon type inequality for $k$-th mean curvatures. However, the proof method in \cite{B21} failed to verify the validity of these conjectures. Recently, the authors [12] proved Conjectures 1.8 and 1.9 only for $h$-convex hypersurfaces by means of the Brendle-Guan-Li's flow.
  This paper aims to utilize other types of curvature flows to prove Conjectures 1.8 and 1.9 for hypersurfaces with weaker convexity conditions. For $k = 1$, we first investigate a new locally constrained mean curvature flow (1.9) in $\mathbb{H}^{n+1}$ and prove its longtime existence and exponential convergence. Then, the sharp Michael-Simon type inequality for mean curvature of starshaped hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{H}^{n+1}$ is confirmed through the flow (1.9). For $k \geq 2$, the sharp Michael-Simon inequality for $k$-th mean curvatures of starshaped, strictly $k$-convex hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{H}^{n+1}$ is proven using the locally constrained inverse curvature flow (1.11) introduced by Scheuer and Xia [31].</description>

      <title>Weyl structures with special holonomy on compact conformal manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider compact conformal manifolds $(M,[g])$ endowed with a closed Weyl structure $\nabla$, i.e. a torsion-free connection preserving the conformal structure, which is locally but not globally the Levi-Civita connection of a metric in $[g]$. Our aim is to classify all such structures when both $\nabla$ and $\nabla^g$, the Levi-Civita connection of $g$, have special holonomy. In such a setting, $(M,[g],\nabla)$ is either flat, or irreducible, or carries a locally conformally product (LCP) structure. Since the flat case is already completely classified, we focus on the last two cases. When $\nabla$ has irreducible holonomy we prove that $(M,g)$ is either Vaisman, or a mapping torus of an isometry of a compact nearly K\"ahler or nearly parallel $\mathrm{G}_2$ manifold, while in the LCP case we prove that $g$ is neither K\"ahler nor Einstein, thus reducible by the Berger-Simons Theorem, and we obtain the local classification of such structures in terms of adapted metrics.</description>

      <title>Degenerate Umbilic Points of Analytic Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Umbilics are points of a surface embedded in three space where normal curvatures are independent of direction. The (in)famous Carath\'{e}odory Conjecture states that a compact simply connected embedded surface has at least two umbilic points. A counterexample to this conjecture would be a surface whose principal foliation has index two at a single umbilic. All (purported) proofs of the Carath\'{e}odory Conjecture are based on analyses of the index of an umbilic, concluding that it is at most one. This investigation gives a much simpler geometric argument that the index of an umbilic on an analytic surface cannot be an integer larger than one, providing new insight into the Carath\'{e}odory Conjecture. The results also establish lower bounds for the index of an umbilic based on its degeneracy.</description>

      <title>Plane wave limits of Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Utilizing the covariant formulation of Penrose's plane wave limit by Blau et al., we construct for any Riemannian metric $g$ a family of "plane wave limits" of one higher dimension. These limits are taken along geodesics of $g$, yield simpler metrics of Lorentzian signature, and are isometric invariants. They can also be seen to arise locally from a suitable expansion of $g$ in Fermi coordinates, and they directly encode much of $g$'s geometry. For example, normal Jacobi fields of $g$ are encoded as geodesics of its plane wave limits. Furthermore, $g$ will have constant sectional curvature if and only if each of its plane wave limits is locally conformally flat. In fact $g$ will be flat, or Ricci-flat, or geodesically complete, if and only if all of its plane wave limits are, respectively, the same. Many other curvature properties are preserved in the limit, including certain inequalities, such as signed Ricci curvature.</description>

      <title>The Z_2-valued spectral flow of a symmetric family of Toeplitz operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15534v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider families $A(t)$ of self-adjoint operators with symmetry that causes the spectral flow of the family to vanish. We study the secondary $\mathbb{Z}_2$-valued spectral flow of such families. We prove an analog of the Atiyah-Singer-Robbin-Salamon theorem, showing that this secondary spectral flow of $A(t)$ is equal to the secondary $\mathbb{Z}_2$-valued index of the suspension operator $\frac{d}{dt}+A(t)$.
  Applying this result, we show that the graded secondary spectral flow of a symmetric family of Toeplitz operators on a complete Riemannian manifold equals the secondary index of a certain Callias-type operator. In the case of a pseudo-convex domain, this leads to an odd version of the secondary Boutet de Monvel's index theorem for Toeplitz operators. When this domain is simply a unit disc in the complex plane, we recover the bulk-edge correspondence for the Graf-Porta module for 2D topological insulators of type AII.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a simplified (coarse) version of pseudo-differential calculus for operators of order zero on complete Riemannian manifolds. This calculus works for the usual Hormander (1,0) class of operators, as well as for pseudo-differential operators on filtered manifolds. In fact, we develop the coarse PDO calculus on a more general class of manifolds which we call manifolds with a tangent Lie structure. We prove an index theorem for `hypoelliptic' operators where the index is not just an integer, but an element of the K-homology group of the manifold.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the transfer of classical geometric structures to the Weil bundle $(M^\mathbf A, \tilde\pi_M, M)$ of a smooth manifold $M$ with respect to a Weil algebra $\mathbf A$. We show that by using a differential-geometric approach based on the pull-back map of the projection $\tilde\pi_M$, we can constructively induce on $M^\mathbf A$ all of $M$'s classical structures including lcs, lcc, contact, Jacobi, orientation, Riemannian, co-Kaehlerian, and Kaehlerian. Furthermore, we provide a novel and explicit example of a cosymplectic manifold that is not a suspension of a symplectic manifold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03949v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper establishes a sharp and rigid isoperimetric-type inequality in Lorentzian signature under the assumption of Ricci curvature bounded below in the timelike directions. The inequality is proved in the high generality of Lorentzian pre-length spaces satisfying timelike Ricci lower bounds in a synthetic sense via optimal transport, the so-called $\mathsf{TCD}^e_p(K,N)$ spaces. The results are new already for smooth Lorentzian manifolds. Applications include an upper bound on the area of achronal hypersurfaces inside the interior of a black hole (original already in Schwarzschild) and an upper bound on the area of achronal hypersurfaces in cosmological spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00575v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the setting of a proper, cocompact action by a locally compact, unimodular group $G$ on a Riemannian manifold, we construct equivariant spectral flow of paths of Dirac-type operators. This takes values in the $K$-theory of the group $C^*$-algebra of $G$. In the case where $G$ is the fundamental group of a compact manifold, the summation map maps equivariant spectral flow on the universal cover to classical spectral flow on the base manifold. We obtain "index equals spectral flow" results. In the setting of a smooth path of $G$-invariant Riemannian metrics on a $G$-spin manifold, we show that the equivariant spectral flow of the corresponding path of spin Dirac operators relates delocalised $\eta$-invariants and $\rho$-invariants for different positive scalar curvature metrics to each other.</description>

  Given an elastic surface $S$ made of $(k-1)$-beams under an equilibriated system $F$ of external forces, then we ask the following two questions:
  1. What are the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of an elastic body made of $k$-beams whose forces on the surface balance $F$ and whose surfaces consist of $S$.
  2. What is an optimal design so that the total cost is a minimum?
  We've solved the existence question completely; and research is still in progress for the minimal question. In particular when $k=1$, it involves a system of beams joining a given finite collection of pointed forces. It was first introduced by A. Michell in 1904, then used in mechanical engineering, and recently popularized in many pure mathematics works by W. Gangbo, Prager, and others. Here we are going to generalize them to higher dimensional cases. We have already found the minimal solutions in terms of the flat chain complex and vector-valued currents. Right now we are studying the Calibration theory for future directions. I appreciate the discussion with Prof. Robert Hardt!</description>

      <title>Difference Equations: from Berry Connections to the Coulomb Branch</title>

Abstract: In recent work, we demonstrated that a spectral variety for the Berry connection of a 2d $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ GLSM with K\"ahler vacuum moduli space $X$ and abelian flavour symmetry is the support of a sheaf induced by a certain action on the equivariant quantum cohomology of $X$. This action could be quantised to first-order matrix difference equations obeyed by brane amplitudes, and by taking the conformal limit, vortex partition functions. In this article, we elucidate how some of these results may be recovered from a 3d perspective, by placing the 2d theory at a boundary and gauging the flavour symmetry via a bulk A-twisted 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ gauge theory (a sandwich construction). We interpret the above action as that of the bulk Coulomb branch algebra on boundary twisted chiral operators. This relates our work to recent constructions of actions of Coulomb branch algebras on quantum equivariant cohomology, providing a novel correspondence between these actions and spectral data of generalised periodic monopoles. The effective IR description of the 2d theory in terms of a twisted superpotential allows for explicit computations of these actions, which we demonstrate for abelian GLSMs.</description>

      <title>Conformal transformations and equivariance in unbounded KK-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend unbounded Kasparov theory to encompass conformal group and quantum group equivariance. This new framework allows us to treat conformal actions on both manifolds and noncommutative spaces. As examples, we present unbounded representatives of Kasparov's $\gamma$-element for the real and complex Lorentz groups and display the conformal $SL_q(2)$-equivariance of the standard spectral triple of the Podle\'s sphere. In pursuing descent for conformally equivariant cycles, we are led to a new framework for representing Kasparov classes. Our new representatives are unbounded, possess a dynamical quality, and also include known twisted spectral triples. We define an equivalence relation on these new representatives whose classes form an abelian group surjecting onto KK. The technical innovation which underpins these results is a novel multiplicative perturbation theory. By these means, we obtain Kasparov classes from the bounded transform with minimal side conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19949v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We relate the recently defined spectral torsion with the algebraic torsion of noncommutative differential calculi on the example of the almost-commutative geometry of the product of a closed oriented Riemannian spin manifold $M$ with the two-point space $\mathcal Z_2$.</description>
