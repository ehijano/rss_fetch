      <title>Word2VecGD: Neural Graph Drawing with Cosine-Stress Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel graph visualization method leveraging random walk-based embeddings to replace costly graph-theoretical distance computations. Using word2vec-inspired embeddings, our approach captures both structural and semantic relationships efficiently. Instead of relying on exact shortest-path distances, we optimize layouts using cosine dissimilarities, significantly reducing computational overhead. Our framework integrates differentiable stress optimization with stochastic gradient descent (SGD), supporting multi-criteria layout objectives. Experimental results demonstrate that our method produces high-quality, semantically meaningful layouts while efficiently scaling to large graphs.

      <title>A note on non-crossing path partitions in the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper ``Lower bounds on the number of crossing-free subgraphs of $K_N$'' (Computational Geometry 16 (2000), 211-221), it is shown that a double chain of $n$ points in the plane admits at least $\Omega(4.642126305^n)$ polygonizations, and it is claimed that it admits at most $O(5.61^n)$ polygonizations. In this note, we provide a proof of this last result. The proof is based on counting non-crossing path partitions for points in the plane in convex position, where a non-crossing path partition consists of a set of paths connecting the points such that no two edges cross and isolated points are allowed.
  We prove that a set of $n$ points in the plane in convex position admits $\mathcal{O}^*(5.610718614^{n})$ non-crossing path partitions and a double chain of $n$ points in the plane admits at least $\Omega(7.164102920^n)$ non-crossing path partitions. If isolated points are not allowed, we also show that there are $\mathcal{O}^*(4.610718614^n)$ non-crossing path partitions for $n$ points in the plane in convex position and at least $\Omega(6.164492582^n)$ non-crossing path partitions in a double chain of $n$ points in the plane. In addition, using a particular family of non-crossing path partitions for points in convex position, we provide an alternative proof for the result that a double chain of $n$ points admits at least $\Omega(4.642126305^n)$ polygonizations.</description>

      <title>Distance Approximating Minors for Planar and Minor-Free Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given an edge-weighted graph $G$ and a subset of vertices $T$ called terminals, an $\alpha$-distance-approximating minor ($\alpha$-DAM) of $G$ is a graph minor $H$ of $G$ that contains all terminals, such that the distance between every pair of terminals is preserved up to a factor of $\alpha$. Distance-approximating minor would be an effective distance-sketching structure on minor-closed family of graphs; in the constant-stretch regime it generalizes the well-known Steiner Point Removal problem by allowing the existence of (a small number of) non-terminal vertices. Unfortunately, in the $(1+\varepsilon)$ regime the only known DAM construction for planar graphs relies on overlaying $\tilde{O}_\varepsilon(|T|)$ shortest paths in $G$, which naturally leads to a quadratic bound in the number of terminals [Cheung, Goranci, and Henzinger, ICALP 2016].
  We break the quadratic barrier and build the first $(1+\varepsilon)$-distance-approximating minor for $k$-terminal planar graphs and minor-free graphs of near-linear size $\tilde{O}_\varepsilon(k)$. In addition to the near-optimality in size, the construction relies only on the existence of shortest-path separators [Abraham and Gavoille, PODC 2006] and $\varepsilon$-covers [Thorup, J.\ ACM 2004]. Consequently, this provides an alternative and simpler construction to the near-linear-size emulator for planar graphs [Chang, Krauthgamer, and Tan, STOC 2022], as well as the first near-linear-size emulator for minor-free graphs. Our DAM can be constructed in near-linear time.</description>

      <title>Minimizing an Uncrossed Collection of Drawings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.09550v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the following new concept in graph drawing. Our task is to find a small collection of drawings such that they all together satisfy some property that is useful for graph visualization. We propose investigating a property where each edge is not crossed in at least one drawing in the collection. We call such collection uncrossed. This property is motivated by a quintessential problem of the crossing number, where one asks for a drawing where the number of edge crossings is minimum. Indeed, if we are allowed to visualize only one drawing, then the one which minimizes the number of crossings is probably the neatest for the first orientation. However, a collection of drawings where each highlights a different aspect of a graph without any crossings could shed even more light on the graph's structure.
  We propose two definitions. First, the uncrossed number, minimizes the number of graph drawings in a collection, satisfying the uncrossed property. Second, the uncrossed crossing number, minimizes the total number of crossings in the collection that satisfy the uncrossed property. For both definitions, we establish initial results. We prove that the uncrossed crossing number is NP-hard, but there is an FPT algorithm parameterized by the solution size.</description>

      <title>Fast Approximation Algorithms for Euclidean Minimum Weight Perfect Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07749v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Euclidean minimum weight perfect matching problem for $n$ points in the plane. It is known that any deterministic approximation algorithm whose approximation ratio depends only on $n$ requires at least $\Omega(n \log n)$ time. We propose such an algorithm for the Euclidean minimum weight perfect matching problem with runtime $O(n\log n)$ and show that it has approximation ratio $O(n^{0.206})$. This improves the so far best known approximation ratio of $n/2$. We also develop an $O(n \log n)$ algorithm for the Euclidean minimum weight perfect matching problem in higher dimensions and show it has approximation ratio $O(n^{0.412})$ in all fixed dimensions.</description>

      <title>VF-Plan: Bridging the Art Gallery Problem and Static LiDAR Scanning with Visibility Field Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01562v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Viewpoint planning is critical for efficient 3D data acquisition in applications such as 3D reconstruction, building life-cycle management, navigation, and interior decoration. However, existing methods often neglect key optimization objectives specific to static LiDAR systems, resulting in redundant or disconnected viewpoint networks. The viewpoint planning problem (VPP) extends the classical Art Gallery Problem (AGP) by requiring full coverage, strong registrability, and coherent network connectivity under constrained sensor capabilities. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel Visibility Field (VF) that accurately captures the directional and range-dependent visibility properties of static LiDAR scanners. We further observe that visibility information naturally converges onto a 1D skeleton embedded in the 2D space, enabling significant searching space reduction. Leveraging these insights, we develop a greedy optimization algorithm tailored to the VPP, which constructs a minimal yet fully connected Viewpoint Network (VPN) with low redundancy. Experimental evaluations across diverse indoor and outdoor scenarios confirm the scalability and robustness of our method. Compared to expert-designed VPNs and existing state-of-the-art approaches, our algorithm achieves comparable or fewer viewpoints while significantly enhancing connectivity. In particular, it reduces the weighted average path length by approximately 95%, demonstrating substantial improvements in compactness and structural efficiency.

      <title>Cover Learning for Large-Scale Topology Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical unsupervised learning methods like clustering and linear dimensionality reduction parametrize large-scale geometry when it is discrete or linear, while more modern methods from manifold learning find low dimensional representation or infer local geometry by constructing a graph on the input data. More recently, topological data analysis popularized the use of simplicial complexes to represent data topology with two main methodologies: topological inference with geometric complexes and large-scale topology visualization with Mapper graphs -- central to these is the nerve construction from topology, which builds a simplicial complex given a cover of a space by subsets. While successful, these have limitations: geometric complexes scale poorly with data size, and Mapper graphs can be hard to tune and only contain low dimensional information. In this paper, we propose to study the problem of learning covers in its own right, and from the perspective of optimization. We describe a method for learning topologically-faithful covers of geometric datasets, and show that the simplicial complexes thus obtained can outperform standard topological inference approaches in terms of size, and Mapper-type algorithms in terms of representation of large-scale topology.</description>

      <title>The Stamp Folding Problem From a Mountain-Valley Perspective: Enumerations and Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A strip of square stamps can be folded in many ways such that all of the stamps are stacked in a single pile in the folded state. The stamp folding problem asks for the number of such foldings and has previously been studied extensively. We consider this problem with the additional restriction of fixing the mountain-valley assignment of each crease in the stamp pattern. We provide a closed form for counting the number of legal foldings on specific patterns of mountain-valley assignments, including a surprising appearance of the Catalan numbers. We construct upper and lower bounds for the number of ways to fold a given mountain-valley assignment on the strip of stamps. Lastly, we provide experimental evidence towards more general results.</description>

      <title>Vietoris--Rips Shadow for Euclidean Graph Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The shadow of an abstract simplicial complex $K$ with vertices in $\mathbb{R}^N$ is a subset of $\mathbb{R}^N$ defined as the union of the convex hulls of simplices of $K$. The Vietoris--Rips complex of a metric space $(S,d)$ at scale $\beta$ is an abstract simplicial complex whose each $k$-simplex corresponds to $(k+1)$ points of $S$ within diameter $\beta$. In case $S\subset\mathbb R^2$ and $d(a,b)=\|a-b\|$ the standard Euclidean metric, the natural shadow projection of the Vietoris--Rips complex is already proved by Chambers et al. to induce isomorphisms on $\pi_0$ and $\pi_1$. We extend the result beyond the standard Euclidean distance on $S\subset\mathbb R^N$ to a family of path-based metrics, $d^\varepsilon_{S}$. From the pairwise Euclidean distances of points in $S$, we introduce a family (parametrized by $\varepsilon$) of path-based Vietoris--Rips complexes $R^\varepsilon_\beta(S)$ for a scale $\beta&gt;0$. If $S\subset\mathbb{R}^2$ is Hausdorff-close to a planar Euclidean graph $G$, we provide quantitative bounds on scales $\beta,\varepsilon$ for the shadow projection map of the Vietoris--Rips complex of $(S,d^\varepsilon_S)$ at scale $\beta$ to induce $\pi_1$-isomorphism. This paper first studies the homotopy-type recovery of $G\subset\mathbb R^N$ using the abstract Vietoris--Rips complex of a Hausdorff-close sample $S$ under the $d^\varepsilon_S$ metric. Then, our result on the $\pi_1$-isomorphism induced by the shadow projection lends itself to providing also a geometrically close embedding for the reconstruction. Based on the length of the shortest loop and large-scale distortion of the embedding of $G$, we quantify the choice of a suitable sample density $\varepsilon$ and a scale $\beta$ at which the shadow of $R^\varepsilon_\beta(S)$ is homotopy-equivalent and Hausdorff-close to $G$.</description>

      <title>PyKirigami: An interactive Python simulator for kirigami metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the concept of kirigami has been used in creating deployable structures for various scientific and technological applications. While the design of kirigami metamaterials has been widely studied, the simulation of the deployment and shape transformation process is less explored. In this work, we develop PyKirigami, an efficient Python-based open-source computational tool for the deployment simulation of kirigami metamaterials. In particular, our tool is capable of simulating both two- and three-dimensional deployments of a large variety of kirigami metamaterials with different geometric, topological, and physical properties. The tool is also highly interactive and customizable, allowing the user to perform deployment simulations of kirigami structures under different environmental setups and material properties. Altogether, our work paves a new way for the modelling and design of shape-morphing mechanical metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Accurate and Complete Surface Reconstruction from 3D Gaussians via Direct SDF Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for photorealistic view synthesis, representing scenes with spatially distributed Gaussian primitives. While highly effective for rendering, achieving accurate and complete surface reconstruction remains challenging due to the unstructured nature of the representation and the absence of explicit geometric supervision. In this work, we propose DiGS, a unified framework that embeds Signed Distance Field (SDF) learning directly into the 3DGS pipeline, thereby enforcing strong and interpretable surface priors. By associating each Gaussian with a learnable SDF value, DiGS explicitly aligns primitives with underlying geometry and improves cross-view consistency. To further ensure dense and coherent coverage, we design a geometry-guided grid growth strategy that adaptively distributes Gaussians along geometry-consistent regions under a multi-scale hierarchy. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, including DTU, Mip-NeRF 360, and Tanks&amp; Temples, demonstrate that DiGS consistently improves reconstruction accuracy and completeness while retaining high rendering fidelity.</description>
