      <title>Revisiting Seismicity Criticality: A New Framework for Bias Correction of Statistical Seismology Model Calibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Epidemic-Type Aftershock Sequences (ETAS) model and its variants effectively capture the space-time clustering of seismicity, setting the standard for earthquake forecasting. Accurate unbiased ETAS calibration is thus crucial. But we identify three sources of bias, (i) boundary effects, (ii) finite-size effects, and (iii) censorship, which are often overlooked or misinterpreted, causing errors in seismic analysis and predictions. By employing an ETAS model variant with variable spatial background rates, we propose a method to correct for these biases, focusing on the branching ratio n, a key indicator of earthquake triggering potential. Our approach quantifies the variation in the apparent branching ratio (napp) with increased cut-off magnitude (Mco) above the optimal cut-off (Mcobest). The napp(Mco) function yields insights superior to traditional point estimates. We validate our method using synthetic earthquake catalogs, accurately recovering the true branching ratio (ntrue) after correcting biases with napp(Mco). Additionally, our method introduces a refined estimation of the minimum triggering magnitude (m0), a crucial parameter in the ETAS model. Applying our framework to the earthquake catalogs of California, New Zealand, and the China Seismic Experimental Site (CSES) in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces, we find that seismicity hovers away from the critical point, nc = 1, remaining distinctly subcritical, however with values tending to be larger than recent reports that do not consider the above biases. It is interesting that, m0 is found around 4 for California, 3 for New Zealand and 2 for CSES, suggesting that many small triggered earthquakes may not be fertile. Understanding seismicity's critical state significantly enhances our comprehension of seismic patterns, aftershock predictability, and informs earthquake risk mitigation and management strategies.</description>

      <title>Estimating Earthquake Early Warning Effectiveness via Blind Zone Sizes: A Case Study of the Planned Seismic Network in Chinese Mainland</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.00198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.00198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The China Earthquake Administration (CEA) has launched an ambitious nationwide earthquake early warning (EEW) system project currently under development, which will include approximately 15,000 seismic stations and be the largest EEW system in the world. The new EEW system is planned to go online at the end of 2023. In approximately 50%, 30% and 20% of Chinese mainland, the inter-station distance will soon be smaller than 50 km, 25 km and 15 km, respectively. The expected effectiveness of this EEW system can be quantified via the metric determined from the radius of the blind zone, which refers to the area near the epicenter where there is insufficient time to issue a warning before the arrival of strong S- and surface waves. This study uses a theoretical network-based method together with Monte Carlo simulation to obtain the spatial distribution of the blind zone radii and their associated uncertainties for the new seismic network based on its configuration. We find that the densified new seismic network is expected to have excellent EEW performance as the area covered by small blind zones with radius less than 30 km increases dramatically from approximately 2% to 22%, that is by 2.4 million km2 inside Chinese mainland. We also find that every 1,000,000 RMB (about 146,000 USD) invested to densify the planned network will lead to an areal increase of 3,000 km2 of small blind zones. Continuing to increase the density of stations in some key regions with blind zone radii ranging from 15 to 40 km is still necessary to control the unexpected expansion of blind zones due to possible (and common) stations failure. Our work provides insights into the expected performance of the upcoming EEW network in Chinese mainland, and our proposed evaluation approach is broadly applicable for predicting the performance of EEW systems during their planning, design, and implementation stages.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Study of Large-Scale Data-Driven Full Waveform Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of big data on deep learning models to help solve the full waveform inversion (FWI) problem. While it is well known that big data can boost the performance of deep learning models in many tasks, its effectiveness has not been validated for FWI. To address this gap, we present an empirical study that investigates how deep learning models in FWI behave when trained on OpenFWI, a collection of large-scale, multi-structural, synthetic datasets published recently. In particular, we train and evaluate the FWI models on a combination of 10 2D subsets in OpenFWI that contain 470K pairs of seismic data and velocity maps in total. Our experiments demonstrate that training on the combined dataset yields an average improvement of 13.03% in MAE, 7.19% in MSE and 1.87% in SSIM compared to each split dataset, and an average improvement of 28.60%, 21.55% and 8.22% in the leave-one-out generalization test. We further demonstrate that model capacity needs to scale in accordance with data size for optimal improvement, where our largest model yields an average improvement of 20.06%, 13.39% and 0.72% compared to the smallest one.</description>

      <title>Fingering convection in a spherical shell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use 123 three dimensional direct numerical simulations to study fingering convection in non-rotating spherical shells. We investigate the scaling behaviour of the flow lengthscale, the non-dimensional heat and compositional fluxes $Nu$ and $Sh$ and the mean convective velocity over the fingering convection instability domain defined by $1 \leq R_\rho &lt; Le$, $R_\rho$ being the ratio of density perturbations of thermal and compositional origins and $Le$ the Lewis number. We show that the chemical boundary layers are marginally unstable and adhere to the laminar Prandtl-Blasius model, hence explaining the asymmetry between the inner and outer spherical shell boundary layers. We develop scaling laws for two asymptotic regimes close to the two edges of the instability domain, namely $R_\rho \lesssim Le$ and $R_\rho \gtrsim 1$. For the former, we develop novel power laws of a small parameter $\epsilon$ measuring the distance to onset, which differ from theoretical laws published to date in Cartesian geometry. For the latter, we find that the Sherwood number $Sh$ gradually approaches a scaling $Sh\sim Ra_\xi^{1/3}$ when $Ra_\xi \gg 1$; and that the P\'eclet number accordingly follows $Pe \sim Ra_\xi^{2/3} |Ra_T|^{-1/4}$, $Ra_\xi$ being the chemical Rayleigh number. When the Reynolds number exceeds a few tens, we report on a secondary instability which takes the form of large-scale toroidal jets which span the entire spherical domain. Jets distort the fingers resulting in Reynolds stress correlations, which in turn feed the jet growth until saturation. This nonlinear phenomenon can yield relaxation oscillation cycles.</description>
