      <title>Translating Dietary Standards into Healthy Meals with Minimal Substitutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An important goal for personalized diet systems is to improve nutritional quality without compromising convenience or affordability. We present an end-to-end framework that converts dietary standards into complete meals with minimal change. Using the What We Eat in America (WWEIA) intake data for 135,491 meals, we identify 34 interpretable meal archetypes that we then use to condition a generative model and a portion predictor to meet USDA nutritional targets. In comparisons within archetypes, generated meals are better at following recommended daily intake (RDI) targets by 47.0%, while remaining compositionally close to real meals. Our results show that by allowing one to three food substitutions, we were able to create meals that were 10% more nutritious, while reducing costs 19-32%, on average. By turning dietary guidelines into realistic, budget-aware meals and simple swaps, this framework can underpin clinical decision support, public-health programs, and consumer apps that deliver scalable, equitable improvements in everyday nutrition.</description>

      <title>Biological Engineering: What does it mean? Where does it (need to) go?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biological engineering, the convergence between engineering and biology, is at the forefront of significant advances in healthcare, agriculture, and environmental sustainability, making it highly relevant to current scientific and societal challenges. We take a comprehensive look at this broad and interdisciplinary domain, structure it into three main areas - bioinspired, biological and biohybrid approaches - and dissect inherent and fundamental challenges along with opportunities, highlighting specific examples. We describe how data-driven discovery and design, in conjunction with artificial intelligence, can mitigate the absence of reductionist models in these areas. Additionally, we address the education of a new generation of biological engineers, emphasizing mathematical, technical, and artificial intelligence frameworks.</description>

      <title>Theoretical morphology of a cichlid according to the approach of Systemic Morphometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyzed the body structure of the Blackstripe Cichlid Vieja fenestrata (G\"unther, 1860), a species with highly phenotypic variability, by the Systemics Morphometrics Methodology, previously proposed by one of the authors. From this perspective and considering the properties of its bauplan, we describe the expected morphometrics variability of this species. The Infinitesimal Change Rates (IChR) were obtained deriving the allometric equations that relate pairs of morphometric variables, and they demonstrated that the species' growth is continuous throughout its ontogeny. For some of the morphometric variables, relative growth trajectories were traced and their relationship with the IChR showed. Also, the observed and theoretical Systemic Phenotypical Spaces (SPS) were described by using three dimensional graphs and Mahalanobis Quadratic Distances (MQD). This was an alternate approach that allowed the analysis of the phenotypical spaces' properties in a wider, more objective, and analytical manner. We conclude that the morphometric variability observed in V. fenestrata agrees with the variability expected in the times and places sampled, although there are still some issues to be explained. We propose to incorporate the structural variance into the classical phenotypic variance equation, and consider the equality: phenotypic variance = SPS theoretical, (the phenotypic variance is equal to the theoretical Systemic Phenotypic Space), as a point of convergence between Quantitative Genetics and Systemic Morphometry.</description>
