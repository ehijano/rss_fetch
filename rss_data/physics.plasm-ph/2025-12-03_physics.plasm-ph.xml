      <title>A novel method for thermal noise reduction, enabling measurements of broadband, low-amplitude electron temperature fluctuations using individual radiometer channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new analysis method has been developed for measurements of broadband, low-amplitude turbulent electron temperature fluctuations in fusion plasmas using individual radiometer channels of a Correlation Electron Cyclotron Emission (CECE) diagnostic. This method takes advantage of differences in the correlation time of thermal noise compared to the correlation time of plasma fluctuations in fusion reactors. The validation of this single-channel method is demonstrated using comparisons with the standard dual-channel radiometer spectral decorrelation method for measurements of turbulent electron temperature fluctuations in the core and edge of low confinement (L), improved confinement (I), and high confinement (H)-mode plasmas at the ASDEX Upgrade tokamak.</description>

      <title>Integrated Sliding-Short/Probe Tuner with Doorknob Transition for High-Q Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an integrated three-knob tuner that internalizes impedance matching inside the launch adapter of a waveguide-fed, high-$Q$ cavity. The tuner combines a waveguide sliding short, a doorknob transition, and a micrometer-driven adjustable coaxial probe. A transmission-line/ABCD model is derived that maps the three mechanical degrees of freedom to the electrical objectives $\Gamma \rightarrow 0$, $\beta$, and $Q_{\rm L}$, explicitly including the fused-silica feedthrough capacitance. The model yields closed-form matching conditions and predicts the critical-coupling set. Full-wave FEM simulations and bench measurements validate the approach: with $h \approx 0.55$~mm and backshort distance $\approx 0.80$~mm, the return loss reaches $|S_{11}| \approx -30$~dB near 17.8--18.1~GHz while sustaining peak electric fields of $\sim 1.8 \times 10^5$~V/m at the nozzle (normalized to 1~W). The measured through loss of the launch assembly is $|S_{21}| \approx 0.7$--$0.8$~dB at resonance.
  A parametric study shows that backshort lengths $L_{\rm {bs}} \geq 0.5 \lambda_{\rm g}$ excite a parasitic stub resonance, introducing a second $S_{11}$ minimum and localizing energy behind the doorknob; keeping $L_{\rm {bs}} \leq 0.4 \lambda_g$ avoids this. In helium plasma discharges at $P_{\rm {in}} = 10$~W, \textit{in-situ} retuning of the short and probe maintained a favorable match as the plasma impedance evolved, increasing absorbed power from $\sim 43\%$ to $\sim 76\%$ while increasing helium propellant flow rate from 25 to 351~sccm. The compact tuner eliminates external stub boxes and generalizes to other waveguide-coupled resonators and plasma sources.</description>

      <title>Laser-driven electrodynamic implosion of fast ions in a thin shell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collision of laser-driven subrelativistic high density ion flows provides a way to create extremely compressed ion conglomerates and study their properties. This paper presents a theoretical study of the electrodynamic implosion of ions inside a hollow spherical or cylindrical shell irradiated by femtosecond petawatt laser pulses. We propose to apply a very effective mechanism for ion acceleration in a selfconsistent field with strong charge separation, based on the oscillation of laser accelerated fast electrons in this field near the thin shell. Fast electrons are generated on the outer side of the shell under irradiation by the intense laser pulses. It is shown that ions, in particular protons, may be accelerated at the implosion stage to energies of tens and hundreds of MeV when a sub-micrometer shell is irradiated by femtosecond laser pulses with an intensity of 10^21 - 10^23 W cm^-2. .</description>

      <title>Progress in relativistic laser-plasma interaction with kilotesla-level applied magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on progress in the understanding of the effects of kilotesla-level applied magnetic fields on relativistic laser-plasma interactions. Ongoing advances in magnetic-field-generation techniques enable new and highly desirable phenomena, including magnetic-field-amplification platforms with reversible sign, focusing ion acceleration, and bulk-relativistic plasma heating. Building on recent advancements in laser-plasma interactions with applied magnetic fields, we introduce simple models for evaluating the effects of applied magnetic fields in magnetic-field amplification, sheath-based ion acceleration, and direct laser acceleration. These models indicate the feasibility of observing beneficial magnetic-field effects under experimentally relevant conditions and offer a starting point for future experimental design.</description>

      <title>Qubit Lattice Algorithm Simulations of the Scattering of a Bounded Two Dimensional Electromagnetic Pulse from an Infinite Planar Dielectric Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Qubit lattice algorithm (QLA) simulations are performed for a two-dimensional (2D) spatially bounded pulse propagating onto a plane interface between two dielectric slabs. QLA is an initial value scheme that consists of a sequence of unitary collision and streaming operators, with appropriate potential operators, that recover Maxwell equations in inhomogeneous dielectric media to second order in the lattice discreteness. For the case of total internal reflection, there is transient energy transfer into the second medium due to the evanescent fields as the Poynting unit vector of the pulse is rotated from its incident to reflected direction. Because of the finite spatial extent of the pulse, a self-consistent Goos-Hanchen-type displacement along the interface is found without imposing any explicit interface boundary conditions on the fields. For normal incidence. the standard Fresnel coefficients are recovered for appropriately averaged QLA fields. Energy is conserved at all times to seven significant figures.</description>

      <title>Dynamo and Jet interconnections in GRMHD simulations of black hole accretion disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present global 3D GRMHD simulations of black hole (BH) accretion disks designed to investigate how MRI-driven dynamo action regulates jet formation and evolution. Unlike standard SANE/MAD setups that impose a coherent large-scale poloidal loop, our "sub-SANE" initial conditions use multiple same-polarity small-scale magnetic loops. Rapid reconnection erases magnetic memory and enables large-scale dynamo to emerge early from MRI turbulence. We perform two such sub-SANE simulations at different BH spins ($a = 0.5, 0.9375$) and compare them with conventional SANE runs. The sub-SANE disks show regular large-scale dynamo cycles with periods of about ten orbits. Decomposition of the induction equation shows that the turbulent dynamo term is stronger in 3D compared to 2.5D and balances advection in the saturated state, confirming sustained large-scale field generation. These dynamo-generated fields are advected inward with minimal time lag, producing correlated peaks in both poloidal and toroidal field strengths from $r_{\rm max}$ to the horizon. Early in the evolution, these peaks imprint directly onto the jet's electromagnetic energy flux, indicating that the jet mirrors the dynamo wave. Though jets form at early times, the sub-SANE runs eventually undergo jet shutdown. We show that this occurs when the magnetic field at the horizon loses coherence, as quantified by a decline in the signed-to-unsigned flux ratio $\mathcal{C}_{\rm BH}$ below $\approx 0.6$. In contrast, the SANE reference case with similar accretion rate and horizon magnetic flux maintains high magnetic coherence because its initial large-scale field persists, allowing its jet to survive. Our results show that both dynamo-driven field evolution and horizon magnetic-field coherence critically regulate jet longevity, establishing a direct dynamo-jet connection in GRMHD disks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a three-dimensional numerical model of a solitary spherically polarized Alfv\'en wave packet -- an Alfv\'enon, characterized by open field-line topology and magnetic field reversals, resembling the switchbacks observed by Parker Solar Probe to be a nearly ubiquitous feature of turbulence in the inner heliosphere. Direct magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the constructed Alfv\'enon demonstrates remarkable stability, confirming its nature as an exact, nonlinear solution of the ideal MHD equations.</description>

      <title>Computational Model for Photoionization in Pure SF6 Streamer at 1-15 atm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photoionization plays a crucial role in achieving accurate quantitative predictions in SF6 streamer simulations, but accurate models for SF6 photoionization remains limited, motivating this paper. First, we develop a computational model for SF6 photoionization and provide the detailed theoretical modeling process, as well as comparison between experiment and simulation. A concise summary of model parameters within the comprehensive pressure range of 1 - 15 atm is provided for direct reference. Then, we perform comparative studies against simplified approaches. The results demonstrate that the proposed model effectively captures the non-local effects of SF6 photoionization, enhancing both the spatial numerical convergence and the accuracy of the streamer structure. Finally, we perform comparative studies by artificially increasing the photoionization intensity through multiplying the photoionization source term Sph by a factor of 50 (50*Sph) relative to the baseline intensity. Regarding breakdown voltage prediction, 50*Sph leads to a significant underestimation of the breakdown voltage for positive streamers, introducing errors greater than 0.5 kV, while exerting a small impact on negative streamers. Regarding streamer propagation dynamics, the radius of the positive streamer head exhibits pronounced shrinking, and 50*Sph reduces this shrinking and significantly lowers the head field by more than 700 Td. In contrast, 50*Sph has little impact on the morphology of the negative streamers and slightly enhances the head field by less than 30 Td.</description>

      <title>Tailored Three Dimensional Betatron Dynamics in UltraStable Hybrid Laser Plasma RF Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detailed theoretical and numerical investigation of hybrid laser plasma RF accelerators, elucidating the mechanisms governing transverse beam dynamics, betatron polarization, and radiation reaction in ultra-relativistic electron bunches is presented. This framework combines analytical models of spatiotemporal plasma wakefield modulation, phase-dependent RF-driven oscillations, and quantum-corrected Landau Lifshitz radiation reaction with fully self-consistent 3D particle in cell simulations using EPOCH. The results demonstrate that RF amplitude, frequency, and phase enable precise control over transverse focusing strengths, betatron oscillation amplitudes, and polarization states. Resonant alignment between RF fields and natural betatron frequencies amplifies transverse excursions while damping parasitic oscillations through enhanced focusing gradients and radiation reaction, yielding reductions in emittance and mitigation of synchrotron-like energy losses. Stability maps and 3D force landscapes reveal strong phase sensitivity, where initial conditions and RF component ratios govern the temporal evolution of betatron amplitudes, and longitudinal field gradients modulate {\gamma} growth rates. These findings provide a comprehensive picture of nonlinear, resonant, and damping phenomena in hybrid laser plasma RF systems, highlighting the full spectrum of controllable transverse, longitudinal, and polarization dynamics in ultra relativistic electron beams.</description>

      <title>Impact of magnetic field gradients on the development of the MRI: Applications to binary neutron star mergers and proto-planetary disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The magneto-rotational instability (MRI) is widely believed to play a central role in generating large-scale, poloidal magnetic fields during binary neutron star mergers. However, the few simulations that begin with a weak seed magnetic field and capture its growth until saturation predominantly show the effects of small-scale turbulence and winding, but lack convincing evidence of MRI activity. In this work, we investigate how the MRI is affected by the complex magnetic field topologies characteristic of the post-merger phase, aiming to assess the actual feasibility of MRI in such environments. We first derive the MRI instability criterion, as well as expressions for the characteristic wavelength and growth timescale of the fastest-growing modes, under conditions that include significant magnetic field gradients. Our analysis reveals that strong radial magnetic field gradients can impact significantly on the MRI, slowing its growth or suppressing it entirely if large enough. We then apply this extended framework to both idealized analytical disk models and data from a numerical relativity simulation of a long-lived neutron star merger remnant. We find that conditions favourable to MRI growth on astrophysically relevant timescales may occur only in limited regions of the post-merger disk, and only at late times $t\gtrsim 100$ ms after the merger. These results suggest that the MRI plays a limited role in amplifying poloidal magnetic fields in post-merger environments during the first $\mathcal{O}(100)$ms.</description>

      <title>Modeling formation and transport of clusters at high temperature and pressure gradients by implying partial chemical equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A theoretical approach to describing transport of an entire ensemble of clusters with different sizes as a single species in gas has been developed. The major assumption is an existence of local partial chemical equilibrium between the clusters. It is shown that thermal diffusion emerges in the collective description as a significant factor even if it is negligible when transport of the original molecular species is considered. Analytical expressions for the effective diffusion and thermal diffusion coefficients at temperature, pressure, and chemical composition gradients have been derived. The theory has been applied to a technology of H2S conversion in a centrifugal plasma-chemical reactor and has made it possible to account for sulfur clusters in numerical process modeling.</description>
