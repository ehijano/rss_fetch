      <title>Access models, authorship patterns, and citation impact in Ukrainian scholarly publishing (2020-2023)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aimed to explore the relationship between access models, authorship patterns, and citation impact in Ukrainian research output from 2020 to 2023. The focus was on scholars affiliated with the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine (NASU) and universities. Findings highlight that open access (OA) articles constituted the majority of publications by Ukrainian scholars during this period. This percentage reached 75.4% for NASU and 85.8% for universities. In both cases, the increase was driven by Gold OA and Hybrid Gold OA, the latter benefiting in part from Elsevier's waivers. Diamond OA prevailed for NASU, while Gold OA was dominant for universities. The effects of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine included (1) a decline in the share of articles in foreign journals for both NASU and universities, (2) a decrease in Gold OA in foreign journals and an increase in Gold OA in Ukrainian journals for universities, and (3) a rise in internationally co-authored Gold OA articles in foreign journals for both entities. Despite waivers for Gold OA provided by major publishers and an increase in Gold OA articles in Elsevier and Springer journals, MDPI and Aluna Publishing House remained the dominant publishers of Gold OA in foreign journals. Hybrid Gold OA, Bronze OA, and Green OA articles in foreign journals had the highest citation impact. The citation impact of Gold OA outperformed Diamond OA. The study confirms the growing dominance of Gold OA, suggesting the need for sustainable OA models that ensure both equity and broad dissemination of research.</description>

      <title>Prevalence and Trends in Global Retractions Explored Through a Topic Lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific publications form the cornerstone of innovation and have maintained a stable growth trend over the years. However, in recent years, there has been a significant surge in retractions, driven largely by the proliferation of low-quality and fraudulent papers. This study aims to examine retractions and their evolving trends through a topic lens. Our analysis of global retraction data reveals that the numbers of retraction have remained alarmingly high in recent years, with the growth rate of retracted papers significantly outpacing that of overall global publications. While retractions are observed across various fields, their distribution is not uniform. In disciplines characterized by high retraction rates, certain topics may only encounter minor issues, whereas in fields with lower retraction rates, some topics can experience substantial challenges. Moreover, an unexpected surge in publications has been observed in specific topics that also display abnormally high retraction rates. This study underscores several indicators that can assist the scientific community in pinpointing key fields that require rigorous scrutiny for potential low-quality and fraudulent research. Ultimately, our findings could serve as a benchmark for examining scientific integrity across diverse topics and offer crucial insights for developing tailored governance policies to enhance research integrity in each field.</description>

      <title>The Intertwined Rise of Collaboration Scale, Reference Diversity, and Breakthrough Potential in Modern Science: A 40-Year Cross-Disciplinary Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last four decades, the way knowledge is created in academia has transformed dramatically: research teams have grown larger, scholars draw from ever-wider pools of prior work, and the most influential discoveries increasingly emerge from complex collaborative efforts. Using a massive dataset of over 15 million publications spanning 1970-2010 and covering six major domains (Humanities, Social Sciences, Agricultural Sciences, Medical and Health Sciences, Engineering and Technology, and Natural Sciences), this study tracks how three core features of scientific papers - authorship team size, the breadth and variety of cited sources, and eventual citation impact - have co-evolved over time. We uncover striking differences across disciplines. In every field, papers that build on a broader and more diverse knowledge base consistently attract more citations later on, lending large-scale empirical support to theories that view scientific breakthroughs as outcomes of novel recombination across distant ideas. Bigger teams, on average, generate work with greater ultimate influence, but the gains taper off after a certain scale; very large consortia seldom produce the absolute highest-impact papers. While the Humanities and Social Sciences remain anchored in solo or small-group authorship traditions, the Natural Sciences, Medicine, and Engineering have moved decisively toward big-team mega-science. These patterns illuminate the underlying production technology of discovery, reveal discipline-specific barriers to collaboration and idea integration, and offer evidence-based guidance for research funding agencies, universities, and policymakers seeking to organize scientific work for maximum breakthrough potential.</description>

      <title>Meursault as a Data Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In an era dominated by datafication, the reduction of human experiences to quantifiable metrics raises profound philosophical and ethical questions. This paper explores these issues through the lens of Meursault, the protagonist of Albert Camus' The Stranger, whose emotionally detached existence epitomizes the existential concept of absurdity. Using natural language processing (NLP) techniques including emotion detection (BERT), sentiment analysis (VADER), and named entity recognition (spaCy)-this study quantifies key events and behaviors in Meursault's life. Our analysis reveals the inherent limitations of applying algorithmic models to complex human experiences, particularly those rooted in existential alienation and moral ambiguity. By examining how modern AI tools misinterpret Meursault's actions and emotions, this research underscores the broader ethical dilemmas of reducing nuanced human narratives to data points, challenging the foundational assumptions of our data-driven society. The findings presented in this paper serve as a critique of the increasing reliance on data-driven narratives and advocate for incorporating humanistic values in artificial intelligence.</description>
