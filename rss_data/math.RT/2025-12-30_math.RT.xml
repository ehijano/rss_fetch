      <title>Tableaux and orbit harmonics quotients for finite transformation monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend Grood's tableau construction of irreducible representations of the rook monoid and Steinberg's analogous result for the full transformation monoid. Our approach is characteristic-free and applies to any submonoid $\mathcal{M}(n)$ of the partial transformation monoid on an $n$-element set that contains the symmetric group. To achieve this, we introduce and study a functor from the category of rational representations of the monoid of $n \times n$ matrices to the category of finite dimensional representations of $\mathcal{M}(n)$. We establish two branching rules. Our main results describe graded module structures of orbit harmonics quotients for the rook, partial transformation, and full transformation monoids. This yields analogs of the Cauchy decomposition for polynomial rings in $n\times n$ variables.</description>

      <title>Computing quaternionic representations via twisted forms of Bruhat-Tits trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is devoted to the study of representations of finite subgroups of the group of units of quaternion division algebras over a global or local field arising from the inclusion via extension of scalars splitting the algebra. Following a question by Serre, we study the set $\mathrm{IF}$ of conjugacy classes of integral representations that are conjugates of the given representation over the field. The set $\mathrm{IF}$ is often called the set of integral forms in the literature. In previous works we have seen that, for a given representation, the set $\mathrm{IF}$ can be indexed by the vertex set of a suitable subgraph of the Bruhat-Tits tree for the special linear group. In this work, we describe a construction that allows the simultaneous study of the set $\mathrm{IF}$ over different splitting fields. For this, we devise and use a theory of twisted Galois form of Bruhat-Tits trees. With this tool, we explicitly compute, in most cases, the cardinality of $\mathrm{IF}$ for the representation of the classical quaternion group of order $8$ studied by Serre, Feit and others, as much as for other similar groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a finite-dimensional faithful representation $V$ of a linearly reductive group $G$ over a field $K=\bar K$, we consider the growth of the number of irreducible factors of $V^{\otimes n}$ when $n$ is large. We prove that there exist upper and lower bounds which are constant multiples of $n^{-u/2} (\dim V)^n$, where $u$ is the dimension of any maximal unipotent subgroup of $G$.</description>

      <title>Schur--Weyl duality for diagonalizing a Markov chain on the hypercube</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how the tools of modern algebraic combinatorics -- representation theory, Murphy elements, and particularly Schur--Weyl duality -- can be used to give an explicit orthonormal basis of eigenfunctions for a "curiously slowly mixing Markov chain" on the space of binary $n$-tuples. The basis is used to give sharp rates of convergence to stationarity.</description>

      <title>The topological life of Dynkin indices: universal scaling and matter selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For simple, simply-connected compact Lie groups, Dynkin embedding indices obey a universal scaling law with a direct topological meaning. Given an inclusion $f:G\hookrightarrow H$, the Dynkin embedding index $j_f$ is characterized equivalently by the induced maps on $\pi_3$ and on the canonical generators of $H^3$, $H^4(B{-})$, and $H^4(\Sigma{-})$. Consequently, $j_f$ controls instanton-number scaling, the quantization levels of Chern--Simons and Wess--Zumino--Witten terms, and the matching of gauge couplings and one-loop RG scales. We connect this picture to representation theory via the $\beta$-construction in topological $K$-theory, relating Dynkin indices to Chern characters through Harris' degree--$3$ formula and Naylor's suspended degree--$4$ refinement. Finally, we apply these results to F-theory to explain the prevalence of index-one matter: we propose a ``genericity heuristic'' where geometry favors regular embeddings (typically $j_f=1$) associated with minimal singularity enhancements, while higher-index embeddings require non-generic tuning.</description>

      <title>q-Opers and Bethe Ansatz for Open Spin Chains I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In in a nutshell, the classical geometric $q$-Langlands duality can be viewed as a correspondence between the space of $(G,q)$-opers and the space of solutions of $^L\mathfrak{g}$ XXZ Bethe Ansatz equations. The latter describe spectra of closed spin chains with twisted periodic boundary conditions and, upon the duality, the twist elements are identified with the $q$-oper connections on a projective line in a certain gauge. In this work, we initiate the geometric study of Bethe Ansatz equations for spin chains with open boundary conditions. We introduce the space of $q$-opers whose defining sections are invariant under reflection through the unit circle in a selected gauge. The space of such reflection-invariant $q$-opers in the presence of certain nondegeneracy conditions is thereby described by the corresponding Bethe Ansatz problem. We compare our findings with the existing results in integrable systems and representation theory. This paper discusses the type-A construction leaving the general case for the upcoming work.</description>

      <title>Aubert duals of strongly positive representations for metaplectic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine the Aubert duals of strongly positive representations of the metaplectic group \(\widetilde{Sp}(n)\) over a non-Archimedean local field $F$ of characteristic different from two. Using the classification of Mati\'c and an explicit analysis of Jacquet modules, we describe these duals in terms of precise inducing data. Our results extend known descriptions for classical groups to the metaplectic groups case and clarify the role of Aubert duality for non-linear covering groups, providing a foundation for future applications to the study of unitary representations for those cases. Furthermore, We are able to show that the same method applies to odd general spin groups $GSpin(2n+1)$, yielding an explicit description of Aubert duals in that setting as well.</description>

      <title>Quantum $K$-theoretic Whitney relations for type $C$ flag manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study relations of $\lambda_{y}$-classes associated to tautological bundles over the flag manifold of type $C$ in the quantum $K$-ring. These relations are called the quantum $K$-theoretic Whitney relations. The strategy of the proof of the quantum $K$-theoretic Whitney relations is based on the method of semi-infinite flag manifolds and the Borel-type presentation. In addition, we observe that the quantum $K$-theoretic Whitney relations give a complete set of the defining relations of the quantum $K$-ring. This gives a presentation of the quantum $K$-ring of the flag manifold of type $C$, called the Whitney-type presentation, as a quotient of a polynomial ring, different from the Borel-type presentation.</description>

Abstract: Let g be a simple Lie algebra, Lg be the loop algebra of g. Fixing a point in S^1 and identifying the real line with the punctured circle, we consider the subalgebra Sg of Lg of rapidly decreasing elements on R. We classify the translation-invariant 2-cocycles on Sg. We show that the ground state representation of Sg is unique for each cocycle. These ground states correspond precisely to the vacuum representations of Lg.</description>

      <title>Brick chain filtrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18427v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We deal with the category of finitely generated modules over an artin algebra $A$. Recall that an object in an abelian category is said to be a brick provided its endomorphism ring is a division ring. Simple modules are, of course, bricks, but in case $A$ is connected and not local, there do exist bricks which are not simple. The aim of this survey is to focus the attention to filtrations of modules where all factors are bricks, with bricks being ordered in some definite way.
  In general, a module category will have many oriented cycles. Recently, Demonet has proposed to look at so-called brick chains in order to deal with a very interesting directedness feature of a module category. These are the orderings of bricks which we will use.
  This is a survey which relies on recent investigations by a quite large group of mathematicians. We have singled out some important observations and have reordered them in order to obtain a completely self-contained (and elementary) treatment of the relevance of bricks in a module category. (Most of the papers we rely on are devoted to what is called $\tau$-tilting theory, but for the results we are interested in, there is no need to deal with $\tau$-tilting, or even with the Auslander-Reiten translation $\tau$).</description>

      <title>Representations of shifted affine quantum groups and Coulomb branches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06262v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compare the integral category O of shifted affine quantum groups of symmetric and non symmetric types. To do so we compute the K-theoretic analog of the Coulomb branches with symmetrizers introduced by Nakajima and Weekes. This yields an equivalence of the category O with a module category over a new type of quiver Hecke algebras. At the decategorified level, this establishes a connection between the Grothendieck group of O and a finite-dimensional module over a simple Lie algebra of unfolded symmetric type. We compute this module in certain cases and give a combinatorial rule for its crystal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a commutative algebra $A$ and a quotient $A$-algebra $A/I$, we construct a resolution of $A/I$ as an $A$-module such that it is also a differential graded (dg) algebra with divided powers (PD). This construction makes use of symmetric tensors in the symmetric tensor category of dg $A$-modules and does not require a Noetherian assumption on $A$. Moreover, the resolution has many lifting properties which we leverage to study the homotopy Lie algebra associated to the pair $(A,A/I)$, which is defined as the cohomology of the PD derivations of this PD dg algebra. Finally we investigate the complete intersection case in more details as well as connect it to the finite generation of the Yoneda algebra.</description>

Abstract: The theory of admissible modules over symmetrizable anisotropic Kac-Moody superalgebras, introduced by Kac and Wakimoto in late 80's, is a well-developed subject with many applications, including representation theory of vertex algebras. Recently this theory was developed in a more general setup by Gorelik and Serganova. In the present paper we develop in this more general setup the theory of admissible modules over arbitrary symmetrizable Kac-Moody superalgebras.</description>

      <title>On local rings of finite syzygy representation type</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a commutative Noetherian local ring. We characterize when its completion has an isolated singularity, thereby strengthening the Dao-Takahashi refinement of the Auslander-Huneke-Leuschke-Wiegand theorem. We investigate the ascent and descent of finite and countable syzygy representation type along the canonical map from $R$ to its completion. One consequence is a complete affirmative answer to Schreyer's conjecture. We explore analogues of Chen's questions in the context of finite Cohen-Macaulay representation type over Cohen-Macaulay rings. The main result in this direction shows that if $R$ is Cohen-Macaulay and there are only finitely many non-isomorphic indecomposable maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules that are locally free on the punctured spectrum, then either $R$ is a hypersurface or every Gorenstein projective module is projective; moreover, every Gorenstein projective module over the completion of $R$ is a direct sum of finite generated ones. Finally, we study dominant local rings, introduced by Takahashi, under certain finite representation type conditions, and identify a new class of virtually Gorenstein rings.</description>

Abstract: In 2020, F. Cesi introduced a random walk on the hyperoctahedral group $B_n$ and analysed its spectral gap when the allowed generators are transpositions and diagonal elements corresponding to singletons. In this paper we extend the allowed generators to transpositions and any diagonal elements, and characterise completely the set of representations from which the spectral gap arises. This settles a conjecture posed in Cesi's paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a Markov chain with very different mixing rates depending on how mixing is measured. The chain is the "Burnside process on the hypercube $C_2^n$." Started at the all-zeros state, it mixes in a bounded number of steps, no matter how large $n$ is, in $\ell^1$ and in $\ell^2$. And started at general $x$, it mixes in at most $\log n$ steps in $\ell^1$. But, in $\ell^2$, it takes $\frac{n}{\log n}$ steps for most starting $x$. The $\ell^2$ mixing results follow from an explicit diagonalization of the Markov chain into binomial-coefficient-valued eigenvectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a new proof of the epsilon dichotomy conjecture, stated by Prasad and Takloo-Bighash, for non Archimedean local fields of characteristic zero, when the twisting character is trivial. Our method relies on the functional equation and the analytic properties of intertwining periods, instead of trace formula and type theory. It removes the odd residual characteristic restriction in the previous proof, coming from type theory.</description>
