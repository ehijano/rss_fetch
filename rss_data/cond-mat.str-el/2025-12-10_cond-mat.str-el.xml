      <title>Monte Carlo simulation of spin-reorientation transition in weak ferrimagnets YFeCrO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents the modeling of the magnetic 3d sublattice in mixed orthoferrites-orthochromites YFe1-xCrxO3 using classical Monte Carlo methods. It is shown that, when taking into account the competition of the Dzyaloshinskii vectors in the mixed compositions, magnetic moment compensations are observed, as well as angular magnetic configurations corresponding to the spin reorientation.</description>

      <title>Environment-matrix-product operator for boundary-free large-scale quantum many-body simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an alternative to the infinite density-matrix renormalization approach for accessing quantum many-body states within a finite-size calculation that faithfully mimics the thermodynamic limit. Our method constructs environment matrix product operators (MPOs) representing the Hamiltonian of semi-infinite regions surrounding the target system. Starting from the finite-size ground-state MPS, we contract its Hamiltonian representation to generate effective environment MPOs, which are then attached to a renewed finite system in a recursive manner. This iterative embedding drives the system toward a bulk-like state with negligible finite-size effects. The scheme requires no assumption of homogeneity and achieves unprecedentedly long real-time dynamics free from boundary reflections.</description>

      <title>Is disorder a friend or a foe to melting of Wigner-Mott insulators?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wigner crystals are extremely fragile, which is shown to result from very strong geometric frustration germane to long-range Coulomb interactions. Physically, this is manifested by a very small characteristic energy scale for shear density fluctuations, which are gapless excitations in a translationally invariant system. The presence of disorder, however, breaks translational invariance, thus suppressing gapless excitations and pushing them to higher density. We illustrate this general principle by explicit microscopic model calculations, showing that this mechanism very effectively stabilizes disordered Wigner lattices to much higher temperatures and densities than in the clean limit. On the other hand, we argue that in two dimensions disorder significantly ``smears" the melting transition, producing spatial coexistence of solid-like and liquid-like regions -- just as recently observed in STM experiments. Our results paint a new physical picture for melting of Wigner-Mott solids in two dimensions, corresponding to a Mott-Hubbard model with spatially varying local electronic bandwidth.</description>

      <title>Quantum Geometry Driven Crystallization: A Neural-Network Variational Monte Carlo Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wigner crystals are a paradigmatic form of interaction driven electronic order. A key open question is how Berry curvature and, more generally, quantum geometry reshape crystallization. The discovery of two-dimensional materials with relatively flat bands and pronounced Berry curvature has added fresh urgency to this question. Recent mean-field studies have proposed a topological variant of the Wigner crystal, the anomalous Hall crystal (AHC), with non-zero Chern number. However it remains unclear whether the AHC survives beyond the mean-field approximation. Here, we map out the ground-state phase diagram of the $\lambda$-jellium model - a simple model whose interaction strength and Berry curvature are independently tunable - using state-of-the-art neural-network variational Monte Carlo. The AHC is found to remain stable against quantum fluctuations. Surprisingly, quantum geometric effects are found to dramatically enhance crystallization. Both the AHC and the standard Wigner Crystal are stabilized at densities up to an order of magnitude above the critical density in the absence of quantum geometry, yet still significantly below the threshold predicted by mean-field theory. These striking results highlight the rich interplay between quantum fluctuations, quantum geometry, and crystallization, providing concrete guidance for experiments and enabling future explorations of fractionalized crystals and chiral superconductors.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Quantum Chiral Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a non-perturbative framework for quantizing chiral solitons in interacting quantum spin chains. This approach provides a direct lattice extension of the well-established $S$-duality between the sine-Gordon and Thirring models, thereby bridging the gap between continuum dualities and their lattice counterparts. By constructing the quantum chiral-soliton operators explicitly, we show how their unconventional dynamics appear in the excitation spectrum and correlation functions across the full Brillouin zone. A key result is that the dominant soliton tunneling amplitude alternates in sign, $\operatorname{sgn}(t_{1+}) = (-1)^{2S+1}$, sharply distinguishing half-odd-integer from integer spin chains. We further identify characteristic signatures of these chiral excitations in the dynamical spin structure factor, demonstrating their visibility in inelastic neutron scattering. Our results open a route to experimentally probing non-perturbative features of dual quantum field theories in condensed-matter settings.</description>

      <title>Topological spin-up triplet excitonic condensation in two-dimensional electron-hole systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate topological spin-up triplet excitonic condensation and its competition with other stabilities in a two-dimensional interacting electron-hole system taking into account Rashba spin-orbit coupling and external magnetic fields. Using an unrestricted Hartree-Fock approach, we self-consistently evaluate spin-selective excitonic condensate order parameters and the Chern number. The ground state phase diagram in the dependence on magnetic field and Coulomb interaction shows a spin-up triplet excitonic condensate (EC) with a nonzero Chern number, emerging uniquely away from the topologically trivial singlet and spin-down triplet EC regions. Strong spin-polarized triplet excitonic fluctuations preceding the condensation are further revealed through the signatures of the dynamical excitonic susceptibility spectra. Our results establish a class of topological quantum phases driven by excitonic coherence and suggest a realistic pathway to its realization in a distorted Janus monolayer of transition metal dichalcogenides or some twisted van der Waals heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Decay of spin helices in XXZ quantum spin chains with single-ion anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-lived spin-helix states facilitate the study of non-equilibrium dynamics in quantum magnets. We consider the decay of transverse spin-helices in antiferromagnetic spin-$S$ XXZ chains with single-ion anisostropy. The spin-helix decay is observable in the time evolution of the local magnetization that we calculate numerically for the system in the thermodynamic limit using infinite time-evolving block decimation simulations. Although the single-ion anisotropy prevents helix states from being eigenstates of the Hamiltonian, they still can be long-lived for appropriately chosen wave numbers. In case of an easy-axis exchange anisotropy the single-ion anisotropy may even stabilize the helices. Within a spin-wave approximation, we obtain a condition giving an estimate for the most stable wave number $Q$ that agrees qualitatively with our numerical results.</description>

      <title>Operator Lanczos Approach enabling Neural Quantum States as Real-Frequency Impurity Solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To understand the intricate exchange between electrons of different bands in strongly correlated materials, it is essential to treat multi-orbital models accurately. For this purpose, dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) provides an established framework, whose scope crucially hinges on the availability of efficient quantum impurity solvers. Here we present a real-frequency impurity solver based on neural quantum states (NQS) combined with an operator-Lanczos construction. NQS are an asymptotically unbiased variational ground-state ansatz that employs neural networks to capture long-range correlations on complicated graph structures. We leverage this ability to solve multi-orbital impurity problems using a systematically improvable Segmented Commutator Operator-Lanczos (SCOL) construction. Our benchmarks on both the single-orbital Anderson model and the multi-orbital Hubbard-Kanamori impurity Hamiltonian reveal excellent ground-state precision and the capacity to accurately resolve zero temperature spectral functions and self-energies. These results open avenues for extending DMFT to more challenging problems.</description>

      <title>Diffusion and relaxation of topological excitations in layered spin liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relaxation processes in topological phases such as quantum spin liquids are controlled by the dynamics and interaction of fractionalized excitations. In layered materials hosting two-dimensional topological phases, elementary quasiparticles can diffuse freely within the layer, whereas only pairs (or more) can hop between layers - a fundamental consequence of topological order. Using exact solutions of emergent nonlinear diffusion equations and particle-based stochastic simulations, we explore how pump-probe experiments can provide unique signatures of the presence of $2d$ topological excitations in a $3d$ material. Here we show that the characteristic time scale of such experiments is inversely proportional to the initial excitation density, set by the pump intensity. A uniform excitation density created on the surface of a sample spreads subdiffusively into the bulk with a mean depth $\bar z$ scaling as $\sim t^{1/3}$ when annihilation processes are absent. The propagation becomes logarithmic, $\bar z \sim \log t$, when pair-annihilation is allowed. Furthermore, pair-diffusion between layers leads to a new decay law for the total density, $n(t) \sim (\log^2 t)/t$ - slower than in a purely $2d$ system. We discuss possible experimental implications for pump-probe experiments in samples of finite width.</description>

      <title>Disentangling the unusual magnetic anisotropy of the near-room-temperature ferromagnet Fe$_{4}$GeTe$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the quest for two-dimensional conducting materials with high ferromagnetic ordering temperature the new family of the layered Fe$_{n}$GeTe$_{2}$ compounds, especially the near-room-temperature ferromagnet Fe$_{4}$GeTe$_{2}$, receives a significant attention. Fe$_{4}$GeTe$_{2}$ features a peculiar spin reorientation transition at $T_\mathrm{SR} \sim 110$ K suggesting a non-trivial temperature evolution of the magnetic anisotropy (MA) - one of the main contributors to the stabilization of the magnetic order in the low-D systems. An electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopic study reported here provides quantitative insights into the unusual magnetic anisotropy of Fe$_{4}$GeTe$_{2}$. At high temperatures the total MA is mostly given by the demagnetization effect with a small contribution of the counteracting intrinsic magnetic anisotropy of an easy-axis type, whose growth below a characteristic temperature $T_{\rm shape} \sim 150$ K renders the sample seemingly isotropic at $T_\mathrm{SR}$. Below one further temperature $T_{\rm d} \sim 50$ K the intrinsic MA becomes even more complex. Importantly, all the characteristic temperatures found in the ESR experiment match those observed in transport measurements, suggesting an inherent coupling between magnetic and electronic degrees of freedom in Fe$_{4}$GeTe$_{2}$. This finding together with the observed signatures of the intrinsic two-dimensionality should facilitate optimization routes for the use of Fe$_{4}$GeTe$_{2}$ in the magneto-electronic devices, potentially even in the monolayer limit.</description>

      <title>Triangular $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg Antiferromagnet in a Magnetic Field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The behavior of the paradigmatic $J_1-J_2$ triangular lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet in a magnetic field remains unsettled despite decades of study. We map out the phase diagram using three complementary approaches, including self-consistent nonlinear spin-wave theory, density-matrix renormalization group, and variational Monte Carlo. This combined analysis resolves the competition among different field-induced magnetic orders and magnetization plateaux across the classically frustrated parameter range. In particular, there is a finite range in the parameter regime around $J_2/J_1=\frac{1}{8}$ in which i) upon the application of the external field, the gapless quantum spin liquid acquires a finite density of monopoles, and ii) by further increasing the field, two plateaux are clearly obtained at $m=\frac{1}{3}$ and $m=\frac{1}{2}$. We discuss the experimental importance of the consecutive magnetization plateaux transitions as a signature of an underlying quantum spin-liquid phase.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Through Topological Defects: Reconciling Theory with Numerics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Present theoretical predictions for the entanglement entropy through topological defects are vi- olated by numerical simulations. In order to resolve this, we introduce a paradigm shift in the preparation of reduced density matrices in the presence of topological defects, and emphasize the role of defect networks with which they can be dressed. We consider the cases of grouplike and du- ality defects in detail for the Ising model, and match all numerically found entanglement entropies. Since our construction functions at the level of reduced density matrices, it accounts for topological defects beyond the entanglement entropy to other entanglement measures.</description>

      <title>Moire-Engineered Ferroelectric Transistors for Nearly Trap-free, Low-Power and Non-Volatile 2D Electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-range moire patterns in twisted WSe2 enable a built-in, moire-length-scale ferroelectric polarization that can be directly harnessed in electronic devices. Such a built-in ferroic landscape offers a compelling means to enable ultralow-voltage and non-volatile electronic functionality in two-dimensional materials; however, achieving stable polarization control without charge trapping has remained a persistent challenge. Here, we demonstrate a moire-engineered ferroelectric field-effect transistor (FeFET) utilizing twisted WSe2 bilayers that leverages atomically clean van der Waals interfaces to achieve efficient polarization-channel coupling and trap-suppressed, ultralow-voltage operation (subthreshold swing of 64 mV per decade). The device exhibits a stable non-volatile memory window of 0.10 V and high mobility, exceeding the performance of previously reported two-dimensional FeFET and matching that of advanced silicon-based devices. In addition, capacitance-voltage spectroscopy, corroborated by self-consistent Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire modeling, indicates ultrafast ferroelectric switching (~0.5 microseconds). These results establish moire-engineered ferroelectricity as a practical and scalable route toward ultraclean, low-power, and non-volatile 2D electronics, bridging atomistic lattice engineering with functional device architectures for next-generation memory and logic technologies.</description>

      <title>Microwave Signature of the Emerging Abrikosov Lattice Above $H_{c2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of the Abrikosov lattice in the normal phase of type-II superconducting films when the magnetic field approaches the critical field $H_{c2}$ from above was predicted in Ref.~\cite{GVV2011}. In the quantum fluctuation regime \cite{GL2001} it is characterized by the formation of relatively large (with sizes of order $\xi_{\mathrm{QF}} \sim \xi_{\mathrm{BCS}}\sqrt{H_{c2}/(H-H_{c2})}$) ``long lived'' (lifetime of order $\tau_{\mathrm{QF}} \sim \hbar \Delta^{-1} H_{c2}/(H-H_{c2})$) clusters of rotating fluctuation Cooper pairs - signatures of developing Abrikosov vortices. We demonstrate that these fluctuation-induced vortex clusters, previously considered unobservable due to their ultrafast dynamics and weak (only logarithmically singular) contribution to the dc-conductivity, can in fact be detected through their distinct electromagnetic signature. By analyzing the high-frequency electromagnetic response of these rotating fluctuation Cooper pairs above the second critical field in superconducting film, we predict a pronounced and measurable enhancement in the imaginary part of the ac-conductivity arising directly from quantum fluctuations. This enhancement is expected to occur at characteristic frequencies $\omega_{QF} \sim \hbar^{-1}\Delta(H-H_{c2})/H_{c2}$, which are well below the superconducting threshold at $2\hbar^{-1}\Delta $, where a similar increase in imaginary conductivity occurs in the superconducting phase. For niobium, a prototypical type II superconductor, $\omega_{QF}$ lies in the experimentally accessible microwave range, making the effect directly testable with modern microwave spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Non-abelian quantum double models from iterated gauging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We reconstruct all (2+1)D quantum double models of finite groups from their boundary symmetries through the repeated application of a gauging procedure, extending the existing construction for abelian groups. We employ the recently proposed categorical gauging framework, based on matrix product operators (MPOs), to derive the appropriate gauging procedure for the $\mathsf{Rep}\, G$ symmetries appearing in our construction and give an explicit description of the dual emergent $G$ symmetry, which is our main technical contribution. Furthermore, we relate the possible gapped boundaries of the quantum double models to the quantum phases of the one-dimensional input state to the iterated gauging procedure. Finally, we propose a gauging procedure for 1-form $\mathsf{Rep}\, G$ symmetries on a two-dimensional lattice and use it to extend our results to the construction of (3+1)D quantum doubles models through the iterative gauging of (2+1)-dimensional symmetries.</description>

      <title>Dominant Excitonic Superconductivity in a Three-component Hubbard Chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding superconductivity emerging from repulsive fermions remains a major challenge in condensed matter physics. In this paper, we investigate the pairing tendencies in a one-dimensional, three component repulsive Hubbard model, using the density matrix renormalization group method. At half-filling, the system exhibits density wave ground state due to strong Hubbard repulsions. Upon doping, we find that Cooper pairs can emerge, whose fluctuations predominate the long-range physics in the system across a wide parameter range. The effective attractions between Cooper pairs are mediated by the particle-hole fluctuations in the third non-pairing component, resembling an excitonic mechanism of superconductivity. The coexistence of multiple density waves and superconductivity at different fermion fillings is explored. We also present an analytical study of the pairing mechanism in both weak and strong coupling limits. Our results provide a new perspective for understanding and exploring unconventional superconductivities in strongly correlated fermionic systems.</description>

      <title>Triangular lattice models of the Kalmeyer-Laughlin spin liquid from coupled wires</title>

Abstract: Chiral spin liquids (CSLs) are exotic phases of interacting spins in two dimensions, characterized by long-range entanglement and fractional excitations. We construct a local Hamiltonian on the triangular lattice that stabilizes the Kalmeyer-Laughlin CSL without requiring fine-tuning. Our approach employs coupled-wire constructions and introduces a lattice duality to construct a solvable chiral sliding Luttinger liquid, which is driven toward the CSL phase by generic perturbations. By combining symmetry analysis and bosonization, we make sharp predictions for the ground states on quasi-one-dimensional cylinders and tori, which exhibit a fourfold periodicity in the circumference. Extensive tensor network simulations demonstrating ground-state degeneracies, fractional quasiparticles, nonvanishing long-range order parameters, and entanglement signatures confirm the emergence of the CSL in the lattice Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Localized Triplons and Site Stuffing in the Quantum Dimer Magnet BiYbGeO$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermodynamic and muon spin-relaxation measurements have recently highlighted BiYbGeO$_5$ as a new example of a rare-earth-based quantum dimer magnet with isolated Yb$^{3+}$ spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ dimers. However, direct spectroscopic evidence of the triplet excitations and measurements of the structural disorder are lacking. In this work, polycrystalline BiYbGeO$_5$ was synthesized using conventional high-temperature solid-state methods and investigated via high-resolution neutron powder diffraction and inelastic neutron scattering. Diffraction measurements down to 58 mK reveal no signatures of magnetic order and indicate that nearly 20\% of Yb$^{3+}$ sites are replaced by non-magnetic Bi$^{3+}$, introducing significant structural disorder. Inelastic neutron scattering shows dispersionless triplon excitations, consistent with localized, non-interacting spin dimers. Fits to the triplet excitation spectrum identify an XXZ-type anisotropic exchange with $J_{XX}$ = 0.11(2) meV and $J_Z = 0.15(1)$ meV. These findings establish BiYbGeO$_5$ as a structurally disordered but magnetically well-isolated quantum dimer system, providing a model platform for studying the resilience of entangled spin states to site dilution.</description>

      <title>Exactly solvable spin liquids in Kitaev bilayers and moir\'e superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building on the recent advancements on moir\'e superlattices, we propose an exactly solvable model with Kitaev-type interactions on a bilayer honeycomb lattice for both AA stacking and moir\'e superlattices. Using Monte Carlo simulations and variational analysis, we uncover a rich variety of phases where the intra and interlayer $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fluxes (visons) are arranged in a periodic fashion in the ground state, tuned by interlayer coupling and out-of-plane external magnetic field. We further extend our model to moir\'e superlattices at various commensurate twist angles around two distinct twist centers represented by $C_{3z}$ and $C_{6z}$ of the honeycomb lattice. Our simulations reveal generalized arrangements of plaquette values that correlate with the AA or AB stacking regions across the moir\'e unit cell. Moreover, we find that, depending on the twist angle, twist center and interlayer coupling, moir\'e superlattices exhibit to a variety of gapped and gapless spin liquid phases and can also host corner and edge modes. Our results highlight the rich physics in bilayer and twisted bilayer models of exactly solvable quantum spin liquids.</description>

      <title>Subdimensional entanglement entropy: from geometric-topological response to entanglement-induced mixed-state landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A growing body of examples reveals that topology and geometry are deeply intertwined in shaping universal properties of quantum matter, as seen in fracton orders with size-dependent topological ground-state degeneracy and in cluster states with spurious topological entanglement entropy. We introduce the \textit{subdimensional entanglement entropy} (SEE), defined on \textit{subdimensional entanglement subsystems} (SESs) embedded in the bulk, as a direct probe of this intertwinement. By virtually tuning SES dimension, geometry and topology, the subleading components of SEE show sharply distinct geometric and topological responses in cluster states, $\mathbb{Z}_q$ topological orders, and fracton orders. Further viewing the SES reduced density matrix as a mixed state on the SES manifold, we establish an exact correspondence between stabilizers and mixed-state symmetries, distinguishing \textit{strong} from \textit{weak} classes. Nontrivial SEE enforces weak symmetries to act as \textit{transparent patch operators} of strong ones, together forming \textit{transparent composite symmetries} that are robust against finite depth quantum circuits. Due to the presence of transparent patch operators, each $D$-dimensional SES holographically encodes a $(D+1)$-dimensional topological order. Thus, SEE simultaneously accesses various forefront directions, providing a unified and versatile nexus linking phenomena previously regarded as distinct.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions in the spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06423v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nature of the intermediate ground-state phase in the spin-1/2 frustrated square lattice model has long been debated. Using cluster density matrix embedding theory, we investigate the phase diagram of this model. The Neel phase is directly identified for J2&lt;0.45 and the collinear phase for J2&gt;0.65 based on the ground state. Although no direct evidence of an internal phase transition is found within the intermediate phase from the ground state, analysis of the first excited state wave function reveals a continuous quantum phase transition in this region, with a critical point at J2=0.55. This critical point divides the intermediate phase into PVBS and CVBS.</description>

      <title>Correlation length in random MPS and PEPS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.11682</link>
      <description>arXiv:1906.11682v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tensor network states are used extensively as a mathematically convenient description of physically relevant states of many-body quantum systems. Those built on regular lattices, i.e. matrix product states (MPS) in dimension 1 and projected entangled pair states (PEPS) in dimension 2 or higher, are of particular interest in condensed matter physics. The general goal of this work is to characterize which features of MPS and PEPS are generic and which are, on the contrary, exceptional. This problem can be rephrased as follows: given an MPS or PEPS sampled at random, what are the features that it displays with either high or low probability? One property which we are particularly interested in is that of having either rapidly decaying or long-range correlations. In a nutshell, our main result is that translation-invariant MPS and PEPS typically exhibit exponential decay of correlations at a high rate. We have two distinct ways of getting to this conclusion, depending on the dimensional regime under consideration. Both yield intermediate results which are of independent interest, namely: the parent Hamiltonian and the transfer operator of such MPS and PEPS typically have a large spectral gap. In all these statements, our aim is to get a quantitative estimate of the considered quantity (generic correlation length or spectral gap), which has the best possible dependency on the physical and bond dimensions of the random MPS or PEPS.</description>
