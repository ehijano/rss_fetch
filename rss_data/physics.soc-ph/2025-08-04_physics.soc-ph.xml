      <title>Assessing (im)balance in signed brain networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many complex systems - be they financial, natural or social - are composed by units - such as stocks, neurons or agents - whose joint activity can be represented as a multivariate time series. An issue of both practical and theoretical importance concerns the possibility of inferring the presence of a static relationships between any two units solely from their dynamic state. The present contribution aims at providing an answer within the frame of traditional hypothesis testing. Briefly speaking, our suggestion is that of linking any two units if behaving in a sufficiently similar way. To achieve such a goal, we project a multivariate time series onto a signed graph, by i) comparing the empirical properties of the former with those expected under a suitable benchmark and ii) linking any two units with a positive (negative) edge in case the corresponding series share a significantly large number of concordant (discordant) values. To define our benchmarks, we adopt an information-theoretic approach that is rooted into the constrained maximisation of Shannon entropy, a procedure inducing an ensemble of multivariate time series that preserves some of the empirical properties on average while randomising everything else. We showcase the possible applications of our method by addressing one of the most timely issues in the domain of neurosciences, i.e. that of determining if brain networks are frustrated or not - and, in case, to what extent. As our results suggest, this is indeed the case, the structure of the negative subgraph being more prone to inter-subject variability than the complementary, positive subgraph. At the mesoscopic level, instead, the minimisation of the Bayesian Information Criterion instantiated with the Signed Stochastic Block Model reveals that brain areas gather into modules aligning with the statistical variant of the Relaxed Balance Theory.</description>

      <title>Evac-Cast: An Interpretable Machine-Learning Framework for Evacuation Forecasts Across Hurricanes and Wildfires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evacuation is critical for disaster safety, yet agencies lack timely, accurate, and transparent tools for evacuation prediction. This study introduces Evac-Cast, an interpretable machine learning framework that predicts tract-level evacuation rates using over 20 features derived from four dimensions: hazard intensity, community vulnerability, evacuation readiness, and built environment. Using an XGBoost model trained on multi-source, large-scale datasets for two hurricanes (Ian 2022, Milton 2024) and two wildfires (Kincade 2019, Palisades--Eaton 2025), Evac-Cast achieves mean absolute errors of 4.5% and 3.5% for hurricane and wildfire events, respectively. SHAP analysis reveals a consistent feature importance hierarchy across hazards, led by hazard intensity. Notably, the models perform well without explicit psychosocial variables, suggesting that macro-level proxies effectively encode behavioral signals traditionally captured through time-consuming surveys. This work offers a survey-free, high-resolution approach for predicting and understanding evacuation in hazard events, which could serve as a data-driven tool to support decision-making in emergency management.</description>

      <title>Data Bias in Human Mobility is a Universal Phenomenon but is Highly Location-specific</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale human mobility datasets play increasingly critical roles in many algorithmic systems, business processes and policy decisions. Unfortunately there has been little focus on understanding bias and other fundamental shortcomings of the datasets and how they impact downstream analyses and prediction tasks. In this work, we study `data production', quantifying not only whether individuals are represented in big digital datasets, but also how they are represented in terms of how much data they produce. We study GPS mobility data collected from anonymized smartphones for ten major US cities and find that data points can be more unequally distributed between users than wealth. We build models to predict the number of data points we can expect to be produced by the composition of demographic groups living in census tracts, and find strong effects of wealth, ethnicity, and education on data production. While we find that bias is a universal phenomenon, occurring in all cities, we further find that each city suffers from its own manifestation of it, and that location-specific models are required to model bias for each city. This work raises serious questions about general approaches to debias human mobility data and urges further research.</description>

      <title>Unifying models of belief dynamics: a meta-model with Personal, Expressed and Social beliefs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Beliefs are central to individual decision-making and societal dynamics, and they are shaped through complex interactions between personal cognition and social environments. Traditional models of belief dynamics often fail to capture the interplay between internal belief systems and external influences. We present a meta-model that represents belief dynamics through three belief types: Personal beliefs, Expressed beliefs, and Social beliefs about others (PES). This distinction allows the model to account for the potential misperception of others' beliefs as well as distortions in the belief expression, and it permits the formalization of psychological processes such as ego projection, social influence, authenticity, and conformity. These processes have been studied extensively in social psychology but are rarely integrated into a comprehensive formal model. The PES meta-model also encompasses many existing belief dynamics models, such as versions of the Voter, Ising, DeGroot, and bounded confidence models. Its nested structure enables comparative analyses between different models and supports the construction of new models by recombining its components, providing a flexible framework for cumulative theory development.</description>

      <title>Block-corrected Modularity for Community Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20083v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unknown node attributes in complex networks may introduce community structures that are important to distinguish from those driven by known attributes. We propose a block-corrected modularity that discounts given block structures present in the network to reveal communities masked by them. We show analytically how the proposed modularity finds the community structure driven by an unknown attribute in a simple network model. Further, we observe that the block-corrected modularity finds the underlying community structure on a number of simple synthetic network models while methods using different null models fail. We develop an efficient spectral method as well as two Louvain-inspired fine-tuning algorithms to maximize the proposed modularity and demonstrate their performance on several synthetic network models. Finally, we assess our methodology on various real-world citation networks built using the OpenAlex data by correcting for the temporal citation patterns.</description>
