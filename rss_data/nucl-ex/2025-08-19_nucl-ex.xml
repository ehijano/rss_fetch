      <title>Observation of Tensor-Driven High-Momentum Neutrons in 16O via (p,d) Reactions and Zero-Degree Deuteron Momentum Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $^{16}\mathrm{O}(p,d)^{15}\mathrm{O}$ reaction has been studied at $0^{\circ}$ using 403-, 604-, 907- and 1209-MeV protons, comparing cross sections populating positive- and negative-parity states in $^{15}\mathrm{O}$. Transitions to positive-parity states exhibit strong sensitivity to high-momentum neutrons, while negative-parity transitions show much smaller effects. The cross-section ratio between positive- and negative-parity states rises sharply with momentum transfer, matching theoretical predictions that include tensor interactions, particularly the peak near $2~\mathrm{fm}^{-1}$ for the $5/2^{+}$ to ground-state ratio. These results highlight $0^{\circ}$ neutron-pickup reactions as a sensitive probe for tensor-driven high-momentum components, paving the way for studies in exotic nuclei via radioactive beams.</description>

      <title>Cross talk between experimental data and simple validation of shell closure in pre-actinides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two back-to-back experiments, 28Si + 178Hf and 28Si + 186W, were intentionally conducted to validate the role of shell closure in pre-actinides by studying neutron multiplicity in compound nucleus (CN) 206Rn and 214Ra. In the first experiment, Dubey et al. [Phys. Rev. C 112, L011602 (2025)], we established the influence of the neutron shell closure. In the present work, the CN 214Ra was deliberately selected to investigate the dependence of the total neutron multiplicity (Mtotal) on the proton number (Z), while keeping the neutron number constant at N = 126 in the pre-actinide region. The objective of the study is two-fold : (i) to examine the effect of proton shell closure when moving away from Z = 82, and (ii) to correlate the present results on proton shell closure with our previous finding on neutron shell closure. We have also used the previous reported data for N = 126 isotones 210Po, 212Rn, and 213Fr to establish the validation of shell closure. A systematic increase in Mtotal with increasing Z was observed from Z = 82 to Z = 88. Furthermore, comparison of the present results on proton shell closure with our earlier neutron shell closure observation, reveals that the cross-correlation between neutron and proton shell closure shows a systematic increase in Mtotal as one moves away from 208Pb, whether along isotonic or isotopic chains.</description>

      <title>About possibility to observe spin dichroism effect (the effect of tensor polarization acquiring) for the effect of tensor polarization acquiring by a nonpolarized deuteron beam passing through the nonpolarized internal target of Nuclotron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deuteron passage through a nonpolarized target is accompanied by birefringence effect which reveals as diverse phenomena, namely: rotation of spin and tensor polarization about the momentum direction, spin oscillations, vector polarization conversion to tensor that and vice versa, spin dichroism. Possibility to study deuteron spin dichroism effect i.e. the effect of tensor polarization acquiring by a nonpolarized deuteron beam moving in NuclotronM and passing through its internal target is discussed.</description>

      <title>Thermalization of Bottomonium in the Quark-Gluon Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the approach to equilibrium of bottomonium in the quark-gluon plasma within the open quantum system framework. We perform large-scale simulations of the long-time behavior in three dimensions using the quantum trajectory method to observe the emergence of steady states and determine the timescale of thermalization in position-, angular-momentum-, and color-space. We find that the thermalization timescale increases with decreasing temperature and decreasing coupling to the medium, which is given by transport coefficients of the medium. Additionally, we observe that the steady states exhibit small corrections to the Gibbs state due to medium interactions and show that these corrections diminish for weaker medium coupling and higher temperature. At a temperature of $450\,$MeV, quarkonium relaxes to a state that is approximately thermal, with the most significant correction being a smaller overlap of the $1S$ state with respect to the Gibbs state. We compare these findings with the master equation obtained at leading order in the expansion of the binding energy over the temperature, which we find to have a trivial steady state.</description>

      <title>IsoDAR@Yemilab: Preliminary Design Report -- Volume II: Medium Energy Beam Transport, Neutrino Source, and Shielding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This Preliminary Design Report (PDR) describes the IsoDAR electron-antineutrino source in two volumes which are mostly site-independent and describe the cyclotron driver providing a 60 MeV, 10 mA proton beam (Volume I); and the medium energy beam transport line (MEBT) and target (this Volume). The IsoDAR driver and target will produce about $1.15\cdot10^{23}$ electron-antineutrinos over five calendar years. Paired with a kton-scale liquid scintillator detector, this will enable a broad particle physics program including searches for new symmetries, new interactions and new particles. Here in Volume II, we describe the medium energy beam transport line, the antineutrino source beam-target and surrounding sleeve, shielding, and plans for monitoring and installation.</description>

      <title>In-medium heavy quark-antiquark $T$-matrix without partial wave expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The T-matrix of the heavy quark-antiquark ($Q\bar{Q}$) pair interacting through a screened Cornell potential in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is computed without employing the partial wave expansion. This is compared with the results obtained using the conventional method of partial wave expansion. Through a comprehensive survey over a range of screening mass and center-of-mass energy, which, when combined, determine the orbital angular momentum involved in the scattering through the associated force range and incident momentum, it is demonstrated that a substantial number of partial wave terms are necessary to precisely match the full scattering amplitude directly obtained from the method without partial wave expansion. For moderate screening masses (corresponding to one to two times the crossover transition temperature) and center-of-mass energy, the number of partial waves required for satisfactory matching turns out as large as 10-20, substantially larger than what one would expect based on simply measuring the magnitudes of the first few partial wave amplitudes. This highlights the efficiency of the new method in directly obtaining the full scattering amplitude needed for further computation of phenomenological observables. We also employ the new method to calculate the T-matrix at center-of-mass energies below the $Q\bar{Q}$ mass threshold, and demonstrate the presence of bound states of different orbital quantum numbers simultaneously in a single energy scan.</description>

      <title>Simulation of heavy quarkonium equilibration in the quark-gluon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We simulate the heavy quarkonium equilibration through transport in a static and homogeneous quark-gluon plasma (QGP) box within the semi-classical Boltzmann approach incorporating both the leading-order and next-to-leading-order dissociation and regeneration reactions. The scattering amplitudes involved are taken from perturbative computations based on effective color-electric dipole coupling of the heavy quarkonium with thermal gluons. By coupling the Langevin simulation of single heavy quark diffusion and the Boltzmann transport of the heavy quarkonium in a real-time fashion, we demonstrate how the kinetic and chemical equilibrium of heavy quarkonium with single heavy quarks in the medium is achieved in terms of both the bound state's yields and momentum distributions. The pertinent equilibration time turns out to be comparable to the lifetime of the QGP created in the most central heavy-ion collisions at the LHC energies. The role of the intricate interplay between the open and hidden heavy sector in the process of equilibration is highlighted. This work provides a dynamical way of understanding the phenomenological success of statistical hadronization model for charmonium production in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, and also paves the way for realistic phenomenological applications to heavy quarkonium transport.</description>

      <title>Influence of Cluster Configurations and Nucleon--Nucleon Scattering Cross-Section on Stopping Power in Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impacts of nuclear $\alpha$-clustering structures and nucleon--nucleon cross-section on nuclear stopping power for ${}^{16}\text{O}$ + ${}^{40}\text{Ca}$ collisions below 300 MeV/nucleon using an extended quantum molecular dynamics (EQMD) model. Our results show that the specific $\alpha$-clustering configurations of ${}^{16}\text{O}$--including chain, square, kite, and tetrahedron--have a significant effect on collision dynamics. Among them, the tightly bound tetrahedral structure exhibits the highest stopping power. Moreover, the repulsive Coulomb interaction is found to reduce the stopping power of protons in the Fermi-energy domain. At higher energies, the decreasing trend is influenced by both the nucleon--nucleon cross-section and the mean field.</description>

      <title>Relativistic atomic structure calculations in support of spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theory can provide important support at all the stages of spectroscopic experiments, from planning the measurements to the interpretation of the results. Such support is particularly valuable for the challenging experiments on heavy, unstable, and superheavy elements and for precision measurements aimed at testing the Standard Model of particle physics. To be reliable and useful in experimental context, theoretical predictions should be based on high-accuracy calculations. For heavy elements, such calculations must treat both relativistic effects and electron correlation on the highest possible level. Relativistic coupled cluster is considered one of the most powerful methods for accurate calculations on heavy many-electron atoms and molecules. This approach is highly accurate and versatile and can be used to obtain energies and a variety of atomic and molecular properties. Furthermore, its robust and transparent formulation allows for systematic improvement of the accuracy of the calculated results and for assigning uncertainties on theoretical values. The Fock-space coupled cluster (FSCC) variant of this method is particularly useful in the context of spectroscopic measurements as it provides access to atomic spectra and properties of the excited states. In this review, we present in detail the relativistic coupled cluster approach and its FSCC variant. We provide a description of the computational procedure used for accurate calculations and for assigning uncertainties. Outstanding recent examples of application to atomic properties, focusing on the experimental context are presented. Finally, we provide a brief discussion of the perspectives for future developments and applications of the CC approach.</description>

      <title>Reaction processes of muon-catalyzed fusion in the muonic molecule $dd\mu$ studied with the tractable $T$-matrix model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Muon-catalyzed fusion has recently regained significant attention due to experimental and theoretical developments being performed. The present authors [Phys. Rev. C {\bf 109} 054625 (2024)] proposed the tractable $T$-matrix model based on the Lippmann-Schwinger equation to approximate the elaborate two- and three-body coupled-channel (CC) calculations [Kamimura, Kino, and Yamashita, Phys. Rev. C {\bf 107}, 034607 (2023)] for the nuclear reaction processes in the muonic molecule $dt\mu$, $(dt\mu)_{J=0} \to\!^4{\rm He} + n + \mu + 17.6 \, {\rm MeV}$. % or $(^4{\rm He}\mu)_{nl} + n + 17.6 \,{\rm MeV}$. The $T$-matrix model well reproduced almost all of the results generated by the CC work. In the present paper, we apply this model to the nuclear reaction processes in the $dd\mu$ molecule, $(dd\mu)_{J=1} \to\!^3{\rm He} + n + \mu +3.27 \,$ MeV or $t + p + \mu + 4.03 \,$ MeV, in which the fusion takes place via the $p$-wave $d$-$d$ relative motion. Recently, significantly different $p$-wave astrophysical $S(E)$ factors of the reaction $d + d \to\!^3{\rm He} + n$ or $t + p$ at $E \! \simeq \! 1$ keV to 1 MeV have been reported experimentally and theoretically by five groups. Employing many sets of nuclear interactions that can reproduce those five cases of $p$-wave $S(E)$ factors, we calculate the fusion rate of the $(dd\mu)_{J=1}$ molecule using three kinds of methods where results are consistent with each other. We also derive the $^3{\rm He}$-$\mu$ sticking probability and the absolute values of the energy and momentum spectra of the emitted muon. The violation of charge symmetry in the $p$-wave $d$-$d$ reaction and the $dd\mu$ fusion reaction is discussed. Information on the emitted 2.45-MeV neutrons and \mbox{1 keV-dominant} muons should be useful for the application of $dd\mu$ fusion.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning for Neutrino Scattering: Domain Adaptation with GANs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We utilize transfer learning to extrapolate the physics knowledge encoded in a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model trained on synthetic charged-current (CC) neutrino-carbon inclusive scattering data. This base model is adapted to generate CC inclusive scattering events (lepton kinematics only) for neutrino-argon and antineutrino-carbon interactions. Furthermore, we assess the effectiveness of transfer learning in re-optimizing a custom model when new data comes from a different neutrino-nucleus interaction model. Our results demonstrate that transfer learning significantly outperforms training generative models from scratch. To study this, we consider two training data sets: one with 10,000 and another with 100,000 events. The models obtained via transfer learning perform well even with smaller training data. The proposed method provides a promising approach for constructing neutrino scattering event generators in scenarios where experimental data is sparse.</description>

      <title>Lifetime measurement of the muonic atoms of enriched Si isotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: A muonic atom, composed of a negative muon and an atomic nucleus, undergoes two primary decay processes: muon-electron decay and muon nuclear capture. The branching ratio between these two processes can be determined from the measured lifetime of the muonic atom. While past researches have examined the general trend of muon capture rates across different nuclei, experimental and theoretical investigations into the isotope dependence of the lifetime remain limited. Purpose: The present study aims to measure the lifetimes of the muonic atom of isotopically enriched silicon isotopes. Methods: The experiment was conducted at the muon facility in the Material and Life Science Facility (MLF), J-PARC. A muon beam was stopped in various target materials, including isotopically enriched $^{28,29,30}$Si. The lifetimes of the muonic atoms were measured by detecting decay electrons using a $\mu$SR spectrometer. The decay spectra were analyzed by fitting with multi-exponential functions to account for contributions from the target nucleus and surrounding materials. Results: For the first time, the lifetimes of the muonic atom of isotopically enriched $^{28,29,30}$Si were measured. Additionally, seven other targets were studied to validate the experimental method and analysis procedure. The results were compared with theoretical models such as Primakoff, Goulard-Primakoff, and the recently-developed microscopic and evaporation model (MEM). Conclusions: The Primakoff and Goulard-Primakoff formulas, while reproducing certain aspects of the isotope dependence, require further refinement. The comparison with MEM calculations constrains the axial vector ($g_A$) and induced pseudoscalar ($g_P$) coupling constants. The present experiment establishes a method for measuring the lifetimes of the muonic atom and will contribute to future systematic investigations.</description>

      <title>Isomeric yield ratios and mass spectrometry of Y and Nb isotopes in the neutron-rich N=60 region: the unusual case of $^{98}$Y</title>

Abstract: The isomeric yield ratio (IYR) of fission products is an observable that carries relevant information about the fragments emerging from the scission of a fissioning nucleus. We report on IYR of $^{96,98,100}$Y and $^{100,102}$Nb, together with the previously reported values for $^{97}$Y and $^{99}$Nb, produced in the 28 MeV $\alpha$-induced fission of $^{232}$Th at the Ion Guide Isotope Separation On-Line (IGISOL) facility of the University of Jyv{\"a}skyl{\"a}. We measured the IYR using two different techniques, the phase-imaging ion-cyclotron-resonance (PI-ICR) and the multiple-reflection time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MR-TOF-MS) methods. Moreover, we measured the masses of the long-lived states in $^{98,100}$Y and $^{100,102}$Nb populated via in-trap $\beta$-decay of their precursors. Since the $\beta$-decay selectively populates states with a favourable spin-parity, we could identify the measured state and show that the ground state is the low-spin state in the cases of $^{98}$Y and $^{100}$Nb, while it is the high-spin state in the cases of $^{100}$Y and $^{102}$Nb. This measurement confirms the spin-parity assignments of all the nuclei as they are reported in the NUBASE2020 evaluations, disagreeing with the assignment for $^{100}$Y reported in the ENSDF evaluation.
  Making also use of previously reported data, we observe an anomalously low IYR for the $N=59$ isotope $^{98}$Y as compared to other yttrium or neighboring niobium isotopes. This behavior is very rare across the nuclear chart and is posited to be connected to the characteristic shape coexistence of $^{98}$Y, and to the change in the charge radii of the ground and excited states in the $N=58-60$ region.</description>

      <title>Probing Spin and Lifetime Correlations in Entangled Hyperon-AntiHyperon Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18507v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement has now been demonstrated in several hadronic systems, revealing that non-classical spin correlations survive even through the strong-interaction hadronization process. To date, however, all studies have focused exclusively on angular observables, leaving the possibility untouched that quantum coherence might also influence the decay times of entangled partners. In this work we propose data-driven tests of spin-lifetime and lifetime-lifetime correlations for Lambda-antiLambda pairs produced in high-energy collisions. By examining the opening-angle distribution in slices of Delta t, constructing a pair-wise spin-lifetime correlator, and testing a simple lifetime-lifetime covariance, we search for deviations from independent exponential decay that align with known spin correlations. Observation of nonzero lifetime correlations would compel a reassessment of how entanglement manifests in decaying systems, revealing hitherto unexplored temporal coherence.</description>

      <title>Bayesian inference of nuclear incompressibility from collective flow in mid-central Au+Au collisions at 400--1500 MeV/nucleon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07051v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The incompressibility $K$ of symmetric nuclear matter (SNM) is determined through a Bayesian analysis of collective flow data from Au + Au collisions at beam energies $E = 400 -1500$ MeV/nucleon. This analysis utilizes a Gaussian process (GP) emulator applied to the isospin-dependent quantum molecular dynamics (IQMD) model for heavy-ion collisions, both with and without incorporating the momentum dependence of the single-nucleon potentials. Specifically, the inferred incompressibility values are $K=188.9^{+2.9}_{-4.5}$ MeV and $256.1^{+8.2}_{-8.7}$ MeV at $E = 400$ MeV/nucleon, respectively, at the 68\% confidence level using rapidity and transverse velocity dependence of proton elliptic flow data, with and without consideration of the momentum dependence. When the transverse momentum dependence of proton-like directed flow data is included, the inferred incompressibility values become $K=222.3^{+9.0}_{-9.9}$ MeV and $K=285.5^{+6.7}_{-7.3}$ MeV, respectively. Furthermore, we found that the value of $K$ derived from observables of proton elliptic flow increases with beam energy. This indicates that the equation of state (EoS) of nuclear matter hardens at higher densities and temperatures in reactions with higher beam energies.</description>

      <title>Imaging nuclei by smashing them at high energies: how are their shapes revealed after destruction?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16071v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-energy nuclear collisions have recently emerged as a promising ``imaging-by-smashing'' approach that may reveal the intrinsic shapes of atomic nuclei. Here, I outline a conceptual framework for this technique, explaining how nuclear shapes are encoded during quark-gluon plasma formation and evolution, and how they can be decoded from final-state particle distributions. I highlight the method's potential to advance our understanding of both nuclear structure and quark-gluon plasma physics.</description>

      <title>The Fermi function and the neutron's lifetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The traditional Fermi function ansatz for nuclear beta decay describes enhanced perturbative effects in the limit of large nuclear charge $Z$ and/or small electron velocity $\beta$. We define and compute the quantum field theory object that replaces this ansatz for neutron beta decay, where neither of these limits hold. We present a new factorization formula that applies in the limit of small electron mass, analyze the components of this formula through two loop order, and resum perturbative corrections that are enhanced by large logarithms. We apply our results to the neutron lifetime, supplying the first two-loop input to the long-distance corrections. Our result can be summarized as \begin{equation*}
  \tau_n \times |V_{ud}|^2\big[1+3\lambda^2\big]\big[1+\Delta_R\big]
  =
  \frac{5263.284(17)\,{\rm s}}
  {1 + 27.04(7)\times 10^{-3} }~, \end{equation*} with $|V_{ud}|$ the up-down quark mixing parameter, $\tau_n$ the neutron's lifetime, $\lambda$ the ratio of axial to vector charge, and $\Delta_R$ the short-distance matching correction. We find a shift in the long-distance radiative corrections compared to previous work, and discuss implications for extractions of $|V_{ud}|$ and tests of the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Malter-Driven Electron Emission as a Source of Noise in LXe TPCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01023v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Persistent single-electron emission ("hot spots") has been observed in multiple liquid xenon (LXe) time projection chambers (TPCs), often persisting long after ionizing events. Although typically discussed in operational terms, the behavior is consistent with Malter-type emission triggered by ion accumulation on resistive oxide surfaces. In this note, we discuss such effects and recommend material choices and design strategies to mitigate them in future detectors. This mechanism is especially relevant to experiments targeting ultra-low energy thresholds, where even small background emissions can limit sensitivity.</description>
