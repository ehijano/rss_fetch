      <title>Comparative analysis of stationarity for Bitcoin and the S&amp;P500</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper compares and contrasts stationarity between the conventional stock market and cryptocurrency. The dataset used for the analysis is the intraday price indices of the S&amp;P500 from 1996 to 2023 and the intraday Bitcoin indices from 2019 to 2023, both in USD. We adopt the definition of `wide sense stationary', which constrains the time independence of the first and second moments of a time series. The testing method used in this paper follows the Wiener-Khinchin Theorem, i.e., that for a wide sense stationary process, the power spectral density and the autocorrelation are a Fourier transform pair. We demonstrate that localized stationarity can be achieved by truncating the time series into segments, and for each segment, detrending and normalizing the price return are required. These results show that the S&amp;P500 price return can achieve stationarity for the full 28-year period with a detrending window of 12 months and a constrained normalization window of 10 minutes. With truncated segments, a larger normalization window can be used to establish stationarity, indicating that within the segment the data is more homogeneous. For Bitcoin price return, the segment with higher volatility presents stationarity with a normalization window of 60 minutes, whereas stationarity cannot be established in other segments.</description>

      <title>Efficient Asymmetric Causality Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03137v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Asymmetric causality tests are increasingly gaining popularity in different scientific fields. This approach corresponds better to reality since logical reasons behind asymmetric behavior exist and need to be considered in empirical investigations. Hatemi-J (2012) introduced the asymmetric causality tests via partial cumulative sums for positive and negative components of the variables operating within the vector autoregressive (VAR) model. However, since the n residuals across the equations in the VAR model are not independent, the ordinary least squares method for estimating the parameters is not efficient. Additionally, asymmetric causality tests mean having different causal parameters (i.e., for positive or negative components), thus, it is crucial to assess not only if these causal parameters are individually statistically significant, but also if their difference is statistically significant. Consequently, tests of difference between estimated causal parameters should explicitly be conducted, which are neglected in the existing literature. The purpose of the current paper is to deal with these issues explicitly. An application is provided, and ten different hypotheses pertinent to the asymmetric causal interaction between two largest financial markets worldwide are efficiently tested within a multivariate setting.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Local Explainability and Trust Scores with Random Forest Proximities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12428v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate a novel approach to explain the predictions and out of sample performance of random forest (RF) regression and classification models by exploiting the fact that any RF can be mathematically formulated as an adaptive weighted K nearest-neighbors model. Specifically, we employ a recent result that, for both regression and classification tasks, any RF prediction can be rewritten exactly as a weighted sum of the training targets, where the weights are RF proximities between the corresponding pairs of data points. We show that this linearity facilitates a local notion of explainability of RF predictions that generates attributions for any model prediction across observations in the training set, and thereby complements established feature-based methods like SHAP, which generate attributions for a model prediction across input features. We show how this proximity-based approach to explainability can be used in conjunction with SHAP to explain not just the model predictions, but also out-of-sample performance, in the sense that proximities furnish a novel means of assessing when a given model prediction is more or less likely to be correct. We demonstrate this approach in the modeling of US corporate bond prices and returns in both regression and classification cases.</description>
