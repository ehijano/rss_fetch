      <title>Dichroic Electron Emission Patterns from Oriented Helium Ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a joint experimental and theoretical study using a combination of polarization-controlled free-electron-laser (FEL) and near-infra\-red (NIR) pulses in a synchronized two-color photo\-ionization scheme. Excited He$^+$ ions, created by extreme ultraviolet (XUV) circularly polarized radiation from the XUV-FEL FERMI in the oriented $3p\, (m\!=\!+1)$ state, are exposed to circularly polarized 784-nm NIR radiation with peak intensities from $10^{12}\,\rm W/cm^2$ to $\rm 10^{13}\,W/cm^2$. The angular distribution of the ejected electrons exhibit a strong dichroism depending on the NIR intensity. While the co-rotating case is defined by a single path, for the counter-rotating case, there are two dominant pathways whose relative strength and phase difference are determined.</description>

      <title>Experimental and theoretical characterisation of Stokes polarimetry of the potassium D1 line with neon buffer gas broadening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive experimental and theoretical characterisation of Stokes polarimetry in potassium (K) vapour on the D1 line. Measurements were performed in the weak-probe regime, investigating the influence of neon buffer gas in the presence of an applied magnetic field in the Faraday geometry. While previous Stokes polarimetry studies in alkali-metal vapours have been conducted, the specific effects of buffer gas-induced broadening and shifts on the observed Stokes parameters remained largely underexplored. Here, experimental measurements of absolute absorption and dispersion were compared with a theoretical model for the electric susceptibility of the vapour, calculated using the established software package $ElecSus$. This work marks the first application of $ElecSus$ to model buffer gas polarimetry of the potassium D1 line, with validation performed against experimental spectra for magnetic fields up to 1.2 kG. Our findings provide new insight into how the presence of buffer gas influences the observed Stokes parameters, thereby enhancing the predictive capabilities of theoretical frameworks for atom-light interactions in buffer-gas environments.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Calculations of Energy Levels, Field Shift Factors, and Polarizabilities of Mercury and Copernicium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mercury (Hg) and superheavy element copernicium (Cn) are investigated using equation-of-motion relativistic coupled-cluster (EOM-RCC) and configuration interaction plus many-body perturbation theory (CI+MBPT) methods. Key atomic properties including ionization potentials (IP), excitation energies (EEs), isotope field shift factors (F), and static electric dipole polarizabilities ({\alpha}) are calculated for ground and low-lying excited states. To evaluate the theoretical accuracy, calculations for both Hg and Cn are performed, with experimental data of Hg serving as benchmarks. Furthermore, basis set dependence has been systematically evaluated in the EOM-RCC calculations, with corresponding uncertainty estimates having been provided. The calculated atomic properties could provide valuable insights into the electronic structure and chemical behavior of superheavy elements.</description>

      <title>Temporal Broadening of Attosecond Pulse Trains Induced by Multi-Band inference in Solid-State High-Order Harmonic Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mechanism underlying high harmonic generation (HHG) in gases has been well clarified, characterizing attosecond pulse trains (APT) in the time domain, significantly advances the synthesis of isolated attosecond pulse (IAP). However, the complexity of HHG in solid obstacles IAP separation. Here, we use time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) to investigate the multiband mechanism of APT in solid state with bulk silicon as prototype. Our research unveils that: 1. The temporal characteristics of APT can be characterized by the occupation of electrons in different energy bands. 2. Due to the temporal occupation difference caused by optical transition allowed (or forbidden) by symmetry between different conduction bands and valence bands, a harmful phase shift in harmonics emission to APT for extracting IAP occurs. Our findings not only shed light on the mechanisms behind solid-state HHG but also provide new avenues to control APT to generate IAP.</description>

      <title>Three-qubit encoding in ytterbium-171 atoms for simulating 1+1D QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating nuclear matter described by quantum chromodynamics using quantum computers is notoriously inefficient because of the assortment of quark degrees of freedom such as matter/antimatter, flavor, color, and spin. Here, we propose to address this resource efficiency challenge by encoding three qubits within individual ytterbium-171 atoms of a neutral atom quantum processor. The three qubits are encoded in three distinct sectors: an electronic "clock" transition, the spin-1/2 nucleus, and the lowest two motional states in one radial direction of the harmonic trapping potential. We develop a family of composite sideband pulses and demonstrate a universal gate set and readout protocol for this three-qubit system. We then apply it to single-flavor quantum chromodynamics in 1+1D axial gauge for which the three qubits directly represent the occupancy of quarks in the three colors. We show that two atoms are sufficient to simulate both vacuum persistence oscillations and string breaking. We consider resource requirements and connections to error detection/correction. Our work is a step towards resource-efficient digital simulation of nuclear matter and opens new opportunities for versatile qubit encoding in neutral atom quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Practical primary thermometry via alkali-metal-vapour Doppler broadening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Doppler-broadening thermometry (DBT) can be used as a calibration-free primary reference suitable for practical applications, e.g. reliably measuring temperatures over long periods of time in environments where sensor retrieval is impractical. We report on our proof-of-concept investigations into DBT with alkali metal vapour cells, with a particular focus on both absorption and frequency accuracy during scans. We reach sub-kelvin temperature accuracy, and experimental absorption fit residuals below $0.05\,\%$, in a simple setup. The outlook for portable, practical devices is bright, with clear prospects for future improvement.</description>
