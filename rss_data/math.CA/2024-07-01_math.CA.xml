      <title>Restricted projections and Fourier decoupling in $\mathbb{Q}_p^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a restricted projection theorem for Borel subsets of $\mathbb{Q}_p^n$ in the regime $p&gt;n$. This generalizes results of Gan-Guo-Wang in the real setting. Our result is effective in the sense that explicit constants are obtained for various covering numbers. Along the way, we prove a fully explicit Fourier decoupling theorem for the moment curve in $p$-adic Cartesian space.</description>

      <title>"Hidden" mechanisms for Gouy-Chapman layer and other critical features via Poisson-Boltzmann equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work a dynamical system approach is taken to systematically investigate the one-dimensional classical Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) equation with various boundary conditions. This framework, particularly, the phase space portrait, has a unique advantage of a geometric view of the dynamical systems, which allows one to reveal and examine critical features of the PB models. More specifically, we are able to reveal the mechanism of Gouy-Chapman layer: the presence of an {\em equilibrium} for the PB equation, including equilibrium-at-infinity for Gouy-Chapman's original setup as the limiting case. Several other critical, somehow counterintuitive, features revealed in this work are the saturation phenomenon of surface charge density, the uniform boundedness of electric pressure (given length) and of length (given electric pressure) in surface charge, and the critical length for a reversal of electric force direction. All have a common mechanism: the presence of an equilibrium for the PB equation. We believe that the critical features presented from the classical PB models persist for modified PB systems up to a certain degree. On the other hand, any qualitative change in these features as the sophistication of the model is increasing is an indication of new phenomena with new mechanisms.</description>

      <title>The truncated multidimensional moment problem: canonical solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the truncated multidimensional moment problem we introduce a notion of a canonical solution. Namely, canonical solutions are those solutions which are generated by commuting self-adjoint extensions inside the associated Hilbert space. It is constructed a 1-1 correspondence between canonical solutions and flat extensions of the given moments (both sets may be empty). In the case of the two-dimensional moment problem (with triangular truncations) a search for canonical solutions leads to an algebraic system of equations. A notion of the index $i_s$ of nonself-adjointness for a set of prescribed moments is introduced. The case $i_s=0$ corresponds to flatness. In the case $i_s=1$ we get explicit necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of canonical solutions. These conditions are valid for arbitrary sizes of truncations. In the case $i_s=2$ we get either explicit conditions for the existence of canonical solutions or a single quadratic equation with several unknowns. Numerical examples are provided.</description>

      <title>Strict Lyapunov functions and energy decay in Hamiltonian chains with degenerate damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a Hamiltonian chain of rotators (in general nonlinear) in which the first rotator is damped. Being motivated by problems of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics of crystals, we construct a strict Lyapunov function that allows us to find a lower bound for the total energy dissipation rate when the energy and time are large. Our construction is explicit and its analysis is rather straightforward. We rely on a method going back to Matrosov, Malisoff and Mazenc, which we review in our paper. The method is rather universal and we show that it is applicable to a chain of oscillators as well.</description>

      <title>The principal eigenvalue of a mixed local and nonlocal operator with drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the eigenvalue problem involving the mixed local-nonlocal operator $ L:= -\Delta +(-\Delta)^{s}+q\cdot\nabla$~ in a bounded domain $\Omega\subset\R^N,$ where a Dirichlet condition is posed on $\R^N\setminus\Omega.$ The field $q$ stands for a drift or advection in the medium. We prove the existence of a principal eigenvalue and a principal eigenfunction for $s\in (0,1/2]$. Moreover, we prove $C^{2,\alpha}$ regularity, up to the boundary, of the solution to the problem $Lu=f$ when coupled with a Dirichlet condition and $0&lt;s&lt;1/2$. To prove the regularity and the existence of a principal eigenvalue, we use a continuation argument, Krein-Rutman theorem as well as a Hopf Lemma and a maximum principle for the operator $L,$ which we derive in this paper.</description>

      <title>The missing proof of Paley's theorem about lacunary coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1407.1458</link>
      <description>arXiv:1407.1458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We modify the standard proof of Paley's theorem about lacunary coefficients of functions in $H^1$ to work without analytic factorization. This leads to the first direct proof of the extension of Paley's theorem that we applied to the former Littlewood conjecture about $L^1$ norms of exponential sums.</description>

      <title>A study guide for "Trilinear smoothing inequalities and a variant of the triangular Hilbert transform"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article is a study guide for "Trilinear smoothing inequalities and a variant of the triangular Hilbert transform" by Christ, Durcik, and Roos. We first present the standard techniques in the study of oscillatory integrals with the simpler toy model of a Hilbert transform along a parabola. These standard techniques prove to be insufficient in the study of the triangular Hilbert transform with curvature. The central and novel idea in their proof of the $L^p$-boundedness of the triangular Hilbert transform with curvature is a trilinear smoothing inequality which we also examine in this article.</description>

      <title>Morse index theorem for heteroclinic, homoclinic and halfclinic orbits of Lagrangian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.08643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2004.08643v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to prove a new and general version of the Morse index theorem for heteroclinic, homoclinic and halfclinic solutions of general Lagrangian systems.
  In the last section we compute the Morse index of some heteroclinic and halfclinic solutions of some classical mechanical systems like the mathematical pendulum, the Nagumo equation and a competition-diffusion system in dimension 4.</description>

      <title>Schur property for jump parts of gradient measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08396v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider weakly null sequences in the Banach space of functions of bounded variation $\mathrm{BV}(\mathbb{R}^d)$. We prove that for any such sequence $\{f_n\}$ the jump parts of the gradients of functions $f_n$ tend to $0$ strongly as measures. It implies that Dunford--Pettis property for the space $\mathrm{SBV}$ is equivalent to the Dunford--Pettis property for the Sobolev space $W^{1,1}.$</description>
