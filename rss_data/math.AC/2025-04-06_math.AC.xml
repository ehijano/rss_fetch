      <title>$F$-purity deforms to perfectoid purity in Gorenstein domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that if $(A,\mathfrak{m})$ is a local ring of mixed characteristic $(0,p)$ and $A/pA$ is an analytically irreducible $F$-pure Gorenstein domain, then $A$ is perfectoid pure. Along the way, we give a list of sufficient conditions for a complete Gorenstein local domain of mixed characteristic to be the completion of a splinter.</description>

      <title>On the algebraic degree stability of vectorial Boolean functions when restricted to affine subspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the behaviour of the algebraic degree of vectorial Boolean functions when their inputs are restricted to an affine subspace of their domain. Functions which maintain their degree on all subspaces of as high a codimension as possible are particularly interesting for cryptographic applications.
  For functions which are power functions $x^d$ in their univariate representation, we fully characterize the exponents $d$ for which the algebraic degree of the function stays unchanged when the input is restricted to spaces of codimension 1 or 2. For codimensions $k\ge 3$, we give a sufficient condition for the algebraic degree to stay unchanged. We apply these results to the multiplicative inverse function, as well as to the Kasami functions. We define an optimality notion regarding the stability of the degree on subspaces, and determine a number of optimal functions, including the multiplicative inverse function and the quadratic APN functions.
  We also give an explicit formula for counting the functions that keep their algebraic degree unchanged when restricted to hyperplanes.</description>

      <title>Further results on Artin approximation, for group-actions on mapping-germs Maps(X,Y) and for quivers of maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider (analytic, resp. algebraic) map-germs, Maps((k^n,o),(k^m,o)). These germs are traditionally studied up to the right, let-right and contact equivalences. Below G is one of these groups. An important tool in this study is the Artin approximation: any formal G-equivalence of maps is approximated by ordinary (i.e. analytic, resp. algebraic) G-equivalence. We consider maps of (analytic, resp. algebraic) scheme-germs, with arbitrary singularities, Maps(X,Y), and establish stronger versions of this property (for G): the Strong Artin approximation and the P\l oski approximation. As a preliminary step we study the contact equivalence for maps with singular targets.
  In many cases one works with multi-germs of spaces, and with their ``muti-maps". More generally, ``quivers of map-germs" occur in various applications. The needed tools are the Strong Artin approximation for quivers and the P\l oski version. We establish these for directed rooted trees.</description>

      <title>Generalised power series determined by linear recurrence relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.04126v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1882, Kronecker established that a given univariate formal Laurent series over a field can be expressed as a fraction of two univariate polynomials if and only if the coefficients of the series satisfy a linear recurrence relation. We introduce the notion of generalised linear recurrence relations for power series with exponents in an arbitrary ordered abelian group, and generalise Kronecker's original result. In particular, we obtain criteria for determining whether a multivariate formal Laurent series lies in the fraction field of the corresponding polynomial ring. Moreover, we study distinguished algebraic substructures of a power series field, which are determined by generalised linear recurrence relations. In particular, we identify generalised linear recurrence relations that determine power series fields satisfying additional properties which are essential for the study of their automorphism groups.</description>

      <title>Perfectoid towers generated from prisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a unified construction of perfectoid towers from specific prisms which covers all the previous constructions of (p-torsion-free) perfectoid towers. By virtue of the construction, perfectoid towers can be systematically constructed for a large class of rings with Frobenius lift. Especially, any Frobenius lifting of a reduced $\mathbb{F}_p$-algebra has a perfectoid tower.</description>

      <title>Results on left-right approximation for algebraic morphisms and for analytic morphisms of weakly finite singularity type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01521v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The classical Artin approximation (AP) reads: any formal solution of a system of (analytic, resp. algebraic) equations of implicit function type is approximated by ``ordinary" solutions (i.e. analytic, resp. algebraic). Morphisms of scheme-germs, e.g. Maps((k^n,o),(k^m,o)) are usually studied up to the left-right equivalence. The natural question is the left-right version of Artin approximation: when is the formal left-right equivalence of morphisms approximated by the ``ordinary" (i.e. analytic, resp. algebraic) equivalence? In this case the standard Artin approximation is not directly applicable, as the involved (functional) equations are not of implicit function type. Moreover, the na\"ive extension does not hold in the analytic case, because of Osgood-Gabrielov-Shiota examples. The left-right version of Artin approximation (LRAP) was established by M. Shiota for morphisms that are either Nash or [real-analytic and of finite singularity type]. We establish LRAP and its stronger version of P\l oski (LRAPP) for Maps(X,Y) where X,Y are analytic/algebraic germs of schemes of any characteristic. More precisely: * LRAP, LRAPP, the inverse Artin approximation (and its P\l oski's version) hold for algebraic morphisms and for finite analytic morphisms. * LRAP holds for analytic morphisms of weakly-finite singularity type. (For char&gt;0 we impose certain integrability condition.)
  This latter class of morphisms of ``weakly-finite singularity type" (which we introduce) is of separate importance. It extends naturally the traditional class of morphisms of ``finite singularity type", while preserving their non-pathological behavior. The definition goes via the higher critical loci and higher discriminants of morphisms with singular targets.
  We establish basic properties of these critical loci. In particular: any map is finitely (right) determined by its higher critical loci.</description>
