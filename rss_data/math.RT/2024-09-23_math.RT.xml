      <title>Divided Power Integral forms of Affine Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we shall prove that the integral subalgebra generated by the divided powers of the Drinfeld generators of an affine Kac-Moody algebra is an integral form. We compare this integral form with the analogous one derived from the Chevalley generators studied by Mitzman and Garland. We shall prove that the integral forms coincide outside the twisted A type, and that it is strictly smaller in the latter case. Moreover, if the rank of the algebra is greater than one, a completely new fact emerges: the subalgebra generated by the imaginary vectors is, in fact, not a polynomial algebra, and we describe its structure. To address this problem, we introduce two other integral forms in the low-rank case in order to obtain the desired polynomial property.</description>

      <title>Discrete series L-packets for real reductive groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a modern exposition of the construction, parameterization, and character relations for discrete series L-packets of real reductive groups, which are fundamental results due to Langlands and Shelstad. This exposition incorporates recent developments not present in the original sources, such as normalized geometric transfer factors and the canonical double covers of tori and endoscopic groups, allowing for simpler statements and proofs. We also prove some new results, such as a simple criterion for detecting generic representations for a prescribed Whittaker datum, and an explicit formula for the factor $\Delta_I$ in terms of covers of tori.</description>

      <title>Extraspecial pairs in the multiply-laced root systems and calculating structure constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notions of {\it special} and {\it extraspecial pairs} of roots were introduced by Carter for calculating structure constants, \cite{Ca72}. Let $\{r, s\}$ be a special pair of roots for which the structure constant $N(r,s)$ is sought, and let $\{r_1, s_1\}$ be the extraspecial pair of roots corresponding to $\{r, s\}$. Consider the ordered set $\{r_1, r, s, s_1\}$, we will call such a set a {\it quartet}. Studying the different quartets allows us to gain additional insight into the internal structure of the root system. Quartet $q$ is said to be {\it simple} if it satisfies the following properties: if $s-r_1$ (resp. $r-r_1$) is a root, then $\mid{s-r_1}\mid = \mid{s}\mid$ (resp. $\mid{r-r_1}\mid = \mid{r}\mid$). It is proved that any quartet in $B_n$ and $C_n$ is simple. As a result, the calculation formula for $B_n$ coincides with the formula for the simply-laced case. The calculation formula for $C_n$ differs from simply-laced case by a certain parameter, which depends only on the extraspecial pair $\{r_1, s_1\}$. For the case $F_4$, there are $48$ quartets, of which $38$ are simple. The implementation in Python of algorithms for obtaining special and extraspecial pairs and calculating structure constants is given.</description>

      <title>Hidden Activations Are Not Enough: A General Approach to Neural Network Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel mathematical framework for analyzing neural networks using tools from quiver representation theory. This framework enables us to quantify the similarity between a new data sample and the training data, as perceived by the neural network. By leveraging the induced quiver representation of a data sample, we capture more information than traditional hidden layer outputs. This quiver representation abstracts away the complexity of the computations of the forward pass into a single matrix, allowing us to employ simple geometric and statistical arguments in a matrix space to study neural network predictions. Our mathematical results are architecture-agnostic and task-agnostic, making them broadly applicable. As proof of concept experiments, we apply our results for the MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets on the problem of detecting adversarial examples on different MLP architectures and several adversarial attack methods. Our experiments can be reproduced with our \href{https://github.com/MarcoArmenta/Hidden-Activations-are-not-Enough}{publicly available repository}.</description>

      <title>Infinite-dimensional Lie bialgebras via affinization of perm bialgebras and pre-Lie bialgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known that the operads of perm algebras and pre-Lie algebras are the Koszul dual each other and hence there is a Lie algebra structure on the tensor product of a perm algebra and a pre-Lie algebra. Conversely, we construct a special perm algebra structure and a special pre-Lie algebra structure on the vector space of Laurent polynomials such that the tensor product with a pre-Lie algebra and a perm algebra being a Lie algebra structure characterizes the pre-Lie algebra and the perm algebra respectively. This is called the affinization of a pre-Lie algebra and a perm algebra respectively. Furthermore we extend such correspondences to the context of bialgebras, that is, there is a bialgebra structure for a perm algebra or a pre-Lie algebra which could be characterized by the fact that its affinization by a quadratic pre-Lie algebra or a quadratic perm algebra respectively gives an infinite-dimensional Lie bialgebra. In the case of perm algebras, the corresponding bialgebra structure is called a perm bialgebra, which can be independently characterized by a Manin triple of perm algebras as well as a matched pair of perm algebras. The notion of the perm Yang-Baxter equation is introduced, whose symmetric solutions give rise to perm bialgebras. There is a correspondence between symmetric solutions of the perm Yang-Baxter equation in perm algebras and certain skew-symmetric solutions of the classical Yang-Baxter equation in the infinite-dimensional Lie algebras induced from the perm algebras. In the case of pre-Lie algebras, the corresponding bialgebra structure is a pre-Lie bialgebra which is well-constructed. The similar correspondences for the related structures are given.</description>

      <title>Persistence module and Schubert calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A multiplication on persistence diagrams is introduced by means of Schubert calculus. The key observation behind this multiplication comes from the fact that the representation space of persistence modules has the structure of the Schubert decomposition of a flag. In particular, isomorphism classes of persistence modules correspond to Schubert cells, thereby the Schubert calculus naturally defines a multiplication on persistence diagrams. The meaning of the multiplication on persistence diagrams is carried over from that on Schubert calculus, i.e., algebro-geometric intersections of varieties of persistence modules.</description>

      <title>Relaxed Highest Weight Modules from $\mathcal{D}$-Modules on the Kashiwara Flag Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06342</link>
      <description>arXiv:1607.06342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The relaxed highest weight representations introduced by Feigin et al. are a class of representations of the affine Kac-Moody algebra $\hat{\mathfrak{sl}_2}$, which do not have a highest (or lowest) weight. We formulate a generalization of this notion for an arbitrary affine Kac-Moody algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. We then realize induced $\mathfrak{g}$-modules of this type and their duals as global sections of twisted $\mathcal{D}$-modules on the Kashiwara flag scheme $X$ associated to $\mathfrak{g}$. The $\mathcal{D}$-modules that appear in our construction are direct images from subschemes of $X$ that are intersections of finite dimensional Schubert cells with their translate by a simple reflection. Besides the twist $\lambda$, they depend on a complex number describing the monodromy of the local systems we construct on these intersections. We describe the global sections of the $*$-direct images as a module over the Cartan subalgebra of $\mathfrak{g}$ and show that the higher cohomology vanishes. We obtain a complete description of the cohomology groups of the direct images as $\mathfrak{g}$-modules in the following two cases. First, we address the case when the intersection is isomorphic to $\mathbb{G}_{\text{m}}$. Second, we address the case of the $*$-direct image from an arbitrary intersection when the twist is regular antidominant and the monodromy is trivial. For the proof of this case we introduce an auto-equivalence of the category of $\mathcal{D}$-modules $\text{Hol}(\lambda)$ induced by the automorphism of $X$ defined by a lift of a simple reflection. These results describe for the first time explicit non-highest weight $\mathfrak{g}$-modules as global sections on the Kashiwara flag scheme and extend several results of Kashiwara-Tanisaki to the case of relaxed highest weight representations.</description>

      <title>The Knutson Index of the Representation Ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.08123v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study if, for a given simple module over a Hopf algebra, there exists a virtual module such that their tensor product is the regular module. This is related to a conjecture by Donald Knutson, later disproved and refined by Savitskii, stating that for every irreducible character of a finite group, there exists a virtual character such that their tensor product is the regular character. We also introduce the Knutson Index as a measure of Knutson's Conjecture failure, discuss its algebraic properties and present counter-examples to Savitskii's Conjecture.</description>

Abstract: We study silting objects over derived preprojective algebras of acyclic quivers by giving a direct relationship between silting objects, spherical twist functors and mutations. Especially, for a Dynkin quiver, we establish a bijection between the elements of the braid group and the set of isomorphism classes of basic silting objects over the derived preprojective algebra.</description>

Abstract: It is proven that if a finite group $G$ has a normal subgroup $H$ with $p'$-index (where $p$ is a prime) and $G/H$ is solvable, then for a $p$-subgroup $P$ of $H$, if the Scott $kH$-module with vertex $P$ is Brauer indecomposable, then so is the Scott $kG$-module with vertex $P$, where $k$ is a field of characteristic $p&gt;0$. This has several applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note we develop a systematic combinatorial definition for constructed earlier supersymmetric polynomial families. These polynomial families generalize canonical Schur, Jack and Macdonald families so that the new polynomials depend on odd Grassmann variables as well. Members of these families are labeled by respective modifications of Young diagrams. We show that the super-Macdonald polynomials form a representation of a super-algebra analog $\mathsf{T}(\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}_{1|1})$ of Ding-Ioahara-Miki (quantum toroidal) algebra, emerging as a BPS algebra of D-branes on a conifold. A supersymmetric modification for Young tableaux and Kostka numbers are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Frobenius algebra objects in Temperley-Lieb categories at roots of unity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a new definition of a Frobenius structure on an algebra object in a monoidal category, generalising Frobenius algebras in the category of vector spaces. Our definition allows Frobenius forms valued in objects other than the unit object, and can be seen as a categorical version of Frobenius extensions of the second kind. When the monoidal category is pivotal we define a Nakayama morphism for the Frobenius structure and explain what it means for this morphism to have finite order.
  Our main example is a well-studied algebra object in the (additive and idempotent completion of the) Temperley-Lieb category at a root of unity. We show that this algebra has a Frobenius structure and that its Nakayama morphism has order 2. As a consequence, we obtain information about Nakayama morphisms of preprojective algebras of Dynkin type, considered as algebras over the semisimple algebras on their vertices.</description>
