      <title>Multi-point Infection Dynamics of Hepatitis B in the Presence of Sub-Viral Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is considered as etiological agent of the lethal liver disease hepatitis B. Globally, hepatitis B is recognized as one of the prevailing infectious diseases with a significant impact on human health. In spite of being non-infectious in nature, sub-viral particles (SVPs) , composed with mainly viral surface proteins, play critical roles in the persistence and progression of the infection. Although the understanding on the functions of these non-infectious SVPs remains limited and incomplete. In this study, a mathematical model is proposed for the first time by incorporating the roles of SVPs and including the effects of capsids recycling. The impacts of spatial mobility of capsids, viruses, SVPs and antibodies are also taken into account in this model. Overall, this model carry unique characteristics in the context of this viral infection. This study investigates the changes in the dynamics of infection considering both single-point as well as multi-point infection initial condition. As a result, it is observed that SVPs can significantly enhance intracellular viral replication and gene expression by reducing the neutralization of virus particles by antibodies. The recycling of capsids substantially increase the concentration of SVPs. The experiments which are carried out on single-point as well as multi-point infection initial conditions show that if the liver is infected at more than one point, infection propagates rapidly. The outcomes of the proposed model strongly recommend that it is imperative to consider the diffusion term while HBV infection dynamics are illustrated.</description>

      <title>Random feature baselines provide distributional performance and feature selection benchmarks for clinical and 'omic ML</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying predictive features from high-dimensional datasets is a major task in biomedical research. However, it is difficult to determine the robustness of selected features. Here, we investigate the performance of randomly chosen features, what we term "random feature baselines" (RFBs), in the context of disease risk prediction from blood plasma proteomics data in the UK Biobank. We begin with two published case studies predicting diagnosis of (1) dementia and (2) hip fracture. RFBs perform similarly to published features of interest (using the same number of proteins, but randomly chosen). We then measure the performance of RFBs for all 607 disease outcomes in the UK Biobank, with various numbers of randomly chosen features, as well as all proteins in the dataset. 114/607 outcomes showed a higher mean AUROC when choosing 5 random features than using all proteins, and the absolute difference in mean AUC was 0.075. 163 outcomes showed a higher mean AUROC when choosing 1000 random features than using all proteins, and the absolute difference in mean AUC was 0.03. Incorporating RFBs should become part of ML practice when feature selection or target discovery is a goal.</description>

      <title>A Modular Open Source Framework for Genomic Variant Calling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variant calling is a fundamental task in genomic research, essential for detecting genetic variations such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertions or deletions (indels). This paper presents an enhancement to DeepChem, a widely used open-source drug discovery framework, through the integration of DeepVariant. In particular, we introduce a variant calling pipeline that leverages DeepVariant's convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to improve the accuracy and reliability of variant detection. The implemented pipeline includes stages for realignment of sequencing reads, candidate variant detection, and pileup image generation, followed by variant classification using a modified Inception v3 model. Our work adds a modular and extensible variant calling framework to the DeepChem framework and enables future work integrating DeepChem's drug discovery infrastructure more tightly with bioinformatics pipelines.</description>

      <title>Character-level Tokenizations as Powerful Inductive Biases for RNA Foundational Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RNA is a vital biomolecule with numerous roles and functions within cells, and interest in targeting it for therapeutic purposes has grown significantly in recent years. However, fully understanding and predicting RNA behavior, particularly for applications in drug discovery, remains a challenge due to the complexity of RNA structures and interactions. While foundational models in biology have demonstrated success in modeling several biomolecules, especially proteins, achieving similar breakthroughs for RNA has proven more difficult. Current RNA models have yet to match the performance observed in the protein domain, leaving an important gap in computational biology. In this work, we present ChaRNABERT, a suite of sample and parameter-efficient RNA foundational models, that through a learnable tokenization process, are able to reach state-of-the-art performance on several tasks in established benchmarks. We extend its testing in relevant downstream tasks such as RNA-protein and aptamer-protein interaction prediction. Weights and inference code for ChaRNABERT-8M will be provided for academic research use. The other models will be available upon request.</description>

      <title>Multi Scale Graph Neural Network for Alzheimer's Disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex, progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by extracellular A\b{eta} plaques, neurofibrillary tau tangles, glial activation, and neuronal degeneration, involving multiple cell types and pathways. Current models often overlook the cellular context of these pathways. To address this, we developed a multiscale graph neural network (GNN) model, ALZ PINNACLE, using brain omics data from donors spanning the entire aging to AD spectrum. ALZ PINNACLE is based on the PINNACLE GNN framework, which learns context-aware protein, cell type, and tissue representations within a unified latent space. ALZ PINNACLE was trained on 14,951 proteins, 206,850 protein interactions, 7 cell types, and 48 cell subtypes or states. After pretraining, we investigated the learned embedding of APOE, the largest genetic risk factor for AD, across different cell types. Notably, APOE embeddings showed high similarity in microglial, neuronal, and CD8 cells, suggesting a similar role of APOE in these cell types. Fine tuning the model on AD risk genes revealed cell type contexts predictive of the role of APOE in AD. Our results suggest that ALZ PINNACLE may provide a valuable framework for uncovering novel insights into AD neurobiology.</description>

      <title>Conformation Generation using Transformer Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating three-dimensional conformations of a molecular graph allows insight into the molecule's biological and chemical functions. Fast generation of valid conformations is thus central to molecular modeling. Recent advances in graph-based deep networks have accelerated conformation generation from hours to seconds. However, current network architectures do not scale well to large molecules. Here we present ConfFlow, a flow-based model for conformation generation based on transformer networks. In contrast with existing approaches, ConfFlow directly samples in the coordinate space without enforcing any explicit physical constraints. The generative procedure is highly interpretable and is akin to force field updates in molecular dynamics simulation. When applied to the generation of large molecule conformations, ConfFlow improve accuracy by up to $40\%$ relative to state-of-the-art learning-based methods. The source code is made available at https://github.com/IntelLabs/ConfFlow.</description>

      <title>GROOT: Effective Design of Biological Sequences with Limited Experimental Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Latent space optimization (LSO) is a powerful method for designing discrete, high-dimensional biological sequences that maximize expensive black-box functions, such as wet lab experiments. This is accomplished by learning a latent space from available data and using a surrogate model to guide optimization algorithms toward optimal outputs. However, existing methods struggle when labeled data is limited, as training the surrogate model with few labeled data points can lead to subpar outputs, offering no advantage over the training data itself. We address this challenge by introducing GROOT, a Graph-based Latent Smoothing for Biological Sequence Optimization. In particular, GROOT generates pseudo-labels for neighbors sampled around the training latent embeddings. These pseudo-labels are then refined and smoothed by Label Propagation. Additionally, we theoretically and empirically justify our approach, demonstrate GROOT's ability to extrapolate to regions beyond the training set while maintaining reliability within an upper bound of their expected distances from the training regions. We evaluate GROOT on various biological sequence design tasks, including protein optimization (GFP and AAV) and three tasks with exact oracles from Design-Bench. The results demonstrate that GROOT equalizes and surpasses existing methods without requiring access to black-box oracles or vast amounts of labeled data, highlighting its practicality and effectiveness. We release our code at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/GROOT-D554</description>

      <title>Graph Artificial Intelligence for Quantifying Compatibility Mechanisms in Traditional Chinese Medicine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) involves complex compatibility mechanisms characterized by multi-component and multi-target interactions, which are challenging to quantify. To address this challenge, we applied graph artificial intelligence to develop a TCM multi-dimensional knowledge graph that bridges traditional TCM theory and modern biomedical science (https://zenodo.org/records/13763953 ). Using feature engineering and embedding, we processed key TCM terminology and Chinese herbal pieces (CHP), introducing medicinal properties as virtual nodes and employing graph neural networks with attention mechanisms to model and analyze 6,080 Chinese herbal formulas (CHF). Our method quantitatively assessed the roles of CHP within CHF and was validated using 215 CHF designed for COVID-19 management. With interpretable models, open-source data, and code (https://github.com/ZENGJingqi/GraphAI-for-TCM ), this study provides robust tools for advancing TCM theory and drug discovery.</description>

      <title>SeqProFT: Applying LoRA Finetuning for Sequence-only Protein Property Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protein language models (PLMs) are capable of learning the relationships between protein sequences and functions by treating amino acid sequences as textual data in a self-supervised manner. However, fine-tuning these models typically demands substantial computational resources and time, with results that may not always be optimized for specific tasks. To overcome these challenges, this study employs the LoRA method to perform end-to-end fine-tuning of the ESM-2 model specifically for protein property prediction tasks, utilizing only sequence information. Additionally, a multi-head attention mechanism is integrated into the downstream network to combine sequence features with contact map information, thereby enhancing the model's comprehension of protein sequences. Experimental results of extensive classification and regression tasks demonstrate that the fine-tuned model achieves strong performance and faster convergence across multiple regression and classification tasks.</description>

      <title>Relating dynamics and structure of discrete and continuous time systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are many instances, in subjects such as biology, where a population number, or related quantity, changes in discrete time. For the population number at time $n=0,1,2,\ldots$, written $x_{n}$, we show that some exactly soluble cases of $x_{n}$ can be related to a different problem, where the number of individuals changes in continuous time. With $x(t)$ the population number at continuous time $t\geq0$, the relation is that $x(t=n)$ precisely coincides with $x_{n}$. In such a case, we call the two models 'equivalent', even though $x_{n}$ obeys a difference equation and $x(t)$ obeys a differential equation. Cases of equivalence can be found for both time homogeneous and time inhomogeneous equations.
  A comparison of the difference equation and the differential equation of the equivalent problem, allows us to make a correspondence between coefficients in these equations, thereby exposing structural similarities and differences of the two problems.
  When the equation that $x_{n}$ obeys is modified, e.g., by the introduction of time inhomogeneity, so $x_{n}$ has no exact solution, we show how to construct an approximate equivalent continuous time solution, $x^{(\mathrm{app})}(t)$. We find that $x^{(\mathrm{app})}(t=n)$ can yield a good approximation to $x_{n}$ because $x^{(\mathrm{app})}(t)$ encapsulates much of the behaviour of $x_{n}$.
  We note that some discrete time problems may have solutions with an oscillatory component that changes sign as $n\rightarrow n+1$. This occurs with the Fibonacci numbers. We find that the way an equivalent continuous time solution replicates this oscillatory behaviour is by becoming complex; it no longer represents a simple interpolation.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Robust Continual Graph Learning for Graph Classification in Biology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph classification is essential for understanding complex biological systems, where molecular structures and interactions are naturally represented as graphs. Traditional graph neural networks (GNNs) perform well on static tasks but struggle in dynamic settings due to catastrophic forgetting. We present Perturbed and Sparsified Continual Graph Learning (PSCGL), a robust and efficient continual graph learning framework for graph data classification, specifically targeting biological datasets. We introduce a perturbed sampling strategy to identify critical data points that contribute to model learning and a motif-based graph sparsification technique to reduce storage needs while maintaining performance. Additionally, our PSCGL framework inherently defends against graph backdoor attacks, which is crucial for applications in sensitive biological contexts. Extensive experiments on biological datasets demonstrate that PSCGL not only retains knowledge across tasks but also enhances the efficiency and robustness of graph classification models in biology.</description>

      <title>Multicellular simulations with shape and volume constraints using optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17086v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many living and physical systems such as cell aggregates, tissues or bacterial colonies behave as unconventional systems of particles that are strongly constrained by volume exclusion and shape interactions. Understanding how these constraints lead to macroscopic self-organized structures is a fundamental question in e.g. developmental biology. To this end, various types of computational models have been developed. Here, we introduce a new framework based on optimal transport theory to model particle systems with arbitrary dynamical shapes and deformability properties. Our method builds upon the pioneering work of Brenier on incompressible fluids and its recent applications to materials science. It lets us specify the shapes and volumes of individual cells and supports a wide range of interaction mechanisms, while automatically taking care of the volume exclusion constraint at an affordable numerical cost. We showcase the versatility of this approach by reproducing several classical systems in computational biology.

      <title>HeMiTo-dynamics: a characterisation of mammalian prion toxicity using non-dimensionalisation, linear stability and perturbation analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prion-like proteins play crucial parts in biological processes in organisms ranging from yeast to humans. For instance, many neurodegenerative diseases are believed to be caused by the production of prion-like proteins in neural tissue. As such, understanding the dynamics of prion-like protein production is a vital step toward treating neurodegenerative disease. Mathematical models of prion-like protein dynamics show great promise as a tool for predicting disease trajectories and devising better treatment strategies for prion-related diseases. Herein, we investigate a generic model for prion-like dynamics consisting of a class of non-linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs), establishing constraints through a linear stability analysis that enforce the expected properties of mammalian prion-like toxicity. Furthermore, we identify that prion toxicity evolves through three distinct phases for which we provide analytical descriptions using perturbation analyses. Specifically, prion-toxicity is initially characterised by the healthy phase, where the dynamics are dominated by the healthy form of prions, thereafter the system enters the mixed phase, where both healthy and toxic prions interact, and lastly, the system enters the toxic phase, where toxic prions dominate, and we refer to these phases as HeMiTo-dynamics. These findings hold the potential to aid researchers in developing precise mathematical models for prion-like dynamics, enabling them to better understand underlying mechanisms and devise effective treatments for prion-related diseases.</description>

      <title>Identifying Markov chain models from time-to-event data: an algebraic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many biological and medical questions can be modeled using time-to-event data in finite-state Markov chains, with the phase-type distribution describing intervals between events. We solve the inverse problem: given a phase-type distribution, can we identify the transition rate parameters of the underlying Markov chain? For a specific class of solvable Markov models, we show this problem has a unique solution up to finite symmetry transformations, and we outline a recursive method for computing symbolic solutions for these models across any number of states. Using the Thomas decomposition technique from computer algebra, we further provide symbolic solutions for any model. Interestingly, different models with the same state count but distinct transition graphs can yield identical phase-type distributions. To distinguish among these, we propose additional properties beyond just the time to the next event. We demonstrate the method's applicability by inferring transcriptional regulation models from single-cell transcription imaging data.</description>

Abstract: Divergent brain connectivity is thought to underlie the behavioral and cognitive symptoms observed in many neurodevelopmental disorders. Quantifying divergence from neurotypical connectivity patterns offers a promising pathway to inform diagnosis and therapeutic interventions. While advanced neuroimaging techniques, such as diffusion MRI (dMRI), have facilitated the mapping of brain's structural connectome, the challenge lies in accurately modeling developmental trajectories within these complex networked structures to create robust neurodivergence markers. In this work, we present the Brain Representation via Individualized Deep Generative Embedding (BRIDGE) framework, which integrates normative modeling with a bio-inspired deep generative model to create a reference trajectory of connectivity transformation as part of neurotypical development. This will enable the assessment of neurodivergence by comparing individuals to the established neurotypical trajectory. BRIDGE provides a global neurodivergence score based on the difference between connectivity-based brain age and chronological age, along with region-wise neurodivergence maps that highlight localized connectivity differences. Application of BRIDGE to a large cohort of children with autism spectrum disorder demonstrates that the global neurodivergence score correlates with clinical assessments in autism, and the regional map offers insights into the heterogeneity at the individual level in neurodevelopmental disorders. Together, the neurodivergence score and map form powerful tools for quantifying developmental divergence in connectivity patterns, advancing the development of imaging markers for personalized diagnosis and intervention in various clinical contexts.</description>
