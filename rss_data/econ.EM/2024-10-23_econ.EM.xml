      <title>Identifying Conduct Parameters with Separable Demand: A Counterexample to Lau (1982)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a counterexample to the conduct parameter identification result established in the foundational work of Lau (1982), which generalizes the identification theorem of Bresnahan (1982) by relaxing the linearity assumptions. We identify a separable demand function that still permits identification and validate this case both theoretically and through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>General Seemingly Unrelated Local Projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a framework for efficiently estimating impulse response functions with Local Projections (LPs). Our approach offers a Bayesian treatment for LPs with Instrumental Variables, accommodating multiple shocks and instruments per shock, accounts for autocorrelation in multi-step forecasts by jointly modeling all LPs as a seemingly unrelated system of equations, defines a flexible yet parsimonious joint prior for impulse responses based on a Gaussian Process, allows for joint inference about the entire vector of impulse responses, and uses all available data across horizons by imputing missing values.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Perspective on the Maximum Score Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a Bayesian inference framework for a linear index threshold-crossing binary choice model that satisfies a median independence restriction. The key idea is that the model is observationally equivalent to a probit model with nonparametric heteroskedasticity. Consequently, Gibbs sampling techniques from Albert and Chib (1993) and Chib and Greenberg (2013) lead to a computationally attractive Bayesian inference procedure in which a Gaussian process forms a conditionally conjugate prior for the natural logarithm of the skedastic function.</description>

      <title>Conformal Predictive Portfolio Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores portfolio selection using predictive models for portfolio returns. Portfolio selection is a fundamental task in finance, and various methods have been developed to achieve this goal. For example, the mean-variance approach constructs portfolios by balancing the trade-off between the mean and variance of asset returns, while the quantile-based approach optimizes portfolios by accounting for tail risk. These traditional methods often rely on distributional information estimated from historical data. However, a key concern is the uncertainty of future portfolio returns, which may not be fully captured by simple reliance on historical data, such as using the sample average. To address this, we propose a framework for predictive portfolio selection using conformal inference, called Conformal Predictive Portfolio Selection (CPPS). Our approach predicts future portfolio returns, computes corresponding prediction intervals, and selects the desirable portfolio based on these intervals. The framework is flexible and can accommodate a variety of predictive models, including autoregressive (AR) models, random forests, and neural networks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our CPPS framework using an AR model and validate its performance through empirical studies, showing that it provides superior returns compared to simpler strategies.</description>

      <title>A Dynamic Spatiotemporal and Network ARCH Model with Common Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a dynamic spatiotemporal volatility model that extends traditional approaches by incorporating spatial, temporal, and spatiotemporal spillover effects, along with volatility-specific observed and latent factors. The model offers a more general network interpretation, making it applicable for studying various types of network spillovers. The primary innovation lies in incorporating volatility-specific latent factors into the dynamic spatiotemporal volatility model. Using Bayesian estimation via the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, the model offers a robust framework for analyzing the spatial, temporal, and spatiotemporal effects of a log-squared outcome variable on its volatility. We recommend using the deviance information criterion (DIC) and a regularized Bayesian MCMC method to select the number of relevant factors in the model. The model's flexibility is demonstrated through two applications: a spatiotemporal model applied to the U.S. housing market and another applied to financial stock market networks, both highlighting the model's ability to capture varying degrees of interconnectedness. In both applications, we find strong spatial/network interactions with relatively stronger spillover effects in the stock market.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric inference on counterfactuals in first-price auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.13856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.13856v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a classical model of the first-price sealed-bid auction with independent private values, we develop nonparametric estimators for several policy-relevant targets, such as the bidder's surplus and auctioneer's revenue under counterfactual reserve prices. Motivated by the linearity of these targets in the quantile function of bidders' values, we propose an estimator of the latter and derive its Bahadur-Kiefer expansion. This makes it possible to construct uniform confidence bands and test complex hypotheses about the auction design. Using the data on U.S. Forest Service timber auctions, we test whether setting zero reserve prices in these auctions was revenue maximizing.</description>

      <title>Identification with possibly invalid IVs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03990v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel identification strategy relying on quasi-instrumental variables (quasi-IVs). A quasi-IV is a relevant but possibly invalid IV because it is not exogenous or not excluded. We show that a variety of models with discrete or continuous endogenous treatment which are usually identified with an IV - quantile models with rank invariance, additive models with homogenous treatment effects, and local average treatment effect models - can be identified under the joint relevance of two complementary quasi-IVs instead. To achieve identification, we complement one excluded but possibly endogenous quasi-IV (e.g., "relevant proxies" such as lagged treatment choice) with one exogenous (conditional on the excluded quasi-IV) but possibly included quasi-IV (e.g., random assignment or exogenous market shocks). Our approach also holds if any of the two quasi-IVs turns out to be a valid IV. In practice, being able to address endogeneity with complementary quasi-IVs instead of IVs is convenient since there are many applications where quasi-IVs are more readily available. Difference-in-differences is a notable example: time is an exogenous quasi-IV while the group assignment acts as a complementary excluded quasi-IV.</description>

      <title>Identifying and exploiting alpha in linear asset pricing models with strong, semi-strong, and latent factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02217v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The risk premia of traded factors are the sum of factor means and a parameter vector we denote by {\phi} which is identified from the cross section regression of alpha of individual securities on the vector of factor loadings. If phi is non-zero one can construct "phi-portfolios" which exploit the systematic components of non-zero alpha. We show that for known values of betas and when phi is non-zero there exist phi-portfolios that dominate mean-variance portfolios. The paper then proposes a two-step bias corrected estimator of phi and derives its asymptotic distribution allowing for idiosyncratic pricing errors, weak missing factors, and weak error cross-sectional dependence. Small sample results from extensive Monte Carlo experiments show that the proposed estimator has the correct size with good power properties. The paper also provides an empirical application to a large number of U.S. securities with risk factors selected from a large number of potential risk factors according to their strength and constructs phi-portfolios and compares their Sharpe ratios to mean variance and S&amp;P 500 portfolio.</description>

      <title>Predicting the Distribution of Treatment Effects: A Covariate-Adjustment Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Important questions for impact evaluation require knowledge not only of average effects, but of the distribution of treatment effects. What proportion of people are harmed? Does a policy help many by a little? Or a few by a lot? The inability to observe individual counterfactuals makes these empirical questions challenging. I propose an approach to inference on points of the distribution of treatment effects by incorporating predicted counterfactuals through covariate adjustment. I show that finite-sample inference is valid under weak assumptions, for example, when data come from a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT), and that large-sample inference is asymptotically exact under suitable conditions. Finally, I revisit five RCTs in microcredit where average effects are not statistically significant and find evidence of both positive and negative treatment effects in household income. On average across studies, at least 13.6% of households benefited, and 12.5% were negatively affected.</description>

      <title>Enhanced power enhancements for testing many moment equalities: Beyond the $2$- and $\infty$-norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contemporary testing problems in statistics are increasingly complex, i.e., high-dimensional. Tests based on the $2$- and $\infty$-norm have received considerable attention in such settings, as they are powerful against dense and sparse alternatives, respectively. The power enhancement principle of Fan et al. (2015) combines these two norms to construct improved tests that are powerful against both types of alternatives. In the context of testing whether a candidate parameter satisfies a large number of moment equalities, we construct a test that harnesses the strength of all $p$-norms with $p\in[2, \infty]$. As a result, this test is consistent against strictly more alternatives than any test based on a single $p$-norm. In particular, our test is consistent against more alternatives than tests based on the $2$- and $\infty$-norm, which is what most implementations of the power enhancement principle target.
  We illustrate the scope of our general results by using them to construct a test that simultaneously dominates the Anderson-Rubin test (based on $p=2$), tests based on the $\infty$-norm and power enhancement based combinations of these in terms of consistency in the linear instrumental variable model with many instruments.</description>

      <title>On the power properties of inference for parameters with interval identified sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the power properties of confidence intervals (CIs) for a partially-identified parameter of interest with an interval identified set. We assume the researcher has bounds estimators to construct the CIs proposed by Stoye (2009), referred to as CI1, CI2, and CI3. We also assume that these estimators are "ordered": the lower bound estimator is less than or equal to the upper bound estimator.
  Under these conditions, we establish two results. First, we show that CI1 and CI2 are equally powerful, and both dominate CI3. Second, we consider a favorable situation in which there are two possible bounds estimators to construct these CIs, and one is more efficient than the other. One would expect that the more efficient bounds estimator yields more powerful inference. We prove that this desirable result holds for CI1 and CI2, but not necessarily for CI3.</description>

      <title>The Transmission of Monetary Policy via Common Cycles in the Euro Area</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use a FAVAR model with proxy variables and sign restrictions to investigate the role of the euro area's common output and inflation cycles in the transmission of monetary policy shocks. Our findings indicate that common cycles explain most of the variation in output and inflation across member countries. However, Southern European economies exhibit a notable divergence from these cycles in the aftermath of the financial crisis. Building on this evidence, we demonstrate that monetary policy is homogeneously propagated to member countries via the common cycles. In contrast, country-specific transmission channels lead to heterogeneous country responses to monetary policy shocks. Consequently, our empirical results suggest that the divergent effects of ECB monetary policy are attributable to heterogeneous country-specific exposures to financial markets, rather than to dis-synchronized economies within the euro area.</description>

      <title>Data-driven fixed-point tuning for truncated realized variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00905v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many methods for estimating integrated volatility and related functionals of semimartingales in the presence of jumps require specification of tuning parameters for their use in practice. In much of the available theory, tuning parameters are assumed to be deterministic and their values are specified only up to asymptotic constraints. However, in empirical work and in simulation studies, they are typically chosen to be random and data-dependent, with explicit choices often relying entirely on heuristics. In this paper, we consider novel data-driven tuning procedures for the truncated realized variations of a semimartingale with jumps based on a type of random fixed-point iteration. Being effectively automated, our approach alleviates the need for delicate decision-making regarding tuning parameters in practice and can be implemented using information regarding sampling frequency alone. We demonstrate our methods can lead to asymptotically efficient estimation of integrated volatility and exhibit superior finite-sample performance compared to popular alternatives in the literature.</description>
