      <title>Measurements of Angular Distributions of Drell-Yan Dimuons in $p+p$ and $p+d$ Interactions at 120 GeV/$c$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present experimental results on the angular distributions of Drell-Yan muons produced by a 120 GeV/$c$ proton beam interacting with liquid hydrogen and deuterium targets. The dimuon angular distributions in both polar ($\theta$) and azimuthal ($\phi$) angles in the Collins-Soper frame are measured within the kinematic range of $4.5 &lt; m_{\mu\mu} &lt; 10\ \mathrm{GeV}/c^2$, $0.19 &lt; p_T &lt; 2.24\ \mathrm{GeV}/c$, and $0 &lt; x_F &lt; 0.95$. Unlike the results of a previous proton-induced Drell-Yan experiment at a higher energy, the data reveal a pronounced $\cos 2\phi$ modulation in the angular distributions. Comparison with perturbative QCD (pQCD) predictions shows statistically significant deviations, with p-values of 3.5\% for the $p+p$ and 1.5\% for the $p+d$ Drell-Yan processes. These results suggest the presence of nonperturbative QCD contributions.</description>

      <title>Analysis of $M1$ capture in the $\alpha(d,\gamma)^6$Li reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An effective operator is exactly equivalent to the long-wavelength form of the $M1$ operator in transition matrix elements. It allows us to analytically and numerically analyze the $M1$ contribution to the $\alpha(d,\gamma)^6$Li reaction. Isoscalar $M1$ transitions from an initial $S$ wave are shown to be forbidden in radiative capture reactions when distortion is neglected in the initial state. A calculation in a three-body model with proton, neutron, and a structureless $\alpha$ interacting through effective forces leads to a negligible $M1$ $S$-factor at small energies. The dominant $M1$ contribution comes from transitions from an initial $S$ wave to isospin 1 components of the $^6$Li ground state. It is suggested that using this effective $M1$ operator in other models should clarify the origin of large discrepancies between $M1$ $S$-factors appearing in the literature.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic geometry in hadron resonance gas model at real and imaginary baryon chemical potential and a simple sufficient condition for quark deconfinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thermodynamic geometry of the hadron resonance gas model with (without) excluded volume effects (EVE) of baryons is investigated. The case with imaginary mu, where mu is the baryon chemical potential, is investigated as well as the one with real mu. We calculate the scalar curvature R and use the R=0 criterion to investigate the phase structure in the mu^2-T plane where T is the temperature. The curve on which R=0 continues analytically from the imaginary mu region, where the lattice QCD is feasible, to the real mu one. In the presence of EVE, there are rich phase structures in the large real mu region as well as the Roberge-Weiss like region where mu is imaginary and a singularity appears, while there is no phase structure in the large real $\mu$ region in the absence of EVE. The limitation temperature of the baryon gas is also obtained by using the baryon number fluctuation. The LQCD predicted critical point locates almost on the curve of the limitation temperature we determined. A simple sufficient condition, n_B&gt;1/(2v_B)$, is obtained for the quark deconfinement in the large real mu region, where n_B and v_B are the net baryon number density and the volume of a baryon, respectively.</description>

      <title>Universal relation between dipole polarizability of finite nuclei and neutron-star compactness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nuclear equation of state, which determines the structure and properties of neutron stars, remains subject to substantial theoretical uncertainties, leading to model dependence in predicted observables. Universal relations have emerged as a powerful tool to mitigate this dependence by linking neutron star observables in a framework-independent manner. In this work, we introduce a new universal relation that \emph{bridges} finite nuclei and neutron stars through the dimensionless quantity $\zeta = \beta_{1.4}\tilde{L}^{-1}$, which couples the compactness of a $1.4~M_{\odot}$ neutron star to the slope of the nuclear symmetry energy at saturation. The relation is examined under a broad set of relativistic energy density functionals with point-coupling and meson-exchange interactions, as well as non-relativistic Skyrme functionals. We demonstrate that $\zeta$ exhibits a strong exponential correlation with the electric dipole polarizability $\alpha_D$ in finite nuclei across all considered equations of state. By exploiting experimental $\alpha_D$ data for selected neutron-rich nuclei, we constrain $\zeta$ and translate these constraints into equation-of-state-independent bounds on the neutron star radius $R_{1.4}$ and the symmetry-energy slope $L$, providing insights into the properties of neutron star matter.</description>

      <title>Neutron spectrum measurement in the Yemi underground laboratory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the measurement of neutron energy spectra at the newly established Yemi Underground Laboratory (Yemilab) in the Republic of Korea, designed to host dark matter and rare-event search experiments. A high-sensitivity neutron spectrometer was employed, consisting of ten cylindrical {}^{3}He proportional counters, eight of which were embedded in cylindrical high-density polyethylene moderators of various sizes. To quantify and mitigate contributions from internal \alpha-backgrounds, each detector underwent a dedicated background measurement using a cadmium-shielded box. These backgrounds, primarily originating from trace amounts of U and Th in the stainless-steel housings, were characterized and subtracted during data analysis. Neutron measurements were carried out at three locations within the Yemilab between March to October 2023. After waveform-based event selection and correction for \alphasym-backgrounds, neutron count rates were estimated and corresponding energy spectra were reconstructed using the unfolding method. The total neutron fluence rates were measured ranged from (3.24 $\pm$ 0.11) to (4.01 $\pm$ 0.10) $\times~10^{-5}~ {cm}^{-2}~{s}^{-1}$, with thermal and fast neutron components (1 - 10 MeV) ranging from (1.32 $\pm$ 0.05) to (1.51 $\pm$ 0.05) $\times 10^{-5}~{cm}^{-2}~{s}^{-1}$ and (0.27 $\pm$ 0.03) to (0.34 $\pm$ 0.10) $\times~10^{-5}~{cm}^{-2}~{s}^{-1}$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Evidence for the collective nature of radial flow in Pb+Pb collisions with the ATLAS detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anisotropic flow and radial flow are two key probes of the expansion dynamics and properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). While anisotropic flow has been extensively studied, radial flow, which governs the system's radial expansion, has received less attention. Notably, experimental evidence for the global and collective nature of radial flow has been lacking. This Letter presents the first measurement of transverse momentum ($p_{\mathrm{T}}$) dependence of radial flow fluctuations ($v_0(p_{\mathrm{T}})$) over $0.5&lt;p_{\mathrm{T}}&lt;10$ GeV, using a two-particle correlation method in Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}=5.02$ TeV. The data reveal three key features supporting the collective nature of radial flow: long-range correlation in pseudorapidity, factorization in $p_{\mathrm{T}}$, and centrality-independent shape in $p_{\mathrm{T}}$. The comparison with a hydrodynamic model demonstrates the sensitivity of $v_0(p_{\mathrm{T}})$ to bulk viscosity, a crucial transport property of the QGP. These findings establish a new, powerful tool for probing collective dynamics and properties of the QGP.</description>
