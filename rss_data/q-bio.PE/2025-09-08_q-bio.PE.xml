      <title>Integrating upstream and downstream reciprocity stabilizes cooperator-defector coexistence in N-player giving games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human cooperation persists among strangers despite theoretical predictions of difficulties in large, well-mixed populations, leaving a fundamental evolutionary puzzle. While upstream (pay-it-forward: helping others because you were helped) and downstream (rewarding-reputation: helping those with good reputations) indirect reciprocity have been independently considered as solutions, their joint dynamics in multiplayer contexts remain unexplored. We study N-player giving games with benefit b and cost c and analyze evolutionary dynamics for three strategies: unconditional cooperation (X), unconditional defection (Y), and an integrated reciprocal strategy (Z) combining unconditional forwarding with reputation-based discrimination. We show that integrating upstream and downstream reciprocity can yield a globally asymptotically stable mixed equilibrium of unconditional defectors and integrated reciprocators whenever the benefit-to-cost ratio exceeds a threshold (b/c &gt; 2). Counterintuitively, introducing small complexity costs, rather than destabilizing, stabilizes the equilibrium by preventing not only unconditional cooperators (viewed as second-order freeloaders) but also alternative conditional strategies from invading. While the equilibrium frequency of integrated reciprocators decreases with group size N, it remains positive for any finite N. Rather than requiring uniformity, our model reveals one pathway to stable cooperation through strategic diversity. Defectors serve as "evolutionary shields" preventing system collapse while integrated reciprocators flexibly combine open and discriminative responses. This framework demonstrates how pay-it-forward chains and reputation systems can jointly maintain social polymorphism including cooperation despite cognitive limitations and group size challenges, offering a potential evolutionary foundation for behavioral diversity in human societies.</description>

      <title>Revealing the building blocks of tree balance: fundamental units of the Sackin and Colless Indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decades, more than 25 phylogenetic tree balance indices and several families of such indices have been proposed in the literature -- some of which even contain infinitely many members. It is well established that different indices have different strengths and perform unequally across application scenarios. For example, power analyses have shown that the ability of an index to detect the generative model of a given phylogenetic tree varies significantly between indices. This variation in performance motivates the ongoing search for new and possibly \enquote{better} (im)balance indices. An easy way to generate a new index is to construct a compound index, e.g., a linear combination of established indices.
  Two of the most prominent and widely used imbalance indices in this context are the Sackin index and the Colless index. In this study, we show that these classic indices are themselves compound in nature: they can be decomposed into more elementary components that independently satisfy the defining properties of a tree (im)balance index. We further show that the difference Colless minus Sackin results in another imbalance index that is minimized (amongst others) by all Colless minimal trees. Conversely, the difference Sackin minus Colless forms a balance index.
  Finally, we compare the building blocks of which the Sackin and the Colless indices consist to these indices as well as to the stairs2 index, which is another index from the literature. Our results suggest that the elementary building blocks we identify are not only foundational to established indices but also valuable tools for analyzing disagreement among indices when comparing the balance of different trees.</description>
