      <title>Decoding how higher-order network interactions shape complex contagion dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex contagion models that involve contagion along higher-order structures, such as simplicial complexes and hypergraphs, yield new classes of mean-field models. Interestingly, the differential equations arising from many such models often exhibit a similar form, resulting in qualitatively comparable global bifurcation patterns. Motivated by this observation, we investigate a generalized mean-field-type model that provides a unified framework for analysing a range of different models. In particular, we derive analytical conditions for the emergence of different bifurcation regimes exhibited by three models of increasing complexity -- ranging from three- and four-body interactions to two connected populations with both pairwise and three-body interactions. For the first two cases, we give a complete characterisation of all possible outcomes, along with the corresponding conditions on network and epidemic parameters. In the third case, we demonstrate that multistability is possible despite only three-body interactions. Our results reveal that single population models with three-body interactions can only exhibit simple transcritical transitions or bistability, whereas with four-body interactions multistability with two distinct endemic steady states is possible. Surprisingly, the two-population model exhibits multistability via symmetry breaking despite three-body interactions only. Our work sheds light on the relationship between equation structure and model behaviour and makes the first step towards elucidating mechanisms by which different system behaviours arise, and how network and dynamic properties facilitate or hinder outcomes.</description>

      <title>Quantifying world geography as seen through the lens of Soviet propaganda</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cultural data typically contains a variety of biases. In particular, geographical locations are unequally portrayed in media, creating a distorted representation of the world. Identifying and measuring such biases is crucial to understand both the data and the socio-cultural processes that have produced them. Here we suggest to measure geographical biases in a large historical news media corpus by studying the representation of cities. Leveraging ideas of quantitative urban science, we develop a mixed quantitative-qualitative procedure, which allows us to get robust quantitative estimates of the biases. These biases can be further qualitatively interpreted resulting in a hermeneutic feedback loop. We apply this procedure to a corpus of the Soviet newsreel series 'Novosti Dnya' (News of the Day) and show that city representation grows super-linearly with city size, and is further biased by city specialization and geographical location. This allows to systematically identify geographical regions which are explicitly or sneakily emphasized by Soviet propaganda and quantify their importance.</description>

      <title>The microscale organization of directed hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many real-world complex systems are characterized by non-pairwise -- higher-order -- interactions among system's units, and can be effectively modeled as hypergraphs. Directed hypergraphs distinguish between source and target sets within each hyperedge, and allow to account for the directional flow of information between nodes. Here, we provide a framework to characterize the structural organization of directed higher-order networks at their microscale. First, we extract the fingerprint of a directed hypergraph, capturing the frequency of hyperedges with a certain source and target sizes, and use this information to compute differences in higher-order connectivity patterns among real-world systems. Then, we formulate reciprocity in hypergraphs, including exact, strong, and weak definitions, to measure to which extent hyperedges are reciprocated. Finally, we extend motif analysis to identify recurring interaction patterns and extract the building blocks of directed hypergraphs. We validate our framework on empirical datasets, including Bitcoin transactions, metabolic networks, and citation data, revealing structural principles behind the organization of real-world systems.</description>

      <title>Fusion divided: what prevented European collaboration on controlled thermonuclear fusion in 1958</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Geneva today operates the world`s largest particle accelerator complex and is a much-cited prototype for high-profile international collaboration. What is less well known, however, is that when its first big accelerator was still under construction, CERN went through an experimental phase in terms of scientific fields and exchanges with similar organizations. This was reflected in a controversy surrounding a CERN-sponsored study group on controlled thermonuclear fusion that met from 1958 to 1964. Invited scientists from CERN member states attended these meetings, as did delegates from the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom), the European Atomic Energy Agency (ENEA), and the US Atomic Energy Commission (AEC). Although the CERN Study Group on Fusion Problems created an international network for the exchange of reports and for better coordination of scientific projects to avoid duplication of work, it failed to materialize joint fusion research programmes. This article explains why, thereby providing insights into intergovernmental power dynamics and how those shaped the relationships between international organizations.</description>

      <title>Networks: The Visual Language of Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the origins of complexity is a fundamental challenge with implications for biological and technological systems. Network theory emerges as a powerful tool to model complex systems. Networks are an intuitive framework to represent inter-dependencies among many system components, facilitating the study of both local and global properties. However, it is unclear whether we can define a universal theoretical framework for evolving networks. While basic growth mechanisms, like preferential attachment, recapitulate common properties such as the power-law degree distribution, they fall short in capturing other system-specific properties. Tinkering, on the other hand, has shown to be very successful in generating modular or nested structures "for-free", highlighting the role of internal, non-adaptive mechanisms in the evolution of complexity. Different network extensions, like hypergraphs, have been recently developed to integrate exogenous factors in evolutionary models, as pairwise interactions are insufficient to capture environmentally-mediated species associations. As we confront global societal and climatic challenges, the study of network and hypergraphs provides valuable insights, emphasizing the importance of scientific exploration in understanding and managing complexity.</description>

      <title>Epidemic spreading in group-structured populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.04733v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Individuals involved in common group activities/settings -- e.g., college students that are enrolled in the same class and/or live in the same dorm -- are exposed to recurrent contacts of physical proximity. These contacts are known to mediate the spread of an infectious disease, however, it is not obvious how the properties of the spreading process are determined by the structure of and the interrelation among the group settings that are at the root of those recurrent interactions. Here, we show that reshaping the organization of groups within a population can be used as an effective strategy to decrease the severity of an epidemic. Specifically, we show that when group structures are sufficiently correlated -- e.g., the likelihood for two students living in the same dorm to attend the same class is sufficiently high -- outbreaks are longer but milder than for uncorrelated group structures. Also, we show that the effectiveness of interventions for disease containment increases as the correlation among group structures increases. We demonstrate the practical relevance of our findings by taking advantage of data about housing and attendance of students at the Indiana University campus in Bloomington. By appropriately optimizing the assignment of students to dorms based on their enrollment, we are able to observe a two- to five-fold reduction in the severity of simulated epidemic processes.</description>

      <title>Indirect reciprocity in the public goods game with collective reputations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Indirect reciprocity unveils how social cooperation is founded upon moral systems. Within the frame of dyadic games based on individual reputations, the "leading-eight" strategies distinguish themselves in promoting and sustaining cooperation. However, in the real-world societies, there are widespread interactions at the group level, where individuals need to make a singular action choice when facing multiple individuals with different reputations. Here, through introducing the assessment of collective reputations, we develop a framework that embeds group-level reputation structure into public goods game to study the evolution of group-level indirect reciprocity. We show that changing the criteria of group assessment destabilize the reputation dynamics of leading-eight strategies. In a particular range of social assessment criteria, all leading-eight strategies can break the social dilemma in public goods games and sustain cooperation. Specifically, there exists an optimal, moderately set assessment criterion that is most conducive to promoting cooperation. Moreover, in the evolution of assessment criteria, the preference of the leading-eight strategies for social strictness is inversely correlated with the payoff level. Our work reveals the impact of social strictness on prosocial behavior, highlighting the importance of group-level interactions in the analysis of evolutionary games and complex social dynamics.</description>

      <title>A call for frugal modelling: two case studies involving molecular spin dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13618v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As scientists living through a climate emergency, we have a responsibility to lead by example, or to at least be consistent with our understanding of the problem. This common goal of reducing the carbon footprint of our work can be approached through a variety of strategies. For theoreticians, this includes not only optimizing algorithms and improving computational efficiency but also adopting a frugal approach to modeling. Here we present and critically illustrate this principle. First, we compare two models of very different level of sophistication which nevertheless yield the same qualitative agreement with an experiment involving electric manipulation of molecular spin qubits while presenting a difference in cost of $&gt;4$ orders of magnitude. As a second stage, an already minimalistic model of the potential use of single-ion magnets to implement a network of probabilistic p-bits, programmed in two different programming languages, is shown to present a difference in cost of a factor of $\simeq 50$. In both examples, the computationally expensive version of the model was the one that was published. As a community, we still have a lot of room for improvement in this direction.</description>

      <title>Social contagion under hybrid interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Threshold-driven models and game theory are two fundamental paradigms for describing human interactions in social systems. However, in mimicking social contagion processes, models that simultaneously incorporate these two mechanisms have been largely overlooked. Here, we study a general model that integrates hybrid interaction forms by assuming that a part of nodes in a network are driven by the threshold mechanism, while the remaining nodes exhibit imitation behavior governed by their rationality (under the game-theoretic framework). Our results reveal that the spreading dynamics are determined by the payoff of adoption. For positive payoffs, increasing the density of highly rational nodes can promote the adoption process, accompanied by a double phase transition. The degree of rationality can regulate the spreading speed, with less rational imitators slowing down the spread. We further find that the results are opposite for negative payoffs of adoption. This model may provide valuable insights into understanding the complex dynamics of social contagion phenomena in real-world social networks.</description>

      <title>Data-informed modeling of the formation, persistence, and evolution of social norms and conventions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social norms and conventions are commonly accepted and adopted behaviors and practices within a social group that guide interactions -- e.g., how to spell a word or how to greet people -- and are central to a group's culture and identity. Understanding the key mechanisms that govern the formation, persistence, and evolution of social norms and conventions in social communities is a problem of paramount importance for a broad range of real-world applications, spanning from preparedness for future emergencies to promotion of sustainable practices. In the past decades, mathematical modeling has emerged as a powerful tool to reproduce and study the complex dynamics of norm and convention change, gaining insights into their mechanisms, and ultimately deriving tools to predict their evolution. The first goal of this chapter is to introduce some of the main mathematical approaches for modeling social norms and conventions, including population models and agent-based models relying on the theories of dynamical systems, evolutionary dynamics, and game theory. The second goal of the chapter is to illustrate how quantitative observations and empirical data can be incorporated into these mathematical models in a systematic manner, establishing a data-based approach to mathematical modeling of formation, persistence, and evolution of social norms and conventions. Finally, current challenges and future opportunities in this growing field of research are discussed.</description>
