      <title>Finite basis problem for varieties of algebraic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a survey on the finite basis problem for varieties of algebraic systems. Our exposition is in two directions:
  (i) We give numerous examples of varieties which are not finitely based.
  (ii) We give examples of important varieties with the property that they and their subvarieties are finitely based.
  A special attention is paid on the varieties of semigroups, groups, associative, Lie and other nonassociative algebras.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We survey theory developed over the past 10 years of semirings which need not be additively cancellative. The main feature is a specified ``null ideal'' $\mcA_0$ of a semiring $\mcA,$ taking the place of a zero element, which permits generalizations of the classical algebraic theory to polynomials and their roots, algebraic geometry, matrices, linear algebra, varieties, categories, and module theory. The ``pair'' $(\mcA,\mcA_0)$ is studied along the lines of universal algebra.</description>

      <title>Structure and arithmetic of multivariate Ore extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give the basic structure of the multivariable Ore extensions $S=A[\underline{t} ; \sigma, \underline{\delta}]$ introduced in the work of Mart\'inez-Pe\~nas and Kschischang. The Pseudo multilinear transformations (PMT's) are introduced and correspond to modules over $S$. These maps are strongly connected to the evaluation of polynomials in $S$. A general product formula is obtained. PMT's help to put some structure on the set of roots of a polynomial $f(t) \in S$.</description>

      <title>A family of maximal subalgebras of the Lie algebra~$W_n(K)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $K$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero and ${P_n=K[x_1,\ldots,x_n]}$ the polynomial ring. Any $K$-derivation $D$ on $P_n$ is of the form ${ D=\sum_{i=1}^n f_i(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i} },$ where $f_i\in P_n.$ All such derivations form the Lie algebra $W_n(K)$ over the field $K$. We prove that for $s=1,\ldots,n-1$ the subalgebra $
m_s(K)=\left\{ \sum_{i=1}^s f_i\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i} +\sum_{j=s+1}^n g_j\frac{\partial}{\partial x_j} \mid f_i\in P_s,\ g_j\in P_n \right\} $
is a maximal subalgebra of~$W_n(K)$. The ideal $
I_s=\left\{\sum_{j=s+1}^n g_j\frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}\right\} $
of $m_s(K)$ is isomorphic to the Lie algebra $P_s\otimes \mathrm{Der}(K[x_{s+1},\ldots,x_n])$ and $m_s(K)/I_s\simeq W_s(K)$. The Lie algebra $W_n(K)$ is also the free module over the ring $P_n.$ Therefore, for any set $S\subseteq W_n(K)$ the rank $rk(S)$ (over $P_n$) is defined. Some properties of maximal subalgebras of rank $n$ in $W_n(K)$ are pointed out.</description>

      <title>On the cocharacter sequence of some PI-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A$ be a unital associative PI-algebra over a field of characteristic zero. We study which partitions $\lambda$ appear with nonzero multiplicities in the cocharacter sequence of $A$ for several classes of algebras $A$. Berele defines the eventual arm width $\omega_0(A)$ to be the maximal integer $d$ so that if $\lambda$ appears with nonzero multiplicity in the cocharacter sequence of $A$, then $\lambda$ can have at most $d$ parts arbitrarily large. Berele also shows that if $A$ is Lie nilpotent, then $\omega_0(A) = 1$. In the first part of this paper, we show that if $A$ is unital, then $\omega_0(A) = 1$ if and only if $A$ is Lie nilpotent. To prove this statement, we show that the algebra of proper polynomials $B_n(A)$ is finite dimensional if and only if $A$ is Lie nilpotent. In the second part, we give a bound on the nonzero multiplicities $\lambda$ in the cocharacter sequence of $A$, when the T-ideal of identities of $A$ is equal to a product of T-ideals generated by long commutators. As an application, we show that for a Lie nilpotent algebra $A$, the nonzero multiplicities $m_{\lambda}(A)$ correspond to partitions $\lambda$ which are supported in step-like diagrams in which the number of steps grows with the index of Lie nilpotency. Finally, we give also some applications to the noncommutative invariant theory of the special linear group $\mathrm{SL}(n)$.</description>

      <title>Graded Lie superalgebras from embedding tensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.23113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how various constructions of $\mathbb{Z}$-graded Lie superalgebras are related to each other. These Lie superalgebras have a Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ as the subalgebra at degree 0, an odd $\mathfrak{g}$-module V as the subspace at degree 1, and an embedding tensor as an element at degree -1. This is a linear map from V to $\mathfrak{g}$ satisfying a quadratic constraint, which equips V with the structure of a Leibniz algebra.</description>

      <title>Locally prime modules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a commutative unital ring $R$ with fixed ideals $I$ and $J$, we introduce and study $I$-prime $R$-modules and $(I, J)$-prime $R$-modules together with their duals $I$-coprime $R$-modules and $(I,J)$-coprime $R$-modules respectively. We employ category-theoretic techniques to reveal their structural properties. Our main results are versions of the Greenlees-May Duality and the Matlis-Greenlees-May Equivalence to the setting of these prime and coprime modules. This generalizes work on $I$-reduced modules and $I$-coreduced modules. We demonstrate that these ``locally prime" modules serve as a tool for studying the classical ``globally prime" modules, creating a bridge between local and global primality.</description>

      <title>Balanced pairs, virtually Gorenstein rings, and cotorsion torsion triples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For any ring $R$, we investigate balanced pairs of classes of modules and their relations to cotorsion triples. We characterize the case when a balanced pair generates a tilting cotorsion pair, and dually, when it cogenerates a cotilting cotorsion pair. If $R$ is right noetherian, we prove that the pair consisting of Gorenstein projective modules and Gorenstein injective modules is balanced if and only if $R$ is right virtually Gorenstein.
  In [4], cotorsion torsion triples in abelian categories were employed in the representation theory of rectangular grids occurring in persistent homology theory. For module categories, we use infinite dimensional tilting theory to completely classify all cotorsion torsion triples by means of $1$-resolving subcategories of $\rfmod R$, and to give an explicit 1-1 correspondence between the formally dual notions of cotorsion torsion triples of right $R$-modules and torsion cotorsion triples of left $R$-modules. This correspondence is bijective in case the underlying ring $R$ is left noetherian, but not in general.</description>

      <title>Serre duality, Mukai pairing and universal Auslander--Reiten triangle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the relationship between Serre duality and the Mukai pairing for smooth and proper dg-algebras. We introduce an alternative definition of the Mukai pairing and prove that it coincides with the Mukai pairings defined by C\u{a}ld\u{a}raru--Willerton and by Shklyarov. Our construction places both the Mukai pairing and Serre duality within a unified framework based on an elementary pairing between Hochschild homology and Hochschild cohomology. As a consequence, the adjointness of the boundary--bulk and bulk--boundary maps follows naturally.
  As an application, we investigate Auslander--Reiten theory for the perfect derived category of a non-positive smooth and proper dg-algebra. We construct an exact triangle of dg-$A$-$A$-bimodules, called a universal Auslander--Reiten triangle in the sense that the derived tensor product of this triangle with an indecomposable dg-$A$-module $M$ yields an Auslander--Reiten triangle starting from $M$. In particular, this provides a functorial construction of Auslander--Reiten triangles. In the case of path algebras of quivers, our construction recovers the universal Auslander--Reiten triangle associated with quiver Heisenberg algebras.</description>

      <title>Algebras in fusion categories: species and hereditary algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We initiate the study of non-semisimple algebras in fusion categories by establishing the framework of $\mathcal{C}$-species -- analogous to the framework of species and quivers used in the study of Artin algebras. Under the (necessary) assumption that the fusion category is separable, we show that any algebra is Morita equivalent to an admissible quotient of the path algebra of a $\mathcal{C}$-species. Moreover, we show that an algebra is hereditary if and only if no further quotient is required. These results generalise that of Gabriel's for finite-dimensional algebras.</description>

      <title>Grokking Finite-Dimensional Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the grokking phenomenon, which refers to the sudden transition from a long memorization to generalization observed during neural networks training, in the context of learning multiplication in finite-dimensional algebras (FDA). While prior work on grokking has focused mainly on group operations, we extend the analysis to more general algebraic structures, including non-associative, non-commutative, and non-unital algebras. We show that learning group operations is a special case of learning FDA, and that learning multiplication in FDA amounts to learning a bilinear product specified by the algebra's structure tensor. For algebras over the reals, we connect the learning problem to matrix factorization with an implicit low-rank bias, and for algebras over finite fields, we show that grokking emerges naturally as models must learn discrete representations of algebraic elements. This leads us to experimentally investigate the following core questions: (i) how do algebraic properties such as commutativity, associativity, and unitality influence both the emergence and timing of grokking, (ii) how structural properties of the structure tensor of the FDA, such as sparsity and rank, influence generalization, and (iii) to what extent generalization correlates with the model learning latent embeddings aligned with the algebra's representation. Our work provides a unified framework for grokking across algebraic structures and new insights into how mathematical structure governs neural network generalization dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17187v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of generalized homogeneous derivations on graded rings as a natural extension of the homogeneous derivations defined by Kanunnikov. We then define gr-generalized derivations, which preserve the degrees of homogeneous components. Several significant results originally established for prime rings are extended to the setting of gr-prime rings, and we characterize conditions under which gr-semiprime rings contain nontrivial central graded ideals. In addition, we investigate the algebraic and module-theoretic structures of these maps, establish their functorial properties, and develop categorical frameworks that describe their derivation structures in both ring and module contexts.</description>

      <title>Homology and cohomology of crossed products by inverse monoid actions and Steinberg algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a unital action $\theta $ of an inverse monoid $S$ on an algebra $A$ over a filed $K$ we produce (co)homology spectral sequences which converge to the Hochschild (co)homology of the crossed product $A\rtimes_\theta S$ with values in a bimodule over $A\rtimes_\theta S$. The spectral sequences involve a new kind of (co)homology of the inverse monoid $S,$ which is based on $KS$-modules. The spectral sequences take especially nice form, when $(A\rtimes_\theta S)^e $ is flat as a left (homology case) or right (cohomology case) $A^e$-module, involving also the Hochschild (co)homology of $A.$ Same nice spectral sequences are also obtained if $K$ is a commutative ring, over which $A$ is projective, and $S$ is $E$-unitary. We apply our results to the Steinberg algebra $A_K(\mathscr{G})$ over a field $K$ of an ample groupoid $\mathscr{G},$ whose unit space $\mathscr{G} ^{(0)}$ is compact. In the homology case our spectral sequence collapses on the $p$-axis, resulting in an isomorphism between the Hochschild homology of $A_K(\mathscr{G})$ with values in an $A_K(\mathscr{G})$-bimodule $M$ and the homology of the inverse semigroup of the compact open bisections of $\mathscr{G}$ with values in the invariant submodule of $M.$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finitely generated torsion-free pro-$p$ group containing an open free-by-$\mathbb{Z}_p$ pro-$p$ subgroup. We show that the completed group algebra of $G$ over $\mathbb{F}_p$ is a Sylvester domain. Moreover the inner rank of a matrix $A$ over this completed group algebra can be calculated by approximation by ranks corresponding to finite quotients of $G$, that is, if $G=G_1&gt;G_2&gt;\ldots$ is a chain of normal open subgroups of $G$ with trivial intersection and $A_i$ is the matrix over $\mathbb{F}_p[G/G_i]$ obtained from the matrix $A$ by applying the natural homomorphism induced from $G \to G/G_i$, then the inner rank of $A$ equals $\lim_{i\to \infty} \frac{\operatorname{rk}_{\mathbb{F}_p} (A_i)}{|G:G_i|}$. As a consequence, we obtain a particular case of the mod $p$ L\"uck approximation for abstract finitely generated subgroups of free-by-$\mathbb{Z}_p$ pro-$p$ groups.</description>

As an application, we determine all finite groups $G$ of order at most $383$ such that the integral group ring $\mathbb{Z}[G]$ has SFC.</description>

      <title>CW-complexes and minimal Hilbert vector of graded Artinian Gorenstein algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13276v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I introduce a geometric interpretation of the set of standard graded Artinian Gorenstein algebras of codimension n and degree d: the standard locus, which is a subset of the projective space of degree d polynomials in n variables, and I characterize it. Under opportune hypothesis, I prove that the locus of full Perazzo polynomials is the union of the minimal dimensional irreducible components of the standard locus and it is a pure dimensional subset. On the other hand, I associate to any homogeneous polynomial a topological space, which is a CW-complex. Using all these sets, I prove that the Hilbert function restricted to the standard locus has minimal values on any irreducible component of the domain. I apply all this to the Full Perazzo Conjecture and I prove it.</description>

      <title>Using nonassociative algebras to classify skew polycyclic codes up to isometry and equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10139v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Employing isomorphisms between their ambient rings, we propose new definitions of equivalence and isometry for skew polycyclic codes that will lead to tighter classifications than existing ones. This reduces the number of previously known isometry and equivalence classes. In the process, we classify classes of skew $(f,\sigma,\delta)$-polycyclic codes with the same performance parameters, to avoid duplicating already existing codes, and state precisely when different notions of equivalence coincide. The generator of a skew polycyclic code is in one-one correspondence with the generator of a principal left ideal in its nonassociative unital ambient ring. By allowing the ambient rings to be nonassociative, we eliminate the need on restrictions on the length of the codes. Ring isomorphisms that preserve the Hamming distance (called isometries) map generators of principal left ideals to generators of principal left ideals and preserve length, dimension, and Hamming distance of the corresponding isometric skew polycyclic codes.</description>
