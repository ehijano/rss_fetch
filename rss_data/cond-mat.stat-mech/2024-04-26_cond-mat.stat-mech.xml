      <title>Nucleation transitions in polycontextural networks towards consensus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, we proposed polycontextural networks as a model of evolving systems of interacting beliefs. Here, we present an analysis of the phase transition as well as the scaling properties. The model contains interacting agents that strive for consensus, each with only subjective perception. Depending on a parameter that governs how responsive the agents are to changing their belief systems the model exhibits a phase transition that mediates between an active phase where the agents constantly change their beliefs and a frozen phase, where almost no changes appear. We observe the build-up of convention-aligned clusters only in the intermediate regime of diverging susceptibility. Here, we analyze in detail the behavior of polycontextural networks close to this transition. We provide an analytical estimate of the critical point and show that the scaling properties and the space-time structure of these clusters show self-similar behavior. Our results not only contribute to a better understanding of the emergence of consensus in systems of distributed beliefs but also show that polycontextural networks are models, motivated by social systems, where susceptibility -- the sensitivity to change own beliefs -- drives the growth of consensus clusters.</description>

      <title>Freezing density scaling of transport coefficients in the Weeks-Chandler-Andersen fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that the transport coefficients (self-diffusion, shear viscosity, and thermal conductivity) of the Weeks-Chandler-Anderson (WCA) fluid along isotherms exhibit a freezing density scaling (FDS). The functional form of this FDS is essentially the same or closely related to those in the Lennard-Jones fluid, hard-sphere fluid, and some liquefied noble gases. This proves that this FDS represents a quasi-universal corresponding state principle for simple classical fluids with steep interactions. Some related aspects such as Stokes-Einstein relation without a hydrodynamic diameter and gas-to-liquid dynamical crossover are briefly discussed. Simple fitting formula for the transport coefficients of the dense WCA fluid are suggested.</description>

      <title>Markov generators as non-hermitian supersymmetric quantum Hamiltonians: spectral properties via bi-orthogonal basis and Singular Value Decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuity equations associated to continuous-time Markov processes can be considered as Euclidean Schr\"odinger equations, where the non-hermitian quantum Hamiltonian $\bold{H}={\bold{div}}{\bold J}$ is naturally factorized into the product of the divergence operator ${\bold {div}}$ and the current operator ${\bold J}$. For non-equilibrium Markov jump processes in a space of $N$ configurations with $M$ links and $C=M-(N-1)\geq 1$ independent cycles, this factorization of the $N \times N$ Hamiltonian ${\bold H}={\bold I}^{\dagger}{\bold J}$ involves the incidence matrix ${\bold I}$ and the current matrix ${\bold J}$ of size $M \times N$, so that the supersymmetric partner ${\hat{\bold H}}= {\bold J}{\bold I}^{\dagger}$ governing the dynamics of the currents living on the $M$ links is of size $M \times M$. To better understand the relations between the spectral decompositions of these two Hamiltonians $\bold{H}={\bold I}^{\dagger}{\bold J}$ and ${\hat {\bold H}} ={\bold J}{\bold I}^{\dagger}$ with respect to their bi-orthogonal basis of right and left eigenvectors that characterize the relaxation dynamics towards the steady state and the steady currents, it is useful to analyze the properties of the Singular Value Decompositions of the two rectangular matrices ${\bold I}$ and ${\bold J} $ of size $M \times N$ and the interpretations in terms of discrete Helmholtz decompositions. This general framework concerning Markov jump processes can be adapted to non-equilibrium diffusion processes governed by Fokker-Planck equations in dimension $d$, where the number $N$ of configurations, the number $M$ of links and the number $C=M-(N-1)$ of independent cycles become infinite, while the two matrices ${\bold I}$ and ${\bold J}$ become first-order differential operators acting on scalar functions to produce vector fields.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Dissipative Euler's equations for a free body</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intrinsic thermal fluctuations within a real solid challenge the rigid body assumption that is central to Euler's equations for the motion of a free body. Recently, we have introduced a dissipative and stochastic version of Euler's equations in a thermodynamically consistent way (European Journal of Mechanics - A/Solids 103, 105184 (2024)). This framework describes the evolution of both orientation and shape of a free body, incorporating internal thermal fluctuations and their concomitant dissipative mechanisms. In the present work, we demonstrate that, in the absence of angular momentum, the theory predicts that principal axis unit vectors of a body undergo an anisotropic Brownian motion on the unit sphere, with the anisotropy arising from the body's varying moments of inertia. The resulting equilibrium time correlation function of the principal eigenvectors decays exponentially. This theoretical prediction is confirmed in molecular dynamics simulations of small bodies. The comparison of theory and equilibrium MD simulations allow us to measure the orientational diffusion tensor. We then use this information in the Stochastic Dissipative Euler's Equations, to describe a non-equilibrium situation of a body spinning around the unstable intermediate axis. The agreement between theory and simulations is excellent, offering a validation of the theoretical framework.</description>

      <title>Model-free inference of memory in conformational dynamics of a multi-domain protein</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-molecule experiments provide insight into the motion (conformational dynamics) of individual protein molecules. Usually, a well-defined but coarse-grained intramolecular coordinate is measured and subsequently analysed with the help of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to deduce the kinetics of protein conformational changes. Such approaches rely on the assumption that the microscopic dynamics of the protein evolve according to a Markov-jump process on some network. However, the manifestation and extent of memory in the dynamics of the observable strongly depends on the chosen underlying Markov model, which is generally not known and therefore can lead to misinterpretations. Here, we combine extensive single-molecule plasmon ruler experiments on the heat shock protein Hsp90, computer simulations, and theory to infer and quantify memory in a model-free fashion. Our analysis is based on the bare definition of non-Markovian behaviour and does not require any underlying model. In the case of Hsp90 probed by a plasmon ruler, the Markov assumption is found to be clearly and conclusively violated on timescales up to roughly 50 s, which corresponds roughly to $\sim$50% of the inferred correlation time of the signal. The extent of memory is striking and reaches biologically relevant timescales. This implies that memory effects penetrate even the slowest observed motions. We provide clear and reproducible guidelines on how to test for the presence and duration of memory in experimental single-molecule data.</description>

      <title>Ordered and disordered stealthy hyperuniform point patterns across spatial dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In previous work [Phys. Rev. X 5, 021020 (2015)], it was shown that stealthy hyperuniform systems can be regarded as hard spheres in Fourier-space in the sense that the the structure factor is exactly zero in a spherical region around the origin in analogy with the pair-correlation function of real-space hard spheres. In this work, we exploit this correspondence to confirm that the densest Fourier-space hard-sphere system is that of a Bravais lattice. This is in contrast to real-space hard-spheres, whose densest configuration is conjectured to be disordered. We also extend the virial series previously suggested for disordered stealthy hyperuniform systems to higher dimensions in order to predict spatial decorrelation as function of dimension. This prediction is then borne out by numerical simulations of disordered stealthy hyperuniform ground states in dimensions $d=2$-$8$.</description>

      <title>Statistical Mechanics of Stochastic Quantum Control: $d$-adic R\'enyi Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of quantum information in many-body systems with large onsite Hilbert space dimension admits an enlightening description in terms of effective statistical mechanics models. Motivated by this fact, we reveal a connection between three separate models: the classically chaotic $d$-adic R\'{e}nyi map with stochastic control, a quantum analog of this map for qudits, and a Potts model on a random graph. The classical model and its quantum analog share a transition between chaotic and controlled phases, driven by a randomly applied control map that attempts to order the system. In the quantum model, the control map necessitates measurements that concurrently drive a phase transition in the entanglement content of the late-time steady state. To explore the interplay of the control and entanglement transitions, we derive an effective Potts model from the quantum model and use it to probe information-theoretic quantities that witness both transitions. The entanglement transition is found to be in the bond-percolation universality class, consistent with other measurement-induced phase transitions, while the control transition is governed by a classical random walk. These two phase transitions merge as a function of model parameters, consistent with behavior observed in previous small-size numerical studies of the quantum model.</description>

      <title>Long-range multipartite entanglement near measurement-induced transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurements profoundly impact quantum systems, and can be used to create new states of matter out of equilibrium. Here, we investigate the multipartite entanglement structure that emerges in quantum circuits involving unitaries and measurements. We describe how a balance between measurements and unitary evolution can lead to multipartite entanglement spreading to distances far greater than what is found in non-monitored systems, thus evading the usual fate of entanglement. We introduce a graphical representation based on spanning graphs that allows to infer the evolution of genuine multipartite entanglement for general subregions. We exemplify our findings on circuits that realize a 1d measurement-induced dynamical phase transition, where we find genuine 3-party entanglement at all separations. The 2- and 4-party cases are also covered with examples. Finally, we discuss how our approach can provide fundamental insights regarding entanglement dynamics for a wide class of quantum circuits and architectures.</description>

      <title>Boomerang effect in classical stochastic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The phenomenon of Anderson localization, occurring in a disordered medium, significantly influences the dynamics of quantum particles. A fascinating manifestation of this is the "quantum boomerang effect" (QBE), observed when a quantum particle, propelled with a finite initial velocity, reverses its average trajectory, eventually halting at its starting point. This effect has recently been demonstrated in an experiment replicating the quantum kicked-rotor model. This research delves into the classical analog of QBE. We uncover evidence of a similar effect in classical systems, characterized by the absence of typical diffusion processes. Our investigation encompasses both simplified probabilistic models and more complex phenomenological models that link classical with quantum mechanics. The results indicate that the boomerang effect is not confined to the quantum realm and may also be present in diverse systems exhibiting subdiffusive behavior.</description>

      <title>Spectral Density and Sum Rules for Second-Order Response Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sum rules for linear response functions give powerful and experimentally-relevant relations between frequency moments of response functions and ground state properties. In particular, renewed interest has been drawn to optical conductivity and density-density sum rules and their connection to quantum geometry in topological materials. At the same time, recent work has also illustrated the connection between quantum geometry and second-order nonlinear response functions in quantum materials, motivating the search for exact sum rules for second-order response that can provide experimental probes and theoretical constraints for geometry and topology in these systems. Here we begin to address these questions by developing a general formalism for deriving sum rules for second-order response functions. Using generalized Kramers-Kronig relations, we show that the second-order Kubo formula can be expressed in terms of a spectral density that is a sum of Dirac delta functions in frequency. We show that moments of the spectral density can be expressed in terms of averages of equal-time commutators, yielding a family of generalized sum rules; furthermore, these sum rules constrain the large-frequency asymptotic behavior of the second harmonic generation rate. We apply our formalism to study generalized $f$-sum rules for the second-order density-density response function and the longitudinal nonlinear conductivity. We show that for noninteracting electrons in solids, the generalized $f$-sum rule can be written entirely in terms of matrix elements of the Bloch Hamiltonian. Finally, we derive a family of sum rules for rectification response, determining the large-frequency asymptotic behavior of the time-independent response to a harmonic perturbation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kinetically constrained spin systems are toy models of supercooled liquids and amorphous solids. In this Perspective, we revisit the prototypical Fredrickson-Andersen (FA) kinetically constrained model from the viewpoint of K-core combinatorial optimization. Each kinetic cluster of the FA system, containing all the mutually visitable microscopic occupation configurations, is exactly the solution space of a specific instance of the K-core attack problem. The whole set of different jammed occupation patterns of the FA system is the configuration space of an equilibrium K-core problem. Based on recent theoretical results achieved on the K-core attack and equilibrium K-core problems, we discuss the thermodynamic spin glass phase transitions and the maximum occupation density of the fully unfrozen FA kinetic cluster, and the minimum occupation density and extreme vulnerability of the partially frozen (jammed) kinetic clusters. The equivalence between K-core attack and the fully unfrozen FA kinetic cluster also implies a new way of sampling K-core attack solutions.</description>

      <title>Speed limits and thermodynamic uncertainty relations for quantum systems governed by non-Hermitian Hamiltonian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian Hamiltonians play a crucial role in the description of open quantum systems and nonequilibrium dynamics. In this paper, we derive trade-off relations for systems governed by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, focusing on the Margolus-Levitin and Mandelstam-Tamm bounds, which are quantum speed limits originally derived in isolated quantum dynamics. We extend these bounds to the case of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians and derive additional bounds on the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean of an observable, which take the same form as the thermodynamic uncertainty relation. As an example, we apply these bounds to the continuous measurement formalism in open quantum dynamics, where the dynamics is described by discontinuous jumps and smooth evolution induced by the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Our work provides a unified perspective on the quantum speed limit and thermodynamic uncertainty relations in open quantum dynamics from the viewpoint of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, extending the results of previous studies.</description>

      <title>A finite-time quantum Otto engine with tunnel coupled one-dimensional Bose gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We undertake a theoretical study of a finite-time quantum Otto engine cycle driven by inter-particle interactions in a weakly interacting one-dimensional Bose gas in the quasicondensate regime. Utilizing a $c$-field approach, we simulate the entire Otto cycle, i.e. the two work strokes and the two equilibration strokes. More specifically, the interaction-induced work strokes are modelled by treating the working fluid as an isolated quantum many-body system undergoing unitary evolution. The equilibration strokes, on the other hand, are modelled by treating the working fluid as an open quantum system tunnel-coupled to another quasicondensate which acts as either the hot or cold reservoir, albeit of finite size. We find that, unlike a uniform 1D Bose gas, a harmonically trapped quasicondensate cannot operate purely as a \emph{heat} engine; instead, the engine operation is enabled by additional \emph{chemical} work performed on the working fluid, facilitated by the inflow of particles from the hot reservoir. The microscopic treatment of dynamics during equilibration strokes enables us to evaluate the characteristic operational time scales of this Otto chemical engine, crucial for characterizing its power output, without any \emph{ad hoc} assumptions about typical thermalization timescales. We analyse the performance and quantify the figures of merit of the proposed Otto chemical engine, finding that it offers a favourable trade-off between efficiency and power output, particularly when the interaction-induced work strokes are implemented via a sudden quench. We further demonstrate that in the sudden quench regime, the engine operates with an efficiency close to the near-adiabatic (near maximum efficiency) limit, while concurrently achieving maximum power output.</description>

      <title>AMEP: The Active Matter Evaluation Package for Python</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Active Matter Evaluation Package (AMEP) is a Python library for analyzing simulation data of particle-based and continuum simulations. It provides a powerful and simple interface for handling large data sets and for calculating and visualizing a broad variety of observables that are relevant to active matter systems. Examples range from the mean-square displacement and the structure factor to cluster-size distributions, binder cumulants, and growth exponents. AMEP is written in pure Python and is based on powerful libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and scikit-image. Computationally expensive methods are parallelized and optimized to run efficiently on workstations, laptops, and high-performance computing architectures, and an HDF5-based data format is used in the backend to store and handle simulation data as well as analysis results. AMEP provides the first comprehensive framework for analyzing simulation results of both particle-based and continuum simulations (as well as experimental data) of active matter systems.

      <title>The magnetization process of classical Heisenberg magnets with non-coplanar cuboc ground states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a classical Heisenberg model on the kagom\'{e} and the square kagom\'{e} lattice, where at zero magnetic field non-coplanar cuboctahedral ground states with twelve sublattices exist if suitable exchange couplings are introduced between the other neighbors. Such 'cuboc ground states' are remarkable because they allow for chiral ordering. For these models, we discuss the magnetization process in an applied magnetic field $H$ by both numerical and analytical methods. We find some universal properties that are present in all models. The magnetization curve $M(H)$ usually contains only non-linear components and there is at least one magnetic field driven phase transition. Details of the $M(H)$ curve such as the number and characteristics (continuous or discontinuous) of the phase transitions depend on the lattice and the details of the exchange between the further neighbors. Typical features of these magnetization processes can already be derived for a paradigmatic 12 spin model that we define in this work.</description>

      <title>Dual-isometric Projected Entangled Pair States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient characterization of higher dimensional many-body physical states presents significant challenges. In this paper, we propose a new class of Project Entangled Pair State (PEPS) that incorporates two isometric conditions. This new class facilitates the efficient calculation of general local observables and certain two-point correlation functions, which have been previously shown to be intractable for general PEPS, or PEPS with only a single isometric constraint. Despite incorporating two isometric conditions, our class preserves the rich physical structure while enhancing the analytical capabilities. It features a large set of tunable parameters, with only a subleading correction compared to that of general PEPS. Furthermore, we analytically demonstrate that this class can encode universal quantum computations and can represent a transition from topological to trivial order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.04900v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Differential equations are a ubiquitous tool to study dynamics, ranging from physical systems to complex systems, where a large number of agents interact through a graph with non-trivial topological features. Data-driven approximations of differential equations present a promising alternative to traditional methods for uncovering a model of dynamical systems, especially in complex systems that lack explicit first principles. A recently employed machine learning tool for studying dynamics is neural networks, which can be used for data-driven solution finding or discovery of differential equations. Specifically for the latter task, however, deploying deep learning models in unfamiliar settings - such as predicting dynamics in unobserved state space regions or on novel graphs - can lead to spurious results. Focusing on complex systems whose dynamics are described with a system of first-order differential equations coupled through a graph, we show that extending the model's generalizability beyond traditional statistical learning theory limits is feasible. However, achieving this advanced level of generalization requires neural network models to conform to fundamental assumptions about the dynamical model. Additionally, we propose a statistical significance test to assess prediction quality during inference, enabling the identification of a neural network's confidence level in its predictions.</description>

      <title>Influence of Entropy Changes on First Passage Time in the Thermodynamics of trajectories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.07398v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For thermodynamics of trajectories, an ensemble containing dynamical activity and first-passage time (FPT) random variables is considered. The dependence of the average FPT on the total non-negative change in entropy is obtained. The same dependencies obtained for dynamic activity, dispersion of dynamic activity and FPT, as well as for the correlation of dynamic activity and FPT. Application of the obtained results to model systems makes it possible to obtain dependences of entropy changes containing a stationary nonequilibrium state and equilibrium states. To relate changes in entropy to the conjugate parameter of the FPT, three models of distribution functions are used, which are applied to classical two-level and three-level systems, as well as to a quantum two-level system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we propose a non-equilibrium temperature by a temperature dependent Vlasov equation for the charge particles transport through a environmental reservoir. A new damping force and a inverse damping relaxation time are derived based on the Vlasov equation, which have obvious influence on the external force and the relaxation time of transport particles. The non-equilibrium temperature for the transport particles is defined by their distribution function out of equilibrium, which is different from the equilibrium temperature of reservoir. There exists heat transfer between the transport particles and the reservoir, because the whole transport particles are in non-equilibrium state. Finally, we illustrate them by an example of one-dimensional charge particles transport under an external electric field, the non-equilibrium temperature and damping force defined by us are shown numerically.</description>

      <title>Moments and First-Passage Time of a Random Process for General Upper Bounds on Fluctuations of Trajectory Observables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: General upper bounds on fluctuations of trajectory observables were recently obtained. It turned out that the size of fluctuations of dynamical observable is limited from below and from above. For the moment generating function of general upper bounds on the size of fluctuations, the moments (average value and variance) of the size of fluctuations are obtained. A more complex and interesting task is to obtain the first-passage time for process of upper bounds of reaching fluctuations of observables. Characteristic functions, average values and variances of the first-passage time of reaching fluctuations of observables of the trajectory of the Markov chain of positive and negative levels are also obtained. Some general issues of the relationship between the theory of random processes (using the example of the risk theory used) and thermodynamics of trajectories are also considered.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium dynamics and entropy production of a trapped colloidal particle in a complex nonreciprocal medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the two-dimensional motion of a Brownian particle that is confined to a harmonic trap and driven by a shear flow. The surrounding medium induces memory effects modelled by a linear, typically nonreciprocal coupling of the particle coordinates to an auxiliary (hidden) variable. The system's behavior resulting from the microscopic Langevin equations for the three variables is analyzed by means of exact moment equations derived from the Fokker-Planck representation, and numerical Brownian Dynamics (BD) simulations. Increasing the shear rate beyond a critical value we observe, for suitable coupling scenarios with nonreciprocal elements, a transition from a stationary to an instationary state, corresponding to an escape from the trap. We analyze this behavior, analytically and numerically, in terms of the associated moments of the probability distribution, and from the perspective of nonequilibrium thermodynamics. Intriguingly, the entropy production rate remains finite when crossing the stability threshold.</description>

      <title>Beyond Linear Response: Equivalence between Thermodynamic Geometry and Optimal Transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01286v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fundamental result of thermodynamic geometry is that the optimal, minimal-work protocol that drives a nonequilibrium system between two thermodynamic states in the slow-driving limit is given by a geodesic of the friction tensor, a Riemannian metric defined on control space. For overdamped dynamics in arbitrary dimensions, we demonstrate that thermodynamic geometry is equivalent to $L^2$ optimal transport geometry defined on the space of equilibrium distributions corresponding to the control parameters. We show that obtaining optimal protocols past the slow-driving or linear response regime is computationally tractable as the sum of a friction tensor geodesic and a counterdiabatic term related to the Fisher information metric. These geodesic-counterdiabatic optimal protocols are exact for parameteric harmonic potentials, reproduce the surprising non-monotonic behavior recently discovered in linearly-biased double well optimal protocols, and explain the ubiquitous discontinuous jumps observed at the beginning and end times.</description>

Abstract: The collective coordination of distributed tasks in a complex system can be represented as decision dynamics on a graph. This abstract representation allows studying the performance of local decision heuristics as a function of task complexity and network architecture. Here we identify hard-to-solve and easy-to-solve networks in a social differentiation task within the basic model of small-world graphs. We show that, depending on the details of the decision heuristic as well as the length of the added links, shortcuts can serve as structural promotors, which speed up convergence towards a solution, but also as structural insulators, which make the network more difficult to solve. Our findings have implications for situations where, in distributed decision systems, regional solutions emerge, which are globally incompatible as for example during the emergence of technological standards.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations play an important role in understanding and engineering heat transport properties of complex materials. An essential requirement for reliably predicting heat transport properties is the use of accurate and efficient interatomic potentials. Recently, machine-learned potentials (MLPs) have shown great promise in providing the required accuracy for a broad range of materials. In this mini review and tutorial, we delve into the fundamentals of heat transport, explore pertinent MD simulation methods, and survey the applications of MLPs in MD simulations of heat transport. Furthermore, we provide a step-by-step tutorial on developing MLPs for highly efficient and predictive heat transport simulations, utilizing the neuroevolution potentials (NEPs) as implemented in the GPUMD package. Our aim with this mini review and tutorial is to empower researchers with valuable insights into cutting-edge methodologies that can significantly enhance the accuracy and efficiency of MD simulations for heat transport studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08738v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a universal characterization of stress correlations in athermal systems, across crystalline to amorphous packings. Via numerical analysis of static configurations of particles interacting through harmonic as well as Lennard-Jones potentials, for a variety of preparation protocols and ranges of microscopic disorder, we show that the properties of the stress correlations at large lengthscales are surprisingly universal across all situations, independent of structural correlations, or the correlations in orientational order. In the near-crystalline limit, we present exact results for the stress correlations for both models, which work surprisingly well at large lengthscales, even in the amorphous phase. Finally, we study the differences in stress fluctuations across the amorphization transition, where stress correlations reveal the loss of periodicity in the structure at short lengthscales with increasing disorder.</description>

      <title>Road layout in the KPZ class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a road layout and traffic model, based on last passage percolation (LPP). An easy naive argument shows that coalescence of traffic trajectories is essential to be considered when observing traffic networks around us. This is a fundamental feature in first passage percolation (FPP) models where nearby geodesics naturally coalesce in search of the easiest passage through the landscape. Road designers seek the same in pursuing cost savings, hence FPP geodesics are straightforward candidates to model road layouts. Unfortunately no detailed knowledge is rigorously available on FPP geodesics. To address this, we use exponential LPP instead to build a stochastic model of road traffic and prove certain characteristics thereof. Cars start from every point of the lattice and follow half-infinite geodesics in random directions. Exponential LPP is known to be in the KPZ universality class and it is widely expected that FPP shares very similar properties, hence our findings should equally apply to FPP-based modelling. We address several traffic-related quantities of this model and compare our theorems to real life road networks.</description>

      <title>A replica analysis of under-bagging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Under-bagging (UB), which combines under sampling and bagging, is a popular ensemble learning method for training classifiers on an imbalanced data. Using bagging to reduce the increased variance caused by the reduction in sample size due to under sampling is a natural approach. However, it has recently been pointed out that in generalized linear models, naive bagging, which does not consider the class imbalance structure, and ridge regularization can produce the same results. Therefore, it is not obvious whether it is better to use UB, which requires an increased computational cost proportional to the number of under-sampled data sets, when training linear models. Given such a situation, in this study, we heuristically derive a sharp asymptotics of UB and use it to compare with several other standard methods for learning from imbalanced data, in the scenario where a linear classifier is trained from a two-component mixture data. The methods compared include the under-sampling (US) method, which trains a model using a single realization of the subsampled data, and the simple weighting (SW) method, which trains a model with a weighted loss on the entire data. It is shown that the performance of UB is improved by increasing the size of the majority class while keeping the size of the minority fixed, even though the class imbalance can be large, especially when the size of the minority class is small. This is in contrast to US, whose performance does not change as the size of the majority class increases, and SW, whose performance decreases as the imbalance increases. These results are different from the case of the naive bagging when training generalized linear models without considering the structure of the class imbalance, indicating the intrinsic difference between the ensembling and the direct regularization on the parameters.</description>
