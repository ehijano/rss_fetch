      <title>Maximal Magic for Two-qubit States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magic is a quantum resource essential for universal quantum computation and represents the deviation of quantum states from those that can be simulated efficiently using classical algorithms. Using the Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropy (SRE), we investigate two-qubit states with maximal magic, which are most distinct from classical simulability, and provide strong numerical evidence that the maximal second order SRE is $\log (16/7)\approx 0.827$, establishing a tighter bound than the prior $\log(5/2)\approx 0.916$. We identity 480 states saturating the new bound, which turn out to be the fiducial states for the mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) generated by the orbits of the Weyl-Heisenberg (WH) group, and conjecture that WH-MUBs are the maximal magic states for $n$-qubit, when $n\neq 1$ and 3. We also reveal a striking interplay between magic and entanglement: the entanglement of maximal magic states is restricted to two possible values, $1/2$ and $1/\sqrt{2}$, as quantified by the concurrence; none is maximally entangled.</description>

      <title>The Moving Born-Oppenheimer Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a mixed quantum-classical framework, dubbed the Moving Born-Oppenheimer Approximation (MBOA), to describe the dynamics of slow degrees of freedom (DOFs) coupled to fast ones. As in the Born-Oppenheimer Approximation (BOA), the fast degrees of freedom adiabatically follow a state that depends on the slow ones. Unlike the BOA, this state depends on both the positions and the momenta of the slow DOFs. We study several model systems: a spin-1/2 particle and a spinful molecule moving in a spatially inhomogeneous magnetic field, and a gas of fast particles coupled to a piston. The MBOA reveals rich dynamics for the slow degree of freedom, including reflection, dynamical trapping, and mass renormalization. It also significantly modifies the state of the fast DOFs. For example, the spins in the molecule are entangled and squeezed, while the gas of fast particles develops gradients that are synchronized with the motion of the piston for a long time. The MBOA can be used to describe both classical and quantum systems and has potential applications in molecular dynamics, state preparation, and quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Expressive equivalence of classical and quantum restricted Boltzmann machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers offer the potential for efficiently sampling from complex probability distributions, attracting increasing interest in generative modeling within quantum machine learning. This surge in interest has driven the development of numerous generative quantum models, yet their trainability and scalability remain significant challenges. A notable example is a quantum restricted Boltzmann machine (QRBM), which is based on the Gibbs state of a parameterized non-commuting Hamiltonian. While QRBMs are expressive, their non-commuting Hamiltonians make gradient evaluation computationally demanding, even on fault-tolerant quantum computers. In this work, we propose a semi-quantum restricted Boltzmann machine (sqRBM), a model designed for classical data that mitigates the challenges associated with previous QRBM proposals. The sqRBM Hamiltonian is commuting in the visible subspace while remaining non-commuting in the hidden subspace. This structure allows us to derive closed-form expressions for both output probabilities and gradients. Leveraging these analytical results, we demonstrate that sqRBMs share a close relationship with classical restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM). Our theoretical analysis predicts that, to learn a given probability distribution, an RBM requires three times as many hidden units as an sqRBM, while both models have the same total number of parameters. We validate these findings through numerical simulations involving up to 100 units. Our results suggest that sqRBMs could enable practical quantum machine learning applications in the near future by significantly reducing quantum resource requirements.</description>

      <title>Detecting emergent 1-form symmetries with quantum error correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher-from symmetries act on sub-dimensional spatial manifolds of a quantum system and they can emerge as an exact symmetry at low energies even when they are explicitly broken at the microscopic level, making them difficult to characterize. In this work, we propose a quantitative criterion for the existence of 1-form symmetries motivated by quantum error correction (QEC). We show that the loss of the emergent 1-form symmetry is an information-theoretic transition revealed from the ensemble of post-measurement states. We analytically determine the regimes in which a 1-form symmetry emerges in product states on one- and two-dimensional lattices. The latter can be solved by mapping the ensemble of post-measurement states to the partition sum of a random bond Ising model along the Nishimori line. In analytically intractable regimes, we demonstrate how to detect 1-form symmetries with a global Minimal-Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) decoder and numerically examine the information-theoretic transition of the 1-form symmetry, including systems with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order. As an application of our protocol, we show that once the 1-form symmetry is detected to exist, a topological quantum phase transitions characterized by the spontaneous breaking of the 1-form symmetry can be accurately detected by a disorder parameter. By exploiting ideas from quantum error correction, our work develops an information-theoretic criterion for emergent 1-from symmetries, which furthers our understanding of exotic symmetries and offers practical routes toward their characterization.</description>

      <title>Invariance under quantum permutations rules out parastatistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum systems invariant under particle exchange are either Bosons or Fermions, even though quantum theory could in principle admit further types of behavior under permutations. But why do we not observe such "paraparticles" in nature? The analysis of this question was previously limited primarily to specific quantum field theory models. Here we give two independent arguments that rule out parastatistics universally, originating in quantum information theory and recent research on internal quantum reference frames. First, we introduce a notion of complete invariance: quantum systems should not only preserve their local state under permutations, but also the quantum information that they carry about other systems, in analogy to the notion of complete positivity in quantum information theory. Second, we demand that quantum systems are invariant under quantum permutations, i.e. permutations that are conditioned on the values of permutation-invariant observables. For both, we show that the respective principle is fulfilled if and only if the particle is a Boson or Fermion. Our results show how quantum reference frames can shed light on a longstanding problem of quantum physics, they underline the crucial role played by the compositional structure of quantum information, and they demonstrate the explanatory power but also subtle limitations of recently proposed quantum covariance principles.</description>

      <title>Optimization of the Qubit Coupled Cluster Ansatz on classical computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Immense interest in quantum computing has prompted development of electronic structure methods that are suitable for quantum hardware. However, the slow pace at which quantum hardware progresses, forces researchers to implement their ideas on classical computers despite the obvious loss of any "quantum advantage." As a result, the so-called quantum inspired methods emerge. They allow one to look at the electronic structure problem from a different angle; yet, to fully exploit their capacity, efficient implementations are highly desirable. Here we report two schemes for improving the amplitude optimisation in the iterative qubit coupled cluster (iQCC) method -- a variational quantum eigensolver-type approach which is based on the qubit coupled cluster (QCC) Ansatz. Our first scheme approximates the QCC unitary as a sum of symmetrical polynomials of generators up to a given order. The resulting energy expression allows for a flexible control of computational complexity via the order parameter. It also guaranties smoothness of trial energies and their derivatives, which is important for gradient-based optimization strategies. The second scheme limits the size of the expansion space in which the QCC unitary is generated. It provides better control of memory requirements, but in general may lead to the non-smooth variation of energy estimates upon changes in amplitudes. It can be used to extrapolate energies for a given set of amplitudes towards the exact QCC value. Both schemes allow for a larger number of generators to be included into the QCC form compared to the exact formulation. This reduces the number of iterations in the iQCC method and/or leads to higher accuracy. We assess capabilities of the new schemes to perform QCC amplitudes optimization for a few molecular systems: N$_2$ (16 qubits), H$_2$O (36 qubits), and tris(2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine) iridium(III), (80 qubits).</description>

      <title>Onset of Quantum Chaos and Ergoditicy in Spin Systems with Highly Degenerate Hilbert Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that in systems with highly degenerate energy spectra, such as the 2D transverse-field Ising model (2DTFIM) in the strong-field limit, quantum chaos can emerge in finite systems for arbitrary small perturbations. In this regime, the presence of extensive quasi-conserved quantities can prevent finite systems from becoming ergodic. We study the ensuing transition to ergodicity in a family of models that includes the 2DTFIM, in which the onset of ergodic behavior exhibits universality and occurs for perturbation strengths that decrease polynomially with increasing system size. We discuss the behaviors of quantum chaos indicators, such as level spacing statistics and bipartite entanglement, and of the fidelity susceptibilities and spectral functions across the transitions.</description>

      <title>Resonant Energy Transfer and Collectively Driven Emitters in Waveguide QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Waveguide quantum electrodynamics (QED) has opened a new frontier in quantum optics, which enables the radiative coupling of distantly located emitters via the spatially extended waveguide mode. This coupling leads to modified emission dynamics and previous work has reported the observation of increased intensity correlations (an antidip) when probing the resonance response of multiple emitters. However, the interference between independent emitters has been shown to lead to a similar response. Here, we directly observe resonant energy transfer between two distant quantum emitters by recording an antidip in the intensity correlations, $g^{(2)}(\tau)$, while driving only one of the emitters. Under the condition that only a single emitter is driven, the antidip in photon coincidences is a distinctive signature of emitter-emitter coupling, which enables the transfer of energy from the driven to the undriven emitter. Interestingly, the observed mechanism is a long-range and waveguide-engineered resonant version of resonant F\"orster transfer, which is responsible for the transport of energy between chlorophylls in the photosynthesis. Building on the established coupling, we demonstrate collective driving of the coupled emitter pair. Specifically, we control the relative driving phase and amplitude of the emitters and apply this collective excitation scheme to selectively populate the long-lived subradiant state. This results in suppressed emission, i.e. the peculiar situation where driving two emitters as opposed to one effectively reduces the probability of photon emission. Our work presents novel emission regimes and excitation schemes for a multi-emitter waveguide QED system. These can be exploited to deterministically generate emitter-emitter entanglement and advanced photonic states providing robustness against losses for photonic quantum computation and quantum communication.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method to construct entanglement witnesses for arbitrarily large multipartite systems, by tensoring and partial tracing existing states and witnesses. As a proof of principle we show that, using little shared quantum resources, the method allows to reuse witnesses unable to detect states with local positive partial transpositions into new ones able to do so. Moreover, we show that this technique allows to tailor both linear and nonlinear witnesses to specific states using semidefinite programming with comparatively low-dimensional variables. As an example, existing trace polynomial witnesses are significantly improved while preserving their symmetries and implementability with randomized measurements. Besides detecting entanglement, the method is shown to detect $k$-copy distillability. A recipe for the single-copy case is shown to be effective for generic and Werner states.</description>

      <title>Experimentally Informed Decoding of Stabilizer Codes Based on Syndrome Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-fidelity decoding of quantum error correction codes relies on an accurate experimental model of the physical errors occurring in the device. Because error probabilities can depend on the context of the applied operations, the error model is ideally calibrated using the same circuit as is used for the error correction experiment. Here, we present an experimental approach guided by a novel analytical formula to characterize the probability of independent errors using correlations in the syndrome data generated by executing the error correction circuit. Using the method on a distance-three surface code, we analyze error channels that flip an arbitrary number of syndrome elements, including Pauli Y errors, hook errors, multi-qubit errors, and leakage, in addition to standard Pauli X and Z errors. We use the method to find the optimal weights for a minimum-weight perfect matching decoder without relying on a theoretical error model. Additionally, we investigate whether improved knowledge of the Pauli Y error channel, based on correlating the X- and Z-type error syndromes, can be exploited to enhance matching decoding. Furthermore, we find correlated errors that flip many syndrome elements over up-to-eight cycles, potentially caused by leakage of the data qubits out of the computational subspace. The presented method provides the tools for accurately calibrating a broad family of decoders, beyond the minimum-weight perfect matching decoder, without relying on prior knowledge of the error model.</description>

      <title>Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem via Different Quantum Computing Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the application of emerging photonic and quantum computing architectures to solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), a well-known NP-hard optimization problem. We investigate several approaches: Simulated Annealing (SA), Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO-Ising) methods implemented on quantum annealers and Optical Coherent Ising Machines, as well as the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and the Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) algorithm on gate-based quantum computers.
  QAOA and QPE were tested on the IBM Quantum platform. The QUBO-Ising method was explored using the D-Wave quantum annealer, which operates on superconducting Josephson junctions, and the QCI Dirac machine, a nonlinear optoelectronic Ising machine. Gate-based quantum computers demonstrated accurate results for small TSP instances in simulation. However, real quantum devices are hindered by noise and limited scalability. Circuit complexity grows with problem size, restricting performance to TSP instances with a maximum of 6 nodes.
  In contrast, Ising-based architectures show improved scalability for larger problem sizes. SQUID-based Ising machines can handle TSP instances with up to 12 nodes, while nonlinear optoelectronic Ising machines extend this capability to 18 nodes. Nevertheless, the solutions tend to be suboptimal due to hardware limitations and challenges in achieving ground state convergence as the problem size increases. Despite these limitations, Ising machines demonstrate significant time advantages over classical methods, making them a promising candidate for solving larger-scale TSPs efficiently.</description>

      <title>STQS: A Unified System Architecture for Spatial Temporal Quantum Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum sensing (QS) harnesses quantum phenomena to measure physical observables with extraordinary precision, sensitivity, and resolution. Despite significant advancements in quantum sensing, prevailing efforts have focused predominantly on refining the underlying sensor materials and hardware. Given the growing demands of increasingly complex application domains and the continued evolution of quantum sensing technologies, the present moment is the right time to systematically explore distributed quantum sensing architectures and their corresponding design space.
  We present STQS, a unified system architecture for spatiotemporal quantum sensing that interlaces four key quantum components: sensing, memory, communication, and computation. By employing a comprehensive gate-based framework, we systemically explore the design space of quantum sensing schemes and probe the influence of noise at each state in a sensing workflow through simulation. We introduce a novel distance-based metric that compares reference states to sensing states and assigns a confidence level. We anticipate that the distance measure will serve as an intermediate step towards more advanced quantum signal processing techniques like quantum machine learning. To our knowledge, STQS is the first system-level framework to integrate quantum sensing within a coherent, unified architectural paradigm. STQS provides seamless avenues for unique state preparation, multi-user sensing requests, and addressing practical implementations. We demonstrate the versatility of STQS through evaluations of quantum radar and qubit-based dark matter detection. To highlight the near-term feasibility of our approach, we present results obtained from IBM's Marrakesh and IonQ's Forte devices, validating key STQS components on present day quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Quantum neural compressive sensing for ghost imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Demonstrating the utility of quantum algorithms is a long-standing challenge, where quantum machine learning becomes one of the most promising candidate that can be resorted to. In this study, we investigate a quantum neural compressive sensing algorithm for ghost imaging to showcase its utility. The algorithm utilizes the variational quantum circuits to reparameterize the inverse problem of ghost imaging and uses the inductive bias of the physical forward model to perform optimization. To validate the algorithm's effectiveness, we conduct optical ghost imaging experiments, capturing signals from objects at different physical sampling rates and detection signal-to-noise ratios. The experimental results show that our proposed algorithm surpasses conventional methods in both visual appearance and quantitative metrics, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Importantly, we observe that the quantum neural network, guided by prior knowledge of physics, effectively overcomes the challenge of barren plateau in the optimization process. The proposed algorithm demonstrates robustness against various quantum noise levels, making it suitable for near-term quantum devices. Our study leverages physical inductive bias guided variational quantum algorithm, underscoring the potential of quantum computation in tackling a broad range of optimization and inverse problems.</description>

      <title>Novel quantum circuit for image compression utilizing modified Toffoli gate and quantized transformed coefficient alongside a novel reset gate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum image computing has emerged as a groundbreaking field, revolutionizing how we store and process data at speeds incomparable to classical methods. Nevertheless, as image sizes expand, so does the complexity of qubit connections, posing significant challenges in the efficient representation and compression of quantum images. In response, we introduce a modified Toffoli gate state connection using a quantized transform coefficient preparation process. This innovative strategy streamlines circuit complexity by modifying state connection from the state connection information. In our operational control gates, only input 1 impacts the output, allowing us to modify the state connection and dramatically enhance the efficiency of the proposed circuit. As a result, the proposed approach significantly reduces the number of gates required for both image compression and representation. Our findings reveal that it requires an impressive 44.21 percent fewer gates than existing techniques, such as the Direct Cosine Transform Efficient Flexible Representation of Quantum Images (DCTEFRQI), all while maintaining a consistent peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). For an image block size of 2^Sx2^Sy with q gray levels, the complexity of our approach can be succinctly expressed as, O[3q+log2Sx+log2Sy+2q(log2Sx+log2Sy)]. Here, Sx and Sy represent the X and Y positional control gates while q indicates the non-zero transform coefficients. Moreover, experimental evaluations strongly demonstrate that it excels in both compressing and representing quantum images compared to the DCTEFRQI approach, particularly excelling in the essential metrics of gate requirements and PSNR performance. Embrace the future of quantum imaging with our innovative solution, where efficiency meets excellence.</description>

      <title>A Computational Framework for Simulations of Dissipative Non-Adiabatic Dynamics on Hybrid Oscillator-Qubit Quantum Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a computational framework for simulating non-adiabatic vibronic dynamics on circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) platforms. Our approach leverages hybrid oscillator-qubit quantum hardware with mid-circuit measurements and resets, enabling the incorporation of environmental effects such as dissipation and dephasing. To demonstrate its capabilities, we simulate energy transfer dynamics in a triad model of photosynthetic chromophores inspired by natural antenna systems. We specifically investigate the role of dissipation during the relaxation dynamics following photoexcitation, where electronic transitions are coupled to the evolution of quantum vibrational modes. Our results indicate that hybrid oscillator-qubit devices, operating with noise levels below the intrinsic dissipation rates of typical molecular antenna systems, can achieve the simulation fidelity required for practical computations on near-term and early fault-tolerant quantum computing platforms.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian effects on the steady state properties of a damped harmonic oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the steady-state characteristics of a damped harmonic oscillator (system) in presence of a non-Markovian bath characterized by Lorentzian spectral density. Although Markovian baths presume memoryless dynamics, the introduction of complex temporal connections by a non-Markovian environment radically modifies the dynamics of the system and its steady-state behaviour. We obtain the steady-state Green's functions and correlation functions of the system using the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism. In both rotating and non-rotating wave approximation, we analyzed various emergent properties like effective temperature and distribution function. We also explore the impact of dissipation and non-Markovian bath on the quantum Zeno and anti-Zeno effects. We show that a transition between Zeno to anti-Zeno effect can be tuned by bath spectral width and the strength of dissipation.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Intrinsic Quality Factors Approaching 10 Million in Superconducting Planar Resonators via Spiral Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the use of spiral geometry in superconducting resonators to achieve high intrinsic quality factors, crucial for applications in quantum computation and quantum sensing. We fabricated Archimedean Spiral Resonators (ASRs) using domain-matched epitaxially grown titanium nitride (TiN) on silicon wafers, achieving intrinsic quality factors of $Q_\mathrm{i} = (9.6 \pm 1.5) \times 10^6$ at the single-photon level and $Q_\mathrm{i} = (9.91 \pm 0.39) \times 10^7$ at high power, significantly outperforming traditional coplanar waveguide (CPW) resonators.
  We conducted a comprehensive numerical analysis using COMSOL to calculate surface participation ratios (PRs) at critical interfaces: metal-air, metal-substrate, and substrate-air. Our findings reveal that ASRs have lower PRs than CPWs, explaining their superior quality factors and reduced coupling to two-level systems (TLSs).</description>

      <title>Quantum Inspired Excited States Calculations for Molecules Based on Contextual Subspace and Symmetry Optimizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum-inspired methods for excited-state calculations remain underexplored in Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware, despite their critical role in photochemistry and material science. Here, we propose a resource-efficient framework that integrates the contextual subspace (CS) method with the Variational Quantum Deflation (VQD) algorithm to enable systematic excited-state calculations for molecules while reducing qubit requirements. On the basis of the numerical results, we find that it is unproblematic to utilize this combination in calculating the excited state to reduce qubits. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the implementation of a spin-conserving hardware-efficient ansatz, namely the $\mathcal{N}(\theta_x,\theta_y,\theta_z)$ block ansatz, allows exploitation of spin symmetry within the projected subspace, thereby achieving further reductions in computational resource demands. Compared to the commonly used $R_{y}R_{z}$ ansatz, using the $\mathcal{N}(\theta_x,\theta_y,\theta_z)$ ansatz can reduce the number of optimization iterations by up to 3 times at a similar circuit depth.</description>

      <title>Microwave dynamics of gated Al/InAs superconducting nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several experiments have recently reported on gate-tunable superconducting properties in metallic devices, holding promise for the realization of cryogenic switches, tunable resonators, and superconducting logic. In particular, the suppression of the critical current as a function of the gate voltage has been widely investigated. However, time-domain studies are discussed only in a few cases. In this paper, we present a microwave characterization of a gate-controlled Al-capped InAs nanowire embedded in a $\lambda/4$ coplanar waveguide resonator. We observe a shift in the resonator frequency and an increase in its internal losses as a function of the gate voltage, which we relate to a change in the imaginary and real components of the nanowire impedance, respectively. We demonstrate that these changes are described by the Mattis-Bardeen model with an effective temperature. We further study the resonator response to fast gate signals and measure characteristic response times of the order of 40 ns, both in time-domain and parametric modulation experiments. Our study elucidates the impact of the gate on the complex impedance of the nanowire in the superconducting state, as well as its dynamic performance, providing a foundation for the design of gate-controlled superconducting devices.</description>

      <title>Quantum negative sampling strategy for knowledge graph embedding with variational circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge graph is a collection of facts, known as triples(head, relation, tail), which are represented in form of a network, where nodes are entities and edges are relations among the respective head and tail entities. Embedding of knowledge graph for facilitating downstream tasks such as knowledge graph completion, link prediction, recommendation, has been a major area of research recently in classical machine learning. Because the size of knowledge graphs are becoming larger, one of the natural choices is to exploit quantum computing for knowledge graph embedding. Recently, a hybrid quantum classical model for knowledge graph embedding has been studied in which a variational quantum circuit is trained. One of the important aspects in knowledge graph embedding is the sampling of negative triples, which plays a crucial role in efficient training of the model. In classical machine learning various negative sampling strategies have been studied. In quantum knowledge graph embedding model, although we can use these strategies in principle, it is natural to ask if we can exploit quantum advantage in negative sampling. In this article we study such a negative sampling strategy, which exploits quantum superposition, and evaluate the model's performance with a knowledge graph database.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Quantum Scaling Model for Histogram Distribution-based Quantum Watermarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of quantum image representation and quantum measurement techniques has made quantum image processing research a hot topic. In this paper, a novel Adaptive Quantum Scaling Model (AQSM) is first proposed for scrambling watermark images. Then, on the basis of the proposed AQSM, a novel quantum watermarking scheme is presented. Unlike existing quantum watermarking schemes with fixed embedding scales, the proposed method can flexibly embed watermarks of different sizes. In order to improve the robustness of the watermarking algorithm, a novel Histogram Distribution-based Watermarking Mechanism (HDWM) is proposed, which utilizes the histogram distribution property of the watermark image to determine the embedding strategy. In order to improve the accuracy of extracted watermark information, a quantum refining method is suggested, which can realize a certain error correction. The required key quantum circuits are designed. Finally, the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed quantum watermarking method are evaluated by simulation experiments on three image size scales. The results demonstrate the invisibility and good robustness of the watermarking algorithm.</description>

      <title>Decoherence from the light bending interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse a decoherence effect, caused by the gravitational interaction between a massive body and the electromagnetic field. Assuming a quantum version of the light bending interaction, we show that it leads to decoherence of the mass if the light is not observed. Using the extreme weakness of the gravitational coupling, we derive explicitly the decoherence lengthscales for general states of the central mass and for both thermal and coherent light. Predictably, the effect is very faint for anything but hugely energetic light, however from the fundamental point of view of co-existence of both gravitation and quantum theories, it is there. Since effectively the studied system is a quantum optomechanical system, we hope our results, properly rescaled, will be also useful in optomechanics.</description>

      <title>Satellite-Aided Entanglement Distribution for Optimized Quantum Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum internet needs to ensure timely provision of entangled qubits to be used in tasks that involve distributed quantum computing or sensing. This has been addressed by a top-down approach of optimized quantum networks [arXiv:2107.10275], in which entanglement is distributed prior to receiving tasks. Upon the task arrival, the desired entanglement state is attained with local operations and classical communication. The pre-distribution of entanglements should aim to minimize the amount of qubits used, as this decreases the risk of decoherence and thus degradation of the entangled state. The optimized quantum networks consider a multi-hop optical network and in this work we are supplementing it with Satellite-aided Entanglement Distribution (SED). The motivation is that satellites can shortcut the topology and place the entanglement at two nodes not directly connected through the optical network. We devise an algorithm for strategic placement of entanglements with SED, which results in a decrease in the number of qubits used in pre-distribution of entanglement. The numerical results show that SED can significantly enhance the performance of small quantum networks, while Entanglement-sharing Constraints (EC) are critical for large networks.</description>

      <title>Quantum Eigensolver with Exponentially Improved Dependence on Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eigenvalue estimation is a fundamental problem in numerical analysis and scientific computation. The case of complex eigenvalues is considered to be hard. This work proposes an efficient quantum eigensolver based on quantum polynomial transformations of the matrix. Specifically, we construct Chebyshev polynomials and positive integer power functions transformations to the input matrix within the framework of block encoding. Our algorithm simply employs Hadamard test on the matrix polynomials to generate classical data, and then pocesses the data to retrieve the information of the eigenvalue. The algorithmic complexity depends logarithmically on precision and failure probability, and is independent of the matrix size. Therefore, the algorithm provides exponential advantage over previous work.</description>

      <title>Pauli measurements are not optimal for single-copy tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state tomography is a fundamental problem in quantum computing. Given $n$ copies of an unknown $N$-qubit state $\rho \in \mathbb{C}^{d \times d},d=2^N$, the goal is to learn the state up to an accuracy $\epsilon$ in trace distance, with at least probability 0.99. We are interested in the copy complexity, the minimum number of copies of $\rho$ needed to fulfill the task.
  Pauli measurements have attracted significant attention due to their ease of implementation in limited settings. The best-known upper bound is $O(\frac{N \cdot 12^N}{\epsilon^2})$, and no non-trivial lower bound is known besides the general single-copy lower bound $\Omega(\frac{8^n}{\epsilon^2})$, achieved by hard-to-implement structured POVMs such as MUB, SIC-POVM, and uniform POVM.
  We have made significant progress on this long-standing problem. We first prove a stronger upper bound of $O(\frac{10^N}{\epsilon^2})$. To complement it with a lower bound of $\Omega(\frac{9.118^N}{\epsilon^2})$, which holds under adaptivity. To our knowledge, this demonstrates the first known separation between Pauli measurements and structured POVMs.
  The new lower bound is a consequence of a novel framework for adaptive quantum state tomography with measurement constraints. The main advantage over prior methods is that we can use measurement-dependent hard instances to prove tight lower bounds for Pauli measurements. Moreover, we connect the copy-complexity lower bound to the eigenvalues of the measurement information channel, which governs the measurement's capacity to distinguish states. To demonstrate the generality of the new framework, we obtain tight-bounds for adaptive quantum tomography with $k$-outcome measurements, where we recover existing results and establish new ones.</description>

      <title>Experimentally separating vacuum fluctuations from source radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unique distinction between vacuum-field and source-radiation induced effects in processes such as the Lamb shift, Casimir forces or spontaneous emission, remains unresolved even at the theoretical level, and an experimental approach was never considered feasible [1-4]. In 1932, Fermi introduced the two-atom problem, which is a Gedanken-experiment that explores how two atoms interact with the surrounding electromagnetic field via vacuum and source-radiation induced processes, providing fundamental insights into the behavior of quantum fields [5-9]. Recent advancements in ultrafast optics have enabled experimental analogues of this system using two laser pulses inside a nonlinear crystal [10-12]. Here, we demonstrate the detection of vacuum and source radiation induced correlations, separated by their causal properties, between two laser pulses. In particular, we show that vacuum fluctuations and source radiation correlate different quadratures of near-infrared laser pulses, allowing them to be individually probed through phase-sensitive detection. This result provides an experimental verification of the time-domain fluctuation-dissipation theorem at the quantum level and offers a novel path to studying quantum radiation effects in time-dependent media. Beyond resolving a longstanding theoretical ambiguity, our findings open new possibilities for investigating quantum field phenomena in the context of relativistic quantum information such as entanglement harvesting from the quantum vacuum or quantum field detection in analogues of curved space-times.</description>

Abstract: We explore the performance of the metrology scheme by employing a quantum time flip during encoding, a specific case of processes with indefinite time direction, which we refer to as indefinite time directed metrology (ITDM). In the case of single parameter estimation of a unitary, we demonstrate that our protocol can achieve Heisenberg scaling (1/N) with product probe states, surpassing the standard quantum limit (1/\sqrt{N}), where N is the number of particles in the probe. We establish this by computing the quantum Fisher information (QFI) which is a lower bound on the root mean square error occurred during parameter estimation. Although we analytically prove the optimality of the symmetric product probe state in ITDM, entangled probe states produce a higher QFI than optimal product probes without enhancing scaling, highlighting the non-essentiality of entanglement. For phase estimation, we propose a single-qubit measurement on the control qubit that accomplishes near-optimal Fisher information and eventually reaches Heisenberg scaling. Our findings reveal the best orientation of product probe states in every pertinent situation, emphasizing its independence from the parameter to be estimated in the limiting case. Furthermore, we illustrate the benefits of ITDM in noisy metrology, outperforming existing techniques in some situations.</description>

      <title>Improved amplitude amplification strategies for the quantum simulation of classical transport problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum simulation of classical fluids often involves the use of probabilistic algorithms that encode the result of the dynamics in the form of the amplitude of the selected quantum state. In most cases, however, the amplitude probability is too low to allow an efficient use of these algorithms, thereby hindering the practical viability of the quantum simulation. The oblivious amplitude amplification algorithm is often presented as a solution to this problem, but to no avail for most classical problems, since its applicability is limited to unitary dynamics. In this paper, we show analytically that oblivious amplitude amplification when applied to non-unitary dynamics leads to a distortion of the quantum state and to an accompanying error in the quantum update. We provide an analytical upper bound of such error as a function of the degree of non-unitarity of the dynamics and we test it against a quantum simulation of an advection-diffusion-reaction equation, a transport problem of major relevance in science and engineering. Finally, we also propose an amplification strategy that helps mitigate the distortion error, while still securing an enhanced success probability.</description>

      <title>Tuning of Josephson junctions -- the effects of depinning physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building more powerful quantum computers requires manufacturing processes with tight tolerances. To improve the tolerances on Josephson junctions, techniques to fine tune their properties after fabrication have been developed. Understanding how tuning techniques may physically modify the tunnel barrier of a Josephson junction is important and will enable these techniques to be optimised. We develop a model of junction tuning based on depinning theory to interpret a phase diagram of tuning rate. We extract the dependence on temperature, time varying voltages and oscillation frequency. Using depinning theory we are able to show both why time varying annealing potentials result in controlled junction tuning and how such protocols can be optimised. We examine how tuning changes the electrical breakdown of barriers and discrepancies between modeled and measured higher energy levels of transmon qubits.</description>

      <title>Demolition measurement protocol for transmon qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The process of measuring a qubit and re-initializing it to the ground state practically lead to long qubit idle times between re-runs of experiments on a superconducting quantum computer. Here, we propose a protocol for a demolition measurement of a transmon qubit that integrates qubit readout with the reset process to minimize qubit idle time. We present a three-staged implementation of this protocol, involving a combined qubit readout and resonator reset scheme that unconditionally resets the resonator at the end of the readout; a leakage removal scheme that can be integrated with the measurement stage; and an unconditional qubit reset. We demonstrate that this protocol could be implemented in $1 \mu$s with greater than $95 \%$ reset fidelity and a $99 \%$ readout fidelity without any hardware overhead beyond those commonly used. This provides at least a tenfold speed-up compared to the passive decay of the qubit, hence significantly increasing the data-acquisition rate.</description>

      <title>Improving success probability in the LHZ parity embedding by computing with quantum walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The LHZ parity embedding is one of the front-running methods for implementing difficult-to-engineer long-range interactions in quantum optimisation problems. Continuous-time quantum walks are a leading approach for solving quantum optimisation problems. Due to them populating excited states, quantum walks can avoid the exponential gap closing problems seen in other continuous-time techniques such as quantum annealing and adiabatic quantum computation (AQC). An important question therefore, is how continuous-time quantum walks perform in combination with the LHZ parity embedding. By numerically simulating continuous-time quantum walks on 4, 5 and 6 logical qubit Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) Ising spin glass instances embedded onto the LHZ parity architecture, we are able to verify the continued efficacy of heuristics used to estimate the optimal hopping rate and the numerical agreement with the theory behind the location of the lower bound of the LHZ parity constraint strength. In addition, by comparing several different LHZ-based decoding methods, we were able to identify post-readout error correction techniques which were able to improve the success probability of the quantum walk.</description>

      <title>Detecting high-dimensional time-bin entanglement in fiber-loop systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many quantum communication protocols rely on the distribution of entanglement between the different participating parties. One example is quantum key distribution (QKD), an application that has matured to commercial use in recent years. However, difficulties remain, especially with noise resilience and channel capacity in long-distance communication. One way to overcome these problems is to use high-dimensional entanglement, which has been shown to be more robust to noise and enables higher secret-key rates. It is therefore important to have access to certifiable high-dimensional entanglement sources to confidently implement these advanced QKD protocols. Here, we develop a method for certifying high-dimensional time-bin entanglement in fiber-loop systems. In these systems, entanglement creation and detection can utilize the same physical components, and the number of time bins, and thus the entanglement dimension, can be adapted without making physical changes to the setup. Our certification method builds on previous proposals for the certification of angular-momentum entanglement in photon pairs. In particular, measurements in only two experimentally accessible bases are sufficient to obtain a lower bound on the entanglement dimension for both two- and multiphoton quantum states. Numerical simulations show that the method is robust against typical experimental noise effects and works well even with limited measurement statistics, thus establishing time-bin encoded photons as a promising platform for high-dimensional quantum-communication protocols.</description>

      <title>Quantum extreme learning machines for photonic entanglement witnessing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The estimation of properties of quantum states -- such as entanglement -- is a core need for the development of quantum technologies, yet remaining a demanding challenge. Standard approaches to property estimation rely on the modeling of the measurement apparatus and, often, a priori assumptions on their working principles. Even small deviations can greatly affect reconstruction accuracy and prediction reliability. Machine learning (ML) techniques have been proven promising to overcome these difficulties. However, interpretability issues related to overfitting limit the usefulness of existing ML methods when high precision is requested. Here, we demonstrate that quantum extreme learning machines (QELMs) embody a powerful alternative for witnessing quantum entanglement and, more generally, for estimating features of experimental quantum states. We implement a photonic QELM that leverages the orbital angular momentum of photon pairs as an ancillary degree of freedom to enable informationally complete single-setting measurements of the entanglement shared by their polarization degrees of freedom. Unlike conventional methods, our approach does not require fine-tuning, precise calibration, or refined knowledge of the apparatus. In contrast, it automatically adapts to noise and imprecisions while avoiding overfitting, thus ensuring the robust reconstruction of entanglement witnesses and paving the way to the assessment of quantum features of experimental multi-party states.</description>

      <title>Entanglement transitions in a boundary-driven open quantum many-body system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a numerical framework based on tree tensor operators that enables large-scale simulation of out-of-equilibrium open quantum many-body systems. By design, it protects density operator positivity and provides direct access to entanglement monotones, such as entanglement of formation and logarithmic negativity. To demonstrate the framework's ability to probe entanglement in open quantum many-body systems and distinguish it from other correlations, we study a paradigmatic open system problem: the boundary-driven XXZ spin-chain. We uncover entanglement transitions driven by both the coupling to the environment and the anisotropy parameter. These transitions reveal an immediate connection between entanglement and spin-current, and link the known transport regimes of the model to distinct entanglement regimes, i.e., separable, area-law, and volume-law. Our work enables the analysis of entanglement in open quantum many-body systems out of equilibrium, a necessary step for developing scalable quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Multi-Channel Currency: A Secure Method Using Semi-Quantum Tokens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital currencies primarily operate online, but there is growing interest in enabling offline transactions to improve digital inclusion. Existing offline methods struggle with double-spending risks, often limiting transaction amounts. In this work, we propose a quantum-state-based currency system that uses the non-cloning theorem to enable secure, multi-channel transactions without the risk of double spending. We demonstrate this system's implementation with experimental results, including use cases for currency transfers and swaps. To mitigate credit risks in swaps, we also integrate blockchain to show its wide applicability. Our approach paves the way for quantum-secure digital currencies and opens new possibilities for optimizing multi-channel tokens.</description>

      <title>Trotter error and gate complexity of the SYK and sparse SYK models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model is a prominent model of strongly interacting fermions that serves as a toy model of quantum gravity and black hole physics. In this work, we study the Trotter error and gate complexity of the quantum simulation of the SYK model using Lie-Trotter-Suzuki formulas. Building on recent results by Chen and Brandao (arXiv:2111.05324), we derive bounds on the first- and higher-order Trotter error of the SYK model, and subsequently find near-optimal gate complexities for simulating these models using Lie-Trotter-Suzuki formulas. For the $k$-local SYK model on $n$ Majorana fermions, our gate complexity estimates for the first-order Lie-Trotter-Suzuki formula scales with $O(n^{k+\frac{5}{2}}t^2)$ for even $k$ and $O(n^{k+3}t^2)$ for odd $k$, and the gate complexity of simulations using higher-order formulas scales with $O(n^{k+\frac{1}{2}}t)$ for even $k$ and $O(n^{k+1}t)$ for odd $k$. Given that the SYK model has $\Theta(n^k)$ terms, these estimates are close to optimal. These gate complexities can be further improved when simulating the time-evolution of an arbitrary fixed input state $|\psi\rangle$, leading to a $O(n^2)$-reduction in gate complexity for first-order formulas and $O(\sqrt{n})$-reduction for higher-order formulas.
  We also apply our techniques to the sparse SYK model, a simplified variant of the SYK model obtained by deleting all but a $\Theta(n)$ fraction of the terms in a uniformly i.i.d. manner. We compute the average (over the random term removal) gate complexity for simulating this model using higher-order formulas to be $O(n^2 t)$, a bound that also holds for a general class of sparse Gaussian random Hamiltonians. Similar to the full SYK model, we obtain a $O(\sqrt{n})$-reduction simulating the time-evolution of an arbitrary fixed input state $|\psi\rangle$.</description>

      <title>A Digital Quantum Algorithm for Non-Markovian Electron Transfer Dynamics Using Repeated Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms have the potential to revolutionize our understanding of open quantum systems in chemistry. In this work, we demonstrate that quantum algorithms leveraging a repeated interaction model can effectively reproduce non-Markovian electron transfer processes under four different donor-acceptor parameter regimes and for a donor-bridge-acceptor system. We systematically explore how the algorithm scales for the regimes. Notably, our approach exhibits favorable scaling in the required repeated interaction length as the electronic coupling, temperature, damping rate, and system size increase. Furthermore, a single Trotter step per repeated interaction leads to an acceptably small error, and high-fidelity initial states can be prepared with a short time evolution. This efficiency highlights the potential of the algorithm for tackling increasingly complex systems. When fault-tolerant quantum hardware becomes available, the method could be extended to incorporate structured baths, additional energy levels, or more intricate coupling schemes, enabling the simulation of real-world open quantum systems that remain beyond the reach of classical computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Renyi reflected entropies of order $n \geq 2$ are correlation measures that have been introduced in the field of holography. In this work, we put the spotlight on the min-reflected entropy, i.e., the Renyi reflected entropy in the limit $n \rightarrow \infty$. We show that, for general bipartite quantum states, this measure is identical to another measure originating from the field of quantum information theory: the doubly minimized Petz Renyi mutual information of order $1/2$. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this equality enables us to answer several previously open questions, each concerning one of the two correlation measures (or generalizations of them).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a toolkit of highly symmetric techniques employing matrix inequalities has been developed to detect entanglement in various ways. Here we unifiedly explain in detail these methods, and expand them to a new family of positive maps with further detection capabilities. In the simplest case, we generalize the reduction map to detect more generic states using both multiple copies and local filters. Through the Choi-Jamio{\l}kowski isomorphism, this family of maps leads to a construction of multipartite entanglement witnesses. Discussions and examples are provided regarding the detection of states with local positive partial transposition and the use of multiple copies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiconductors are the backbone of modern technology, garnering decades of investment in high quality materials and devices. Electron spin systems in semiconductors, including atomic defects and quantum dots, have been demonstrated in the last two decades to host quantum coherent spin qubits, often with coherent spin-photon interfaces and proximal nuclear spins. These systems are at the center of developing quantum technology. However, new material challenges arise when considering the isotopic composition of host and qubit systems. The isotopic composition governs the nature and concentration of nuclear spins, which naturally occur in leading host materials. These spins generate magnetic noise -- detrimental to qubit coherence -- but also show promise as local quantum memories and processors, necessitating careful engineering dependent on the targeted application. Reviewing recent experimental and theoretical progress towards understanding local nuclear spin environments in semiconductors, we show this aspect of material engineering as critical to quantum information technology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conducting levitated mechanical experiments in extreme conditions has long been the aim of researchers, as it allows for the investigation of new fundamental physics phenomena. One of the great frontiers has been sending these experiments into the micro-g environment of space, with multiple proposals calling for such a platform. At the same time, levitated sensors have demonstrated a high sensitivity to external stimuli which will only improve in low-vibrational conditions. conditions This paper describes the development of a technology demonstrator for optical and magnetic trapping experiments in space. Our payload represents the first concrete step towards future missions with aims of probing fundamental physical questions: matter-wave interferometry of nanoparticles to probe the limits of macroscopic quantum mechanics, detection of Dark Matter candidates and gravitational waves to test physics beyond the Standard Model, and accelerometry for Earth-observation.</description>

      <title>A Constructor-Theoretic and Quantum Information Approach to the Three-Step Photoemission Model: A Theoretical Investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel theoretical reformulation of the conventional three-step photoemission model is presented by integrating the conceptual frameworks of constructor theory and quantum information theory. Each step of the photoemission process photon absorption, electron transport, and electron emission is formalized as a physical task (in the constructor-theoretic sense) and modeled by a quantum channel with an explicit operator-level description. This dual framework not only recovers the standard efficiency factorization n = A T D but also reveals new insights into the preservation of coherence and the interdependence of successive tasks. Furthermore, potential experimental setups and conditions under which the predicted phenomena could be observed are discussed. The motivation of this work is to pave the path for improved implementations of the current photoemission model and to contribute toward the realization of a universal constructor for quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Emergent Hydrodynamic Mode on SU(2) Plaquette Chains and Quantum Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We search for emergent hydrodynamic modes in real-time Hamiltonian dynamics of $2+1$-dimensional SU(2) lattice gauge theory on a quasi one dimensional plaquette chain, by numerically computing symmetric correlation functions of energy densities on lattice sizes of about $20$ with the local Hilbert space truncated at $j_{\rm max}=\frac{1}{2}$. Due to the Umklapp processes, we only find a mode for energy diffusion. The symmetric correlator exhibits transport peak near zero frequency with a width proportional to momentum squared at small momentum, when the system is fully quantum ergodic, as indicated by the eigenenergy level statistics. This transport peak leads to a power-law $t^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ decay of the symmetric correlator at late time, also known as the long-time tail, as well as diffusion-like spreading in position space. We also introduce a quantum algorithm for computing the symmetric correlator on a quantum computer and find it gives results consistent with exact diagonalization when tested on the IBM emulator. Finally we discuss the future prospect of searching for the sound modes.</description>

      <title>Real-time simulation of jet energy loss and entropy production in high-energy scattering with matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In analogy to high-energy nuclear scattering experiments, we study a real-time scattering process between a propagating state and a dense target in $1+1$-d massive QED. In our setup, we identify three distinct regimes that qualitatively characterize the evolution: for a dilute medium, the incoming probe state evolves nearly ballistically; in an intermediate setting, it traverses the matter, locally exciting it; and for dense targets, one approaches a black-disk limit, where the matter acts as a strong wall potential. We find evidence that the probe's energy loss rate scales linearly with the path length in the medium, and we study how the entanglement entropy reveals the mixing between the probe and medium states. With the goal of one day replicating high-energy nuclear experiments in quantum devices, we briefly discuss how the current tensor network-based simulations can be translated to a quantum simulator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It was conjectured thirty years ago that gravity could arise from the entropic re-arrangement of information. In this paper, we offer a set of microscopic quantum models which realize this idea in detail. In particular, we suggest a simple mechanism by which Newton's law of gravity arises from extremization of the free energy of a collection of qubits or oscillators, rather than from the exchange of virtual quanta of a fundamental field. We give both a local and non-local version of the construction, and show how to distinguish a range of these entropic models from ordinary perturbative quantum gravity using existing observations and near-term experiments.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional Meta-atoms for High Confinement of Mid-IR Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to confine photons into structures with highly sub-wavelength volumes is extremely interesting for many applications such as sensing, nonlinear optics, and strong light-matter interactions. However, their realization is increasingly difficult as the wavelength becomes shorter, due to fabrication challenges and increased metal losses. In this work, we present the first experimental characterization of three-dimensional circuit-like resonators operating in the mid-infrared. Through a combination of simulations, reflectivity measurements, and scanning near-field optical microscopy, we developed an analytical model capable of predicting the electromagnetic response of these structures based on their geometrical parameters. The design we studied offers a high degree of flexibility, enabling precise control over the resonant frequency of the various modes supported by the resonator, as well as independent control over radiative and non-radiative losses. Combined with the extreme field confinement demonstrated, these meta-atoms are highly promising for applications in detectors,</description>

      <title>Effective Field Neural Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, with the rapid development of machine learning, physicists have been exploring its new applications in solving or alleviating the curse of dimensionality in many-body problems. In order to accurately reflect the underlying physics of the problem, domain knowledge must be encoded into the machine learning algorithms. In this work, inspired by field theory, we propose a new set of machine learning models called effective field neural networks (EFNNs) that can automatically and efficiently capture important many-body interactions through multiple self-refining processes. Taking the classical $3$-spin infinite-range model and the quantum double exchange model as case studies, we explicitly demonstrate that EFNNs significantly outperform fully-connected deep neural networks (DNNs) and the effective model. Furthermore, with the help of convolution operations, the EFNNs learned in a small system can be seamlessly used in a larger system without additional training and the relative errors even decrease, which further demonstrates the efficacy of EFNNs in representing core physical behaviors.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Theory of Chern Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The modern theory of polarization does not apply in its original form to systems with non-trivial band topology. Chern insulators are one such example since they are insulating in the bulk but exhibit metallic edge states, complicating the definition of polarization. Wannier functions formed a key ingredient of the original modern theory of polarization, but it has been considered that these cannot be applied to Chern insulators since they are no longer exponentially localized and the Wannier center is no longer gauge invariant. In this Letter, we provide an unambiguous definition of absolute polarization for a Chern insulator in terms of the Zak phase. We obtain our expression by studying the non-quantized fractional charge bound to lattice dislocations and it can be computed directly from bulk quantities and makes no assumption on the edge state filling. Our result is fully consistent with previous results on the quantized charge bound to dislocations in the presence of crystalline symmetry. At the same time, our result is more general since it also applies to Chern insulators which do not have crystalline symmetries other than translations.</description>

      <title>Quantum Transport in Reduced Graphene Oxide Measured by Scanning Probe Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report combined scanning probe microscopy and transport measurements to investigate the local electronic transport properties of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) devices. We demonstrate that the quantum transport properties in these materials can be significantly tuned by the electrostatic potential applied by an atomic force microscope (AFM) conducting tip. Scanning gate microscopy measurements show a distinct p-type response, where the AFM tip locally gates the rGO, thereby modulating the transport current. Additional scanning impedance microscopy measurements indicate shifts in the Fermi energy under different gating conditions, highlighting the strong influence of local electrostatic potentials on the transport characteristics of rGO. We demonstrate that the interplay between the tip-induced Fermi level shifts and defect-mediated scattering processes plays a key role in determining the observed transport behavior. Our findings emphasize the crucial role of scattering mechanisms, particularly resonant scattering caused by impurities or structural defects, in determining low-dimensional transport behavior in rGO. Notably, rGO exhibits resonant scattering effects akin to those seen in one-dimensional systems like carbon nanotubes, despite its two-dimensional structure. These insights advance our current understanding of charge transport in rGO, and have important implications for its use in nanoscale electronics, flexible sensors, and tunable optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>ByteQC: GPU-Accelerated Quantum Chemistry Package for Large-Scale Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Applying quantum chemistry algorithms to large-scale systems requires substantial computational resources scaled with the system size and the desired accuracy. To address this, ByteQC, a fully-functional and efficient package for large-scale quantum chemistry simulations, has been open-sourced at https://github.com/bytedance/byteqc, leveraging recent advances in computational power and many-body algorithms.
  Regarding computational power, several standard algorithms are efficiently implemented on modern GPUs, ranging from mean-field calculations (Hartree-Fock and density functional theory) to post-Hartree-Fock methods such as M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory, random phase approximation, coupled cluster methods, and quantum Monte Carlo methods. For the algorithmic approach, we also employ a quantum embedding method, which significantly expands the tractable system size while preserving high accuracy at the gold-standard level.
  All these features have been systematically benchmarked. For standalone algorithms, the benchmark results demonstrate up to a 60$\times$ speedup when compared to 100-core CPUs. Additionally, the tractable system sizes have been significantly expanded: 1,610 orbitals for coupled cluster with single and double excitations (1,380 orbitals with perturbative triple excitations), 11,040 orbitals for M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory of second order, 37,120 orbitals for mean-field calculations under open boundary conditions, and over 100,000 orbitals for periodic boundary conditions. For the advanced quantum embedding feature, two representative examples are demonstrated: the water cluster problem (2,752 orbitals) and a water monomer adsorbed on a boron nitride surface (3,929 orbitals), achieving the gold-standard accuracy.</description>

We then discuss the particular example of parton showers with quantum interference. We summarize the basic ideas behind the classical and quantum parton shower Monte Carlo algorithms and highlight the importance of quantum/classical hybrid algorithms. Our finding in quantum parton showers could serve as a useful case study for further exploration of quantum algorithms/computers in high-energy physics.</description>

      <title>Scrutinizing the Mori memory function for diffusion in periodic quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion is an ubiquitous phenomenon. It is a widespread belief that as long as the area under a current autocorrelation function converges in time, the corresponding spatiotemporal density dynamics should be diffusive. This may be viewed as a result of the combination of linear response theory with the Einstein relation. However, attempts to derive this statement from first principles are notoriously challenging. We first present a counterexample by constructing a correlation functions of some density wave, such that the area under the corresponding current autocorrelation function converges, but the dynamics do not obey a diffusion equation. Then we will introduce a method based on the recursion method and the Mori memory formalism, that may help to actually identify diffusion. For a decisive answer, one would have to know infinitely many so called Lanczos coefficients, which is unattainable in most cases. However, in the examples examined in this paper, we find that the practically computable number of Lanczos coefficients suffices for a strong guess.</description>

      <title>Quantum entanglement of fermionic gapless symmetry protected topological phases in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement can be an effective diagnostic tool for probing topological phases protected by global symmetries. Recently, the notion of nontrivial topology in critical systems has been proposed and is attracting growing attention. In this work, as a concrete example, we explore the quantum entanglement properties of fermionic gapless topological states by constructing exactly solvable models based on stacked multiple Kitaev chains. We first analytically establish the global phase diagram using entanglement entropy and reveal three topologically distinct gapped phases with different winding numbers, along with three topologically distinct transition lines separating them. Importantly, we unambiguously demonstrate that two transition lines exhibit fundamentally different topological properties despite sharing the same central charge. Specifically, they display nontrivial topological degeneracy in the entanglement spectrum under periodic boundary conditions, thereby generalizing the Li-Haldane bulk-boundary correspondence to a broader class of fermionic gapless topological states. Additionally, we identify a novel Lifshitz multicritical point at the intersection of the three transition lines, which also exhibits nontrivial topological degeneracy. This work provides a valuable reference for investigating gapless topological phases of matter from the perspective of quantum entanglement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present work, we examine how the recent quantum-computing algorithm known as the state-average orbital-optimized variational quantum eigensolver (SA-OO-VQE), viewed within the context of quantum chemistry as a type of multiconfiguration self-consistent field (MCSCF) electronic-structure approach, exhibits a propensity to produce an ab initio quasi-diabatic representation ``for free'' if considered as a least-transformed block-diagonalization procedure, as alluded to in our previous work [S. Yalouz et al., J. Chem. Theory Comput. 18 (2022) 776] and thoroughly assessed herein. To this end, we introduce intrinsic and residual descriptors of diabaticity and re-explore the definition and linear-algebra properties - as well as their consequences on the vibronic nonadiabatic couplings - of an optimal diabatic representation within this context, and how much one may deviate from it. Such considerations are illustrated numerically on the prototypical case of formaldimine, which presents a well-known conical intersection between its ground and first-excited singlet electronic states.</description>

      <title>Quantum implicit representation of vortex filaments in turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entangled vortex filaments are essential to turbulence, serving as coherent structures that govern nonlinear fluid dynamics and support the reconstruction of fluid fields to reveal statistical properties. This study introduces an quantum implicit representation of vortex filaments in turbulence, employing a level-set method that models the filaments as the intersection of the real and imaginary zero iso-surfaces of a complex scalar field. Describing the fluid field via the wave function offers distinct advantages in capturing complex structures, topological properties, and fluid dynamics, while opening new avenues for innovative solutions through quantum computing platforms. The representation is reformulated into an eigenvalue problem for Hermitian matrices, enabling the conversion of velocity fields into complex scalar fields that embed the vortex filaments. The resulting optimization is addressed using a variational quantum eigensolver, with Pauli operator truncation and deep learning techniques applied to improve efficiency and reduce noise. The proposed quantum framework achieves a near-linear time complexity and a exponential storage reduction while maintaining a balance of accuracy, robustness, and versatility, presenting a promising tool for turbulence analysis, vortex dynamics research, and machine learning dataset generation.</description>

      <title>Phonon thermal Hall as a lattice Aharonov-Bohm effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a growing list of insulators, experiments find a misalignment between the heat flux and the thermal gradient vectors induced by magnetic field. This phenomenon, known as the phonon thermal Hall effect, implies energy flow without entropy production along the orientation perpendicular to the temperature gradient. Experiments find that the thermal Hall angle is maximal at the temperature at which the longitudinal thermal conductivity peaks. At this temperature, $T_{max}$, Normal phonon-phonon collisions (which do not produce entropy) dominate Umklapp and boundary scattering events (which do). In the presence of a magnetic field, Born-Oppenheimer approximated molecular wave functions are known to acquire a geometric [Berry] phase. I will argue here that the survival of this phase in a crystal implies a complex amplitude for transverse phonons. This modifies three-phonon interference patterns, twisting the quasi-momentum of the outgoing phonon. The rough amplitude of the thermal Hall angle expected in this picture is set by the wavelength, $\lambda_{max}$, and the crest displacement amplitude, $u_m$, of transverse acoustic phonons at $T_{max}$. Combined with the interatomic distance, $a$ and the magnetic length, $\ell_B$, it yields: $\Theta_H \approx \lambda_{max}^2u_m^2a^{-2}\ell_B^{-2}$. This is surprisingly close to what has been experimentally found in black phosphorus, germanium and silicon.</description>

Abstract: Many architectures for quantum information processing rely on qubits dedicated for the readout of a larger quantum register. These ancilla readout qubits present a physical overhead not contributing to the computational resource. A common implementation in spin qubit architectures is the readout schemes based on Pauli exclusion of charges confined in a double quantum dot, with one dot serving as the ancilla qubit. Here, using a three-qubit spin register and a Pauli exclusion-based readout, we present z-basis measurements of the entire register constructed with tomography, eliminating the physical overhead. We validate our approach with simulations which provide insight into potential sources of errors in the reconstruction. We also demonstrate our reconstruction by performing quantum state tomography on a GHZ state of a spin-qubit based device.</description>

      <title>Quantum Imaging of Photonic Spin Texture in an OAM Beam with NV Centers in Diamond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonic spin texture (PST), the spatial distribution of the spin angular momentum (SAM) of light, is connected to unique properties of light, such as optical skyrmions and topological optical N-invariants. There has been recent progress on the generation and manipulation of PST using various methodologies. However, a challenge remains for the sub-wavelength characterization of PST. Here, we demonstrate nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond as nanoscale quantum sensors for imaging the PST of a beam with orbital angular momentum (OAM). Leveraging the coherent interaction between photon spin and NV center electron spin at cryogenic temperature (77 K), and using the Hahn-Echo magnetometry technique, we experimentally demonstrate the imprinting of the PST on the quantum phase of NV centers. Our work can lead to the development of a quantum imaging platform capable of characterization of the spin texture of light at sub-wavelength scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coulomb crystals, ordered structures of cold ions confined in ion traps, find applications in a variety of research fields. The number and temperature of the ions forming the Coulomb crystals are two key attributes of interest in many trapped-ion experiments. Here, we present a fast and accurate approach of determining these attributes from fluorescence images of the ions based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In this approach, we first generate a large number of images of Coulomb crystals with different ion numbers and temperatures using molecular-dynamics simulations and then train CNN models on these images to classify the desired attributes. The classification performance of several common pre-trained CNN models was compared in example tasks. We find that for crystals with ion numbers in the range 100-299 and secular temperatures of 5-15 mK, the best-performing model can discern number variations on the level of one ion with an accuracy of 93% and temperature variations by 1 mK with an accuracy of 92%. Since the trained model can be directly integrated into experiments, in-situ determination of these attributes can be realized in a non-invasive fashion, which has the potential to greatly facilitate the analysis and control of trapped ions in real time.</description>

      <title>Hybrid nonlocality via atom photon interactions with and without impurities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.11513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To obtain Bell statistics from hybrid systems composed of finite- and infinite-dimensional systems, we propose a hybrid measurement scheme, in which the continuous mode is measured using the generalized pseudospin operators, while the finite (two)-dimensional system is measured in the usual Pauli basis. Maximizing the Bell expression with these hybrid measurement settings leads to the violations of local realism in hybrid system which is referred to as hybrid nonlocality. We demonstrate the utility of our strategy in a realistic setting of cavity quantum electrodynamics, where an atom interacts resonantly with a single mode of an electromagnetic field under the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian. We dynamically compute the quenched averaged value of hybrid nonlocality in imperfect situations by incorporating disorder in the atom-cavity coupling strength. In the disordered case, we introduce two kinds of measurement scenarios to determine the Bell statistics -- in one situation, experimentalists can tune the optimal settings according to the interaction strength while such controlled power is absent in the other case. In contrast to the oscillatory behavior observed in the ordered case, the quenched averaged violation saturates to a finite value in some parameter regimes in the former case. We also examine the connection between Wigner negativity and hybrid nonlocality.</description>

      <title>Unextendibility, uncompletability, and many-copy indistinguishable ensembles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.17507v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the notions unextendible product basis and uncompletability for operators which remain positive under partial transpose. Then, we analyze their connections to the ensembles which are many-copy indistinguishable under local operations and classical communication (LOCC). We show that the orthogonal complement of any bipartite pure entangled state is spanned by product states which form a nonorthogonal unextendible product basis (nUPB) of maximum cardinality. This subspace has one to one correspondence with the maximum dimensional subspace where there is no orthonormal product basis. Due to these, the proof of indistinguishability of a class of ensembles under LOCC in many-copy scenario becomes simpler. Furthermore, it is now clear that there are several many-copy indistinguishable ensembles which are different construction-wise. But if we consider the technique of proving their indistinguishability property under LOCC, then, for many of them it can be done using the general notion of unextendible product basis. Explicit construction of the product states, forming nUPBs is shown. Thereafter, we introduce the notion of positive partial transpose uncompletability to unify different many-copy indistinguishable ensembles. We also report a class of multipartite many-copy indistinguishable ensembles for which local indistinguishability property increases with decreasing number of mixed states.</description>

      <title>Cavity magnon-polariton interface for strong spin-spin coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.13553v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong coupling between single qubits is crucial for quantum information science and quantum computation. However, it is still challenged, especially for single solid-state qubit. Here, we propose a hybrid quantum system, consisting of a coplanar waveguide (CPW) resonator weakly coupled to a single nitrogen-vacancy spin in diamond and a yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) nanosphere holding Kerr magnons, to realize strong long-distance spin-spin coupling. With a strong driving field on magnons, the Kerr effect can squeeze magnons, and {thus the coupling between the CPW resonator and the sequeezed magnons is exponentially enhanced}, which produces two cavity-magnon polaritons, i.e., the high-frequency polariton (HP) and low-frequency polariton (LP). When the enhanced cavity-magnon coupling {approaches} the critical value (i.e., the frequency of the LP becomes zero), the spin is fully decoupled from the HP, while the coupling between the spin and the LP is significantly improved. In the dispersive regime, a strong spin-spin coupling mediated by the LP is achieved with accessible parameters. Our proposal indicates that the critical cavity-magnon polarition is a potential interface to realize strong spin-spin coupling and manipulates remote solid spins.</description>

      <title>Pump-efficient Josephson parametric amplifiers with high saturation power</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Circuit QED based quantum information processing relies on low noise amplification for signal readout. In the realm of microwave superconducting circuits, this amplification is often achieved via Josephson parametric amplifiers (JPA). In the past, these amplifiers exhibited low power added efficiency (PAE), which is roughly the fraction of pump power that is converted to output signal power. This is increasingly relevant because recent attempts to build high saturation power amplifiers achieve this at the cost of very low PAE, which in turn puts a high heat load on the cryostat and limits the number of these devices that a dilution refrigerator can host. Here, we numerically investigate upper bounds on PAE. We focus on a class of parametric amplifiers that consists of a capacitor shunted by a nonlinear inductive block. We first set a benchmark for this class of amplifiers by considering nonlinear blocks described by an arbitrary polynomial current-phase relation. Next, we propose two circuit implementations of the nonlinear block. Finally, we investigate chaining polynomial amplifiers. We find that while amplifiers with higher gain have a lower PAE, regardless of the gain there is considerable room to improve as compared to state of the art devices. For example, for a phase-sensitive amplifier with a power gain of 20 dB, the PAE is ~0.1% for typical JPAs, 5.9% for our simpler circuit JPAs, 34% for our more complex circuit JPAs, 48% for our arbitrary polynomial amplifiers, and at least 95% for our chained amplifiers.</description>

      <title>Parameterized quantum comb and simpler circuits for reversing unknown qubit-unitary operations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum combs play a vital role in characterizing and transforming quantum processes, with wide-ranging applications in quantum information processing. However, obtaining the explicit quantum circuit for the desired quantum comb remains a challenging problem. We propose PQComb, a novel framework that employs parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) or quantum neural networks to harness the full potential of quantum combs for diverse quantum process transformation tasks. This method is well-suited for near-term quantum devices and can be applied to various tasks in quantum machine learning. As a notable application, we present two streamlined protocols for the time-reversal simulation of unknown qubit unitary evolutions, reducing the ancilla qubit overhead from six to three compared to the previous best-known method. We also extend PQComb to solve the problems of qutrit unitary transformation and channel discrimination. Furthermore, we demonstrate the hardware efficiency and robustness of our qubit unitary inversion protocol under realistic noise simulations of IBM-Q superconducting quantum hardware, yielding a significant improvement in average similarity over the previous protocol under practical regimes. PQComb's versatility and potential for broader applications in quantum machine learning pave the way for more efficient and practical solutions to complex quantum tasks.</description>

Abstract: Josephson junction parametric amplifiers have become essential tools for microwave quantum circuit readout with minimal added noise. Even after improving at an impressive rate in the last decade, they remain vulnerable to magnetic field, which limits their use in many applications such as spin qubits, Andreev and molecular magnet devices, dark matter searches, etc. Kinetic inductance materials, such as granular aluminum (grAl), offer an alternative source of non-linearity with innate magnetic field resilience. We present a non-degenerate amplifier made of two coupled grAl resonators resilient to in-plane magnetic field up to 1 T. It offers 20 dB of gain close to the quantum limit of added noise, with a gain-bandwidth product of 28 MHz and -110 dBm input saturation power.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic modulation of driving protocols in periodically driven quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a periodically driven system where the high-frequency driving protocol consists of a sequence of potentials switched on and off at different instants within a period. We explore the possibility of introducing an adiabatic modulation of the driving protocol by considering a slow evolution of the instants when the sequence of potentials is switched on/off. We examine how this influences the long-term dynamics of periodically driven quantum systems. By assuming that the slow and fast timescales in the problem can be decoupled, we derive the stroboscopic (effective) Hamiltonian for a four-step driving sequence up to the first order in perturbation theory. We then apply this approach to a spin-$1/2$ system, where the adiabatic modulation of the driving protocol is chosen to produce an evolving emergent magnetic field that interacts with the spin. We study the emergence of diabolical points and diabolical loci in the parameter space of the effective Hamiltonian. Further, we study the topological properties of the maps of the adiabatic paths in the parameter space to the eigenspace of the effective Hamiltonian. In effect, we obtain a technique for tuning the topological properties of the eigenstates by selecting different adiabatic evolutions of the driving protocol, characterized by distinct paths in parameter space. This technique can be applied to any periodic driving protocol to achieve desirable topological effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03339v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Grobe--Eberly doublet phenomenon occurs in photoelectron distributions when a field dresses the remaining ion. Its manifestation is due to entanglement between a free electron and a hybrid state of light and matter. Direct detection of such entanglement is however not possible by coincidence schemes due to the dressing mechanism having an inconspicuous phase correlation effect on the ion. Here, it is shown that odd envelopes fundamentally alter the entanglement, such that channel-resolved photoelectron distributions become identifiable in coincidence with the internal state of the field-free ion. This constitutes a first usage of the parity of time symmetry in strong-field interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06418v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although the similarity between non-stabilizer states -- also known as magic states -- in discrete-variable systems and non-Gaussian states in continuous-variable systems has widely been recognized, the precise connections between these two notions have still been unclear. We establish a fundamental link between these two quantum resources via the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) encoding. We show that the negativity of the continuous-variable Wigner function for an encoded GKP state coincides with a magic measure we introduce, which matches the negativity of the discrete Wigner function for odd dimensions. We also provide a continuous-variable representation of the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy -- a recent proposal for a magic measure for multi-qubit states. With this in hand, we give a classical simulation algorithm with runtime scaling with the resource contents, quantified by our magic measures. We also employ our results to prove that implementing a multi-qubit logical non-Clifford operation in the GKP code subspace requires a non-Gaussian operation even at the limit of perfect encoding, despite the fact that the ideal GKP states already come with a large amount of non-Gaussianity.</description>

      <title>Relational objectivity in presence of finite quantum resources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The no-go theorems of Bell and Kochen and Specker could be interpreted as implying that the notions of system and experimental context are fundamentally inseparable. In this interpretation, statements such as "spin is 'up' along direction $x$" are relational statements about the configurations of macroscopic devices which are mediated by the spin and not about any intrinsic properties of the spin. The operational meaning of these statements is provided by the practically infinite resources of macroscopic devices that serve to define the notion of a direction in three-dimensional space. This is the subject of "textbook quantum mechanics": The description of quantum systems in relation to an experimental context. Can one go beyond that? Relational quantum mechanics endeavors to provide a relational description between any quantum systems without the necessity of involving macroscopic devices. However, by applying "textbook quantum mechanics" in such situations, it implicitly assumes infinite resources, even for simple quantum systems such as spins, which have no capacity to define an experimental context. This leads to conceptual difficulties. As an alternative, we analyse Penrose's spin network proposal as a potential formalisation of quantum theory that goes beyond the textbook framework: A description in presence of finite resources, which is inherently relational and inseparable in the system-context entity.</description>

Abstract: We propose a natural, parameter-free, discrete-variable formulation of Feynman path integrals. We show that for discrete-variable quantum systems, Feynman path integrals take the form of walks on the graph whose weighted adjacency matrix is the Hamiltonian. By working out expressions for the partition function and transition amplitudes of discretized versions of continuous-variable quantum systems, and then taking the continuum limit, we explicitly recover Feynman's continuous-variable path integrals. We also discuss the implications of our result.</description>

      <title>Discrimination of bosonic dephasing quantum channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14935v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the possibility of discriminating between two bosonic dephasing quantum channels. We show that unambiguous discrimination is not realizable. We then consider discrimination with nonzero error probability and minimize this latter in the absence of input constraints. In the presence of an input energy constraint, we derive an upper bound on the error probability. Finally, we extend these results from single-shot to multi-shot discrimination, envisaging the asymptotic behavior.</description>

      <title>Precision in estimating independent local fields: attainable bound and indispensability of genuine multiparty entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20142v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimation of local quantum fields is a crucial aspect of quantum metrology applications, and often also forms the test-bed to analyze the utility of quantum resources, like entanglement. However, so far, this has been analyzed using the same local field for all the probes, and so, although the encoding process utilizes a local Hamiltonian, there is an inherent "nonlocality" in the encoding process in the form of a common local field applied on all the probes. We show that estimation of even independent multiple field strengths of a local Hamiltonian, i.e., one formed by a sum of single-party terms, necessitates the utility of genuine multipartite entangled state as the input probe. The feature depends on the choice of the weight matrix considered, which is full-rank and contains non-vanishing off-diagonal terms. We obtain this result by providing a lower bound on the precision of multiparameter estimation, optimized over input probes, for an arbitrary positive semi-definite weight matrix. We show that there exists a weight matrix for which this bound is always attainable by the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state, chosen in a certain basis. Furthermore, we find the parametric form of the most general optimal state for three parties. We also show that no pure product state can achieve the lower bound. Finally, for an arbitrary weight matrix and an arbitrary multiparty local encoding Hamiltonian, we prove that using a probe that is in any mixed state provides a precision lower than that obtainable using pure states. To emphasize the importance of the weight matrix considered, we also prove that the choice of identity operator as the same - thereby ignoring the "off-diagonal" covariances in the precision matrix - does not require the use of genuine multiparty entanglement in input probes for attaining the best precision, and the optimal probe can be a pure product.</description>

      <title>Dirac Equation with Space Contributions Embedded in a Quantum-Corrected Gravitational Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10598v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Dirac equation is considered with the recently proposed generalized gravitational interaction (Kepler or Coulomb), which includes post-Newtonian (relativistic) and quantum corrections to the classical potential. The general idea in choosing the metric is that the spacetime contributions are contained in an external potential or in an electromagnetic potential which can be considered as a good basis for future studies of quantum physics in space. The forms considered for the scalar potential and the so-called vector (magnetic) potential, can be viewed as the multipole expansion of these terms and therefore the approach includes a simultaneous study of multipole expansions to both fields. We also discuss several known generalizations of the Coulomb potential within this formulation in terms of certain Heun functions. The impossibility of solving our equation for the quantum-corrected Coulomb terms using known exact or quasi-exact nonperturbative analytical techniques is discussed, and finally the Bethe-ansatz approach is proposed to overcome this challenging problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the time evolution of the Bloch vector of the thermal multiphoton Jaynes-Cummings model (JCM). First, we plot the trajectory of the Bloch vector for the multiphoton JCM as a discrete-time sequence with a constant time interval. We show that this plot is invariant under a scale transformation of a finite but non-zero time interval. Second, we numerically evaluate the times at which the absolute value of the $z$-component of the Bloch vector is nearly equal to zero. We demonstrate that some time values can be derived from the denominators of the fractions of the Diophantine approximations for irrational numbers. The reason underlying these findings is that the components of the Bloch vector for the thermal multiphoton JCM cannot be described with a Fourier series.</description>

      <title>Detecting quasi-degenerate ground states in topological models via variational quantum eigensolver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15179v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the exact ground states of the Su--Schrieffer--Heeger open chain and of the Kitaev open chain, using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm. These models host symmetry-protected topological phases, characterized by edge modes with vanishing single-particle energy in the thermodynamic limit. The same fact prevents the standard VQE algorithm from converging to the correct ground state for finite chains, since it is quasi-degenerate in energy with other many-body states. Notably, this quasi-degeneracy cannot be removed by small perturbations, as in typical spin systems. We address this issue by imposing appropriate constraints on the VQE evolution and constructing appropriate variational circuits, to restrict the probed portion of the Hilbert space along the same evolution. These constraints stem from both general properties of the topological phases and of the studied Hamiltonians. In this way, the improved VQE algorithm achieves an accurate convergence to the exact ground states in each phase. The present approach promises large applicability, also to realistic systems with different topologies and/or not easily removable degeneracies, thanks to the very high fidelity achievable also on systems with a relatively high number of qubits.</description>

      <title>Smallest quantum codes for amplitude damping noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe the smallest quantum error correcting (QEC) code to correct for amplitude-damping (AD) noise, namely, a 3-qubit code that corrects all the single-qubit damping errors. We generalize this construction to a family of codes that correct AD noise up to any fixed order of the damping strength. We underpin the fundamental connection between the structure of our codes and the noise structure, via a relaxed form of the Knill-Laflamme conditions, that are different from existing formulations of approximate QEC conditions. Although the recovery procedure for this code is non-deterministic, our codes are optimal with respect to overheads and outperform existing codes to tackle AD noise in terms of entanglement fidelity. This alternate formulation of approximate QEC further leads us to a new classes of quantum codes tailored to AD noise and also gives rise to a noise-adapted quantum Hamming bound for AD noise.</description>

      <title>Zero-energy Quantum Many-Body Scar under Emergent Chiral Symmetry and Pseudo Hilbert Space Fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22778v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hilbert space fragmentation (HSF) is a mechanism for generating quantum many-body scar (QMBS), which provides a route to weakly break ergodicity. The zero-energy QMBSs widely exist across various systems due to the intertwining of chiral symmetry and spatial inversion symmetry. In this work, we study the phenomenology of the zero-energy QMBS under the interplay between the chiral symmetry and pseudo HSF, where the Hilbert space is approximately fragmented into different blocks. We consider a model of tilted chain of interacting spinless fermions with periodically varying tunneling strength. At small tunneling strength and under resonance condition, the system is described by an effective model with chiral symmetry and pseudo HSF. We find that the interplay between the two gives rise to a highly localized zero-energy QMBS when the particle number is even. We identify a simple product state to signalize the zero-energy QMBS, which gives rise to unusual scarred dynamics. The fidelity oscillates around a fixed value without decaying instead of showing the usual collapse and revival in common scarred systems. We show that the signature of the zero-energy QMBS can also be captured by the original Hamiltonian. Our results uncover a new scar phenomenon and provide an example that does not need the intertwining of chiral and spatial symmetries to support zero-energy QMBS.</description>

Abstract: We exhibit a total search problem with classically verifiable solutions whose communication complexity in the quantum SMP model is exponentially smaller than in the classical two-way randomized model. Our problem is a bipartite version of a query complexity problem recently introduced by Yamakawa and Zhandry (JACM 2024). We prove the classical lower bound using the structure-vs-randomness paradigm for analyzing communication protocols.</description>

      <title>Optimal Geometry of Oscillators in Gravity-Induced Entanglement Experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12631v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interface between quantum mechanics and gravity remains an unresolved issue. Recent advances in precision measurement suggest that detecting gravity-induced entanglement in oscillator systems could provide key evidence for the quantum nature of gravity. However, thermal decoherence imposes strict constraints on system parameters. For entanglement to occur, mechanical frequency $\omega_m$, dissipation rate $\gamma_m$, environmental temperature $T$, oscillator density $\rho$, and the form factor $\Lambda$-determined by the geometry and arrangement of oscillators-must satisfy a specific constraint. This constraint, intrinsic to the noise model, is considered universal and cannot be improved by quantum control. Given the difficulty in further optimizing $\omega_m$, $\gamma_m$, $\rho$, and $T$, optimizing $\Lambda$ can relax the constraints on these parameters. In this work, we prove that the form factor has a supremum of $2\pi$, revealing a fundamental limit of the oscillator system. We propose designs that approach this supremum, nearly an order of magnitude higher than typical spherical oscillators. This optimization could ease experimental constraints and bring quantum gravity validation based on gravity-induced entanglement closer to realization.</description>

Abstract: Developing quantum key distribution (QKD) systems using monolithic photonic integrated circuits (PICs) can accelerate their adoption by a wide range of markets, thanks to the potential reduction in size, complexity of the overall system, power consumption, and production cost. In this work, we design, fabricate and characterize an InP-based PIC transmitter for continuous-variable (CV) QKD applications. In a proof-of-principle experiment implementing a pulsed Gaussian-modulated coherent state (GMCS) CV-QKD protocol over an optical fiber channel of 11 km, the system showed a performance compatible with a secret key rate of 78 kbps in the asymptotic regime. These results show the potential of InP technologies to integrate CV-QKD systems onto a monolithic platform.</description>

      <title>Advanced Attacks On Qubit-Ensemble Based Quantum Coins</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present and characterize an ensemble based quantum token protocol that allows for implementing non-clonable tokens containing ensembles of identically prepared qubits. Multiple differently initialized tokens with ensembles are realizing a quantum coin that can be issued by a bank. A sophisticated attempt to copy the token can assume that measurements on sub-ensembles can be carried through and that even individual qubits can be measured. Even though such an advanced attack might be perceived as technically unfeasible, we proof the security of the ensemble based protocol under these conditions and provide detailed expressions on how the quantum coin must be designed to fulfill desired security requirements. We have used realistic parameters of the IBM Quantum Platforms and verified our numerical simulations with experimental data for advanced attacks using brute force optimization, direct inversion tomography, maximum likelihood and Bayesian method. Full message passing interface parallelized source code is provided to allow for adjusting to other hardware platforms. Interestingly, our results deviate from predictions provided by quantum state tomography. This can be attributed to the fact that an attacker's goal is not to get an optimal estimate of an unknown quantum state, but to mislead the bank into accepting the counterfeit quantum coin. Finnally, we prove that an arbitrary level of security can be obtained by adding an increasing amount of quantum tokens into a quantum coin.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the impact of non-Markovian classical noise on single-qubit randomized benchmarking experiments, in a manner that explicitly models the realization of each gate via realistic finite-duration pulses. Our new framework exploits the random nature of each gate sequence to derive expressions for the full survival probability decay curve which are non-perturbative in the noise strength. In the presence of non-Markovian noise, our approach shows that the decay curve can exhibit a strong dependence on the implementation method, with regimes of both exponential and power law decays. We discuss how these effects can complicate the interpretation of a randomized-benchmarking experiment, but also how to leverage them to probe non-Markovianty.</description>

Abstract: Spontaneous wavefunction collapse models offer a solution to the quantum measurement problem, by modifying the Schr\"odinger equation with nonlinear and stochastic terms. The Continuous Spontaneous Localisation (CSL) model is the most studied among these models, with phenomenological parameters that are constrained by experiments. Here, we exploit the recent analysis of LISA Pathfinder's angular motion data to derive a tighter constraint than previously achieved with translational motion. Moreover, we identify the general conditions for preferring rotational measurement over translational ones for constraining the CSL model.</description>

Abstract: We present a recurrent neural network-based approach for ground state preparation utilizing mid-circuit measurement and feedback. Unlike previous methods that use machine learning solely as an optimizer, our approach dynamically adjusts quantum circuits based on real-time measurement outcomes and learns distinct preparation protocols for different Hamiltonians. Notably, our machine learning algorithm consistently identifies a state preparation strategy wherein all initial states are first steered toward an intermediate state before transitioning to the target ground state. We demonstrate that performance systematically improves as a larger fraction of ancilla qubits are utilized for measurement and feedback, highlighting the efficacy of mid-circuit measurements in state preparation tasks.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a new method, rooted in estimation theory, to detect the individual atoms in site-resolved images of microtrap arrays, such as optical lattices or optical tweezers arrays. Using simulated images, we demonstrate a ten-fold reduction of the detection error rate compared to the popular method based on Wiener deconvolution, under a wide range of experimental conditions. The runtime is fully compatible with real-time applications, even for a very large arrays. Finally, we propose a rigorous definition for the signal-to-noise ratio of an image, and show that it can be used as a predictor for the detection error rate, which opens new prospect for the design of future experiments.</description>

Abstract: We present a classification algorithm for quantum states, inspired by decision-tree methods. To adapt the decision-tree framework to the probabilistic nature of quantum measurements, we utilize conditional probabilities to compute information gain, thereby optimizing the measurement scheme. For each measurement shot on an unknown quantum state, the algorithm selects the observable with the highest expected information gain, continuing until convergence. We demonstrate using the simulations that this algorithm effectively identifies quantum states sampled from the Haar random distribution. However, despite not relying on circuit-based quantum neural networks, the algorithm still encounters challenges akin to the barren plateau problem. In the leading order, we show that the information gain is proportional to the variance of the observable's expectation values over candidate states. As the system size increases, this variance, and consequently the information gain, are exponentially suppressed, which poses significant challenges for classifying general Haar-random quantum states. Finally, we apply the quantum decision tree to classify the ground states of various Hamiltonians using physically-motivated observables. On both simulators and quantum computers, the quantum decision tree yields better performances when compared to methods that are not information-optimized. This indicates that the measurement of physically-motivated observables can significantly improve the classification performance, guiding towards the future direction of this approach.</description>

      <title>NRQNN: The Role of Observable Selection in Noise-Resilient Quantum Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12637v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the complexities associated with training Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) under noisy conditions, a critical consideration for Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. We first demonstrate that Barren Plateaus (BPs), characterized by exponetially vanishing gradients, emerge more readily in noisy quantum environments than in ideal conditions. We then propose that careful selection of qubit measurement observable can make QNNs resilient against noise. To this end, we explore the effectiveness of various qubit measurement observables, including PauliX, PauliY, PauliZ, and a custom designed Hermitian observable, against three types of quantum noise: Phase Damping, Phase Flip, and Amplitude Damping. Our findings reveal that QNNs employing Pauli observables are prone to an earlier emergence of BPs, notably in noisy environments, even with a smaller qubit count of four qubits. Conversely, the custom designed Hermitian measurement observable exhibits significant resilience against all types of quantum noise, facilitating consistent trainability for QNNs up to 10 qubits. This study highlights the crucial role of observable selection and quantum noise consideration in enhancing QNN training, offering a strategic approach to improve QNN performance in NISQ era.</description>

      <title>On the Addressability Problem on CSS Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13889v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent discoveries in asymptotically good quantum codes have intensified research on their application in quantum computation and fault-tolerant operations. This study focuses on the addressability problem within CSS codes: what circuits might implement logical gates on strict subsets of logical qubits? With some notion of fault-tolerance, we show some impossibility results: for CSS codes with non-zero rate, one cannot address a logical H, HP, PH, nor CNOT to any non-empty strict subset of logical qubits using a circuit made only from 1-local Clifford gates.
  Furthermore, we show that one cannot permute the logical qubits in a code purely by permuting the physical qubits, if the rate of the code is (asymptotically) greater than 1/3 and the distance is at least 3. We can show a similar no-go result for CNOTs and CZs between two such high-rate codes, albeit with a less reasonable restriction to circuits that we call ``global'' (though recent addressable CCZ gates use global circuits).
  This work pioneers the study of distance-preserving addressability in quantum codes, mainly by considering automorphisms of the code. This perspective offers new insights and potential directions for future research. We argue that studying this trade off between addressability and efficiency of the codes is essential to understand better how to do efficient quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Bohmian Mechanics fails to compute multi-time correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The violation of Bell type inequalities in quantum systems manifests that quantum states cannot be described by classical probability distributions. Yet, Bohmian mechanics is a realistic, non-local theory of classical particle trajectories that is claimed to be indistinguishable by observations from more traditional approaches to quantum mechanics. We set up a spatial version of the GHZ system with qubits realised as positional observables that demonstrates that the Bohmian theory fails to match predictions of textbook quantum mechanics (and most likely experients) unless enlarged by a microscopic theory of collapse of the wave function after observation. For this discrepancy to occur it is essential that positions at different times do not commute.</description>

      <title>Existence and Characterisation of Coprime Bivariate Bicycle Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Encoding quantum information in a quantum error correction (QEC) code offers protection against decoherence and enhances the fidelity of qubits and gate operations. One of the holy grails of QEC is to construct codes with asymptotically good parameters, i.e. a non-vanishing rate and relative minimum distance. Such codes provide compact quantum memory with low overhead and enhanced error correcting capabilities, compared to state-of-the-art topological error correction codes such as the surface or colour codes. Finding good codes that can be implemented on near-term quantum hardware is among the key goals in the field of quantum computing. Recently, bivariate bicycle (BB) codes have emerged as a promising candidate for such compact memory, though the exact tradeoff of the code parameters remains unknown. In this Article, we explore these parameters by focusing on the subclass of coprime BB codes. In many cases, we can efficiently predict code parameters by leveraging the ring structure of these codes. Finally, we demonstrate asymptotic badness. Though this excludes this subclass of codes from the search towards practical good low-density parity check (LDPC) codes, it does not affect the utility of the moderately long codes that are known, which can already be used to experimentally demonstrate better QEC beyond the surface code.</description>

      <title>Exploring Frustration Effects of Strongly Interacting Bosons via the Hall Response</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Hall response of hardcore bosonic atoms on a triangular ladder in a magnetic field. To access the dynamical properties of this many-body quantum system, we employ matrix product states numerical methods. We show that the behavior of the Hall polarization, both in its saturation value and in the short-time dynamics, correlates with the features of the underlying phase diagram, which stem from the interplay of interactions and geometric frustration. This paves the way to employ the Hall response as a sensitive probe of many-body chiral quantum phases in strongly correlated materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12981v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bosonic Bogoliubov de Gennes (BBdG) Hamiltonians describe the excitations of weakly interacting Bose condensates as well as photonic systems under parametric driving. Their topological features have been studied mainly by utilizing a generalized symplectic version of the Berry curvature and related Chern numbers. However, a full characterization of geometrical features in BBdG systems is still lacking. Here, we propose a symplectic quantum geometric tensor (SQGT), whose imaginary part leads to the previously studied symplectic Berry curvature, while the real part gives rise to a symplectic quantum metric, providing a natural distance measure in the space of bosonic Bogoliubov modes. The SQGT is directly related to observable properties of BBdG systems. We show how to measure all components of the SQGT by extracting excitation rates in response to periodic modulations of the systems' parameters. Moreover, we connect the symplectic Berry curvature to a generalized symplectic anomalous velocity term for Bogoliubov-Bloch wave packets. We test our results for a bosonic Bogoliubov-Haldane model.</description>

      <title>Simulating Chemistry with Fermionic Optical Superlattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that quantum number preserving Ans\"{a}tze for variational optimization in quantum chemistry find an elegant mapping to ultracold fermions in optical superlattices. Using native Hubbard dynamics, trial ground states of molecular Hamiltonians can be prepared and their molecular energies measured in the lattice. The scheme requires local control over interactions and chemical potentials and global control over tunneling dynamics, but foregoes the need for optical tweezers, shuttling operations, or long-range interactions. We describe a complete compilation pipeline from the molecular Hamiltonian to the sequence of lattice operations, thus providing a concrete link between quantum simulation and chemistry. Our work enables the application of recent quantum algorithmic techniques, such as Double Factorization and quantum Tailored Coupled Cluster, to present-day fermionic optical lattice systems with significant improvements in the required number of experimental repetitions. We provide detailed quantum resource estimates for small non-trivial hardware experiments.</description>

      <title>Self-congruent point in critical matrix product states: An effective field theory for finite-entanglement scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03954v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We set up an effective field theory formulation for the renormalization flow of matrix product states (MPS) with finite bond dimension, focusing on systems exhibiting finite-entanglement scaling close to a conformally invariant critical fixed point. We show that the finite MPS bond dimension $\chi$ is equivalent to introducing a perturbation by a relevant operator to the fixed-point Hamiltonian. The fingerprint of this mechanism is encoded in the $\chi$-independent universal transfer matrix's gap ratios, which are distinct from those predicted by the unperturbed Conformal Field Theory. This phenomenon defines a renormalization group self-congruent point, where the relevant coupling constant ceases to flow due to a balance of two effects; When increasing $\chi$, the infrared scale, set by the correlation length $\xi(\chi)$, increases, while the strength of the perturbation at the lattice scale decreases. The presence of a self-congruent point does not alter the validity of the finite-entanglement scaling hypothesis, since the self-congruent point is located at a finite distance from the critical fixed point, well inside the scaling regime of the CFT. We corroborate this framework with numerical evidences from the exact solution of the Ising model and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations of an effective lattice model.</description>

      <title>Effects of the Hubbard interaction on the quantum metric</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum geometry provides important information about the structure and topology of quantum states in various forms of quantum matter. The information contained therein has profound effects on observable quantities such as superconducting weight, Drude weight, and optical responses. Motivated by the recent advances in flat-band interacting systems, we investigate the role of interaction effects on the quantum metric. By using the fermionic Creutz ladder as a representative system, we show that the repulsive Hubbard interaction monotonically suppresses the quantum metric. While the eigenstates and their overlap quantifying the quantum metric can be obtained exactly in the presence of interactions through exact diagonalization, this method is limited to small system sizes. Alternatively, two theoretical proposals, the generalized quantum metric and the dressed quantum metric, suggest using renormalized Green's functions to define the interacting quantum metric. By comparing these analytical approaches with results from exact diagonalization, we show that the dressed quantum metric provides a better fit to the exact diagonalization results. Our conclusion holds for both flat-band and dispersive systems.</description>

      <title>Engineering high Pockels coefficients in thin-film strontium titanate for cryogenic quantum electro-optic applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14349v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Materials which exhibit the Pockels effect are notable for their strong electro-optic interaction and rapid response times and are therefore used extensively in classical electro-optic components for data and telecommunication applications. Yet many materials optimized for room-temperature operation see their Pockels coefficients at cryogenic temperatures significantly reduced - a major hurdle for emerging quantum technologies which have even more rigorous demands than their classical counterpart. A noted example is $\mathrm{BaTiO_3}$, which features the strongest effective Pockels coefficient at room temperature, only to see it reduced to a third (i.e. $\mathrm{r_{eff}} \approx$ 170 pm/V) at a few Kelvin. Here, we show that this behaviour is not inherent and can even be reversed: Strontium titanate ($\mathrm{SrTiO_3}$), a material normally not featuring a Pockels coefficient, can be engineered to exhibit an $\mathrm{r_{eff}}$ of 345 pm/V at cryogenic temperatures - a record value in any thin-film electro-optic material. By adjusting the stoichiometry, we can increase the Curie temperature and realise a ferroelectric phase that yields a high Pockels coefficient, yet with limited optical losses - on the order of decibels per centimetre. Our findings position $\mathrm{SrTiO_3}$ as one of the most promising materials for cryogenic quantum photonics applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the effect of Zeeman and hyperfine optical pumping and transverse laser cooling of a dysprosium (Dy) atomic beam on the $4f^{10}6s^2(J = 8) \rightarrow 4f^{10}6s6p(J = 9)$ transition at 421.291 nm. For $^{163}$Dy, an electro-optic modulator is used to generate five frequency sidebands required to pump the atoms to the $F = 10.5$ ground state hyperfine level and the light polarization is chosen to pump the atoms to the $m_F = 10.5$ Zeeman sublevel. The atoms are simultaneously laser-cooled using a standing wave orthogonal to the atomic beam. The resulting polarized and cooled atomic beam will be used in fundamental physics experiments taking advantage of the accidental degeneracy of excited states in Dy including the ongoing measurement of parity violation in this system.</description>
