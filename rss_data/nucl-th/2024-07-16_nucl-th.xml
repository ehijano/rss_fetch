      <title>Ab initio study of Z(N) = 6 magicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of magic numbers of protons and neutrons in nuclei is essential for understanding nuclear structure and fundamental nuclear forces. Over decades, researchers have conducted theoretical and experimental studies on the new magic number Z(N) = 6, focusing on observables such as radii, binding energy, electromagnetic transition, and nucleon separation energies. We perform the ab initio no-core shell model calculations for the occupation numbers of the lowest single particle states in the ground states of Z(N) = 6 and Z(N) = 8 isotopes (isotones). Our calculations do not support Z(N) = 6 as a magic number over a span of atomic numbers. However, 14C and 14O exhibit the characteristics of double-magic nuclei.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear-structure calculations for the description of low-energy neutral-current neutrino scattering off the stable $^{203,205}$Tl isotopes are performed in the context of nuclear shell model using the model space jj56pn. Cross-section and event-rates calculations focusing on inelastic solar-neutrino scattering off $^{203,205}$Tl are performed. The individual contributions of the various nuclear responses are presented and discussed, and the results are also illustrated in terms of the nuclear recoil energy. Analytical expressions entering the cross sections are given in order to achieve a direct connection with experimental observables.</description>

      <title>Threshold photo-production of $J/\Psi$ off light nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze threshold photoproduction of heavy mesons off a deuteron and Helium-4, using the QCD factorization method. Assuming large skewness, the production amplitude is dominated by the leading twist-2 gluonic energy-momentum tensor (EMT). We use our recent results for the gluonic gravitational form factors of light nuclei in the impulse approximation, to estimate the differential cross sections for $J/\Psi$ production off a deuteron and Helium-4 at current electron facilities.</description>

      <title>Charged hadron spectra and anisotropic flow from the AMPT model with shear viscous transport dynamics simulations at RHIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We utilized the AMPT model to simulate the shear viscous transport dynamics of parton matter in Au+Au collisions at a constant specific shear viscosity and varying phase transition temperatures at 200 GeV. The resulting charged hadron spectra and anisotropic flow profiles correspond closely with experimental data. The transverse momentum spectra and longitudinal decorrelations are essentially unaffected by the phase transition temperature. An increase in the phase transition temperature leads to a rise in particle yields at midrapidity, accompanied by a decrease in both elliptic and triangular flows over a range of transverse momenta and pseudorapidities.</description>

      <title>Nuclear forces and nuclear excited states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the role of the central, spin-force and tensor forces of two-nucleon interaction in building the first 2$^+$ and 4$^+$ states of 20 sd-shell nuclei is studied. Calculations are performed within the framework of the nuclear shell model. It is shown that the central force predominantly contributes to the excitation energy. While the spin-orbit and tensor forces contribute relatively less, their roles are noted crucial in a few cases, such as in $^{22}$O. Further, it is demonstrated that the Hamiltonian projection approach should be preferred for rightly assessing the contributions of each force to the excitation energy.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper discusses the charge-exchange strength functions $S(E)$ of the isotopes $^{128,130}$Te. The experimental data of the $S(E)$ strength functions obtained from $(^{3}\mathrm{He}, t)$ reactions, as well as the $S(E)$ strength functions calculated in the microscopic theory of finite fermi-systems, are analyzed. The resonance structure of the strength function $S(E)$ is examined, and the Gamow-Teller and Pygmy resonances are identified. The resonance structure of the strength function $S(E)$ is vital for the calculation and analysis of the process of neutrino capture by atomic nuclei.</description>

      <title>Nuclear contacts of unstable nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear contact is a key quantity to describe the nucleon-nucleon short-range correlations (SRCs). While they have been determined by electron scattering experiments for selected stable nuclei, nuclear contacts are largely unknown for unstable nuclei. In this work, we study nuclear contacts for a number of nuclei in the vicinity of the doubly magic $^{132}$Sn from the theoretical perspective, with special emphasis on unstable nuclei. We find that the proton-proton contact generally gets suppressed by the excess neutrons for the Sn isotopes, resembling the suppression of $\alpha$-cluster formation reported recently for the same isotopic chain [J. Tanaka $\textit{et al}.$, Science $\textbf{371}$, 260 (2021)]. This indicates a hidden universal aspect of SRCs and $\alpha$ clustering, two different kinds of nuclear correlations. Meanwhile, a linear relation is found between the proton-proton contact and the proton number for the $N=82$ isotones. Our results can be helpful for future experimental studies of SRCs in unstable nuclei at advanced facilities worldwide.</description>

      <title>A Semi-Empirical Formula for Two-Neutrino Double-Beta Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a semi-empirical formula for calculating the nuclear matrix elements for two-neutrino double-beta decay. The proposed model (PM) dependence on the proton and neutron numbers, the pairing, isospin, and deformation properties of the initial and final nuclei is inspired by the insights offered by nuclear many-body methods. Compared with the previous phenomenological and nuclear models, the PM yields the best agreement with the experimental data. Its stability and predictive power are cross-validated, and predictions for nuclear systems of experimental interest are provided.</description>

      <title>Polarized $\phi$ meson rates with viscous corrections at RHIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the emission of $\phi$ mesons with longitudinal and transverse polarization in ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions. In the hadronic phase and in leading order in the kaon diluteness, $\phi$ emission is isotropic and driven by the flavor singlet and octet vector spectral functions. At next to leading order, the emissivities receive a non-isotropic correction from the flavor octet spectral function, and the non-equilibrium contributions originating from the shear and bulk viscosities. Implications for the $\phi$ meson alignment in heavy-ion collisions are discussed.</description>

      <title>Probing QGP droplets with charmonium in high-multiplicity proton-proton collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the hot medium effects in high-multiplicity proton-proton (pp) collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=13$ TeV via the charmonium probes. The hot medium is described with the hydrodynamic model, while charmonium evolutions in the medium are studied with a time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. The hot medium dissociation on charmonium is considered with the temperature-dependent complex potential parametrized with the results from lattice QCD calculations. The ratio $\sigma_{\psi(2S)}/\sigma_{J/\psi}$ of $J/\psi$ and $\psi(2S)$ production cross sections are calculated and compared with the LHCb experimental data in pp collisions. Our calculations explain the charmonium relative suppression in different transverse momentum and multiplicity bins. The suppression of this ratio is mainly affected by the effects of the deconfined medium. It is less affected by the initial effects before the generation of the heavy quark pair. We suggest this to be a clear signal of the small QGP droplets generated in high multiplicity pp collisions.</description>

      <title>Comparing matching prescriptions between pre-equilibrium and hydrodynamic models in high-energy nuclear collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-of-the-art simulations of high-energy nuclear collisions rely on hybrid setups, involving in particular a pre-equilibrium stage to let the system evolve from a far-from-equilibrium initial condition towards a near-equilibrated state after which fluid dynamics can be applied meaningfully. A known issue is the mismatch between the equation of state in the fluid-dynamical evolution and the effective one in the previous stage, which leads to discontinuities at the interface between the two models. Here we introduce a new matching prescription at this interface, based on the entropy, and we compare it with the standard one relying on local energy conservation. We study the behavior of various quantities at the switching time between the models and investigate a number of final-state hadronic observables. For the latter, we show that they are not modified significantly by the choice of matching prescription, provided an appropriate normalization is chosen for the initial state. In turn, our approach reduces sizeably the ratio of bulk over thermodynamic pressure at the beginning of the fluid-dynamical stage.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Eigenvalue Computation for Nuclear Structure Calculations via Perturbative Corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new method for computing the lowest few eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors of a nuclear many-body Hamiltonian represented in a truncated configuration interaction subspace, i.e., the no-core shell model (NCSM). The method uses the hierarchical structure of the NCSM Hamiltonian to partition the Hamiltonian as the sum of two matrices. The first matrix corresponds to the Hamiltonian represented in a small configuration space, whereas the second is viewed as the perturbation to the first matrix. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the first matrix can be computed efficiently. Perturbative corrections to the eigenvectors of the first matrix can be obtained from the solutions of a sequence of linear systems of equations defined in the small configuration space. These correction vectors can be combined with the approximate eigenvectors of the first matrix to construct a subspace from which more accurate approximations of the desired eigenpairs can be obtained. We call this method a Subspace Projection with Perturbative Corrections (SPPC) method. We show by numerical examples that the SPPC method can be more efficient than conventional iterative methods for solving large-scale eigenvalue problems such as the Lanczos, block Lanczos and the locally optimal block preconditioned conjugate gradient (LOBPCG) method. The method can also be combined with other methods to avoid convergence stagnation.</description>

      <title>Soft-gluon exchange matters: isotropic screening in QCD kinetic theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: QCD kinetic theory simulations are a prominent tool for studying the nonequilibrium initial stages in heavy-ion collisions. Despite their success, all implementations rely on approximations of the hard thermal loop (HTL) screened matrix elements in the collision terms. In this paper, we present our results for different isotropic screening prescriptions in the elastic collision term for gluons. In particular, we go beyond the simple Debye-like screening form that is used in all current implementations and apply the isotropic HTL matrix element instead. For isotropic systems, the evolution is nearly unchanged, but when studying the equilibration process in a Bjorken expanding plasma, we find qualitative and quantitative differences in a range of moments of the distribution function, such as a decrease in the maximum pressure anisotropy by up to 50%. In contrast, we find no significant qualitative impact on the jet quenching parameter or on the late-time hydrodynamization dynamics of anisotropic plasmas but observe systematically smaller values of $\eta/s$ by about 10% that coincide with perturbative calculations at small couplings. Our study reveals that the choice of the screening prescription can lead to large corrections at early times, but is less important close to equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Coupling and Recoupling Coefficients for Wigner's U(4) Supermultiplet Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel procedure for evaluating Wigner coupling coefficients and Racah recoupling coefficients for U(4) in two group-subgroup chains is presented. The canonical U(4)-&gt;U(3)-&gt;U(2)-&gt;U(1) coupling and recoupling coefficients are applicable to any system that possesses U(4) symmetry, while the physical U(4)-&gt;SU_S(2)xSU_T(2) coupling coefficients are more specific to nuclear structure studies that utilize Wigner's Supermultiplet Symmetry concept. The procedure that is proposed sidesteps the use of binomial coefficients and alternating sum series, and consequently enables fast and accurate computation of any and all U(4)-underpinned features. The inner multiplicity of a (S,T) pair within a single U(4) irreducible representation is obtained from the dimension of the null space of the SU(2) raising generators; while the resolution for the outer multiplicity follows from the work of Alex et al. on U(N). It is anticipated that a C++ library will ultimately be available for determining generic coupling and recoupling coefficients associated with both the \textit{canonical} and the \textit{physical} group-subgroup chains of U(4).</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Extraction of the Weak Radius and the Weak Mixing Angle from Parity-Violating Electron Scattering on $^{12}\mathrm{C}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of nuclear structure uncertainties on a measurement of the weak charge of $^{12}\mathrm{C}$ at the future MESA facility in Mainz. Information from a large variety of nuclear models, accurately calibrated to the ground-state properties of selected nuclei, suggest that a $0.3$% precision measurement of the parity-violating asymmetry at forward angles will not be compromised by nuclear structure effects, thereby allowing a world-leading determination of the weak charge of $^{12}\mathrm{C}$. Further, we show that a combination of measurements of the parity-violating asymmetry at forward and backward angles for the same electron beam energy can be used to extract information on the nuclear weak charge distribution. We conclude that a $0.34$% precision on the weak radius of $^{12}\mathrm{C}$ may be achieved by performing a $3$% precision measurement of the parity-violating asymmetry at backward angles.</description>

      <title>Influence of magnetic field-induced anisotropic gluon pressure during pre-equilibrium in heavy-ion collisions: A faster road towards isotropization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic fields of a large intensity can be generated in peripheral high-energy heavy-ion collisions. Although their intensity drops fast and, moreover, it is not clear whether these fields last long enough to induce a magnetization during the quark-gluon plasma phase, most of the models and simulations predict a significant intensity that lasts up to proper times of order 1 fm after the beginning of the reaction, which is a typical time for the hydrodynamical phase to start. This interval of time is referred to as the pre-equilibrium stage. The evolution of the reaction during pre-equilibrium is thus likely to be influenced by these fields. In this work we adopt a strong field approximation to study the effects of the magnetic field-induced anisotropy on the gluon pressure. We include this anisotropy within the description obtained by means of Effective Kinetic Theory and explore the consequences to reach isotropization at proper times of order 1 fm. We show that when including the magnetic field effects, isotropization is achieved faster.</description>

      <title>Properties of neutron stars and strangeness-mixed stars from a pion mean-field approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of the static neutron stars and strangeness-mixed stars, based on the equations of state derived from a pion mean-field approach. Using the empirical data on the pion-nucleus scattering and bulk properties of nuclear matter, we have already fixed all the parameters in a previous work, where the nucleons and hyperons were shown to be modified in various nuclear medium. In the current work, we first examine the energy and pressure inside a neutron star. We show that the central densities in various neutron stars vary within the range of $(3-6)\rho_0$, where $\rho_0$ is the normal nuclear matter density. The mass-radius relations are obtained and discussed. As the slope parameter for neutron matter increases, the radii of the neutron stars increase with their masses fixed. We also study the strangeness-mixed stars or the hyperon stars using the same sets of the parameters. As the strangeness content of strange matter increases, the binding energy per nucleon is saturated and the corresponding equation of state becomes softened. Consequently, the central densities of the strangeness-mixed stars increase. Assuming that recently observed neutron stars are the strangeness-mixed ones, we find that the central densities increase. In the case of the pure strange stars, the central densities reach almost $(5-6)\rho_0$.</description>

      <title>Probing gluon saturation and nuclear structure in photon-nucleus collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate exclusive vector meson photoproduction within the Color Glass Condensate framework in high-energy photon-nucleus scattering probed experimentally in ultra peripheral heavy ion collisions at RHIC and at the LHC. When the free parameters are constrained by the $\gamma+p$ data from HERA, we predict significant nuclear suppression for both the coherent and incoherent photoproduction cross section in the TeV range. Our results indicate that the LHC data prefers even stronger saturation effects at the highest collision energies. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the linear polarization of photons in ulra peripheral collisions generates azimuthal modulations in the decay products of the exclusively produced vector meson. We show how these measurements can probe details of the nuclear geometry, specifically the deformed structure of the uranium nuclei.</description>

      <title>Two-pion emission decays of negative parity singly heavy baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate two-pion emission decays of singly charmed and bottom baryons, focusing on $\Lambda_Q^*(1P)$ and $\Xi_Q^*(1P)$ with $Q=c$ (charm) or $b$ (bottom) quarks and $J^P=1/2^-,3/2^-$, belonging to antisymmetric flavor triplet $\bar{\boldsymbol{3}}_F$. Our analysis encompasses both sequential processes, involving intermediate states belonging to symmetric flavor sextet $\boldsymbol{6}_F$ such as $\Sigma_Q(1S)$ and $\Xi_Q^\prime(1S)$ respectively with $J^P=1/2^+,3/2^+$, derived from the chiral quark model, and direct process crucial for comparison with experimental data, whose coupling constants estimated using the chiral-partner scheme. We also incorporate the convolution of the parent particle's mass for the Dalitz plot, enabling a more realistic comparison with experimental data. We scrutinize the Dalitz plots of these negative parity states in light of recent Belle measurements for $\Lambda_c(2625)^+$. Our findings support the assignment of $\Lambda_c(2625)^+$ as the $\lambda$-mode excitation with $J^P=3/2^-$ in the quark model, deduced from the the ${\Lambda_c\pi}$ invariant mass distribution, and we then give predictions for other cases, including the $\Xi_Q^*$ decays. The observed asymmetry in the ${\pi\pi}$ invariant mass distribution underscores the important role of the direct process, reflecting the chiral-partner structure in the heavy baryon sector. It is evident that the presence of the direct process is not significant in the three-body decays unless the $S$-wave resonance contribution is suppressed. We suggest further experimental verification to test our predictions and get more insights into the structure of heavy baryons.</description>

      <title>Strangeness Production in $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=3$ GeV Au+Au Collisions at RHIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report multi-differential measurements of strange hadron production ranging from mid- to target-rapidity in Au+Au collisions at a center-of-momentum energy per nucleon pair of $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=3$ GeV with the STAR experiment at RHIC. $K^0_S$ meson and $\Lambda$ hyperon yields are measured via their weak decay channels. Collision centrality and rapidity dependences of the transverse momentum spectra and particle ratios are presented. Particle mass and centrality dependence of the average transverse momenta of $\Lambda$ and $K^0_S$ are compared with other strange particles, providing evidence of the development of hadronic rescattering in such collisions. The 4$\pi$ yields of each of these strange hadrons show a consistent centrality dependence. Discussions on radial flow, the strange hadron production mechanism, and properties of the medium created in such collisions are presented together with results from hadronic transport and thermal model calculations.</description>

      <title>Charge radii of $^{11-16}$C, $^{13-17}$N and $^{15-18}$O determined from their charge-changing cross-sections and the mirror-difference charge radii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charge-changing cross-sections of $^{11-16}$C, $^{13-17}$N and $^{15-18}$O on a carbon target have been determined at energies around 300 MeV/nucleon. A nucleon separation energy dependent correction factor has been introduced to the Glauber model calculation for extracting the nuclear charge radii from the experimental CCCSs. The charge radii of $^{11}$C, $^{13,16}$N and $^{15}$O thus were determined for the first time. With the new radii, we studied the experimental mirror-difference charge radii ($\Delta R_{\text {ch}}^{\text {mirror}}$) of $^{11}$B-$^{11}$C, $^{13}$C-$^{13}$N, $^{15}$N-$^{15}$O, $^{17}$N-$^{17}$Ne pairs for the first time. We find that the $\Delta R_{\text {ch}}^{\text {mirror}}$, including both bound and weakly bound proton-rich mirror partners, are reproduced by the empirical relation to the isospin asymmetry predicted by the $ab$ $initio$ calculations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The three-dimensional spatial structure of hadrons is encoded in their form factors. Via appropriate Fourier transform, the latter describe how charge, energy, linear and angular momentum, but also pressure are distributed inside these systems. Electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon have been measured for a long time, but it is only recently that some gravitational form factors have been extracted from experimental data, creating a great deal of enthusiasm in the hadronic community. Here we summarize some of the recent developments on the interpretation of these form factors, and provide a quick overview of what we can learn about the nucleon mass, spin and internal pressure.</description>

      <title>Confronting the low-scale seesaw and leptogenesis with neutrinoless double beta decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the impact of heavy neutrinos with masses in the MeV-GeV range on neutrinoless double beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$) in view of updated results for the lifetime of this process. Working in a minimal realistic extension of the Standard Model by two right-handed neutrino flavours, we show that the non-observation of $0\nu\beta\beta$ will impose strong bounds on the heavy neutrino properties that are complementary to the limits obtained from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and collider searches. For an inverted mass hierarchy of the light neutrinos we find that improved limits on $0\nu\beta\beta$ from next-generation experiments will restrict the allowed parameter space for fixed mass splitting to narrow bands in the mass-mixing plane. Further combining this with the requirement to explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe via leptogenesis reduces these bands to windows in parameter space that are constrained in all directions and can be targeted by direct searches at accelerators. For a normal mass hierarchy, only parts of the parameter space can be probed by such experiments.</description>

      <title>Classification of Coupled-Channel Near-Threshold Structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since 2003, plenty of resonant structures have been observed in the heavy quarkonium regime. Many of them are close to the thresholds of a few pairs of heavy hadrons. They are candidates of exotic hadrons and have attracted immense attentions. Based on a coupled-channel nonrelativistic effective field theory, we classify the near-threshold structures of a symmetry-related two-channel system according to the scattering length and channel coupling strength. We show that the evolution of the scattering amplitude line shapes can be understood from the pole trajectories in the complex energy plane, and the pole evolution can be traced back to the renormalization group fixed points. We provide a dictionary of correspondence between the evolution of line shapes and pole trajectories, which can be used to understand the experimental observations of the near-threshold structures.</description>

Abstract: We review the theoretical foundations, methodological approaches and current status of the determination of nuclear parton distribution functions (PDFs). A large variety of measurements in fixed-target and collider experiments provide increasingly precise constraints on various aspects of nuclear PDFs, including shadowing, antishadowing, the EMC effect, Fermi motion, flavour separation, deuteron binding, target-mass and other higher-twist effects. We give particular emphasis to measurements carried out in proton-lead collisions at the Large Hadron Collider, which have revolutionised the global analysis during the past decade. These measurements include electroweak boson, isolated photon, single inclusive hadron, jet, and heavy-flavour observables.</description>

      <title>Antineutrino Opacity in Neutron Stars in the Models Constrained by Recent Terrestrial Experiments and Astrophysical Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present paper, I have investigated a neutral current (NC) antineutrinos scattering with neutron star (NS) matter constituents at zero temperature. The modeling of the standard matters in NS is constructed in the framework of both extended relativistic mean-field (E-RMF) and nonrelativistic Korea-IBS-Daegu-SKKU energy density functional (KIDS-EDF) models. In the E-RMF model, I use a new parameter of G3(M), which was constrained by the recent PREX II experiment measurement of neutron distribution of $^{208}\rm{Pb}$, while the KIDS-EDF models are constrained by terrestrial experiments, gravitational-wave signals, and astrophysical observations. Using both realistic and well-constrained matter models, I then calculate the antineutrino differential cross-section (ADCS) and antineutrino mean free path (AMFP) of the antineutrinos-NS matter constituents interaction using a linear response theory. It is found that the AMFP for the KIDS0 and KIDSA models are smaller in comparison to the SLy4 model and the E-RMF model with the G3(M) parameter. The AMFP result of the Skyrme model with the SLy4 parameter set is found to have an almost similar prediction to that of the E-RMF model with the G3(M) parameter. Contributions of each nucleon to total AMFP are also presented for the G3(M) model.</description>

      <title>Method for measuring the charge radii of charged hyperons from the time-like region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07850v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel method for measuring the charge radii of charged stable hadrons, with which the first measurement of the charge radii of the $\Sigma^+$ and the $\Xi^-$ is foreseen. The method explores the facts that the Dalitz decay $\psi(2S) \to Y\bar{Y}e^+e^-$ contains the hyperon form factors and the lowest measurable four-momentum transfer squared can be as low as $\sim 4m_e^2= 1.05\times10^{-6}\,{\rm GeV^2}$ in the time-like region. We identify a kinematic region where the hyperon form factors are essential and propose a method for subtracting the background from the data. It is estimated that the hyperon charge radii can be measured to a precision of about {0.2~fm} with the BES\Rom{3} experiment and one order of magnitude better at the future Super $\tau$-Charm Facility. Moreover, the same method can be used to measure the charge radius of the proton, which provides an independent cross-check on the extraction of proton radius from elastic $ep$ scattering or leptonic hydrogen spectroscopy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11694v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a general class of machine learning algorithms called parametric matrix models. In contrast with most existing machine learning models that imitate the biology of neurons, parametric matrix models use matrix equations that emulate the physics of quantum systems. Similar to how physics problems are usually solved, parametric matrix models learn the governing equations that lead to the desired outputs. Parametric matrix models can be efficiently trained from empirical data, and the equations may use algebraic, differential, or integral relations. While originally designed for scientific computing, we prove that parametric matrix models are universal function approximators that can be applied to general machine learning problems. After introducing the underlying theory, we apply parametric matrix models to a series of different challenges that show their performance for a wide range of problems. For all the challenges tested here, parametric matrix models produce accurate results within an efficient and interpretable computational framework that allows for input feature extrapolation.</description>

      <title>Impact of The Newly Revised Gravitational Redshift of X-ray Burster GS 1826-24 on The Equation of State of Supradense Neutron-Rich Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thanks to the recent advancement in producing rare isotopes and measuring their masses with unprecedented precision, the updated nuclear masses around the waiting-point nucleus $^{64}$Ge in the rapid-proton capture process have led to a significant revision of the surface gravitational redshift of the neutron star (NS) in GS 1826-24 by re-fitting its X-ray burst light curve ({\it X. Zhou et al., Nature Physics {\bf 19}, 1091 (2023)}) using Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA). The resulting NS compactness $\xi$ is between 0.244 and 0.342 at 95\% confidence level and its upper boundary is significantly smaller than the maximum $\xi$ previously known. Incorporating this new data within a comprehensive Bayesian statistical framework, we investigate its impact on the Equation of State (EOS) of supradense neutron-rich matter and the required spin frequency for GW190814's minor $m_2$ with mass $2.59\pm 0.05$M$_{\odot}$ to be a rotationally stable pulsar. We found that the EOS of high-density symmetric nuclear matter (SNM) has to be softened significantly while the symmetry energy at supersaturation densities stiffened compared to our prior knowledge from earlier analyses using data from both astrophysical observations and terrestrial nuclear experiments. In particular, the skewness $J_0$ characterizing the stiffness of high-density SNM decreases significantly, while the slope $L$, curvature $K_{\rm{sym}}$, and skewness $J_{\rm{sym}}$ of nuclear symmetry energy all increase appreciably compared to their fiducial values. We also found that the most probable spin rate for the $m_2$ to be a stable pulsar is very close to its mass-shedding limit once the revised redshift data from GS 1826-24 is considered, making the $m_2$ unlikely the most massive NS observed so far.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of critical fluctuations in hadronic matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Critical phenomena in phase transitions of strongly interacting matter, governed by quantum chromodynamics, are inherently encoded in the fluctuations of conserved charges. In this work, we study the net-baryon number density fluctuations, including the lowest-lying nucleon and the baryonic resonance $\Delta(1232)$, based on the parity doublet model in the mean-field approximation. We focus on the qualitative features of the second-order susceptibility of the net-baryon number density in dense hadronic matter and how the inclusion of $\Delta(1232)$ affects it. We demonstrate that the fluctuations of the individual baryons do not necessarily reflect the total net-baryon number fluctuations at finite density, due to the non-trivial correlations between different particle species. Our results highlight the role of baryonic correlations in the interpretation of data from heavy ion collision experiments.</description>
