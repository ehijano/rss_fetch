      <title>Stylized facts in Web3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07653v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive statistical analysis of the Web3 ecosystem, comparing various Web3 tokens with traditional financial assets across multiple time scales. We examine probability distributions, tail behaviors, and other key stylized facts of the returns for a diverse range of tokens, including decentralized exchanges, liquidity pools, and centralized exchanges. Despite functional differences, most tokens exhibit well-established empirical facts, including unconditional probability density of returns with heavy tails gradually becoming Gaussian and volatility clustering. Furthermore, we compare assets traded on centralized (CEX) and decentralized (DEX) exchanges, finding that DEXs exhibit similar stylized facts despite different trading mechanisms and often divergent long-term performance. We propose that this similarity is attributable to arbitrageurs striving to maintain similar centralized and decentralized prices. Our study contributes to a better understanding of the dynamics of Web3 tokens and the relationship between CEX and DEX markets, with important implications for risk management, pricing models, and portfolio construction in the rapidly evolving DeFi landscape. These results add to the growing body of literature on cryptocurrency markets and provide insights that can guide the development of more accurate models for DeFi markets.</description>

      <title>Modeling of Measurement Error in Financial Returns Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the modeling of measurement error for fund returns data. In particular, given access to a time-series of discretely observed log-returns and the associated maximum over the observation period, we develop a stochastic model which models the true log-returns and maximum via a L\'evy process and the data as a measurement error there-of. The main technical difficulty of trying to infer this model, for instance Bayesian parameter estimation, is that the joint transition density of the return and maximum is seldom known, nor can it be simulated exactly. Based upon the novel stick breaking representation of [12] we provide an approximation of the model. We develop a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to sample from the Bayesian posterior of the approximated posterior and then extend this to a multilevel MCMC method which can reduce the computational cost to approximate posterior expectations, relative to ordinary MCMC. We implement our methodology on several applications including for real data.</description>

      <title>Many learning agents interacting with an agent-based market model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.07393v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the dynamics and the interactions of multiple reinforcement learning optimal execution trading agents interacting with a reactive Agent-Based Model (ABM) of a financial market in event time. The model represents a market ecology with 3-trophic levels represented by: optimal execution learning agents, minimally intelligent liquidity takers, and fast electronic liquidity providers. The optimal execution agent classes include buying and selling agents that can either use a combination of limit orders and market orders, or only trade using market orders. The reward function explicitly balances trade execution slippage against the penalty of not executing the order timeously. This work demonstrates how multiple competing learning agents impact a minimally intelligent market simulation as functions of the number of agents, the size of agents' initial orders, and the state spaces used for learning. We use phase space plots to examine the dynamics of the ABM, when various specifications of learning agents are included. Further, we examine whether the inclusion of optimal execution agents that can learn is able to produce dynamics with the same complexity as empirical data. We find that the inclusion of optimal execution agents changes the stylised facts produced by ABM to conform more with empirical data, and are a necessary inclusion for ABMs investigating market micro-structure. However, including execution agents to chartist-fundamentalist-noise ABMs is insufficient to recover the complexity observed in empirical data.</description>
