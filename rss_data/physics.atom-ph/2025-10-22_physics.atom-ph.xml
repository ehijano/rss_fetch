      <title>Probing Nuclear Interactions Through Isotope Shift Spectroscopy of Mercury</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present precision isotope shift spectroscopy of the $\mathrm{6s^{2}}\, {}^{1}\mathrm{S}_{0}{\rightarrow\,}\mathrm{6s\, 6p}\, {}^{3}\mathrm{P}_{1}$ intercombination line and the $\mathrm{6s\,6p}\, {}^{3}\mathrm{P}_{1}{\rightarrow\,}\mathrm{6s\,6d}\, {}^{3}\mathrm{D}_{J}$ ($J=1,2$) transitions in neutral mercury, performed on the five naturally abundant even isotopes, including the low-abundant isotope ${}^{196}\mathrm{Hg}$. Using laser-cooled atoms in a magneto-optical trap, we achieve uncertainties down to $20\,\mathrm{kHz}$, resolving the isotope shift to a fractional uncertainty of ${\sim}\,2{\,\times\,}10^{-6}$. A King plot analysis comparing our ${}^{1}\mathrm{S}_{0}{\rightarrow}{}^{3}\mathrm{P}_{1}$ data to previous results on the $\mathrm{6s\,6p}\,{}^{3}\mathrm{P}_{2}{\rightarrow\,}\mathrm{6s\,7s}\,{}^{3}\mathrm{S}_{1}$ line reveals a nonlinearity with $4.9\,\sigma$ significance at this $\mathrm{kHz}$-level resolution -- substantially larger than the $\mathrm{Hz}$-level nonlinearities recently reported in $\mathrm{Yb}$ and $\mathrm{Ca}$. Our generalized King plot nonlinear decomposition analysis discusses potential contributions from quadratic ($\propto \delta\langle r^{2}\rangle^{2}$) and higher order field shifts ($\propto \delta\langle r^{4}\rangle$) also induced by nuclear deformation. These measurements yield new insights into the structure of the $\mathrm{Hg}$ nucleus and provide benchmarks for nuclear-structure models. They further establish mercury as a potential platform to search for hypothetical Yukawa-type boson-mediated forces coupling electrons to neutrons.</description>

      <title>Electron impact excitation of Te IV and V and Level Resolved R-matrix Photoionization of Te I - IV with application to modelling of AT2017gfo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectral modelling of kilonovae (KNe) require large amounts of collisional excitation and photoionization atomic data for lowly ionised (neutral, singly and doubly ionised) species of heavy elements. Much of the data currently used is calculated using approximate hydrogenic results or adopts semi-empirical formulae. We present atomic data for ions of tellurium (Te) computed using the well-known $R$-matrix method. Results will also be presented for radiative and thermal collisions of Te IV and V, for which the required atomic data are also typically limited in the literature. The Multi-Configuration-Dirac-Hartree-Fock (MCDHF) method is used to produce model atomic structures and radiative rates. These model structures are then used to calculate electron-impact-excitation and photoionization cross-sections. The resulting excitation and radiative rates are further used in a collisional radiative model to produce synthetic spectra, which are compared with observations. We also investigate the possibility of Te IV contributing to the 1.08 $\mu$m emission feature in the mid-epochs of AT2017gfo alongside the established P-Cygni feature of Sr II.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Brilliant source of 19.2 attosecond soft X-ray pulses below the atomic unit of time"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent preprint by Ardana-Lamas et al. (Ref. [1], arXiv:2510.04086) re-analyzes the data set of the attosecond streaking experiment on krypton atoms originally reported in Phys Rev X 7, 041030 (2017) [2], and claims the characterization of a 19.2 attosecond light pulse with an overall photon flux of 4.8*10^10 photons per second. In this comment, we highlight a series of physical and technical issues concerning both the original experiment [2] and the new characterization [1]. Specifically, without accounting for the contribution of Auger electrons or employing filters to remove low-energy harmonics and compensate for the intrinsic pulse chirp, the authors attribute the measured photoelectrons predominantly to the 3d inner-shell orbital of krypton and claim to have retrieved a nearly chirp-free pulse based on the single atomic orbital. In comparison with our recent attosecond streaking experiments on krypton atoms, these physical and technical issues raise significant doubts about the validity of the characterization results.</description>

      <title>Galilean Invariance in the Characterization of Light Drag in Moving Atomic Vapor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light experiences drag effects when it propagates through a moving medium. The study of light drag has provided foundational insights into light-matter interactions. While longitudinal drag has been extensively characterized, transverse drag, where the medium moves perpendicular to the light's propagation, is subtler and requires advanced techniques for detection. In this work, we experimentally investigate transverse drag in a highly dispersive slow-light medium using non-degenerate Zeeman electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) in rubidium vapor. By systematically comparing configurations where the light beam and the medium serve as the moving frame, we leverage Galilean invariance to analyze transverse light-drag in this optical context. Thus, we provide a platform for future tests of fundamental principles on strong experimental grounds, which offers promising applications in precision velocimetry, accelerometry, quantum information, and light storage technologies.</description>

      <title>Enhancing optical lattice clock coherence times with erasure conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Increasing coherent interrogation times is central to advancing the precision of optical clocks. Synchronous differential optical clock comparisons have now demonstrated atomic coherence times that far exceed the coherence time of the clock laser. While atom coherence times are then primarily limited by errors induced by lattice Raman scattering, excited clock state radiative decay, and broadening from two-body collisions, many of these errors take the atoms out of the clock transition subspace, and can therefore be converted into "erasure" errors if the appropriate readout scheme is employed. Here we experimentally demonstrate a hyperfine-resolved readout technique for ${}^{87}$Sr optical lattice clocks that mitigates decoherence from Raman scattering induced by the lattice as well as radiative decay. By employing hyperfine-resolved readout in synchronous differential comparisons between ${}^{87}$Sr ensembles with both Ramsey and spin echo spectroscopy sequences, we achieve enhanced atomic coherence times exceeding 100 s and 150 s, respectively, enabling longer coherent measurements without a reduction in performance. We anticipate that this hyperfine-resolved readout technique will benefit applications of state-of-the-art optical lattice clock comparisons in which the coherence times are constrained by Raman scattering or radiative decay.</description>

      <title>Magneto-optical trapping of aluminum monofluoride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magneto-optical trapping of molecules has thus far been restricted to molecules with $^2\Sigma$ electronic ground states. These species are chemically reactive and only support a simple laser cooling scheme from their first excited rotational level. Here, we demonstrate a magneto-optical trap (MOT) of aluminum monofluoride (AlF), a deeply bound and intrinsically stable diatomic molecule with a $^1\Sigma^+$ electronic ground state. The MOT operates on the strong A$^1\Pi\leftarrow{}$X$^1\Sigma^+$ transition near 227.5~nm, whose Q$(J)$ lines are all rotationally closed. We demonstrate a MOT of about $6\times 10^4$ molecules for the $J=1$ level of AlF, more than $10^4$ molecules for $J=2$ and $3$, and with no fundamental limit in going to higher rotational levels. Laser cooling and trapping of AlF is conceptually similar to the introduction of alkaline-earth atoms into cold atom physics, and is key to leveraging its spin-forbidden a$^3\Pi \leftarrow{}$X$^1\Sigma^+$ transition for precision spectroscopy and narrow-line cooling.</description>

      <title>Single-Beam Magneto-Optical Trap in Back-to-Back Pyramidal and Conical Mirrors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A three-dimensional magneto-optical trap (MOT), as an efficient method of producing cold atoms from room-temperature atomic vapor, has been widely used to develop atomic sensors. Various compact MOTs using a single laser beam have been reported, simplifying apparatuses and leading to miniaturized devices. Here, we propose single-beam MOTs based on back-to-back pyramidal and conical mirrors. In such back-to-back mirrors, a MOT trapping volume is formed by an incident laser beam, a retroreflected beam, and multiple reflections from the mirror surfaces. We present the design of back-to-back mirrors and a series of compact MOT configurations, with the potential of increasing access to the MOT and simultaneously creating multiple MOTs. We demonstrate a MOT in a back-to-back conical mirror, loading 10 million rubidium-87 atoms from background vapor and cooling the atoms to 7 {\mu}K using polarization gradients. Single-beam MOTs based on back-to-back mirrors will contribute to building compact and scalable cold-atom-based sensors.</description>

      <title>Magnetic shielding in the atomic hydrogen anion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The atomic hydrogen anion H$^-$ is the lightest stable anion and its bound states and resonances are well studied in the literature. Due to the planned comparison of the bare antiproton to H$^-$ in a Penning trap, we study the magnetic shielding of H$^-$ using the nonrelativistic quantum electrodynamics theory, by accurately calculating the non-relativistic shielding, as well as finite nuclear mass, relativistic, and partially QED corrections. We find that the finite nuclear mass correction is quite significant in H$^-$ contributing about $0.1\%$ of the total shielding, which is more than twice as much as the relativistic correction. Our final result for the shielding constant has a nine-parts-per-trillion accuracy and paves the way for direct comparison of the antiproton-to-proton magnetic moments.</description>

      <title>Perturbation-assisted Observation of the Lowest Vibrational Level of the $\mathrm{b}^{3}\Pi_{0}$ State of Ultracold LiK Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The narrow transition from the lowest rovibrational level of the $\mathrm{X}^{1}\Sigma^{+}$ electronic ground state to the lowest vibrational level of the $\mathrm{b}^{3}\Pi_{0}$ potential provides opportunities for achieving magic-wavelength trapping of ultracold bialkali molecules for enhancing their rotational coherence times. Guided by existing spectroscopic data of several perturbed and deeply-bound rovibrational states of the $\mathrm{A}^{1}\Sigma^{+}$ potential [Grochola et al., Chem. Phys. Lett., 2012, 535, 17-20], we conducted a targeted spectroscopic search and report the first observation of the lowest vibrational level of the $\mathrm{b}^{3}\Pi_{0}$ state in $^{6}\mathrm{Li}^{40}\mathrm{K}$. The transition frequency from $|\mathrm{X}^{1}\Sigma^{+},\,v=0,\,J=0&gt;$ to $|\mathrm{b}^{3}\Pi_{0},\,v'=0,\,J'=1&gt;$ is determined to be 314,230.5(5)GHz. Assisted by microwave spectroscopy, we resolved the rotational structure of $|\mathrm{b}^{3}\Pi_{0},\,v'=0&gt;$ and extracted a rotational constant of $h\times8.576(44)$ GHz for the $\mathrm{b}^{3}\Pi_{0}$ state. From this, we deducted an energy separation between $|\mathrm{b}^{3}\Pi_{0},v'=0,J'=0&gt;$ and $|\mathrm{X}^{1}\Sigma^{+},v=0,J=0&gt;$ of $hc\times$10,481.03(2) $\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. Our work provides timely and precise information on the deeply-bound region of the $\mathrm{b}^{3}\Pi_{0}$ triplet excited potential of LiK, and benefits future applications of ultracold LiK isotopologues in quantum simulation and quantum computation that demand long coherence times.</description>

      <title>Floquet-engineered moire quasicrystal patterns of ultracold Bose gases in twisted bilayer optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21093v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of moir\'e quasicrystal patterns in Bose gases confined in twisted bilayer optical lattices via Floquet-engineered intralayer atomic interactions. Dynamical evolutions of the inverse participation ratio and the density wave amplitude reveal the stage for the emergence of moir\'e quasicrystal patterns, whose symmetry can be easily manipulated by the modulation frequencies and amplitudes. Reducing the frequencies and increasing the amplitudes can both facilitate lattice symmetry breaking and the subsequent emergence of rotational symmetry. Notably, a twelve-fold quasicrystal pattern emerges under specific parameters, closely resembling the moir\'e quasicrystal in twisted bilayer graphene. The momentum-space distributions also exhibit high rotational symmetry, which is consistent with the real-space patterns at specific evolution times. Our findings establish a new quantum platform for exploring quasicrystals and their symmetry properties in ultracold bosonic systems.</description>
