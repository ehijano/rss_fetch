      <title>Automatic Forward Model Parameterization with Bayesian Inference of Conformational Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To quantify how well theoretical predictions of structural ensembles agree with experimental measurements, we depend on the accuracy of forward models. These models are computational frameworks that generate observable quantities from molecular configurations based on empirical relationships linking specific molecular properties to experimental measurements. Bayesian Inference of Conformational Populations (BICePs) is a reweighting algorithm that reconciles simulated ensembles with ensemble-averaged experimental observations, even when such observations are sparse and/or noisy. This is achieved by sampling the posterior distribution of conformational populations under experimental restraints as well as sampling the posterior distribution of uncertainties due to random and systematic error. In this study, we enhance the algorithm for the refinement of empirical forward model (FM) parameters. We introduce and evaluate two novel methods for optimizing FM parameters. The first method treats FM parameters as nuisance parameters, integrating over them in the full posterior distribution. The second method employs variational minimization of a quantity called the BICePs score that reports the free energy of `turning on` the experimental restraints. This technique, coupled with improved likelihood functions for handling experimental outliers, facilitates force field validation and optimization, as illustrated in recent studies (Raddi et al. 2023, 2024). Using this approach, we refine parameters that modulate the Karplus relation, crucial for accurate predictions of J-coupling constants based on dihedral angles between interacting nuclei. We validate this approach first with a toy model system, and then for human ubiquitin, predicting six sets of Karplus parameters. This approach, which does not rely on predetermined parameters, enhances predictive accuracy and can be used for many applications.</description>

      <title>Emergence of bidirectional cell laning from collective contact guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Directed collective cell migration is central in morphogenesis, wound healing and cancer progression1,2. Although it is well-accepted that the molecular anisotropy of the micro-environment guides this migration3,4, its impact on the pattern of the cell flows remains largely unexplored. Studying confluent human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) in vitro, we show that subcellular microgrooves elicit a polar mode of collective migration in millimeter-long bidirectional lanes that are much wider than a cell size, even though cell flows are highly disordered on featureless surfaces 5. This directed flocking-like transition6,7 can be accounted for by a hydrodynamic theory of active polar fluids and corresponding numerical simulations. This model further predicts that anisotropic friction resulting from the grooves lowers the threshold of the transition, which we confirm experimentally. Therefore, microscopic anisotropy of the environment not only directs the collective motion of the cells in the easy direction, but also shapes the cell migration pattern. Flow patterns induced by collective contact guidance are thus markedly different from those induced by supracellular confinement8, demonstrating that all length-scales of the micro-environment must be considered in a comprehensive description of collective migration. Furthermore, artificial microtopographies designed from theoretical considerations can provide a rational strategy to direct cells to specific geometries and functions, which has broad implications, for instance, for tissue engineering strategies in organoid morphogenesis.</description>

      <title>Cognitive biases can move opinion dynamics from consensus to signatures of transient chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interest in how democracies form consensus has increased recently, with statistical physics and economics approaches both suggesting that there is convergence to a fixed point in belief networks, but with fluctuations in opinions when there are ``stubborn'' voters. We modify a model of opinion dynamics in which agents are fully Bayesian to account for two cognitive biases: confirmation bias and in-group bias. Confirmation bias occurs when the received information is considered to be more likely when it aligns with the receiver's beliefs. In-group bias occurs when the receiver further considers the information to be more likely when the receiver's beliefs and the sender's beliefs are aligned. We find that when there are no cognitive biases, a network of agents always converges to complete consensus. With confirmation bias alone, polarization can occur. With both biases present, consensus and polarization are possible, but when agents attempt to counteract confirmation bias, there can be signatures of transient chaos and ongoing opinion fluctuations. Based on this simple model, we conjecture that complex opinion fluctuations might be a generic feature of opinion dynamics when agents are Bayesian with biases.</description>

      <title>Immune cells interactions in the tumor microenvironment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a critical role in cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and resistance to therapy. A principal component of the TME is the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME), which includes various immune cells such as macrophages. Depending on the signals received from environmental elements like IL-4 or IFN-$\gamma$, macrophages can exhibit pro-inflammatory (M1) or anti-inflammatory (M2) phenotypes. This study uses an enhanced agent-based model to simulate interactions within the TIME, focusing on the dynamic behavior of macrophages. We examine the response of cancer cell populations to alterations in macrophages, categorized into three different behaviors: M0 (initial-inactive), M1 (immune-upholding), and M2 (immune-repressing), as well as environmental differentiations. The results highlight the significant impact of macrophage modulation on tumor proliferation and suggest potential therapeutic strategies targeting these immune cells.</description>

      <title>Interacting Streams of Cognitive Active Agents in a Three-Way Intersection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergent collective motion of active agents - in particular pedestrians - at a three-way intersection is studied by Langevin simulations of cognitive intelligent active Brownian particles (iABPs) with directed visual perception and self-steering avoidance. Depending on the maneuverability $\Omega$, the goal fixation $K$, and the vision angle $\psi$, different types of pedestrian motion emerge. At intermediate relative maneuverability $\Delta = \Omega/K$ and large $\psi$, pedestrians have noisy trajectories due to multiple scattering events as they encounter other pedestrians in their field of view. For $\psi = \pi$ and large relative maneuverability $\Delta$, an effectively jammed state is found, which belongs to the percolation universality class. For small $\psi$, agents exhibit localised clustering and flocking, while for intermediate $\psi$ self-organized rotational flows can emerge. The analysis of mean squared displacement and velocity auto-correlation of the agents reveals that the motion is well described by fractional Brownian Motion with positively correlated noise. Finally, despite the rich variety of collective behaviour, the fundamental flow diagram for the three-way-crossing setup shows a universal curve for the different vision angles. Our research provides valuable insights into the importance of vision angle and self-steering avoidance on pedestrian dynamics in semi-dense crowds.</description>

      <title>Simulating neuronal dynamics in fractional adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an efficient discretization of a novel fractional-order adaptive exponential (FrAdEx) integrate-and-fire model, which is used to study the fractional-order dynamics of neuronal activities. The discretization is based on extension of L1-type methods that can accurately handle the exponential growth and the spiking mechanism of the model. This new method is implicit and uses adaptive time stepping to robustly handle the stiff system that arises due to the exponential term. The implicit nonlinear system can be solved exactly, without the need for iterative methods, making the scheme efficient while maintaining accuracy. We present a complete error model for the numerical scheme that can be extended to other integrate-and-fire models with minor changes. To show the feasibility of our approach, the numerical method has been rigorously validated and used to investigate several different spiking oscillations of the model. We observed that the fractional-order model is capable of predicting biophysical activities, which are interpreted through phase diagrams describing the transition from one firing type to another. This simple model shows significant promise, as it has sufficient expressive dynamics to reproduce several features qualitatively from a biophysical dynamical perspective.</description>

      <title>A theoretical framework for learning through structural plasticity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11735v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A growing body of research indicates that structural plasticity mechanisms are crucial for learning and memory consolidation. Starting from a simple phenomenological model, we exploit a mean-field approach to develop a theoretical framework of learning through this kind of plasticity, capable of taking into account several features of the connectivity and pattern of activity of biological neural networks, including probability distributions of neuron firing rates, selectivity of the responses of single neurons to multiple stimuli, probabilistic connection rules and noisy stimuli. More importantly, it describes the effects of stabilization, pruning and reorganization of synaptic connections. This framework is used to compute the values of some relevant quantities used to characterize the learning and memory capabilities of the neuronal network in training and testing procedures as the number of training patterns and other model parameters vary. The results are then compared with those obtained through simulations with firing-rate-based neuronal network models.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic bounds on generalized transport: From single-molecule to bulk observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the transport of any scalar observable in $d$-dimensional non-equilibrium systems is bounded from above by the total entropy production scaled by the amount the observation "stretches" microscopic coordinates. The result -- a time-integrated generalized speed limit -- reflects the thermodynamic cost of transport of observables, and places underdamped and overdamped stochastic dynamics on equal footing with deterministic motion. Our work allows for stochastic thermodynamics to make contact with bulk experiments, and fills an important gap in thermodynamic inference, since microscopic dynamics is, at least for short times, underdamped. Requiring only averages but not sample-to-sample fluctuations, the proven transport bound is practical and applicable not only to single-molecule but also bulk experiments where only averages are observed, which we demonstrate by examples. Our results may facilitate thermodynamic inference on molecular machines without an obvious directionality from bulk observations of transients probed, e.g. in time-resolved X-ray scattering.</description>

      <title>Six decades of the FitzHugh-Nagumo model: A guide through its spatio-temporal dynamics and influence across disciplines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11403v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The FitzHugh-Nagumo equation, originally conceived in neuroscience during the 1960s, became a key model providing a simplified view of excitable neuron cell behavior. Its applicability, however, extends beyond neuroscience into fields like cardiac physiology, cell division, population dynamics, electronics, and other natural phenomena. In this review spanning six decades of research, we discuss the diverse spatio-temporal dynamical behaviors described by the FitzHugh-Nagumo equation. These include dynamics like bistability, oscillations, and excitability, but it also addresses more complex phenomena such as traveling waves and extended patterns in coupled systems. The review serves as a guide for modelers aiming to utilize the strengths of the FitzHugh-Nagumo model to capture generic dynamical behavior. It not only catalogs known dynamical states and bifurcations, but also extends previous studies by providing stability and bifurcation analyses for coupled spatial systems.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium structure and relaxation in active microemulsions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Microphase separation is common in active biological systems as exemplified by the separation of RNA and DNA-rich phases in the cell nucleus driven by the transcriptional activity of polymerase enzymes acting similarly to amphiphiles in a microemulsion. Here we propose an analytically tractable model of an active microemulsion to investigate how the activity affects its structure and relaxation dynamics. Continuum theory derived from a lattice model exhibits two distinct regimes of the relaxation dynamics and is linked to the broken detailed balance due to intermittent activity of the amphiphiles.</description>
