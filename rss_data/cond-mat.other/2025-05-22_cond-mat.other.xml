      <title>Gap modes in Arnold tongues and their topological origins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gap modes in a modified Mathieu equation, perturbed by a Dirac delta potential, are investigated. It is proved that the modified Mathieu equation admits stable isolated gap modes with topological origins in the unstable regions of the Mathieu equation, which are known as Arnold tongues. The modes may be identified as localized electron wavefunctions in a 1D chain or as toroidal Alfv\'en eigenmodes. A generalization of this argument shows that gap modes can be induced in regimes of instability by localized potential perturbations for a large class of periodic Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Rare-Earth Nitrides: Fundamental Advances and Applications in Cryogenic Electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Driven by the pursuit of high-performance electronic devices, research into novel materials with properties appropriate for cryogenic applications has unveiled the exceptional properties of the rare-earth nitride series of intrinsic ferromagnetic semiconductors. Here we report on the field focusing on developments, since the most recent comprehensive review [1], which enable applications in cryogenic electronic devices.</description>

      <title>First-principles calculations of transport coefficients in Weyl semimetal TaAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study charge and heat transport from first-principles in the topological Weyl semimetal TaAs. Electron-phonon coupling matrix elements are calculated using density functional perturbation theory and used to derive the thermo-electric transport coefficients, including the electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, electronic thermal conductivity and the Peltier coefficient. We compare the self-energy and momentum relaxation time approximations to the iterative solution of the Boltzmann Transport Equation, finding they give similar results for TaAs provided the chemical potential is treated accurately. For the iterative method, we derive an additional equation, which is needed to fully solve for transport under both thermal and an electrical potential gradients. Interestingly, the Onsager reciprocity between $S$ and $\Pi$ is no longer imposed, and we can deal with systems breaking time-reversal symmetry, in particular magnetic materials. We compare our results with the available experimental data for TaAs: the agreement is excellent for $\sigma_{xx}$, while $\sigma_{zz}$ is overestimated, probably due to differences in experimental carrier concentrations. The Seebeck coefficient is of the same order of magnitude in theory and experiments, and we find that its low-T behavior also strongly depends on the doping level.</description>

      <title>Synchronous manipulation of nuclear spins via boron vacancy centers in hexagonal boron nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02828v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a method for entangling operations on nuclear spins surrounding a negatively charged boron vacancy (VB-center) point defect in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). To this end, we propose to employ the electron spin of a VB-center as a control qubit. We show that in the presence of a background magnetic field and by applying control pulses, one can collectively manipulate the state of the nuclei with $\hat{U}_z$ and $\hat{U}_x$ rotations. These rotations can serve for implementing the synchronous three-qubit $X$, $Z$, and the Hadamard gates. Through our numerical analyses considering realistic system parameters and the decoherence effects, we demonstrate that these gates can be executed with high fidelities. Furthermore, as an example for the application of our toolbox, we utilize these collective gates to prepare the highly entangled GHZ states among the three nuclear spins with a fidelity of $0.99$. By including the electron decoherence effects, we find that the relative deviations of the gate fidelities from the noisy terms are negligibly small, proving the noise-resilience of our protocols. Our work can serve as the foundation for exploiting the nuclear spins in hBN in future quantum technological applications.</description>
