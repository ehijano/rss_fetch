      <title>Point Charges in Classical Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LaTeX transcription (2025) of a 1989 honours thesis (University of Adelaide) on point charges in classical electrodynamics and the Lorentz-Dirac radiation-reaction equation. The thesis reviews the retarded field of an arbitrarily moving charge, energy-momentum conservation, and derives the Lorentz-Dirac equation via momentum balance. It discusses self-interaction and mass renormalization, and presents world-line self-field definitions including retarded averaging and an analytic continuation approach. Appendices include Mathematica listings used to obtain near-world-line expansions of the field and related quantities.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Coupling of Mass and Electromagnetic Fields: Entropic Origin of Parity Asymmetry and the Meissner Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a thermodynamic framework that couples mass dynamics, described by the Newton- Gibbs-van der Waals formalism, with electromagnetic fields beyond the scope of classical Maxwell theory. Classical Newtonian mechanics does not capture density evolution in the momentum balance, while the standard Maxwell equations neglect the contribution of the curl component of the electric field associated with moving charges. Building on an alternative understanding on entropy, we develop a generalized theory for electrodynamics governed by entropy-production constraints. The resulting framework yields a modified Maxwell stress tensor that incorporates the moving-charge contribution, leading to intrinsic parity asymmetry in electromagnetic forces. The theory naturally reproduces key features of superconductivity, including the Meissner effect, and reduces to the conventional Maxwell-Faraday and Maxwell-Ampere equations in an appropriate limit. This entropic formulation provides a unified thermodynamic basis for mass-field coupling and reveals new physical consequences arising from motion-induced electromagnetic effects.</description>

      <title>Unified Micromechanics Theory of Composites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the matrix composite materials (CM) of either random (statistically homogeneous or inhomogeneous), periodic, or deterministic (neither random nor periodic) structures. CMs exhibit linear or nonlinear behavior, coupled or uncoupled multi-physical phenomena, locally elastic, weakly nonlocal (strain gradient and stress gradient), or strongly nonlocal (strain-type and displacement-type, peridynamics) phase properties. A modified Computational Analytical Micromechanics (CAM) approach introduces an exact Additive General Integral Equation (AGIE) for CMs of any structure and phase properties mentioned above. The unified iteration solution of static AGIEs is adapted to the body force with compact support serving as a fundamentally new universal training parameter. The approach also establishes a critical threshold for filtering out unsuitable sub-datasets of effective parameters through a novel Representative Volume Element (RVE) concept, which extends Hill's classical framework. This RVE concept eliminates sample size, boundary layer, and edge effects, making it applicable to CMs of any structure and phase properties, regardless of local or nonlocal, linear or nonlinear. Incorporating this new RVE concept into machine learning and neural network techniques enables the construction of any unpredefined surrogate nonlocal operators. The methodology is structured as a modular, block-based framework, allowing independent development and refinement of software components. This flexible, robust AGIE-CAM framework integrates data-driven, multi-scale, and multi-physics modeling, accelerating research in CM of any microtopology and phase properties considered. The AGIE-CAM framework represents a groundbreaking paradigm shift in the micromechanics of composites, redefining the very philosophy that underpins our understanding of their behavior at the microscopic level.</description>

      <title>Conservation of Momentum and Energy in the Lorenz-Abraham-Dirac Equation of Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: After a brief review of the modified causal Lorentz-Abraham classical equation of motion for an extended charged sphere and its limit to the mass-renormalized modified causal Lorentz-Abraham-Dirac equation of motion as the radius of the charged sphere approaches zero, a concise derivation is given for the conditions on the velocity and external force required for these modified equations of motion to satisfy conservation of momentum and energy. The solutions to the unmodified and modified LAD equations of motion as well as the Landau-Liftshitz approximate solution to the unmodified LAD equation of motion are obtained for a charge traveling through a parallel-plate capacitor.</description>
