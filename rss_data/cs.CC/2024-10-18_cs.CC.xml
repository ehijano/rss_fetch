      <title>High Rate Multivariate Polynomial Evaluation Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical Reed-Muller codes over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ are based on evaluations of $m$-variate polynomials of degree at most $d$ over a product set $U^m$, for some $d$ less than $|U|$. Because of their good distance properties, as well as the ubiquity and expressive power of polynomials, these codes have played an influential role in coding theory and complexity theory. This is especially so in the setting of $U$ being ${\mathbb{F}}_q$ where they possess deep locality properties. However, these Reed-Muller codes have a significant limitation in terms of the rate achievable -- the rate cannot be more than $\frac{1}{m{!}} = \exp(-m \log m)$.
  In this work, we give the first constructions of multivariate polynomial evaluation codes which overcome the rate limitation -- concretely, we give explicit evaluation domains $S \subseteq \mathbb{F}_q^m$ on which evaluating $m$-variate polynomials of degree at most $d$ gives a good code. For $m= O(1)$, these new codes have relative distance $\Omega(1)$ and rate $1 - \epsilon$ for any $\epsilon &gt; 0$. In fact, we give two quite different constructions, and for both we develop efficient decoding algorithms for these codes that can decode from half the minimum distance.
  The first of these codes is based on evaluating multivariate polynomials on simplex-like sets whereas the second construction is more algebraic, and surprisingly (to us), has some strong locality properties, specifically, we show that they are locally testable.</description>

      <title>Adaptive and oblivious statistical adversaries are equivalent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We resolve a fundamental question about the ability to perform a statistical task, such as learning, when an adversary corrupts the sample. Such adversaries are specified by the types of corruption they can make and their level of knowledge about the sample. The latter distinguishes between sample-adaptive adversaries which know the contents of the sample when choosing the corruption, and sample-oblivious adversaries, which do not. We prove that for all types of corruptions, sample-adaptive and sample-oblivious adversaries are \emph{equivalent} up to polynomial factors in the sample size. This resolves the main open question introduced by \cite{BLMT22} and further explored in \cite{CHLLN23}.
  Specifically, consider any algorithm $A$ that solves a statistical task even when a sample-oblivious adversary corrupts its input. We show that there is an algorithm $A'$ that solves the same task when the corresponding sample-adaptive adversary corrupts its input. The construction of $A'$ is simple and maintains the computational efficiency of $A$: It requests a polynomially larger sample than $A$ uses and then runs $A$ on a uniformly random subsample.
  One of our main technical tools is a new structural result relating two distributions defined on sunflowers which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Quasi-quantum states and the quasi-quantum PCP theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce $k$-local quasi-quantum states: a superset of the regular quantum states, defined by relaxing the positivity constraint. We show that a $k$-local quasi-quantum state on $n$ qubits can be 1-1 mapped to a distribution of assignments over $n$ variables with an alphabet of size $4$, which is subject to non-linear constraints over its $k$-local marginals. Therefore, solving the $k$-local Hamiltonian over the quasi-quantum states is equivalent to optimizing a distribution of assignment over a classical $k$-local CSP. We show that this optimization problem is essentially classical by proving it is NP-complete. Crucially, just as ordinary quantum states, these distributions lack a simple tensor-product structure and are therefore not determined straightforwardly by their local marginals. Consequently, our classical optimization problem shares some unique aspects of Hamiltonian complexity: it lacks an easy search-to-decision reduction, and it is not clear that its 1D version can be solved with dynamical programming (i.e., it could remain NP-hard).
  Our main result is a PCP theorem for the $k$-local Hamiltonian over the quasi-quantum states in the form of a hardness-of-approximation result. The proof suggests the existence of a subtle promise-gap amplification procedure in a model that shares many similarities with the quantum local Hamiltonian problem, thereby providing insights on the quantum PCP conjecture.</description>

      <title>On estimating the trace of quantum state powers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the computational complexity of estimating the trace of quantum state powers $\text{tr}(\rho^q)$ for an $n$-qubit mixed quantum state $\rho$, given its state-preparation circuit of size $\text{poly}(n)$. This quantity is closely related to and often interchangeable with the Tsallis entropy $\text{S}_q(\rho) = \frac{1-\text{tr}(\rho^q)}{q-1}$, where $q = 1$ corresponds to the von Neumann entropy. For any non-integer $q \geq 1 + \Omega(1)$, we provide a quantum estimator for $\text{S}_q(\rho)$ with time complexity $\text{poly}(n)$, exponentially improving the prior best results of $\exp(n)$ due to Acharya, Issa, Shende, and Wagner (ISIT 2019), Wang, Guan, Liu, Zhang, and Ying (TIT 2024), and Wang, Zhang, and Li (TIT 2024), and Wang and Zhang (ESA 2024). Our speedup is achieved by introducing efficiently computable uniform approximations of positive power functions into quantum singular value transformation.
  Our quantum algorithm reveals a sharp phase transition between the case of $q=1$ and constant $q&gt;1$ in the computational complexity of the Quantum $q$-Tsallis Entropy Difference Problem (TsallisQED$_q$), particularly deciding whether the difference $\text{S}_q(\rho_0) - \text{S}_q(\rho_1)$ is at least $0.001$ or at most $-0.001$:
  - For any $1+\Omega(1) \leq q \leq 2$, TsallisQED$_q$ is $\mathsf{BQP}$-complete, which implies that Purity Estimation is also $\mathsf{BQP}$-complete.
  - For any $1 \leq q \leq 1 + \frac{1}{n-1}$, TsallisQED$_q$ is $\mathsf{QSZK}$-hard, leading to hardness of approximating von Neumann entropy because $\text{S}_q(\rho) \leq \text{S}(\rho)$, as long as $\mathsf{BQP} \subsetneq \mathsf{QSZK}$.
  The hardness results are derived from reductions based on new inequalities for the quantum $q$-Jensen-(Shannon-)Tsallis divergence with $1\leq q \leq 2$, which are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Unifying lower bounds for algebraic machines, semantically</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.06787</link>
      <description>arXiv:1811.06787v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a new abstract method for proving lower bounds in computational complexity. Based on the notion of topological and measurable entropy for dynamical systems, it is shown to generalise three previous lower bounds results from the literature in algebraic complexity. We use it to prove that maxflow, a Ptime complete problem, is not computable in polylogarithmic time on parallel random access machines (prams) working with real numbers. This improves, albeit slightly, on a result of Mulmuley since the class of machines considered extends the class "prams without bit operations", making more precise the relationship between Mulmuley's result and similar lower bounds on real prams.
  More importantly, we show our method captures previous lower bounds results from the literature, thus providing a unifying framework for "topological" proofs of lower bounds: Steele and Yao's lower bounds for algebraic decision trees, Ben-Or's lower bounds for algebraic computation trees, Cucker's proof that NC is not equal to Ptime in the real case, and Mulmuley's lower bounds for "prams without bit operations".</description>

      <title>Learning quantum states and unitaries of bounded gate complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While quantum state tomography is notoriously hard, most states hold little interest to practically-minded tomographers. Given that states and unitaries appearing in Nature are of bounded gate complexity, it is natural to ask if efficient learning becomes possible. In this work, we prove that to learn a state generated by a quantum circuit with $G$ two-qubit gates to a small trace distance, a sample complexity scaling linearly in $G$ is necessary and sufficient. We also prove that the optimal query complexity to learn a unitary generated by $G$ gates to a small average-case error scales linearly in $G$. While sample-efficient learning can be achieved, we show that under reasonable cryptographic conjectures, the computational complexity for learning states and unitaries of gate complexity $G$ must scale exponentially in $G$. We illustrate how these results establish fundamental limitations on the expressivity of quantum machine learning models and provide new perspectives on no-free-lunch theorems in unitary learning. Together, our results answer how the complexity of learning quantum states and unitaries relate to the complexity of creating these states and unitaries.</description>

      <title>Lift-and-Project Integrality Gaps for Santa Claus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of the MaxMinDegree Arborescence (MMDA) problem in layered directed graphs of depth $\ell\le O(\log n/\log \log n)$, which is an important special case of the Santa Claus problem. Obtaining a polylogarithmic approximation for MMDA in polynomial time is of high interest as it is a necessary condition to improve upon the well-known 2-approximation for makespan scheduling on unrelated machines by Lenstra, Shmoys, and Tardos [FOCS'87]. The only way we have to solve the MMDA problem within a polylogarithmic factor is via an elegant recursive rounding of the $(\ell-1)^{th}$ level of the Sherali-Adams hierarchy, which needs time $n^{O(\ell)}$ to solve. However, it remains plausible that one could obtain a polylogarithmic approximation in polynomial time by using the same rounding with only $1$ round of the Sherali-Adams hierarchy. As a main result, we rule out this possibility by constructing an MMDA instance of depth $3$ for which an integrality gap of $n^{\Omega(1)}$ survives $1$ round of the Sherali-Adams hierarchy. This result is tight since it is known that after only $2$ rounds the gap is at most polylogarithmic on depth-3 graphs. Second, we show that our instance can be ``lifted'' via a simple trick to MMDA instances of any depth $\ell\in \Omega(1)\cap o(\log n/\log \log n)$ (the whole range of interest), for which we conjecture that an integrality gap of $n^{\Omega(1/\ell)}$ survives $\Omega(\ell)$ rounds of Sherali-Adams. We show a number of intermediate results towards this conjecture, which also suggest that our construction is a significant challenge to the techniques used so far for Santa Claus.</description>

      <title>Commuting Local Hamiltonians Beyond 2D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10495v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Commuting local Hamiltonians provide a testing ground for studying many of the most interesting open questions in quantum information theory, including the quantum PCP conjecture and the existence of area laws. Although they are a simplified model of quantum computation, the status of the commuting local Hamiltonian problem remains largely unknown. A number of works have shown that increasingly expressive families of commuting local Hamiltonians admit completely classical verifiers. Despite intense work, the largest class of commuting local Hamiltonians we can place in NP are those on a square lattice, where each lattice site is a qutrit. Even worse, many of the techniques used to analyze these problems rely heavily on the geometry of the square lattice and the properties of the numbers 2 and 3 as local dimensions. In this work, we present a new technique to analyze the complexity of various families of commuting local Hamiltonians: guided reductions. Intuitively, these are a generalization of typical reduction where the prover provides a guide so that the verifier can construct a simpler Hamiltonian. The core of our reduction is a new rounding technique based on a combination of Jordan's Lemma and the Structure Lemma. Our rounding technique is much more flexible than previous work, and allows us to show that a larger family of commuting local Hamiltonians is in NP, albiet with the restriction that all terms are rank-1. Specifically, we prove the following two results:
  1. Commuting local Hamiltonians in 2D that are rank-1 are contained in NP, independent of the qudit dimension. Note that this family of commuting local Hamiltonians has no restriction on the local dimension or the locality.
  2. We prove that rank-1, 3D commuting Hamiltonians with qudits on edges are in NP. To our knowledge this is the first time a family of 3D commuting local Hamiltonians has been contained in NP.</description>
