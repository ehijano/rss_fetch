      <title>Curation and Dissemination of Complex Multi-modal Data Sets for Radiation Detection, Localization, and Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The PANDAWN sensor network in Chicago, IL, is a state-of-the-art test-bed for networked, multi-modal sensing. It integrates AI/data science methods into its operation, from data acquisition to automated data labeling and curation workflows. The curation and dissemination of diverse multi-modal data sets will enable the development of new radiological/nuclear (R/N) detection, localization, and tracking algorithms, and methods relevant across the nonproliferation mission space. This paper first introduces the PANDAWN sensor network and the features that make it stand out from previous multi-modal data acquisition efforts. We then review the various data streams acquired on the PANDAWN nodes, and present the implementation of an automated data curation pipeline that includes the labeling of radiation and contextual data streams. We finally provide a short overview of different studies that leveraged the curated data sets.</description>

      <title>Physics-based Full-band GaN HEMT Simulation Suggests Upper Bound of LO Phonon Lifetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intrinsic limits to device performance arise from fundamental material properties that define the best achievable operation, independent of engineering constraints. In GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs), hot longitudinal optical (LO) phonons can act as an intrinsic performance bottleneck by reducing electron saturation velocity, output current, and transconductance, which are key device metrics. While bulk GaN studies report LO phonon lifetimes of approximately 1 ps, leading to strong nonequilibrium phonon populations, ungated heterostructures show much shorter lifetimes of only tens of femtoseconds. Because direct measurement inside a HEMT channel is challenging, the true impact of hot phonons remains uncertain. Using full-band transport simulations of a fabricated GaN HEMT, we show that LO phonon lifetimes must be less than about 40 fs to reproduce measured I-V characteristics, consistent with ultrafast decay observed in GaN heterostructures. We further demonstrate that even these ultrafast lifetimes are not sufficient to eliminate hot phonon effects: the residual nonequilibrium LO population continues to limit the current density at high bias. Moreover, when the LO phonon lifetime exceeds a few tens of femtoseconds, a pronounced hot phonon bottleneck emerges, leading to substantial current-density suppression that is inconsistent with experiment.</description>

      <title>A Wideband Tri-Band Shared-Aperture Antenna Array for 5G and 6G Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a wideband tri-band shared-aperture antenna array covering the 5G mid-band and 6G centimetric band. The challenge of scattering and coupling suppression is holistically addressed across the wide bands. Guided by characteristic mode analysis (CMA), a segmented spiral radiator is developed to mitigate high-frequency scattering and coupling while maintaining low-frequency radiation performance. Compared with a conventional tube radiator, the proposed spiral achieves a reduced radar cross-section (RCS) over 4.7-21.5 GHz (128.2%). With the aid of serial resonators, the segmented-spiral dipole achieves impedance matching in the low band (LB, 3.05-4.68 GHz, 42.2%), covering the 5G band (3.3-4.2 GHz), while additional suppressors further reduce cross-band coupling. The middle band (MB) and high band (HB) antennas operate at 6.2-10.0 GHz (46.9%) and 10.0-15.6 GHz (43.8%), respectively, collectively covering the anticipated 5G-Advanced and 6G bands (6.425-15.35 GHz). Both the MB and HB antennas employ a planar magnetoelectric (ME) dipole structure to avoid common-mode resonances within the LB and MB and to minimize cross-band scattering in the HB. The proposed array maintains undistorted radiation patterns and better than 20 dB port isolation between any two ports across all three bands.</description>

      <title>Frequency modulated enhancement of microwave resonator sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) technique to characterize the frequency stability of a microwave-frequency surface acoustic wave (SAW) resonator-based sensor. The multi-mode acoustic resonator is integrated in a notch geometry with a transmission line, all fabricated on Y-cut lithium niobate. We measure the amplitude and phase of the resonator transfer function and the PDH signal across the resonator full spectral range. We use these measurements to emphasize the differences between the PDH measurement and a standard Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) technique. As compared to a PLL, we demonstrate that PDH is insensitive to phase error and exhibits a reduced Allan deviation of the center frequency measurement, in each case by up to an order of magnitude. The method rejects spurious effects and background frequency drift, demonstrating the enhancements possible with PDH-based measurements, which can be realized in a wide range of microwave-frequency resonator-based sensors and devices.</description>

      <title>High-Efficiency Isolator-Free Magnetron Power Combining Method Based on H-Plane Tee Coupling and Peer-to-Peer Locking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetrons are widely used as high-performance microwave sources in microwave heating, microwave chemistry, and microwave power transmission due to their high efficiency, low cost, and compact size advantages. However, the output power of a single magnetron is limited by its resonant cavities, posing a physical constraint. High-efficiency coherent power combining based on the injection-locking technique effectively overcomes this limitation and meets the demand for higher output power. Nevertheless, using isolators, such as circulators, introduces significant insertion loss, and the injection signal sources and phase shifters increase the system size, cost, and complexity in a conventional magnetron power combining (MPC) system. A novel method is proposed to utilize the coupling between two ports of an H-plane tee to achieve peer-to-peer injection locking magnetrons. Meanwhile, an asymmetric phase compensation is realized using a section of waveguide to adjust the magnetron output characteristics. Theoretical and numerical analyses provided qualitative insight into the system output behavior. Subsequently, an experimental system was developed for verification. In the experiments, the system achieved maximum microwave power combining efficiencies 90.2%, 93.6%, and 93.6% at electrical waveguide lengths corresponding to 90, 135, and 225, with output powers of 1650, 1260, and 1610 W, respectively, without the use of any isolators or external injection sources. The experimental results show good agreement with numerical calculations. This method offers the advantages of low cost, compact size, and low loss, providing a new approach for developing high-performance MPC systems in the future.</description>

      <title>Study on Improving Microwave Heating Uniformity Based on Phase-Frequency Simultaneous Modulation Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional microwave heating techniques are limited due to inherent thermal point residency effects and inadequate control over the heating process. A novel method is proposed to enhance microwave heating uniformity using the injection-pulling technique. In this method, the injection-pulling technique is used to achieve simultaneous modulation of both the output phase and frequency of the magnetron, thereby extending the locking bandwidth of the injection-locking technique. The output characteristics of the injection-pulled magnetron were validated through numerical calculations and experiments. Microwave heating experiments were conducted under both a five-cup water load and an absorbent paper load. Compared with conventional injection-locking frequency sweeping, the proposed method not only expands the sweeping bandwidth from 8 to 18 MHz but also further improves heating uniformity, offering more options for magnetron applications in microwave heating.</description>

      <title>Application of Time-Controlled Critical Point in Pressure Reducing Valves. A Case Study in North Spain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Potable water utilities are currently making great efforts to reduce leakage rates and assure long-term supply to the population due to the challenges of climate change, growing population and water shortage scenarios that have been on them over the last years. One of the most employed methods to reduce leakage includes the installation of pressurereducing valves along the water distribution network and the utilization of pressure management schemes. Pressure management includes different types of control models, which are applied according to the requirements of each site. The most advanced and sophisticated scheme is critical point control, which relies on a flow signal from a measuring device or online communication between the critical point and the valve. This paper proposes the utilization of a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average, or the SARIMA model, to correlate pressure at the outlet of the valve and pressure on the critical point of the area supplied, aiming to set a fixed pressure in the critical point. The SARIMA model is developed according to historical data logged in the field and then validated. Later, the SARIMA model was tested on a real location in the village of Noja, Spain. The analysis of the field test results prove that the proposed model is feasible to be used since there is no significance difference between the target values set in the critical point and the real values measured in the field. The research proves that the SARIMA model can be used as an alternative for critical point control in water distribution networks when no flow signal is available or when communication between the critical point and the pressure reducing valve is not an option.</description>

      <title>Realizing on-demand all-to-all selective interactions between distant spin ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving all-to-all coherent networks is critical for the advancement of large-scale coherent computing and communication protocols. By exploiting the resonant dipole-dipole interaction between distant spin ensembles coupled to a one-dimensional coplanar waveguide (CPW) terminated by a mirror, we successfully demonstrate an on-demand all-to-all selective coherent network between four spin ensembles. Furthermore, by repositioning the spin ensembles along the CPW, we achieve collective coupling, and demonstrate coherent energy exchange between multiple spin ensembles in the time domain. These results strongly indicate the potential of this device as a medium-scale all-to-all network structure, which is poised to advance the exploration of many-body physics and enhance coherent information processing capabilities.</description>

      <title>A Tri-Band Shared-Aperture Base Station Antenna Array Covering 5G Mid-Band and 6G Centimetric Wave Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes a tri-band shared-aperture antenna array with three wide bands, covering the 5G mid-band and the 6G centimetric band, which is a promising candidate for future 6G base station antennas. The challenge of suppressing interferences, including scattering and coupling, in the tri-band array is holistically addressed across wide bands. Guided by characteristic mode analysis (CMA), a segmented spiral radiator is efficiently developed to mitigate scattering and coupling at high frequencies while preserving radiation performance at low frequencies. Compared to a conventional tube radiator, the proposed spiral exhibits a reduced radar cross-section (RCS) over an ultra-wide range of 4.7-21.5 GHz (128.2%). With the aid of serial resonators, impedance matching of the segmented-spiral-based dipole antenna is achieved across the low band (LB) of 3.05-4.68 GHz (42.2%), spanning the 5G band 3.3-4.2 GHz. Moreover, suppressors are placed near the LB ports to further reduce the cross-band coupling. Middle band (MB) and high band (HB) antennas operate in 6.2-10.0 GHz (46.9%) and 10.0-15.6 GHz (43.8%), respectively, collectively covering the anticipated 5G-Advanced and 6G centimetric band of 6.425-15.35 GHz. Both the MB and HB antennas employ a planar magnetoelectric (ME) dipole structure, which prevents common-mode resonances in the LB and MB, and mitigates the scattering from the MB antenna in the HB. In this tri-band array, radiation patterns remain undistorted across the LB, MB, and HB, and the isolation between any two ports exceeds 20 dB over all three bands.</description>

      <title>A Reconfigurable Circuit Strategy and Its Application in Low-Power Rectifier for Ambient Energy Harvesting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In ambient electromagnetic energy harvesting systems, the input power to the rectifier is low. To improve rectification efficiency, Schottky diodes, which are sensitive to low power, are commonly selected as rectifying devices to convert microwave power into dc power. However, low-power rectifying diodes typically have low reverse breakdown voltages, making them susceptible to reverse breakdown under high power conditions. This letter proposes a low-power rectifier with reconfigurable function. The rectifying diode is connected in parallel with the p-i-n diode. At low input power, the output dc voltage is low, and the p-i-n diode remains off, having no impact on the rectifier operation. As the input power increases, the p-i-n diode turns on, causing change in circuit structure and impedance mismatch. This leads to increased reflected power, thereby preventing the rectifying diode from receiving excessive power. In addition, the turn-on voltage of the p-i-n diode is lower than the reverse breakdown voltage of the rectifying diode, protecting it from reverse breakdown.</description>

      <title>Optimization for growth condition of ultrathin hexagonal boron nitride on dielectric substrates via LPCVD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hexagonal Boron Nitride (h-BN) is a highly intriguing candidate for heterostructure optoelectronic applications, such as Deep Ultraviolet photodetectors, UV sensing and communication systems and solar cells. This is primarily due to its unique properties, including a layer dependent wide energy bandgap, superior mechanical strength, high thermal conductivity, high band-edge absorption coefficient, and exceptional transparency in the UV region. The widely adopted synthesis method for h-BN thin films is Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) Method, which often utilizes catalytic substrates like copper (Cu) and Nickel (Ni). However, integrating the synthesized h-BN into device applications requires a subsequent transfer process to the target substrate. This transfer step introduces significant material damage, such as folding, cracking and polymer residues, which ultimately degrade the optoelectronic properties of the material and compromise device performance. To overcome this major challenge, there is a strong need to synthesize high-quality h-BN films directly onto dielectric substrates such as silicon (Si), SiO2, quartz, sapphire or AlN without the need for transfer. The primary difficulty in direct synthesis lies in achieving homogenous, high crystallinity films with controllable thickness due to the absence of a catalytic effect. In this work, we investigated the optimization of growth parameters for the direct synthesis of ultrathin h-BN films on non-catalytic quartz substrates, which are highly transparent in the UV region, using the Low-pressure Chemical Vapor Deposition (LPCVD) method. The optimal synthesis conditions were determined to be 1050oC for 60 min, achieved by the decomposition of 150 mg Ammonia Borane (AB) precursor at 80oC. This optimization is crucial for advancing large-scale, high-performance h-BN based DUV photodetector fabrication.</description>

      <title>Bidirectional Photoinduced Carrier Transfer in Fluorinated Quasi-2D Perovskites Governing Enhanced Photocurrent Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) metal halide perovskites exhibit rich phase heterogeneity that profoundly influences light-matter interactions and charge transport. However, the fundamental mechanisms governing carrier transfer across distinct phases remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate effective electron-hole separation in fluorinated multilayered quasi-2D perovskite films nominally prepared for three layers, using femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. The films are revealed to comprise a heterogeneous phase distribution (with 1, 2, 3 layers and bulk) naturally stacked along the growth direction. Our ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements, show the type-two band alignment between the small-n (layer number) phases and the bulk. This alignment drives charge separation via both direct and sequential carrier transfer mechanisms, whereby electrons preferentially migrate into the bulk domains while holes accumulate in the small-n layers, extending even to single layer phase-a process only rarely observed in previous studies. The nearly symmetric transfer times of electrons and holes yield an efficient and balanced spatial separation of carriers. Global target analysis employing a carrier transfer model quantitatively reproduces the spectral evolution, providing a rigorous validation of the mechanism. Nonetheless, we found photocurrent enhancement in the diode devices of this quasi-2D perovskite as a consequence of the efficient transfer of photocarriers in the opposite directions. This work delivers a comprehensive picture of interphase charge transfer in fluorinated quasi-2D perovskites and highlights strategies to engineer directional separation pathways for high-performance photovoltaic, optoelectronic, and quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Ferromagnetic Phase Transition of DPPH Induced by a Magic Angle Helical Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the results and unique instrument configuration of a novel experiment in which we successfully transitioned a DPPH sample from its natural paramagnetic state and essentially a non-magnetic material to a ferromagnetic state at room temperature. This was achieved using a specifically applied helical flux magnetic field. The DPPH sample (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) remained ferromagnetic for at least one hour after the experiment, indicating that a transformation in the material was induced by the external field rather than being merely a temporary magnetic phase transition observed only during the experiment. The external magnetic field used had a helical pitch angle of approximately $54.7{\deg}$, known mathematically as the Magic Angle, relative to the +z-axis, which is aligned with the normal S to N external field's magnetic moment vector. Based on the phenomenology of the experiment, we infer that this specific magic angle corresponding to the known quantization precession spin angle of free electrons under a homogeneous straight flux magnetic field potentially enhances the percentage of unpaired valence electrons within the DPPH material, allowing them to align in parallel with the applied external field. Typically, in paramagnetic materials, the distribution of unpaired electrons' quantum spins relative to an external field is nearly random, showing roughly a 50% chance of either parallel or antiparallel alignment. Only a slight majority preference exists in one alignment direction due to the Boltzmann thermal distribution, which contributes to the paramagnetic nature of these materials. In our measurements, we found that the induced ferromagnetism of the DPPH sample resulted in an abnormal thousand-fold decimal value increase in relative magnetic permeability at ${\mu}{\approx}1.4$, compared to its typical paramagnetic value of $1.0001$ for this material.</description>

      <title>Deep learning recognition and analysis of Volatile Organic Compounds based on experimental and synthetic infrared absorption spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) are organic molecules that have low boiling points and therefore easily evaporate into the air. They pose significant risks to human health, making their accurate detection the crux of efforts to monitor and minimize exposure. Infrared (IR) spectroscopy enables the ultrasensitive detection at low-concentrations of VOCs in the atmosphere by measuring their IR absorption spectra. However, the complexity of the IR spectra limits the possibility to implement VOC recognition and quantification in real-time. While deep neural networks (NNs) are increasingly used for the recognition of complex data structures, they typically require massive datasets for the training phase. Here, we create an experimental VOC dataset for nine different classes of compounds at various concentrations, using their IR absorption spectra. To further increase the amount of spectra and their diversity in term of VOC concentration, we augment the experimental dataset with synthetic spectra created via conditional generative NNs. This allows us to train robust discriminative NNs, able to reliably identify the nine VOCs, as well as to precisely predict their concentrations. The trained NN is suitable to be incorporated into sensing devices for VOCs recognition and analysis.</description>

      <title>Polarons from first principles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article reviews recent theoretical developments in the ab initio study of polarons in materials. The polaron is an emergent quasiparticle that arises from the interaction between electrons and phonons in solids, and consists of an electron or a hole accompanied by a distortion of the crystal lattice. Recent advances in experiments, theory, and computation have made it possible to investigate these quasiparticles with unprecedented detail, reigniting the interest in this classic problem of condensed matter physics. Recent theoretical and computational advances include ab initio calculations of polaron spectral functions, wavefunctions, lattice distortions, and transport and optical properties. These developments provide new insight into polaron physics, but they have evolved somewhat independently from the earlier effective Hamiltonian approaches that laid the foundation of the field. This article aims to bridge these complementary perspectives by placing them within a single unified conceptual framework. To this end, we start by reviewing effective Hamiltonians of historical significance in polaron theory, ab initio techniques based on density functional theory, and many-body first-principles approaches to polarons. After this survey, we outline a general field-theoretic framework that bridges between these diverse approaches to polaron physics. For completeness, we also review recent progress in the study of exciton polarons and self-trapped excitons and their relations to polarons. Beyond the methodology, we discuss recent applications to several classes of materials that attracted attention in the context of polaron physics.</description>

      <title>Dispersion Engineering of Planar Sub-millimeter Wave Waveguides and Resonators with Low Radiation Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mm-wave and THz superconducting circuits find numerous applications in areas ranging from quantum information and sensing to high-energy physics. Planar THz transmission lines and resonators are fabrication-friendly, compact, and scalable, and they can be efficiently interfaced with external signals and controls. However, planar circuits radiate strongly at high frequencies, which precludes their use in loss-sensitive applications. Here, we present the design and characterization of planar dispersion-engineered transmission lines that effectively suppress radiation leakage in desired mm-wave bands. We extend this concept to design planar resonators with extremely low radiation leakage, resulting in radiation Q-factors above 106 at 553 GHz. Low-loss planar THz circuitry will impact many application domains, including broadband communications, quantum information, radio astronomy, and cosmology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum sensors based on electronic spins have emerged as powerful probes of microwave-frequency fields. Among other solid-state platforms, spins in molecular crystals offer a range of advantages, from high spin density to functionalization via chemical tunability. Here, we demonstrate microwave vector magnetometry using the photoexcited spin triplet of pentacene molecules, operating at zero external magnetic field and room temperature. We achieve full three-dimensional microwave field reconstruction by detecting the Rabi frequencies of anisotropic spin-triplet transitions associated with two crystallographic orientations of pentacene in deuterated naphthalene crystals. We further introduce a phase alternated protocol that extends the rotating-frame coherence time by an order of magnitude and enables sensitivities of approximately $1~\mu\mathrm{T}/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ with sub-micrometer spatial resolution. These results establish pentacene-based molecular spins as a practical and high-performance platform for microwave quantum sensing in addition to demonstrating control techniques broadly applicable to other molecular and solid-state spin systems.</description>

      <title>Dual-comb correlation spectroscopy reveals laser dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laser dynamics underpin a broad range of modern photonic technologies and continue to reveal rich nonlinear behaviors. However, existing spectroscopic tools, most notably time-stretched dispersive Fourier transform spectroscopy (TS-DFT), remain limited in spectral resolution, accuracy, and their ability to capture continuous waveforms and complex field dynamics. Here, we introduce dual-comb correlation spectroscopy (DCCS) as a powerful approach for resolving fast and intricate laser behaviors that are inaccessible to TS-DFT and conventional spectrometers. By correlating two sequences of heterodyne spectra produced by mixing a test laser with a pair of optical combs, DCCS enables rapid (e.g., 1 us) and high-resolution (0.08 pm) spectral retrieval over broad optical bandwidths. Leveraging these capabilities, we reveal mode-hopping and mode-competition dynamics in continuous-wave lasers, as well as the buildup process of a mode-locked laser. These results establish DCCS as a versatile and complementary tool to TS-DFT for exploring transient, broadband, and previously unresolvable behaviors in lasers and other time-evolving optical systems.</description>

      <title>Phase-Factor-Controlled Surface Spirals in the Magnetic Conical Phase: The Role of In-Plane Directionality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In chiral magnets, the magnetic textures surrounding domain walls exhibit a rich variety of structures, offering insights into fundamental physics and potential applications in spintronic devices. Conical spirals and related structures possess intrinsic in-plane directionalities governed by phase factors $\phi_0$, which are often obscured in long spirals due to cylindrical symmetry but become prominent in short spirals or thin films. Using micromagnetic simulations, we systematically studied magnetic textures at ferromagnetic-conical interfaces (FCI), including 1D and 2D FCIs with various shapes. Surface spirals (SS) emerge adjacent to these FCIs, closely linked to the cone's in-plane reorientation. In 1D FCIs, reorientation controls the presence, shape, and topological charge of the SS, with a discontinuity point observed where spirals with opposite charges form on opposite sides. In 2D FCIs, eyebrow-like SS are evident. The reorientation angle between top and bottom SS is controlled by the film thickness, similar to stacked spirals reported previously. We further demonstrate that SSs form at the facets of skyrmion clusters within the conical phase, as confirmed by both simulations and Lorentz transmission electron microscopy observations in Co$_8$Zn$_{10}$Mn$_2$ thin films. The experiments specifically reveal two distinct formation pathways: thermally activated co-growth and field-driven transformation from residual helices. These findings establish $\phi_0$ as a fundamental control parameter for magnetic states, enabling promising spintronic functionalities such as multi-state memory through SS polymorphism and energy-efficient neuromorphic computing via controlled topological transitions.</description>

      <title>Observed enhanced emission at higher-order exceptional points in RF circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Purcell effect -- stemming directly from the celebrated Fermi's Golden Rule -- links the enhanced emissivity of an emitter to the local density of states (LDoS) of a surrounding cavity. Under typical circumstances the LDoS is assumed to have a Lorentzian lineshape. Here, we go beyond the traditional Purcell framework by designing RF cavities with non-Lorentzian LDoS caused by higher-order non-Hermitian exceptional point degeneracies (EPDs) where $N\geq 2$ eigenfrequencies and their associated eigenmodes coalesce. We experimentally demonstrate a non-conventional emissivity enhancement (as compared to the isolated resonance regime) that increases with the EPD order $N$. The theoretical analysis traces its origin to an $N$-th power Lorentzian LDoS line shape that dominates under judicious spatially designed cavity losses. Our results reveal a new route to design cavities that do not rely on ultrahigh $Q$-factor resonators or small modal volumes.</description>

      <title>An Euler-Lagrangian Multiphysics Coupling Framework for Particle-Laden High-Speed Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle-laden effects in high-speed flows require a coupled Euler and Lagrangian prediction technique with varying fidelity of thermochemical models, depending on the simulation conditions of interest. This requirement makes the development of a conventional monolithic solver challenging to manage the different fidelity of the thermochemical models within a single computational framework. To address this, the present study proposes a multi-solver framework for the coupled Euler-Lagrangian predictions applicable to various particle-laden high-speed flow conditions. Volumetric and surface couplings are established between a particle solver ORACLE (OpenFOAM-based lagRAngian CoupLEr) and a thermochemical nonequilibrium flow solver based on an adaptable data exchange algorithm. The developed framework is then validated by predicting particle-laden supersonic nozzle flows and aerothermal heating around a hypersonic Martian atmospheric entry capsule. Finally, a quasi-1D approximation is proposed in conjunction with a surrogate method to efficiently and accurately predict particle-laden surface erosion, with quantified parametric uncertainty, for hypersonic aerothermal characterization.</description>

      <title>Fault-Tolerant Information Processing with Quantum Weak Measurement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Noise is an important factor that influences the reliability of information acquisition, transmission, processing, and storage. In order to suppress the inevitable noise effects, a fault-tolerant information processing approach via quantum weak measurement is proposed, where pairwise orthogonal postselected measurement bases with various tiny angles and optimal compositions of measured results are chosen as a decoding rule. The signal to be protected can be retrieved with a minimal distortion after having been transmitted through a noisy channel. Demonstrated by typical examples of encoding signal on two-level superposition state or Einstein-Podolsky-Rossen state transmitted through random telegraph noise and decoherence noises channel, the mean squared error distortion may be close to $0$ and the fault-tolerant capability could reach $1$ with finite quantum resources. To verify the availability of the proposed approach, classic coherent light and quantum coherent state are used for encoding information in the experiment. Potentially, the proposed approach may provide a solution for suppressing noise effects in long-distance quantum communication, high-sensitivity quantum sensing, and accurate quantum computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to visualize both macroscopic and microscopic features over an extended field of view is essential for endoscopic imaging and other applications ranging from machine vision to microscopy. However, miniaturizing endoscopes introduces inherent trade-offs between size and optical performance, including field-of-view (FOV), depth-of-field (DOF), and resolution. These constraints limit the use of microendoscopes in clinical settings such as early cancer detection within narrow, hard-to-access anatomical regions, including the lung, ovaries, and pancreas. State-of-the-art microendoscopes typically rely on microlens assemblies that increase both cost and size. Their large f-numbers also hinder the collection of high-resolution information from live tissue. In this work, we present two compact metalens designs that provide wide FOV, extended DOF, and high resolution, enabled by custom-tailored point spread functions (PSFs). The devices achieve a full 172 degrees FOV, an extended DOF from 0.4 mm to beyond 300 mm, and a resolution of 30 line pairs per millimeter, all within a 1 mm x 1 mm x 0.2 mm footprint. A key advantage of our approach is the ability to transition seamlessly between low and high magnification without mechanical refocusing. Final images are reconstructed through backend deconvolution, highlighting the potential of hybrid imaging systems that integrate computational techniques with flat-optics components.</description>

Abstract: Freestanding thin films, a class of low-dimensional materials capable of maintaining structural integrity without substrates, have emerged as a forefront research focus. Their unique advantages-circumventing substrate clamping, liberating intrinsic material properties, and enabling cross-platform heterogeneous integration-underpin this prominence. This review systematically summarizes core fabrication techniques, including physical delamination (e.g., laser lift-off, mechanical exfoliation) and chemical etching, alongside associated transfer strategies. It further explores the induced strain modulation mechanisms, extreme mechanical properties and interface decoupling effects enabled by these films. Representative case studies demonstrate breakthrough applications in flexible/ultrathin electronics, ultrahigh-sensitivity sensors and the exploration of novel quantum states. Critical challenges regarding scalable fabrication, precise interface control, and long-term stability are analyzed, concluding with prospects for emerging applications in bio-inspired intelligent devices, quantum precision sensing, and brain-inspired neural networks.</description>

      <title>A Capacitor Model of the Helical Deflector: Revisiting Shamaev's Proposal and the Model in the Book</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06651v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A RF helical deflector is a type of electron and ion optics device that applies a time-dependent rotating transverse electric or magnetic field by means of time-dependent RF voltage applied on two opposite conducting helical structures (wires, ribbons or other) to deflect charged particles (a single, bunch or beam) in a circular or spiral path. It is a perspective indirect timing system being concurrent for reaching picosecond time resolution, and have promise being excellent candidate for high precision time-of-flight detection. As a timing system, it converts the temporal structure of an electron beam into a spatial pattern -- particularly, an ellipse in the case of a single-frequency RF voltage and continuous electron pencil beam.
  I propose a capacitor model of a RF helical deflector and compare it with the existing model in the Book, interpret it and provide understanding of it. Furthermore, I analyze the latter, finding analytical formulas for the applied electric field, ellipse sizes (semi-axes) and rotation angle, lengths of the ellipse line, corresponding to the duration of electron pencil bunches or beams. The present article touches the topics of getting circle on resonance limit and of deflection sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Phase-multiplexed optical computing: Reconfiguring a multi-task diffractive optical processor using illumination phase diversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a monochrome multi-task diffractive network architecture that leverages illumination phase multiplexing to dynamically reconfigure its output function and accurately implement a large group of complex-valued linear transformations between an input and output aperture. Each member of the desired group of T unique transformations is encoded and addressed with a distinct 2D illumination phase profile, termed "phase key", which illuminates the input aperture, activating the corresponding transformation at the output field-of-view. A common diffractive optical network, optimized with T phase keys, demultiplexes these encoded inputs and accurately executes any of the T distinct linear transformations at its output. We demonstrate that a diffractive network composed of N = 2 x T x Ni x No optimized diffractive features can realize T distinct complex-valued linear transformations, accurately executed for any complex field at the input aperture, where Ni and No refer to the input/output pixels, respectively. In our proof-of-concept numerical analysis, T = 512 complex-valued transformations are implemented by the same monochrome diffractive network with negligible error using illumination phase diversity. Compared with wavelength-multiplexed diffractive systems, phase-multiplexing architecture significantly lowers the transformation errors, potentially enabling larger-scale optical transformations to be implemented through a monochrome processor. Phase-multiplexed multi-task diffractive networks would enhance the capabilities of optical computing and machine-vision systems.</description>

      <title>Full Electrical Switching of a Freestanding Ferrimagnetic Metal for Energy-Efficient Bipolar Neuromorphic Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flexible electronics and neuromorphic computing face key challenges in material integration and function retention. In particular, freestanding membranes suffer from slow sacrificial layer removal and interfacial strain, while neuromorphic hardware often relies on area-intensive dual-device schemes for bipolar synaptic weights. Here, we present a universal strategy based on water-soluble Sr4Al2O7 sacrificial layers, enabling the rapid release of freestanding ferrimagnetic metal membranes, which exhibit deterministic spin-orbit torque switching characteristics with well-preserved perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and are potential for next-generation ultrafast information technology. Extending this approach, we realize single-device ferrimagnetic synapses exhibiting intrinsic bipolar resistive switching. When implemented in a ResNet-18 architecture, these devices achieve 92% accuracy on CIFAR-10 - comparable to floating-point software models - while halving device counts relative to differential-pair implementations. These results establish a scalable platform linking flexible spintronics with compact, high-performance neuromorphic systems, offering foundational advances for next-generation electronics and brain-inspired hardware.</description>

      <title>Learning Thermoelectric Transport from Crystal Structures via Multiscale Graph Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are designed to extract latent patterns from graph-structured data, making them particularly well suited for crystal representation learning. Here, we propose a GNN model tailored for estimating electronic transport coefficients in inorganic thermoelectric crystals. The model encodes crystal structures and physicochemical properties in a multiscale manner, encompassing global, atomic, bond, and angular levels. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets with remarkable extrapolative capability. By combining the proposed GNN with \textit{ab initio} calculations, we successfully identify compounds exhibiting outstanding electronic transport properties and further perform interpretability analyses from both global and atomic perspectives, tracing the origins of their distinct transport behaviors. Interestingly, the decision process of the model naturally reveals underlying physical patterns, offering new insights into computer-assisted materials design.</description>

      <title>Effective Electromagnetic Degrees of Freedom in Backscatter MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the definition of the effective electromagnetic degrees of freedom (EEMDOFs) of a static linear multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system is well established, the counterpart for a backscatter MIMO (BS-MIMO) system is so far missing. A BS-MIMO system encodes the input information into the loads of backscatter elements. Due to mutual coupling, the mapping from load configuration to observed fields is fundamentally non-linear, which complicates the analysis of BS-EEMDOFs. We introduce a definition of BS-EEMDOFs based on the Jacobian of the observed fields with respect to the load configuration. We derive a closed-form expression from multiport network theory which demonstrates that the number of BS-EEMDOFs is fundamentally a distributed variable, whose distribution depends on the mutual coupling between the backscatter elements and the coherent illumination. The modes associated with BS-EEMDOFs lie in the column space of the end-to-end channel matrix from backscatter array ports to receiver ports, but the number of BS-EEMDOFs is generally different from the number of benchmark EEMDOFs associated with the same array being coherently fed rather than tunably terminated. The dependence on the coherent illumination yields optimized coherent illumination as a control knob for the number of BS-EEMDOFs. We present numerical and experimental results for the evaluation and optimization of the number of BS-EEMDOFs in different radio environments with reconfigurable intelligent surfaces.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Pre-trained Neural Network Models for the Classification of Tumor Cells Analyzed by Label-free Phase Holotomographic Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Can a single label-free image reveal whether cancer cells were exposed to chemotherapy? We present an innovative methodology on the label-free and high-resolution imaging properties of phase holotomographic microscopy coupled with neural network models for the classification of cancer cells. Using 3D phase holotomographic microscopy, we imaged live A549 lung cancer cells with and without paclitaxel, converted stacks to 2D maximum-intensity projections, and evaluated pre-trained convolutional networks (VGG16, ResNet18, DenseNet121, and EfficientNet-B0) for binary classification of treatment status. EfficientNet-B0 achieved 96.9 % accuracy on unsegmented images. Refractive index analysis revealed bimodal distribution in treated cells, reflecting heterogeneous biophysical responses to paclitaxel exposure and supporting the network's ability to detect subtle, label-free indicators of drug action. As further proof-of-concept, the same pipeline separated holotomographic images of label-free, high versus low-graded urothelial cancer cells with high accuracy (90.6 %). These findings highlight the potential of integrating label-free holotomographic imaging with deep learning techniques for rapid and efficient classification of tumor cells, paving the way for advancements in treatment optimization and personalized diagnostic strategies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compare experiments and fully-resolved particle simulations designed to match the experimental conditions of a weakly inertial, neutrally buoyant, moderately oblate spheroid in shear flow under confinement. Experimental and numerical results are benchmarked against theory valid for asymptotically small particle Reynolds numbers and for unconfined systems. By considering the combined effects of confinement and inertia, sensitivity to initial conditions, and the time span of observation, we reconcile the findings of theory, experiments, and numerical simulations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that confinement significantly influences the orientational stability of log-rolling spheroids compared to weak inertia, with the primary consequence being a reduced drift rate towards the stable log-rolling orbit.</description>

      <title>Observation of Stable Bimeron Transport Driven by Spoof Surface Acoustic Waves on Chiral Metastructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological quasiparticles, such as merons and bimerons, are characterized by non-trivial textures that exhibit remarkably robust transport against deformation, offering significant potential for information processing. While these phenomena have been explored in various systems, acoustic realizations remain challenging. Here, we report that acoustic meron topological textures were successfully realized using designed Archimedeanlike square spiral metastructures via the excitation of spoof surface acoustic waves (SSAWs). By applying mirror-symmetric combinatorial operations to the unit structures, we further construct composite chiral metastructures that enable both one-dimensional and two-dimensional stable transport of acoustic bimerons. It is further revealed that bimeron transport originates from the locked opposite phase differences of SSAWs, induced by the handedness of the cavity resonant modes. The intrinsic robustness of the meron textures against structural defects is confirmed through the calculation of their topological charge. Our findings establish stable acoustic bimeron transport as a topologically resilient foundation for future acoustic information processing and storage technologies.</description>

      <title>Single Flux Quantum Circuit Operation at Millikelvin Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As quantum computing processors increase in size, there is growing interest in developing cryogenic electronics to overcome significant challenges to system scaling. Single flux-quantum (SFQ) circuits offer a promising alternative to remote, bulky, and power-hungry room temperature electronics. To meet the need for digital qubit control, readout, and co-processing, SFQ circuits must be adapted to operate at millikelvin temperatures near quantum processors. SEEQC's SFQuClass digital quantum management approach proximally places energy-efficient SFQ (ERSFQ) circuits and qubits in a multi-chip module. This enables extremely low power dissipation, compatible with a typical dilution cryostat's limited cooling power, while maintaining high processing speed and low error rates. We report on systematic testing from 4 K to 10 mK of a comprehensive set of ERSFQ cells, as well as more complex circuits such as programmable counters and demultiplexers used in digital qubit control. We compare the operating margins and error rates of these circuits and find that, at millikelvin, bias margins decrease and the center of the margins (i.e., the optimal bias current value) increases by ~15%, compared to 4.2 K. The margins can be restored by thermal annealing by reducing Josephson junction (JJ) critical current Ic. To provide guidance for how circuit parameters vary from 4.2 K to millikelvin, relevant analog process control monitors (PCMs) were tested in the temperature range of interest. The measured JJ critical current (of the PCM JJ arrays) increases by ~15% when decreasing temperature from 4.2 K to millikelvin, in good agreement with both theory and the empirically measured change in the center of bias margins for the tested digital circuits.</description>

Abstract: Studying the dynamical behavior of micro- and nano-mechanical systems (MEMS and NEMS) is essential in various fields from nonlinear dynamics to quantum technologies. Hence, it is important to be able to precisely monitor the mechanical properties of MEMS and NEMS devices. In this work, we show how to track and spatially map various properties of a mechanical resonator, such as frequency shift, linewidth, and nonlinearity, by aptly choosing three closely-spaced drive frequencies and using phase-locked loops. This technique tracks changes in the system faster and more efficiently, without the need for repeated frequency sweeps of the oscillator response, simply by employing three phase-locked tones.</description>

      <title>Spin-Texture Spin-valve with a van der Waals Magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: All-electrical methods for nucleating, detecting, and manipulating spin textures in two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) magnets can serve as fundamental building blocks for multi-state spintronic memory, logic, and neuromorphic computing applications. Unlike conventional ferromagnets, vdW ferromagnets such as Fe5GeTe2 with strong Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions stabilize nanoscale chiral spin textures, including skyrmions and stripe domains. However, the sub-100 nm size of these spin textures has limited their study to sophisticated microscopy techniques. Here, we demonstrate all-electrical detection of spin textures in vdW itinerant ferromagnet Fe5GeTe2 using pure spin transport in a lateral graphene spin-valve device at room temperature. By engineering nanoscale constrictions or notches in Fe5GeTe2, we create spin textures that inject distinct spin polarizations into the graphene channel, where they are nonlocally sensed by a reference conventional ferromagnetic detector at room temperature. This enables the observation of anomalous multi-level spin-valve switching and Hanle spin precession signals, which are due to unique spin textures in Fe5GeTe2 and in sharp contrast to single-domains and conventional magnet-based devices. This all-electrical approach can provide direct access to the spin textures on an integrated 2D spintronic circuit without the need for ex-situ microscopic characterizations.</description>

      <title>Enhanced charging power in nonreciprocal quantum battery by reservoir engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a scheme to achieve a nonreciprocal quantum battery (QB) in the non-Hermitian (NH) system, which can overcome the intrinsic dissipation and reverse flow constraints. The design is based on a charger and a battery, which are coherently coupled and jointly interact with a bad cavity. By introducing the auxiliary bad cavity and exploiting the nonreciprocal condition, this model can harness the environmental dissipation to suppress the reverse energy transfer. Under resonant conditions, we have achieved a four ratio of the battery energy to the charger energy; in contrast, this ratio is significantly reduced under large detuning. Through damping optimization, high efficiency of the short-time charging power is attained. In comparison to the fully nonreciprocal scheme, the QB operating at the exceptional point (EP) exhibits greater resilience to parameter fluctuations. These findings highlight the potential of NH quantum engineering for advancing QB technology, particularly in regimes involving directional energy transfer, controlled dissipation, and entropy management in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Magnonics of time-varying media: Giant amplification via phase-transition-driven temporal interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gilbert damping-the primary obstacle limiting spin-wave propagation in magnonic devices-can be transformed from an adversary into an asset. Here we demonstrate 175-fold spin-wave amplitude amplification in ultrathin films with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy at temporal interfaces associated with a field-driven transition between a uniform in-plane state and a stripe-domain state, exceeding existing parametric and spin-torque schemes (10-50-fold) without a continuous power supply. When the in-plane bias field is swept through a critical value in the presence of finite Gilbert damping, the spin-wave dispersion undergoes dramatic softening, and the eigenfrequency crosses zero and acquires a positive imaginary part that drives exponential growth. We identify this as a damping-induced instability operating near an exceptional point-a non-Hermitian degeneracy where, counterintuitively, increased Gilbert damping enhances amplification. This mechanism exploits ingredients specific to these magnetic films: the interplay of Gilbert damping, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya-interaction-induced nonreciprocity, and field-driven phase transitions-a combination that, to our knowledge, has no direct counterpart in photonic or acoustic time-varying platforms. Our analytical framework provides explicit design rules, while micromagnetic simulations capture the full nonlinear dynamics, including stripe-domain formation. This work establishes temporal magnonics as a new paradigm for reconfigurable, lithography-free spin-wave control.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we describe and demonstrate a novel Technology Computer Aided Design (TCAD) driven methodology to re-center room-temperature Process Design Kits (PDKs) for cryogenic operation using a limited set of experimental measurements. Unlike previous approaches that relied on direct fitting of sparse measurements, our technique accounts for process-induced deviations by calibrating TCAD models to both room-temperature and cryogenic data. Compact models for all process corners are extracted from TCAD-generated target characteristics, enabling accurate cryogenic modeling without dedicated foundry support. This scalable, technology-independent method provides a practical path for cryogenic circuit design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12884v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-energy ion irradiation deposits extreme energy in a narrow range (1-10 nm) along ion trajectories in solid through electronic energy loss, producing unique irradiation effects such as ion tracks. However, intrinsic velocity effects impose an upper limit on electronic energy loss that cannot be overcome by adjusting irradiation parameters. We introduce a method using electric fields during irradiation to enhance nanoscale energy deposition by accelerating ion-excited electrons within sub-picosecond timescales.Our extended thermal spike model quantitatively describes this enhancement and predicts a significant reduction in the electronic energy loss required for ion track formation in amorphous SiO2, which is in excellent agreement with experimental observations. This work provides a new approach to control energy deposition during irradiation and boosts the wide application of ion tracks in material modification and nanoengineering to much broader extents.</description>

Abstract: We report the design, fabrication in a commercial foundry, and experimental results of high-efficiency, normal incidence grating couplers for silicon photonics. We observe a maximum coupling efficiency of 85.4% (-0.69 dB) with a 1 dB bandwidth of 20 nm at a central wavelength of 1546 nm. These experimental results verify earlier theoretical and simulation results and pave the way for the use of perfectly vertical grating couplers, as an alternative to edge coupling, in silicon photonics applications that are sensitive to input coupling loss. Further, these results enable the use of grating couplers for vertically oriented elements, such as multicore fibers and VCSELs, and address challenges associated with coupling to free space beams.</description>

Abstract: Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) are key elements in practical spintronics, enabling not only conventional tasks such as data storage, transmission, and processing but also the implementation of compute-in-memory processing elements, facilitating the development of efficient hardware for neuromorphic computing. The functionality of an MTJ is determined by the properties of its free layer (FL) and reference layer (RL) with fixed magnetization, separated by an MgO tunnel barrier. This paper presents a mechanism for reconfiguring the RL, which is the upper layer of a pinned synthetic antiferromagnet, enabling a reversible transition from a single-domain state to a vortex magnetic state with different core positions. When the RL is in the vortex state, it generates a spin current with a vortex-like polarization distribution, enabling stable vortex oscillations in the FL even in the absence of external magnetic fields. This effect has been confirmed in MTJs with diameters ranging from 400 to 1000 nm. It is demonstrated, using experimental data with comparative micromagnetic simulation, that the pinning antiferromagnet retains a long term memory of previous reannealing states resulting in a deformation of the vortex polarised spin current, which in turn introduces a strong dynamical vortex core polarity symmetry breaking. The analogue reprogrammable nature of both the static and dynamic properties of the MTJ demonstrate different possible routes for the introduction of non-volatility into radiofrequency spintronic neuromorphic paradigms.</description>
