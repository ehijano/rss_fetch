      <title>Aegis: Taxonomy and Optimizations for Overcoming Agent-Environment Failures in LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) agents augmented with domain tools promise to autonomously execute complex tasks requiring human-level intelligence, such as customer service and digital assistance. However, their practical deployment is often limited by their low success rates under complex real-world environments. To tackle this, prior research has primarily focused on improving the agents themselves, such as developing strong agentic LLMs, while overlooking the role of the system environment in which the agent operates.
  In this paper, we study a complementary direction: improving agent success rates by optimizing the system environment in which the agent operates. We collect 142 agent traces (3,656 turns of agent-environment interactions) across 5 state-of-the-art agentic benchmarks. By analyzing these agent failures, we propose a taxonomy for agent-environment interaction failures that includes 6 failure modes. Guided by these findings, we design Aegis, a set of targeted environment optimizations: 1) environment observability enhancement, 2) common computation offloading, and 3) speculative agentic actions. These techniques improve agent success rates on average by 6.7-12.5%, without any modifications to the agent and underlying LLM.</description>

      <title>CataractSurg-80K: Knowledge-Driven Benchmarking for Structured Reasoning in Ophthalmic Surgery Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cataract surgery remains one of the most widely performed and effective procedures for vision restoration. Effective surgical planning requires integrating diverse clinical examinations for patient assessment, intraocular lens (IOL) selection, and risk evaluation. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in supporting clinical decision-making. However, existing LLMs often lack the domain-specific expertise to interpret heterogeneous ophthalmic data and provide actionable surgical plans. To enhance the model's ability to interpret heterogeneous ophthalmic reports, we propose a knowledge-driven Multi-Agent System (MAS), where each agent simulates the reasoning process of specialist ophthalmologists, converting raw clinical inputs into structured, actionable summaries in both training and deployment stages. Building on MAS, we introduce CataractSurg-80K, the first large-scale benchmark for cataract surgery planning that incorporates structured clinical reasoning. Each case is annotated with diagnostic questions, expert reasoning chains, and structured surgical recommendations. We further introduce Qwen-CSP, a domain-specialized model built on Qwen-4B, fine-tuned through a multi-stage process tailored for surgical planning. Comprehensive experiments show that Qwen-CSP outperforms strong general-purpose LLMs across multiple metrics. Our work delivers a high-quality dataset, a rigorous benchmark, and a domain-adapted LLM to facilitate future research in medical AI reasoning and decision support.</description>

      <title>Anomaly Detection in Networked Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nodes' interconnections on a social network often reflect their dependencies and information-sharing behaviors. Nevertheless, abnormal nodes, which significantly deviate from most of the network concerning patterns or behaviors, can lead to grave consequences. Therefore, it is imperative to design efficient online learning algorithms that robustly learn users' preferences while simultaneously detecting anomalies.
  We introduce a novel bandit algorithm to address this problem. Through network knowledge, the method characterizes the users' preferences and residuals of feature information. By learning and analyzing these preferences and residuals, it develops a personalized recommendation strategy for each user and simultaneously detects anomalies. We rigorously prove an upper bound on the regret of the proposed algorithm and experimentally compare it with several state-of-the-art collaborative contextual bandit algorithms on both synthetic and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>The Aegis Protocol: A Foundational Security Framework for Autonomous AI Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of autonomous AI agents marks a paradigm shift toward complex, emergent multi-agent systems. This transition introduces systemic security risks, including control-flow hijacking and cascading failures, that traditional cybersecurity paradigms are ill-equipped to address. This paper introduces the Aegis Protocol, a layered security framework designed to provide strong security guarantees for open agentic ecosystems. The protocol integrates three technological pillars: (1) non-spoofable agent identity via W3C Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs); (2) communication integrity via NIST-standardized post-quantum cryptography (PQC); and (3) verifiable, privacy-preserving policy compliance using the Halo2 zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) system. We formalize an adversary model extending Dolev-Yao for agentic threats and validate the protocol against the STRIDE framework. Our quantitative evaluation used a discrete-event simulation, calibrated against cryptographic benchmarks, to model 1,000 agents. The simulation showed a 0 percent success rate across 20,000 attack trials. For policy verification, analysis of the simulation logs reported a median proof-generation latency of 2.79 seconds, establishing a performance baseline for this class of security. While the evaluation is simulation-based and early-stage, it offers a reproducible baseline for future empirical studies and positions Aegis as a foundation for safe, scalable autonomous AI.</description>

      <title>Aggregate Fictitious Play for Learning in Anonymous Polymatrix Games (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fictitious play (FP) is a well-studied algorithm that enables agents to learn Nash equilibrium in games with certain reward structures. However, when agents have no prior knowledge of the reward functions, FP faces a major challenge: the joint action space grows exponentially with the number of agents, which slows down reward exploration. Anonymous games offer a structure that mitigates this issue. In these games, the rewards depend only on the actions taken; not on who is taking which action. Under such a structure, we introduce aggregate fictitious play (agg-FP), a variant of FP where each agent tracks the frequency of the number of other agents playing each action, rather than these agents' individual actions. We show that in anonymous polymatrix games, agg-FP converges to a Nash equilibrium under the same conditions as classical FP. In essence, by aggregating the agents' actions, we reduce the action space without losing the convergence guarantees. Using simulations, we provide empirical evidence on how this reduction accelerates convergence.</description>

      <title>Memory-R1: Enhancing Large Language Model Agents to Manage and Utilize Memories via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a wide range of NLP tasks, but they remain fundamentally stateless, constrained by limited context windows that hinder long-horizon reasoning. Recent efforts to address this limitation often augment LLMs with an external memory bank, yet most existing pipelines are static and heuristic-driven, lacking any learned mechanism for deciding what to store, update, or retrieve. We present Memory-R1, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that equips LLMs with the ability to actively manage and utilize external memory through two specialized agents: a Memory Manager that learns to perform structured memory operations {ADD, UPDATE, DELETE, NOOP}, and an Answer Agent that selects the most relevant entries and reasons over them to produce an answer. Both agents are fine-tuned with outcome-driven RL (PPO and GRPO), enabling adaptive memory management and use with minimal supervision. With as few as 152 question-answer pairs and a corresponding temporal memory bank for training, Memory-R1 outperforms the most competitive existing baseline and demonstrates strong generalization across diverse question types and LLM backbones. Beyond presenting an effective approach, this work provides insights into how RL can unlock more agentic, memory-aware behaviors in LLMs, pointing toward richer, more persistent reasoning systems.</description>

      <title>SWIRL: A Staged Workflow for Interleaved Reinforcement Learning in Mobile GUI Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of large vision language models (LVLMs) and agent systems has heightened interest in mobile GUI agents that can reliably translate natural language into interface operations. Existing single-agent approaches, however, remain limited by structural constraints. Although multi-agent systems naturally decouple different competencies, recent progress in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has often been hindered by inefficiency and remains incompatible with current LVLM architectures. To address these challenges, we introduce SWIRL, a staged workflow for interleaved reinforcement learning designed for multi-agent systems. SWIRL reformulates MARL into a sequence of single-agent reinforcement learning tasks, updating one agent at a time while keeping the others fixed. This formulation enables stable training and promotes efficient coordination across agents. Theoretically, we provide a stepwise safety bound, a cross-round monotonic improvement theorem, and convergence guarantees on return, ensuring robust and principled optimization. In application to mobile GUI control, SWIRL instantiates a Navigator that converts language and screen context into structured plans, and an Interactor that grounds these plans into executable atomic actions. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance on both high-level and low-level GUI benchmarks. Beyond GUI tasks, SWIRL also demonstrates strong capability in multi-agent mathematical reasoning, underscoring its potential as a general framework for developing efficient and robust multi-agent systems.</description>

      <title>Symphony: A Decentralized Multi-Agent Framework for Scalable Collective Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most existing Large Language Model (LLM)-based agent frameworks rely on centralized orchestration, incurring high deployment costs, rigid communication topologies, and limited adaptability. To address these challenges, we introduce Symphony, a decentralized multi-agent system which enables lightweight LLMs on consumer-grade GPUs to coordinate. Symphony introduces three key mechanisms: (1) a decentralized ledger that records capabilities, (2) a Beacon-selection protocol for dynamic task allocation, and (3) weighted result voting based on CoTs. This design forms a privacy-saving, scalable, and fault-tolerant orchestration with low overhead. Empirically, Symphony outperforms existing baselines on reasoning benchmarks, achieving substantial accuracy gains and demonstrating robustness across models of varying capacities.</description>

      <title>Self-Organizing Agent Network for LLM-based Workflow Automation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent multi-agent frameworks built upon large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex task planning. However, in real-world enterprise environments, business workflows are typically composed through modularization and reuse of numerous subprocesses, resulting in intricate workflows characterized by lengthy and deeply nested execution paths. Such complexity poses significant challenges for LLM-driven orchestration, as extended reasoning chains and state-space explosions severely impact planning effectiveness and the proper sequencing of tool invocations. Therefore, developing an orchestration method with controllable structures capable of handling multi-layer nesting becomes a critical issue. To address this, we propose a novel structure-driven orchestration framework Self-Organizing Agent Network (SOAN). SOAN incrementally builds a formalized agent network by identifying and encapsulating structural units as independent agents, enhancing modularity and clarity in orchestration. Extensive evaluations were performed using multiple benchmarks as well as a real-world enterprise workflow dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that SOAN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of adaptability, fault tolerance, and execution efficiency.</description>

      <title>DVM-SLAM: Decentralized Visual Monocular Simultaneous Localization and Mapping for Multi-Agent Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cooperative Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (C-SLAM) enables multiple agents to work together in mapping unknown environments while simultaneously estimating their own positions. This approach enhances robustness, scalability, and accuracy by sharing information between agents, reducing drift, and enabling collective exploration of larger areas. In this paper, we present Decentralized Visual Monocular SLAM (DVM-SLAM), the first open-source decentralized monocular C-SLAM system. By only utilizing low-cost and light-weight monocular vision sensors, our system is well suited for small robots and micro aerial vehicles (MAVs). DVM-SLAM's real-world applicability is validated on physical robots with a custom collision avoidance framework, showcasing its potential in real-time multi-agent autonomous navigation scenarios. We also demonstrate comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art centralized monocular C-SLAM systems. We open-source our code and provide supplementary material online.</description>

      <title>RoboTwin 2.0: A Scalable Data Generator and Benchmark with Strong Domain Randomization for Robust Bimanual Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulation-based data synthesis has emerged as a powerful paradigm for advancing real-world robotic manipulation. Yet existing datasets remain insufficient for robust bimanual manipulation due to (1) the lack of scalable task generation methods and (2) oversimplified simulation environments. We present RoboTwin 2.0, a scalable framework for automated, large-scale generation of diverse and realistic data, together with unified evaluation protocols for dual-arm manipulation. At its core is RoboTwin-OD, an object library of 731 instances across 147 categories with semantic and manipulation-relevant annotations. Building on this, we design an expert data synthesis pipeline that leverages multimodal language models (MLLMs) and simulation-in-the-loop refinement to automatically generate task-level execution code. To improve sim-to-real transfer, RoboTwin 2.0 applies structured domain randomization along five axes: clutter, lighting, background, tabletop height, and language, enhancing data diversity and policy robustness. The framework is instantiated across 50 dual-arm tasks and five robot embodiments. Empirically, it yields a 10.9% gain in code generation success rate. For downstream policy learning, a VLA model trained with synthetic data plus only 10 real demonstrations achieves a 367% relative improvement over the 10-demo baseline, while zero-shot models trained solely on synthetic data obtain a 228% gain. These results highlight the effectiveness of RoboTwin 2.0 in strengthening sim-to-real transfer and robustness to environmental variations. We release the data generator, benchmark, dataset, and code to support scalable research in robust bimanual manipulation.

      <title>Hierarchical Decentralized Stochastic Control for Cyber-Physical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22971v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a two-timescale hierarchical decentralized control architecture for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). The system consists of a global controller (GC), and N local controllers (LCs). The GC operates at a slower timescale, imposing budget constraints on the actions of LCs, which function at a faster timescale. Applications can be found in energy grid planning, wildfire management, and other decentralized resource allocation problems. We propose and analyze two optimization frameworks for this setting: COpt and FOpt. In COpt, both GC and LCs together optimize infinite-horizon discounted rewards, while in FOpt the LCs optimize finite-horizon episodic rewards, and the GC optimizes infinite-horizon rewards. Although both frameworks share identical reward functions, their differing horizons can lead to different optimal policies. In particular, FOpt grants greater autonomy to LCs by allowing their policies to be determined only by local objectives, unlike COpt. To our knowledge, these frameworks have not been studied in the literature. We establish the formulations, prove the existence of optimal policies, and prove the convergence of their value iteration algorithms. We further show that COpt always achieves a higher value function than FOpt and derive explicit bounds on their difference. Finally, we establish a set of sufficient structural conditions under which the two frameworks become equivalent.</description>
