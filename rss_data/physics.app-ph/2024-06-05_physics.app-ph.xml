      <title>Exploring Memristive Biosensing Dynamics: A COMSOL Multiphysics Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel methodology for modeling memristive biosensing within COMSOL Multiphysics, focusing on critical performance metrics such as antigen-antibody binding concentration and output resistive states. By studying the impact of increasing inlet concentrations, insights into binding concentration curve and output resistance variations are uncovered. The resultant simulation data effectively trains a support vector machine classifier (SVMC), achieving a remarkable accuracy rate of 97%. The incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) through SVM demonstrates promising strides in advancing AI-based memristive biosensing modeling, potentially elevating their performance standards and applicability across diverse domains.</description>

      <title>High-Performance Ferroelectric Field-Effect Transistors with Ultra-High Current and Carrier Densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectric field-effect transistors (FeFET) with two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor channels are promising low-power, embedded non-volatile memory (NVM) candidates for next-generation in-memory computing. However, the performance of FeFETs can be limited by a charge imbalance between the ferroelectric layer and the channel, and for low-dimensional semiconductors, also by a high contact resistance between the metal electrodes and the channel. Here, we report a significant enhancement in performance of contact-engineered FeFETs with a 2D MoS2 channel and a ferroelectric Al0.68Sc0.32N (AlScN) gate dielectric. Replacing Ti with In contact electrodes results in a fivefold increase in on-state current (~120 uA/um at 1 V) and on-to-off ratio (~2*10^7) in the FeFETs. In addition, the high carrier concentration in the MoS2 channel during the on-state (&gt; 10^14 cm^-2) facilitates the observation of a metal-to-insulator phase transition in monolayer MoS2 permitting observation of high field effect mobility (&gt; 100 cm^2V^-1s^-1) at cryogenic temperatures. Our work and devices broaden the potential of FeFETs and provides a unique platform to implement high-carrier-density transport in a 2D channel.</description>

      <title>Ultra-thin transistors and circuits for conformable electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adapting electronics to perfectly conform to non-planar and rough surfaces, such as human skin, is a very challenging task which, if solved, could open up new applications in fields of high economic and scientific interest ranging from health to robotics, wearable electronics, human-machine interface and Internet of Things. The key to success lies in defining a technology that can lead to the fabrication of ultra-thin devices while exploiting materials that are ultimately thin, with high mechanical flexibility and excellent electrical properties. Here, we report a hybrid approach for the definition of high-performance, ultra-thin and conformable electronic devices and circuits, based on the integration of ultimately thin semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC), i.e., MoS2, with organic gate dielectric material, i.e., polyvinyl formal (PVF) combined with the ink-jet printing of conductive PEDOT:PSS ink for electrodes definition. Through this cost-effective, fully bottom-up and solution-based approach, transistors and simple digital and analogue circuits are fabricated by a sequential stacking of ultrathin (nanometer) layers on a few micron thick polyimide substrate, which guarantees the high flexibility mandatory for the targeted applications.</description>

      <title>High-fidelity remote entanglement of trapped atoms mediated by time-bin photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonic interconnects between quantum processing nodes are likely the only way to achieve large-scale quantum computers and networks. The bottleneck in such an architecture is the interface between well-isolated quantum memories and flying photons. We establish high-fidelity entanglement between remotely separated trapped atomic qubit memories, mediated by photonic qubits stored in the timing of their pulses. Such time-bin encoding removes sensitivity to polarization errors, enables long-distance quantum communication, and is extensible to quantum memories with more than two states. Using a measurement-based error detection process and suppressing a fundamental source of error due to atomic recoil, we achieve an entanglement fidelity of 97% and show that fidelities beyond 99.9% are feasible.</description>

      <title>Can Entanglement-enhanced Quantum Kernels Improve Data Classification?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical machine learning, extensively utilized across diverse domains, faces limitations in speed, efficiency, parallelism, and processing of complex datasets. In contrast, quantum machine learning algorithms offer significant advantages, including exponentially faster computations, enhanced data handling capabilities, inherent parallelism, and improved optimization for complex problems. In this study, we used the entanglement-enhanced quantum kernel in quantum support vector machine to train complex respiratory data sets. Compared to classical algorithms, our findings reveal that QSVM performs better with 45% higher accuracy for complex respiratory data sets while maintaining comparable performance with linear datasets in contrast to their classical counterparts executed on a 2-qubit system. Through our study, we investigate the efficacy of the QSVM-Kernel algorithm in harnessing the enhanced dimensionality of the quantum Hilbert space for effectively training complex datasets.</description>

      <title>Diamond molecular balance: Revolutionizing high-accuracy mass spectrometry from MDa to TDa at room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The significance of mass spectrometry lies in its unparalleled ability to accurately identify and quantify molecules in complex samples, providing invaluable insights into molecular structures and interactions. Here, we leverage diamond nanostructures as highly sensitive mass sensors by utilizing a self-excitation mechanism under an electron beam in a conventional scanning electron microscope (SEM). The diamond molecular balance (DMB) exhibits exceptional mass accuracy of a few MDa and an extensive dynamic range from MDa to TDa, positioning itself as a forefront molecular balance operating at room temperature. Notably, the DMB measures the mass of a single bacteriophage T4, achieving a mass accuracy of 4.7 MDa for an analyte at 184 MDa, while precisely determining their positional information on the device. These findings highlight the groundbreaking potential of the DMB as a revolutionary tool for mass analysis at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Resonance in Strongly Coupled Inductor Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic resonance coupling (MRC) is widely used for wireless power transfer (WPT) applications, but little work has explored how MRC phenomena could be exploited for sensing applications. This paper introduces, validates and evaluates the unique multi-resonant phenomena predicted by circuit theory for over-coupled inductive arrays, and presents eigen-formulae for calculating resonant frequencies and voltage modes within passively excited arrays. Finite-element simulations and experimental results demonstrate the validity of the multi-modal resonant principles for strongly-coupled inductor arrays. The results confirm the distinctive multi-modal resonant frequencies these arrays exhibit, corresponding to the specific magnetic excitation "modes" (comparable to vibrational modes in multi-degree-of-freedom systems). The theoretical and finite element models presented offer a framework for designing and optimizing novel inductive sensing arrays, capitalizing on the unique resonant effects of over-coupling and exploiting their potential magnetic field shaping.</description>

      <title>Transient infrared nanoscopy resolves the millisecond photoswitching dynamics of single lipid vesicles in water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the biophysical and biochemical properties of molecular nanocarriers under physiological conditions and with minimal interference is crucial for advancing nanomedicine, photopharmacology, drug delivery, nanotheranostics and synthetic biology. Yet, analytical methods struggle to combine precise chemical imaging and measurements without perturbative labeling. This challenge is exemplified for azobenzene-based photoswitchable lipids, which are intriguing reagents for controlling nanocarrier properties on fast timescales, enabling, e.g., precise light-induced drug release processes. Here, we leverage the chemical recognition and high spatio-temporal resolution of scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM) to demonstrate non-destructive, label-free mid-infrared (MIR) imaging and spectroscopy of photoswitchable liposomes below the diffraction limit and the tracking of their dynamics down to 50 ms resolution. The vesicles are adsorbed on an ultrathin 10-nm SiN membrane, which separates the sample space from the tip space for stable and hour-long observations. By implementing a transient nanoscopy approach, we accurately resolve, for the first time, photoinduced changes in both the shape and the MIR spectral signature of individual vesicles and reveal abrupt change dynamics of the underlying photoisomerization process. Our findings highlight the methods potential for future studies on the complex dynamics of unlabeled nanoscale soft matter, as well as, in a broader context, for host-guest systems, energy materials or drugs.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic auxetic composite laminates: a polar approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of obtaining anisotropic auxetic composite laminates, i.e. having a negative Poisson's ratio for at least some directions, is examined in this paper. In particular, the possibility of obtaining auxeticity stacking uni-directional identical plies is considered. It is shown that if the ply is composed by isotropic matrix and fibers, then it is impossible to obtain totally auxetic orthotropic laminates, i.e. auxeticity for each direction, unless at least one among matrix and fibers is auxetic itself. Moreover, it is shown what are the conditions, in terms of the mechanical properties of the constituents and of the volume fraction of the fibers, to fabricate uni-directional plies with which to realize laminates having a negative Poisson's ratio for some directions. Several existing materials are also examined. All the analysis is done using the polar formalism, very effective for the study of plane anisotropic problems.</description>

      <title>Case studies on time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau simulations for superconducting applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The macroscopic electromagnetic properties of type II superconductors are primarily influenced by the behavior of microscopic superconducting flux quantum units. Time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) equations provide an elegant and powerful tool for describing and examining both the statics and dynamics of these superconducting entities. They have been instrumental in replicating and elucidating numerous experimental results over the past decades.This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the progress in TDGL simulations, focusing on three key aspects of superconductor applications. The initial section delves into vortex rectification in superconductors described within the TDGL framework. We specifically highlight the superconducting diode effect achieved through asymmetric pinning landscapes and the reversible manipulation of vortex ratchets with dynamic pinning landscapes. The subsequent section reviews the achievements of TDGL simulations concerning the critical current density of superconductors, emphasizing the optimization of pinning sites, particularly vortex pinning and dynamics in polycrystalline Nb$_3$Sn with grain boundaries. The third part concentrates on numerical modeling of vortex penetration and dynamics in superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities, including a discussion of superconductor insulator superconductor multilayer structures. In the last section, we present key findings, insights, and perspectives derived from the discussed simulations.</description>

      <title>Suppression of flux jumps in high-$J_c$ Nb$_3$Sn conductors by ferromagnetic layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flux jumps observed in high-$J_c$ Nb$_3$Sn conductors are urgent problems to construct high field superconducting magnets. The low-field instabilities usually reduce the current-carrying capability and thus cause the premature quench of Nb$_3$Sn coils at low magnetic field. In this paper, we explore suppressing the flux jumps by ferromagnetic (FM) layer. Firstly, we experimentally and theoretically investigate the flux jumps of Nb$_3$Sn/FM hybrid wires exposed to a magnetic field loop with constant sweeping rate. Comparing with bare Nb$_3$Sn and Nb$_3$Sn/Cu wires, we reveal two underlying mechanisms that the suppression of flux jumps is mainly attributed to the thermal effect of FM layer for the case of lower sweeping rate, whereas both thermal and electromagnetic effects play a crucial role for the case of higher sweeping rate. Furthermore, we explore the flux jumps of Nb$_3$Sn/FM hybrid wires exposed to AC magnetic fields with amplitude $B_{a0}$ and frequency $\rm\omega$. We build up the phase diagrams of flux jumps in the plane $\rm\omega$-$B_{a0}$ for bare Nb$_{3}$Sn wire, Nb$_{3}$Sn/Cu wire and Nb$_{3}$Sn/FM wire, respectively. We stress that the region of flux jumps of Nb$_{3}$Sn/FM wire is much smaller than the other two wires, which indicates that the Nb$_{3}$Sn/FM wire has significant advantage over merely increasing the heat capacity. The findings shed light on suppression of the flux jumps by utilizing FM materials, which is useful for developing new type of high-$J_c$ Nb$_{3}$Sn conductors.</description>
