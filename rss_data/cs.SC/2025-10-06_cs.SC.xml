      <title>Deducing Closed-Form Expressions for Bright-Solitons in Strongly Magnetized Plasmas with Physics Informed Symbolic Regression (PISR)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to finding analytical approximations for bright-soliton solutions in strongly magnetized plasmas. We leverage Physics-Informed Symbolic Regression (PISR) to discover closed-form expressions for the vector potential and number density profiles, governed by a reduced-order model derived from Maxwell-fluid equations. The PISR framework combines symbolic regression with physics-based constraints, boundary conditions, and available simulation data to guide the search for solutions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach by rediscovering approximate solutions consistent with previously published numerical results, showcasing the potential of PISR for reducing simulation costs of reduced-order models in plasma physics.</description>

      <title>An Exact Algorithm for Computing the Structure of Jordan Blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An efficient method is proposed for computing the structure of Jordan blocks of a matrix of integers or rational numbers by exact computation. We have given a method for computing Jordan chains of a matrix with exact computation. However, for deriving just the structure of Jordan chains, the algorithm can be reduced to increase its efficiency. We propose a modification of the algorithm for that purpose. Results of numerical experiments are given.</description>

      <title>Simulation to Rules: A Dual-VLM Framework for Formal Visual Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) show strong potential for visual planning but struggle with precise spatial and long-horizon reasoning. In contrast, Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) planners excel at long-horizon formal planning, but cannot interpret visual inputs. Recent works combine these complementary advantages by enabling VLMs to turn visual planning problems into PDDL files for formal planning. However, while VLMs can generate PDDL problem files satisfactorily, they struggle to accurately generate the PDDL domain files, which describe all the planning rules. As a result, prior methods rely on human experts to predefine domain files or on constant environment access for refinement. We propose VLMFP, a Dual-VLM-guided framework that can autonomously generate both PDDL problem and domain files for formal visual planning. VLMFP introduces two VLMs to ensure reliable PDDL file generation: A SimVLM that simulates action consequences based on input rule descriptions, and a GenVLM that generates and iteratively refines PDDL files by comparing the PDDL and SimVLM execution results. VLMFP unleashes multiple levels of generalizability: The same generated PDDL domain file works for all the different instances under the same problem, and VLMs generalize to different problems with varied appearances and rules. We evaluate VLMFP with 6 grid-world domains and test its generalization to unseen instances, appearance, and game rules. On average, SimVLM accurately describes 95.5%, 82.6% of scenarios, simulates 85.5%, 87.8% of action sequence, and judges 82.4%, 85.6% goal reaching for seen and unseen appearances, respectively. With the guidance of SimVLM, VLMFP can generate PDDL files to reach 70.0%, 54.1% valid plans for unseen instances in seen and unseen appearances, respectively.

      <title>A Novel Algorithm for Representing Positive Semi-Definite Polynomials as Sums of Squares with Rational Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel algorithm for constructing a sum-of-squares (SOS) decomposition for positive semi-definite polynomials with rational coefficients. Unlike previous methods that typically yield SOS decompositions with floating-point coefficients, our approach ensures that all coefficients in the decomposition remain rational. This is particularly useful in formal verification and symbolic computation, where exact arithmetic is required. We introduce a stepwise reduction technique that transforms a given polynomial into a sum of ladder-like squares while preserving rationality. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to existing numerical approaches. This artical is an extension of the following Chinnese paper: HUANG Yong , ZENG Zhenbing , YANG Lu , RAO Yongsheng. An Algorithm to Represent Positive Semi-Definite Polynomials to Sum of Lader-Like Squares of Polynomials with Rational Coefficients (in Chinese).
