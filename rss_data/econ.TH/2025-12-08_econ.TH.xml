      <title>The Mathematics of Income Property Valuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper surveys and generalizes the main valuation formulas used in real estate valuation and presents unified proofs. The results are otherwise scattered in obscure journals and books while the proofs are rarely available to researchers in the field. The material was originally developed so that it could be used by mathematically-trained appraisers and researchers in the former Soviet Union and in other transition economies that were starting their real estate valuation profession.
  Keywords: real estate valuations; six functions of one; Ellwood, Akerson, and Hoskold formulas; capitalization rate methods; amortization tables

      <title>Vague Knowledge: Information without Transitivity and Partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I relax the standard assumptions of transitivity and partition structure in economic models of information to formalize vague knowledge: non-transitive indistinguishability over states. I show that vague knowledge, while failing to partition the state space, remains informative by distinguishing some states from others. Moreover, it can only be faithfully expressed through vague communication with blurred boundaries. My results provide microfoundations for the prevalence of natural language communication and qualitative reasoning in the real world, where knowledge is often vague.</description>

      <title>Egyptian Ratscrew: Discovering Dominant Strategies with Computational Game Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01007v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: "Egyptian Ratscrew" (ERS) is a modern American card game enjoyed by millions of players worldwide. A game of ERS is won by collecting all of the cards in the deck. Typically this game is won by the player with the fastest reflexes, since the most common strategy for collecting cards is being the first to slap the pile in the center whenever legal combinations of cards are placed down. Most players assume that the dominant strategy is to develop a faster reaction time than your opponents, and no academic inquiry has been levied against this assumption. This thesis investigates the hypothesis that a "risk slapping" strategist who relies on practical economic decision making will win an overwhelming majority of games against players who rely on quick reflexes alone. It is theorized that this can be done by exploiting the "burn rule," a penalty that is too low-cost to effectively dissuade players from slapping illegally when it benefits them. Using the Ruby programming language, we construct an Egyptian Ratscrew simulator from scratch. Our model allows us to simulate the behavior of 8 strategically unique players within easily adjustable parameters including simulation type, player count, and burn amount. We simulate 100k iterations of 67 different ERS games, totaling 6.7 million games of ERS, and use win percentage data in order to determine which strategies are dominant under each set of parameters. We then confirm our hypothesis that risk slapping is a dominant strategy, discover that there is no strictly dominant approach to risk slapping, and elucidate a deeper understanding of different ERS mechanics such as the burn rule. Finally, we assess the implications of our findings and suggest potential improvements to the rules of the game. We also touch on the real-world applications of our research and make recommendations for the future of Egyptian Ratscrew modeling.</description>
