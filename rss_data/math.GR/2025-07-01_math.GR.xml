      <title>Abnormal and Contranormal L-Subgroups of an L-group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the concepts of abnormal and contranormal L-subgroups of an L-group have been introduced using the notion of the conjugate. Then, the properties of abnormal and contranormal L-subgroups have been studied analogous to their group-theoretic counterparts. Thereafter, several relations of abnormality and contranormality have been investigated in context of normality, maximality, normalizer and normal closure of L-subgroups of an L-group.</description>

      <title>Andrews-Curtis Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any group $G$ and integer $k\ge 2$ the Andrews-Curtis transformations act as a permutation group, termed the Andrews-Curtis group $AC_k(G)$, on the subset $N_k(G) \subset G^k$ of all $k$-tuples that generate $G$ as a normal subgroup (provided $N_k(G)$ is non-empty). The famous Andrews-Curtis Conjecture is that if $G$ is free of rank $k$, then $AC_k(G)$ acts transitively on $N_k(G)$. The set $N_k(G)$ may have a rather complex structure, so it is easier to study the full Andrews-Curtis group $FAC(G)$ generated by AC-transformations on a much simpler set $G^k$. Our goal here is to investigate the natural epimorphism $\lambda\colon FAC_k(G) \to AC_k(G)$. We show that if $G$ is non-elementary torsion-free hyperbolic, then $FAC_k(G)$ acts faithfully on every nontrivial orbit of $G^k$, hence $\lambda\colon FAC_k(G) \to AC_k(G)$ is an isomorphism.</description>

      <title>The flat semirings with nilpotent multiplicative reducts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the variety $\mathbf{NF}_3$ generated by all flat semirings with $3$-nilpotent multiplicative reducts. By introducing graph semirings, we characterize all subdirectly irreducible members of $\mathbf{NF}_3$. We prove that the variety $\mathbf{NF}_3$ has uncountably many subvarieties and show that every finitely generated subvariety of $\mathbf{NF}_3$ is a Cross variety. Moreover, we demonstrate that $\mathbf{NF}_3$ has a unique limit subvariety, which is generated by all acyclic graph semirings.</description>

      <title>Large maximal subgroups of almost simple classical groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A proper subgroup $H$ in a finite group $G$ is said to be large if $|H|^3\geq |G|$. In this paper, we determined all large maximal subgroups of almost simple classical groups. Combined with the work of Alavi and Burness (J. Algebra 421 (2015) 187--233) and Alavi, Bayat, and Daneshkhah (J. Algebraic Combin. 55 (2022) 729--779), this completes the classification of all large maximal subgroups of almost simple groups.</description>

      <title>Quasi-isometric embeddings of Ramanujan complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ramanujan complexes were defined as high dimensional analogues of the optimal expanders, Ramanujan graphs. They were constructed as quotients of the Euclidean building (also called the affine building and the Bruhat-Tits building) of $\mathrm{PGL}_d(\mathbb{F}_p((y)))$ for any prime $p$ by Lubotzky-Samuels-Vishne. We distinguish the Ramanujan complexes up to large-scale geometry. More precisely, we show that if $p$ and $q$ are distinct primes, then the associated Ramanujan complexes do not quasi-isometrically embed into one another. The main tools are the box space rigidity of Khukhro-Valette and the Euclidean building rigidity of Kleiner-Leeb and Fisher-Whyte.</description>

      <title>Yang-Baxter Equation and Related Algebraic Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the 1990s, Drinfel'd proposed the study of set-theoretical solutions to the quantum Yang-Baxter equation, initiating a line of research that has since garnered substantial attention and led to notable developments in algebra, low-dimensional topology, and related areas. This monograph offers a concise introduction to the algebraic theory of such solutions, focusing on key structures including skew braces, quandles, racks, and Rota-Baxter groups, which have emerged as central objects in this framework. We investigate the algebraic, combinatorial, and homological properties of these structures, with an emphasis on their interrelations and applications to knot theory. The monograph is intended as a reference for researchers interested in the deep interplay between these algebraic structures and the quantum Yang-Baxter equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A critically finite branched self-cover $f: (S^2, P) \to (S^2, P)$ determines naturally three iterated function systems: one on the pure mapping class group of the sphere marked at $P$, one on the Teichm\"uller space of the sphere marked at $P$, and one on a finite-dimensional real vector space. We show that contraction for any one of these systems implies contraction for the others.</description>

      <title>Externally definable fsg groups in NIP theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that every fsg group externally definable in an NIP structure is definably isomorphic to a group interpretable in it. Our proof relies on honest definitions and a group chunk result reconstructing a hyper-definable group from its multiplication given generically with respect to a translation invariant definable Keisler measure on it. We obtain related results on externally (type-)definable sets and groups, including a proof of a conjecture of Eleftheriou on fsg groups in real closed valued fields, and a description of externally definable, definably amenable subgroups of definable groups.</description>

      <title>The regular representation of Neretin groups is factorial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the left regular representation of Neretin groups is factorial, providing the first example of a non-discrete simple group with this property. This is based on a new criterion of factoriality for totally disconnected groups. For groups G satisfying the criterion, we determine the type of the factor L(G) and derive factoriality results for crossed products associated to G-actions on von Neumann algebras.</description>

      <title>The complexity of intersecting subproducts with subgroups in Cartesian powers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.06157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.06157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a finite abelian group $G$ and $t\in \mathbb{N}$, there are two natural types of subsets of the Cartesian power $G^t$; namely, Cartesian powers $S^t$ where $S$ is a subset of $G$, and (cosets of) subgroups $H$ of $G^t$. A basic question is whether two such sets intersect. In this paper, we show that this decision problem is NP-complete. Furthermore, for fixed $G$ and $S$ we give a complete classification: we determine conditions for when the problem is NP-complete, and show that in all other cases the problem is solvable in polynomial time. These theorems play a key role in the classification of algebraic decision problems in finitely generated rings developed in [Spe21].</description>

Abstract: We show that properties $F_n$ and $FP_n$ hold for a relatively hyperbolic group if and only if they hold for all the peripheral subgroups. As an application we show that there are at least countably many distinct quasi-isometry classes of one-ended groups that are type $F_n$ but not $F_{n+1}$ and similarly of type $FP_n$ and not $FP_{n+1}$ for all positive integers $n$.</description>

Abstract: By previous work of Ced\'{o}, Smoktunowicz, and Vendramin, one already knows that the analog of Gr\"{u}n's lemma fails to hold for perfect skew left braces when the socle is used as an analog of the center of a group. In this paper, we use the annihilator instead of the socle. We shall show that the analog of Gr\"{u}n's lemma holds for perfect two-sided skew braces but not in general.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and study some families of groups whose irreducible characters take values on quadratic extensions of the rationals. We focus mostly on a generalization of inverse semi-rational groups, which we call uniformly semi-rational groups. Moreover, we associate to every finite group two invariants, called rationality and semi-rationality of the group. They measure respectively how far a group is from being rational and how much uniformly rational it is. We determine the possible values that these invariants may take for finite nilpotent groups. We also classify the fields that can occur as the field generated by the character values of a finite nilpotent group.</description>

Abstract: A transitive permutation group is said to be semiprimitive if each of its normal subgroups is either semiregular or transitive.The class of semiprimitive groups properly contains primitive groups, quasiprimitive groups and innately transitive groups.The latter three classes of groups of rank $3$ have been classified, forming significant progresses on the long-standing problem of classifying permutation groups of rank $3$.In this paper, a complete classification is given of finite semiprimitive groups of rank $3$ that are not innately transitive, examples of which are certain Schur coverings of certain almost simple $2$-transitive groups, and three exceptional small groups.</description>

      <title>A completeness criterion for the common divisor graph on $p$-regular class sizes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09083v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite $p$-separable group, for some fixed prime $p$. Let $\Gamma_p(G)$ be the common divisor graph built on the set of sizes of $p$-regular conjugacy classes of $G$: this is the simple undirected graph whose vertices are the class sizes of those non-central elements of $G$ such that $p$ does not divide their order, and two distinct vertices are adjacent if and only if they are not coprime. In this note we prove that if $\Gamma_p(G)$ is a $k$-regular graph with $k\geq 1$, then it is a complete graph with $k+1$ vertices. We also pose a conjecture regarding the order of products of $p$-regular elements with coprime conjugacy class sizes, whose validity would enable to drop the $p$-separability hypothesis.</description>

Abstract: We consider Brauer's 14th Problem in the context of "Real" structures on finite groups and their antilinear representations. The problem is to count the number of characters of each different type using "group theory". While Brauer's original problem deals only with three types (real, complex and quaternionic), here we consider the ten types coming from Dyson's tenfold way.</description>

  $M$ denote an $n$-manifold of non-zero simplicial volume and
  $S$ a codimension two submanifold of $M$, then one can
  conclude that the $n$-th bounded cohomology of the fundamental group of
  $M \setminus S$ is non-zero.
  While in this note this approach is only used for degree $4$. There is no
  reason to expect that this approach and its generalizations is not suitable
  to prove the non-vanishing of higher degrees or the bounded cohomology of
  different groups as well.</description>

      <title>On the heat kernel of a Cayley graph of $\operatorname{PSL}_2\mathbb{Z}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain an explicit formula for the heat kernel on the infinite Cayley graph of the modular group $\operatorname{PSL}_2\mathbb{Z}$, given by the presentation $\langle a,b\mid a^2=1, b^3=1\rangle$. Our approach extends the method of Chung--Yau in~\cite{MR1667452} by observing that the Cayley graph strongly and regularly covers a weighted infinite line. We solve the spectral problem on this line to obtain an integral expression for its heat kernel, and then lift this to the Cayley graph using spectral transfer principles for strongly regular coverings. The explicit formula allows us to determine the Laplace spectrum, containing eigenvalues and continuous parts. As a by-product, we suggest a conjecture on the lower bound for the spectral gap of Cayley graphs of $\operatorname{PSL}_2\mathbb{F}_p$ with our generators, inspired by the analogy with Selberg's $1/4$-conjecture. Numerical evidence is provided for small primes.</description>

      <title>Dehn filling and the knot group I: Realization Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.15738v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Each $r$-Dehn filling of the exterior $E(K)$ of a knot $K$ in $S^3$ produces a $3$-manifold $K(r)$, and induces an epimorphism from the knot group $G(K) = \pi_1(E(K))$ to $\pi_1(K(r))$, which trivializes elements in its kernel. To each element $g \in G(K)$, consider all the non-trivial Dehn fillings and assign $\mathcal{S}_K(g) = \{ r \in \mathbb{Q} \mid \textrm{$r$-Dehn filling trivializes}\ g \}$ $\subset \mathbb{Q}$. Which subsets of $\mathbb{Q}$ can occur as $\mathcal{S}_K(g)$? Property P concerns this question and gives a fundamental result which asserts that the emptyset can be realized by $\mathcal{S}_K(\mu)$ for the meridian $\mu$ of $K$. Suppose that $K$ is a hyperbolic knot. Then $\mathcal{S}_K(g)$ is known to be finite for all non-trivial elements $g \in G(K)$. We prove that generically, for instance, if $K$ has no exceptional surgery, then any finite (possibly empty) family of slopes $\mathcal{R} = \{ r_1, . . . , r_n \}$ can be realized by $\mathcal{S}_K(g)$ for some element $g \in G(K)$. Furthermore, there are infinitely many, mutually non-conjugate such elements, each of which is not conjugate to any power of $g$. We also provide an example showing that the above realization property does not hold unconditionally.</description>

      <title>On the degree-two part of the associated graded of the lower central series of the Torelli group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the associated graded $\bigoplus_{k\geq 1} \Gamma_k \mathcal{I} / \Gamma_{k+1} \mathcal{I} $ of the lower central series $\mathcal{I} = \Gamma_1 \mathcal{I} \supset \Gamma_2 \mathcal{I} \supset \Gamma_3 \mathcal{I} \supset \cdots$ of the Torelli group $\mathcal{I}$ of a compact oriented surface. Its degree-one part is well-understood by D. Johnson's seminal works on the abelianization of the Torelli group. The knowledge of the degree-two part $(\Gamma_2 \mathcal{I} / \Gamma_3 \mathcal{I})\otimes \mathbb{Q}$ with rational coefficients arises from works of S. Morita on the Casson invariant and R. Hain on the Malcev completion of $\mathcal{I}$. Here, we prove that the abelian group $\Gamma_2 \mathcal{I} / \Gamma_3 \mathcal{I}$ is torsion-free, and we describe it as a lattice in a rational vector space. As an application, the group $\mathcal{I}/\Gamma_3 \mathcal{I}$ is computed, and it is shown to embed in the group of homology cylinders modulo the surgery relation of $Y_3$-equivalence.</description>

      <title>Complementation in Continuous Cohomology with Coefficients in Banach Modules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15746v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce the concept of weakly uniquely stationary representations. This framework enables us to investigate the complementability of closed subspaces within the context of continuous cohomology with coeffcients in Banach modules. As an application, we extend and refine several cohomological results from the literature, particularly in the settings of nilpotent groups, products of groups, and lattices.</description>

      <title>Fast Convolutions on $\mathbb{Z}^2\backslash SE(2)$ via Radial Translational Dependence and Classical FFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{Z}^2\backslash SE(2)$ denote the right coset space of the subgroup consisting of translational isometries of the orthogonal lattice $\mathbb{Z}^2$ in the non-Abelian group of planar motions $SE(2)$. This paper develops a fast and accurate numerical scheme for approximation of functions on $\mathbb{Z}^2\backslash SE(2)$. We address finite Fourier series of functions on the right coset space $\mathbb{Z}^2\backslash SE(2)$ using finite Fourier coefficients. The convergence/error analysis of finite Fourier coefficients are investigated. Conditions are established for the finite Fourier coefficients to converge to the Fourier coefficients. The matrix forms of the finite transforms are discussed. The implementation of the discrete method to compute numerical approximation of $SE(2)$-convolutions with functions which are radial in translations are considered. The paper is concluded by discussing capability of the numerical scheme to develop fast algorithms for approximating multiple convolutions with functions which are radial in translations.</description>

      <title>Amenability of group actions on compact spaces and the associated Banach algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08357v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a topological group $G$, amenability can be characterized by the amenability of the convolution Banach algebra $L^1(G)$. Here a Banach algebra $A$ is called amenable if every bounded derivation from $A$ into any dual--type $A$--$A$--Banach bimodule is inner. We extend this classical result to the case of discrete group actions on compact Hausdorff spaces. By introducing a Banach algebra naturally associated with the action and adopting a suitably weakened notion of amenability for Banach algebras, we obtain an analogous characterization of amenable actions. As a lemma, we also proved a fixed--point property for amenable actions that strengthens the theorem of Dong and Wang (2015).</description>

      <title>Character degrees in principal blocks for distinct primes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group of order divisible by two distinct primes $p$ and $q$. We show that $G$ possesses a non-trivial irreducible character of degree not divisible by $p$ nor $q$ lying in both the principal $p$- and $q$-block whenever $G$ is one of the following: an alternating group $\mathfrak{A}_n$, $n\geq 4$, a symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}_n$, $n\geq 3$, or a finite simple classical group of type A, B, or C, defined in characteristic distinct from $p$ and $q$. This extends earlier results of Navarro-Rizo-Schaeffer Fry for $2\in\{p,q\}$, and in particular completes the proof of an instance of a conjecture of the same authors, e.g., in the case of symmetric and alternating groups.</description>

      <title>Linear Geometry and Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14060v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linear Geometry studies geometric properties which can be expressed via the notion of a line. All information about lines is encoded in a ternary relation called a line relation. A set endowed with a line relation is called a liner. So, Linear Geometry studies liners. Imposing some additional axioms on a liner, we obtain some special classes of liners: regular, projective, affine, proaffine, etc. Linear Geometry includes Affine and Projective Geometries and is a part of Incidence Geometry. The aim of this book is to present a self-contained logical development of Linear Geometry, starting with some intuitive acceptable geometric axioms and ending with algebraic structures that necessarily arise from studying the structure of geometric objects that satisfy those simple and intuitive geometric axioms. We shall meet many quite exotic algebraic structures that arise this way: magmas, loops, ternars, quasi-fields, alternative rings, procorps, profields, etc. We strongly prefer (synthetic) geometric proofs and use tools of analytic geometry only when no purely geometric proof is available. Liner Geometry has been developed by many great mathematicians since times of Antiquity (Thales, Euclides, Proclus, Pappus), through Renaissance (Descartes, Desargues), Early Modernity (Playfair, Gauss, Lobachevski, Bolyai, Poncelet, Steiner, M\"obius), Late Modernity Times (Steinitz, Klein, Hilbert, Moufang, Hessenberg, Jordan, Beltrami, Fano, Gallucci, Veblen, Wedderburn, Lenz, Barlotti) till our contempories (Hartshorne, Hall, Buekenhout, Gleason, Kantor, Doyen, Hubault, Dembowski, Klingenberg, Grundh\"ofer).</description>
