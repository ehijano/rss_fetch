      <title>Spectral density characteristics of self-organized structuring in phase-synchronized oscillator ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-organized turbulence represents a way for structuring in nature to arise through sheer complexity rather than through linear instability theory. Simulating ensembles of oscillators that undergo phase synchronization through a propagating Kuramoto-interaction field, we present the spectral characteristics of spontaneous, self-organized structures of locally coupled oscillators. We demonstrate that the spectral density of emergent structures can exhibit universal scaling laws, in line with expectations from nature, indicating that observed statistical outcomes of complex physical interactions can be achieved through a more general principle of self-organization. We suggest that spontaneously generated structures may provide nuance to the reigning reductionist explanations for the observed structure in coupled systems of astrophysical and geophysical plasmas.</description>

      <title>Laminar chaos in systems with random and chaotically time-varying delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A type of chaos called laminar chaos was found in singularly perturbed dynamical systems with periodically [Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 084102 (2018)] and quasiperiodically [Phys. Rev. E 107, 014205 (2023)] time-varying delay. Compared to high-dimensional turbulent chaos that is typically found in such systems with large constant delay, laminar chaos is a very low-dimensional phenomenon. It is characterized by a time series with nearly constant laminar phases that are interrupted by irregular bursts, where the intensity level of the laminar phases varies chaotically from phase to phase. In this paper, we demonstrate that laminar chaos, and its generalizations, can also be observed in systems with random and chaotically time-varying delay. Moreover, while for periodic and quasiperiodic delays the appearance of (generalized) laminar chaos and turbulent chaos depends in a fractal manner on the delay parameters, it turns out that short-time correlated random and chaotic delays lead to (generalized) laminar chaos in almost the whole delay parameter space, where the properties of circle maps with quenched disorder play a crucial role. It follows that introducing such a delay variation typically leads to a drastic reduction of the dimension of the chaotic attractor of the considered systems. We investigate the dynamical properties and generalize the known methods for detecting laminar chaos in experimental time series to random and chaotically time-varying delay.</description>

      <title>Free Independence and Unitary Design from Random Matrix Product Unitaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00051v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The concept of unitary randomness underpins the modern theory of quantum chaos and fundamental tasks in quantum information. In one research direction, out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs) have recently been shown to probe freeness between Heisenberg operators, the non-commutative generalization of statistical independence. In a distinct setting, approximate unitary designs look random according to small moments and for forward-in-time protocols. Bridging these two concepts, we study the emergence of freeness in a random matrix product unitary (RMPU) ensemble, an efficient unitary design. We prove that, with only polynomial bond dimension, these unitaries reproduce Haar values of higher-order OTOCs for local, finite-trace observables -- precisely those predicted to thermalize in chaotic many-body systems according to the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. We further compute the frame potential of the RMPU ensemble, showing convergence to the Haar value also with only polynomial deviations, indicating that freeness is reached on-average for global observables. On the other hand, to reproduce freeness for traceless observables, volume-law operator entanglement is required. Our results highlight the need to refine previous notions of unitary design in the context of operator dynamics, guiding us towards protocols for quantum advantage while shedding light on the emergent complexity of chaotic many-body systems.</description>
