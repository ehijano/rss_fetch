      <title>Striving towards robust phase diversity on-sky: Implementing LIFT for VLT/MUSE-NFM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent IRLOS upgrade for VLT/MUSE narrow field mode (NFM) introduced a full-pupil mode to enhance sensitivity and sky coverage. This involved replacing the 2x2 Shack-Hartmann sensor with a single lens for full-aperture photon collection, which also enabled the engagement of the linearized focal-plane technique (LIFT) wavefront sensor instead. However, initial on-sky LIFT experiments have highlighted a complex point spread function (PSF) structure due to strong and polychromatic non-common path aberrations (NCPAs), complicating the accurate retrieval of tip-tilt and focus using LIFT. This study aims to conduct the first on-sky validation of LIFT on VLT/UT4, outline challenges encountered during the tests, and propose solutions for increasing the robustness of LIFT in on-sky operations. We developed a two-stage approach to focal-plane wavefront sensing, where tip-tilt and focus retrieval done with LIFT is preceded by the NCPA calibration step. The resulting NCPA estimate is subsequently used by LIFT. To perform the calibration, we proposed a method capable of retrieving the information about NCPAs directly from on-sky focal-plane PSFs. We verified the efficacy of this approach in simulated and on-sky tests. Our results demonstrate that adopting the two-stage approach has led to a significant improvement in the accuracy of the defocus estimation performed by LIFT, even under challenging low-flux conditions. The efficacy of LIFT as a slow and truth focus sensor in practical scenarios has been demonstrated. However, integrating NCPA calibration with LIFT is essential to verifying its practical application in the real system. Additionally, the proposed calibration step can serve as an independent and minimally invasive approach to evaluate NCPA on-sky.</description>

      <title>The verification of periodicity with the use of recurrent neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to automatically and robustly self-verify periodicity present in time-series astronomical data is becoming more important as data sets rapidly increase in size. The age of large astronomical surveys has rendered manual inspection of time-series data less practical. Previous efforts in generating a false alarm probability to verify the periodicity of stars have been aimed towards the analysis of a constructed periodogram. However, these methods feature correlations with features that do not pertain to periodicity, such as light curve shape, slow trends and stochastic variability. The common assumption that photometric errors are Gaussian and well determined is also a limitation of analytic methods. We present a novel machine learning based technique which directly analyses the phase folded light curve for its false alarm probability. We show that the results of this method are largely insensitive to the shape of the light curve, and we establish minimum values for the number of data points and the amplitude to noise ratio.</description>

      <title>Technical requirements flow-down for the concept design of the novel 50-meter Atacama Large Aperture Submm Telescope (AtLAST)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Atacama Large Aperture Submm Telescope (AtLAST) is a concept for a novel 50-meter class single-dish telescope operating at sub-millimeter and millimeter wavelengths (30-950 GHz). The telescope will provide an unprecedentedly wide field of view (FoV) of 1-2 degree diameter with a large receiver cabin housing six major instruments in Nasmyth and Cassegrain positions. The high observing frequencies, combined with the scanning operation movements with up to 3 deg/second, place high demands on the accuracy and stability of the optical and structural components. The design features the introduction of a rocking chair type mount with an iso-statically decoupled main reflector backup structure and an active main reflector surface with a high precision metrology system. The planned site location is in the Chilean Atacama Desert at approximately 5050 meters above sea level, near Llano de Chajnantor. This paper gives an overview of the optical, structural, and mechanical design concepts. It explains the flow-down from key science requirements to technical design decisions as well as showing design analogies from other existing large radio, (sub-)mm, and optical telescopes.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Optics with dLux I: Deep calibration of Flat Field and Phase Retrieval with Automatic Differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sensitivity limits of space telescopes are imposed by uncalibrated errors in the point spread function, photon-noise, background light, and detector sensitivity. These are typically calibrated with specialized wavefront sensor hardware and with flat fields obtained on the ground or with calibration sources, but these leave vulnerabilities to residual time-varying or non-common path aberrations and variations in the detector conditions. It is therefore desirable to infer these from science data alone, facing the prohibitively high dimensional problems of phase retrieval and pixel-level calibration. We introduce a new Python package for physical optics simulation, dLux, which uses the machine learning framework JAX to achieve GPU acceleration and automatic differentiation (autodiff), and apply this to simulating astronomical imaging. In this first of a series of papers, we show that gradient descent enabled by autodiff can be used to simultaneously perform phase retrieval and calibration of detector sensitivity, scaling efficiently to inferring millions of parameters. This new framework enables high dimensional optimization and inference in data analysis and hardware design in astronomy and beyond, which we explore in subsequent papers in this series.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Optics with dLux II: Optical Design Maximising Fisher Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of astronomical hardware operating at the diffraction limit requires optimization of physical optical simulations of the instrument with respect to desired figures of merit, such as throughput or astrometric accuracy. These systems can be high dimensional, with highly nonlinear relationships between outputs and the adjustable parameters of the hardware. In this series of papers we present and apply dLux, an open-source end-to-end differentiable optical modelling framework. Automatic differentiation enables not just efficient high-dimensional optimization of astronomical hardware designs, but also Bayesian experimental design directly targeting the precision of experimental outcomes. Automatic second derivatives enable the exact and numerically stable calculation of parameter covariance forecasts, and higher derivatives of these enable direct optimization of these forecasts. We validate this method against analytic theory and illustrate its utility in evaluating the astrometric precision of a parametrized telescope model, and the design of a diffractive pupil to achieve optimal astrometric performance for exoplanet searches. The source code and tutorial software are open source and publicly available, targeting researchers who may wish to harness dLux for their own optical simulation problems.</description>

      <title>Optimising an Array of Cherenkov Telescopes in Australia for the Detection of TeV Gamma-Ray Transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As TeV gamma-ray astronomy progresses into the era of the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), instantaneously following up on gamma-ray transients is becoming more important than ever. To this end, a worldwide network of Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes has been proposed. Australia is ideally suited to provide coverage of part of the Southern Hemisphere sky inaccessible to H.E.S.S. in Namibia and the upcoming CTA-South in Chile. This study assesses the sources detectable by a small, transient-focused array in Australia based on CTA telescope designs. The TeV emission of extragalactic sources (including the majority of gamma-ray transients) can suffer significant absorption by the extragalactic background light. As such, we explored the improvements possible by implementing stereoscopic and topological triggers, as well as lowered image cleaning thresholds, to access lower energies. We modelled flaring gamma-ray sources based on past measurements from the satellite-based gamma-ray telescope Fermi-LAT. We estimate that an array of four Medium-Sized Telescopes (MSTs) would detect $\sim$24 active galactic nucleus flares &gt;5$\sigma$ per year, up to a redshift of $z\approx1.5$. Two MSTs achieved $\sim$80-90% of the detections of four MSTs. The modelled Galactic transients were detectable within the observation time of one night, 11 of the 21 modelled gamma-ray bursts were detectable, as were $\sim$10% of unidentified transients. An array of MST-class telescopes would thus be a valuable complementary telescope array for transient TeV gamma-ray astronomy.</description>

      <title>E(2)-Equivariant Features in Machine Learning for Morphological Classification of Radio Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the growth of data from new radio telescope facilities, machine-learning approaches to the morphological classification of radio galaxies are increasingly being utilised. However, while widely employed deep-learning models using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are equivariant to translations within images, neither CNNs nor most other machine-learning approaches are equivariant to additional isometries of the Euclidean plane, such as rotations and reflections. Recent work has attempted to address this by using G-steerable CNNs, designed to be equivariant to a specified subset of 2-dimensional Euclidean, E(2), transformations. Although this approach improved model performance, the computational costs were a recognised drawback. Here we consider the use of directly extracted E(2)-equivariant features for the classification of radio galaxies. Specifically, we investigate the use of Minkowski functionals (MFs), Haralick features (HFs) and elliptical Fourier descriptors (EFDs). We show that, while these features do not perform equivalently well to CNNs in terms of accuracy, they are able to inform the classification of radio galaxies, requiring ~50 times less computational runtime. We demonstrate that MFs are the most informative, EFDs the least informative, and show that combinations of all three result in only incrementally improved performance, which we suggest is due to information overlap between feature sets.</description>

      <title>fast-resolve: Fast Bayesian Radio Interferometric Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Interferometric imaging is algorithmically and computationally challenging as there is no unique inversion from the measurement data back to the sky maps, and the datasets can be very large. Many imaging methods already exist, but most of them focus either on the accuracy or the computational aspect. Aims: This paper aims to reduce the computational complexity of the Bayesian imaging algorithm resolve, enabling the application of Bayesian imaging for larger datasets. Methods: By combining computational shortcuts of the CLEAN algorithm with the Bayesian imaging algorithm resolve we developed an accurate and fast imaging algorithm which we name fast-resolve. Results: We validate the accuracy of the presented fast-resolve algorithm by comparing it with results from resolve on VLA Cygnus A data. Furthermore, we demonstrate the computational advantages of fast-resolve on a large MeerKAT ESO 137-006 dataset which is computationally out of reach for resolve. Conclusions: The presented algorithm is significantly faster than previous Bayesian imaging algorithms, broadening the applicability of Bayesian interferometric imaging. Specifically for the single channel VLA Cygnus A datasets fast-resolve is about $144$ times faster than resolve. For the MeerKAT dataset with multiple channels the computational speedup of fast-resolve is even larger.</description>

      <title>Measuring the CMB spectral distortions with COSMO: the multi-mode antenna system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present the design and manufacturing of the two multi-mode antenna arrays of the COSMO experiment and the preliminary beam pattern measurements of their fundamental mode compared with simulations.
  COSMO is a cryogenic Martin-Puplett Fourier Transform Spectrometer that aims at measuring the isotropic y-type spectral distortion of the Cosmic Microwave Background from Antarctica, by performing differential measurements between the sky and an internal, cryogenic reference blackbody. To reduce the atmospheric contribution, a spinning wedge mirror performs fast sky-dips at varying elevations while fast, low-noise Kinetic Inductance detectors scan the interferogram.
  Two arrays of antennas couple the radiation to the detectors. Each array consists of nine smooth-walled multi-mode feed-horns, operating in the $120-180$ GHz and $210-300$ GHz range, respectively. The multi-mode propagation helps increase the instrumental sensitivity without employing large focal planes with hundreds of detectors. The two arrays have a step-linear and a linear profile, respectively, and are obtained by superimposing aluminum plates made with CNC milling. The simulated multi-mode beam pattern has a $\sim 20^{\circ} - 26^{\circ}$ FWHM for the low-frequency array and $\sim 16^{\circ}$ FWHM for the high-frequency one. The side lobes are below $-15$ dB.
  To characterize the antenna response, we measured the beam pattern of the fundamental mode using a Vector Network Analyzer, in far-field conditions inside an anechoic chamber at room temperature. We completed the measurements of the low-frequency array and found a good agreement with the simulations. We also identified a few non-idealities that we attribute to the measuring setup and will further investigate. A comprehensive multi-mode measurement will be feasible at cryogenic temperature once the full receiver is integrated.</description>

      <title>Investigating Mutual Coupling in the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array and Mitigating its Effects on the 21-cm Power Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interferometric experiments designed to detect the highly redshifted 21-cm signal from neutral hydrogen are producing increasingly stringent constraints on the 21-cm power spectrum, but some k-modes remain systematics-dominated. Mutual coupling is a major systematic that must be overcome in order to detect the 21-cm signal, and simulations that reproduce effects seen in the data can guide strategies for mitigating mutual coupling. In this paper, we analyse 12 nights of data from the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array and compare the data against simulations that include a computationally efficient and physically motivated semi-analytic treatment of mutual coupling. We find that simulated coupling features qualitatively agree with coupling features in the data; however, coupling features in the data are brighter than the simulated features, indicating the presence of additional coupling mechanisms not captured by our model. We explore the use of fringe-rate filters as mutual coupling mitigation tools and use our simulations to investigate the effects of mutual coupling on a simulated cosmological 21-cm power spectrum in a "worst case" scenario where the foregrounds are particularly bright. We find that mutual coupling contaminates a large portion of the "EoR Window", and the contamination is several orders-of-magnitude larger than our simulated cosmic signal across a wide range of cosmological Fourier modes. While our fiducial fringe-rate filtering strategy reduces mutual coupling by roughly a factor of 100 in power, a non-negligible amount of coupling cannot be excised with fringe-rate filters, so more sophisticated mitigation strategies are required.</description>

      <title>Composition Tracking for Collisions Between Differentiated Bodies in REBOUND</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previous research suggests that impacts between planetary embryos and planetesimals during the late stages of planet formation can often determine the percentages of core and mantle material that compose the newly formed planets in a system. Previous studies have attempted to include the composition-changing effects of these collisions in N-body simulations of planet formation, often as post-processing codes. In this paper, we present the Differentiated Body Composition Tracker, a new post-processing tool that uses collisional data collected from the N-body integrator REBOUND to determine the amount of core and mantle material that is transferred between colliding objects and the resulting fragments during an impact. We demonstrate how this code works using the data from 50 REBOUND simulations of planet formation and explore how the parameters in the code affect the core mass fractions of the remaining objects from these simulations. We then investigate how non-uniform distributions of core material across an initial disc affect the final core mass fractions of planets. Under ideal conditions, we find that a combination of giant impacts and planetary embryos enriched in core material could create some of the iron-rich planets that have been discovered.</description>

      <title>Measuring gravitational wave memory with LISA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) astronomy has revolutionized our capacity to explore nature. The next generation of observatories, among which the space-borne detector Laser Interferometer Space Antenna LISA, is expected to yield orders of magnitude of signal-to-noise ratio improvement, and reach fainter and novel features of General Relativity. Among them, an exciting possibility is the detection of GW memory. Interpreted as a permanent deformation of the background spacetime after a GW perturbation has passed through the detector, GW memory offers a novel avenue to proof-test General Relativity, access the non-linear nature of gravity, and provide complementary information for a better characterization of the GW source. Previous studies have shown that GW memory detection from individual mergers of massive black hole binaries is expected with LISA. However, these works have not simulated the proper time domain response of the detector to the GW memory. This work is filling this gap and presents the detection prospects of LISA regarding GW memory and the expected signature of GW memory on the data-streams using the most up-to-date LISA consortium simulations of the response, as well as GW memory time-series computation inherited from numerical relativity. We will confront the LISA observation window to massive black hole binary mergers' population forecasted with the state-of-the-art population models and evaluate the odds and the expected accuracies regarding GW memory observations in the LISA lifetime. We conclude that GW memory will be a key feature of several events detected by LISA, and will help to exploit the scientific potential of the mission fully.</description>

Abstract: As JWST begins to return observations, it is more important than ever that exoplanet climate models can consistently and correctly predict the observability of exoplanets, retrieval of their data, and interpretation of planetary environments from that data. Model intercomparisons play a crucial role in this context, especially now when few data are available to validate model predictions. The CUISINES Working Group of NASA's Nexus for Exoplanet System Science (NExSS) supports a systematic approach to evaluating the performance of exoplanet models, and provides here a framework for conducting community-organized exoplanet Model Intercomparison Projects (exoMIPs). The CUISINES framework adapts Earth climate community practices specifically for the needs of exoplanet researchers, encompassing a range of model types, planetary targets, and parameter space studies. It is intended to help researchers to work collectively, equitably, and openly toward common goals. The CUISINES framework rests on five principles: 1) Define in advance what research question(s) the exoMIP is intended to address. 2) Create an experimental design that maximizes community participation, and advertise it widely. 3) Plan a project timeline that allows all exoMIP members to participate fully. 4) Generate data products from model output for direct comparison to observations. 5) Create a data management plan that is workable in the present and scalable for the future. Within the first years of its existence, CUISINES is already providing logistical support to 10 exoMIPs, and will continue to host annual workshops for further community feedback and presentation of new exoMIP ideas.</description>

      <title>General relativistic force-free electrodynamics with a discontinuous Galerkin-finite difference hybrid method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01531</link>

Abstract: Relativistic plasmas around compact objects can sometimes be approximated as being force-free. In this limit, the plasma inertia is negligible and the overall dynamics is governed by global electric currents. We present a novel numerical approach for simulating such force-free plasmas, which allows for high accuracy in smooth regions as well as capturing dissipation in current sheets. Using a high-order accurate discontinuous Galerkin method augmented with a conservative finite-difference method, we demonstrate efficient global simulations of black hole and neutron star magnetospheres. In addition to a series of challenging test problems, we show that our approach can-depending on the physical properties of the system and the numerical implementation-be up to 10x more efficient than conventional simulations, with a speedup of 2-3x for most problems we consider in practice.</description>

      <title>Data quality control system and long-term performance monitor of the LHAASO-KM2A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11826v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The KM2A is the largest sub-array of the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). It consists of 5216 electromagnetic particle detectors (EDs) and 1188 muon detectors (MDs). The data recorded by the EDs and MDs are used to reconstruct primary information of cosmic ray and gamma-ray showers. This information is used for physical analysis in gamma-ray astronomy and cosmic ray physics. To ensure the reliability of the LHAASO-KM2A data, a three-level quality control system has been established. It is used to monitor the status of detector units, stability of reconstructed parameters and the performance of the array based on observations of the Crab Nebula and Moon shadow. This paper will introduce the control system and its application on the LHAASO-KM2A data collected from August 2021 to July 2023. During this period, the pointing and angular resolution of the array were stable. From the observations of the Moon shadow and Crab Nebula, the results achieved using the two methods are consistent with each other. According to the observation of the Crab Nebula at energies from 25 TeV to 100 TeV, the time averaged pointing errors are estimated to be $-0.003^{\circ} \pm 0.005^{\circ}$ and $0.001^{\circ} \pm 0.006^{\circ}$ in the R.A. and Dec directions, respectively.</description>

      <title>NIRPS first light and early science: breaking the 1 m/s RV precision barrier at infrared wavelengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Near-InfraRed Planet Searcher or NIRPS is a precision radial velocity spectrograph developed through collaborative efforts among laboratories in Switzerland, Canada, Brazil, France, Portugal and Spain. NIRPS extends to the 0.98-1.8 $\mu$m domain of the pioneering HARPS instrument at the La Silla 3.6-m telescope in Chile and it has achieved unparalleled precision, measuring stellar radial velocities in the infrared with accuracy better than 1 m/s. NIRPS can be used either stand-alone or simultaneously with HARPS. Commissioned in late 2022 and early 2023, NIRPS embarked on a 5-year Guaranteed Time Observation (GTO) program in April 2023, spanning 720 observing nights. This program focuses on planetary systems around M dwarfs, encompassing both the immediate solar vicinity and transit follow-ups, alongside transit and emission spectroscopy observations. We highlight NIRPS's current performances and the insights gained during its deployment at the telescope. The lessons learned and successes achieved contribute to the ongoing advancement of precision radial velocity measurements and high spectral fidelity, further solidifying NIRPS' role in the forefront of the field of exoplanets.</description>

      <title>The Potential of Water-Cherenkov Air Shower Arrays for detecting transient sources of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We highlight the capacity of current and forthcoming air shower arrays using water-Cherenkov stations to detect neutrino events spanning energies from $10\,$GeV to $100\,$TeV. This detection approach leverages individual stations equipped with both bottom and top photosensors, making use of features of the signal time trace and machine learning techniques. Our findings demonstrate the complementary of this method to established and future neutrino-detection experiments, including IceCube and the upcoming Hyper-Kamiokande experiment.</description>

      <title>Searches for Compact Binary Coalescence Events Using Neural Networks in LIGO/Virgo Third Observation Period</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12912v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the results on the search for the coalescence of compact binary mergers using convolutional neural networks and the LIGO/Virgo data for the O3 observation period. Two-dimensional images in time and frequency are used as input. The analysis is performed in three separate mass regions covering the range for the masses in the binary system from 0.2 to 100 solar masses, excluding very asymmetric mass configurations. We explore neural networks trained with input information from pairs of interferometers or all three interferometers together, concluding that the use of the maximum information available leads to an improved performance. A scan over the O3 data set, using the convolutional neural networks, is performed with different fake rate thresholds for claiming detection of at most one event per year or at most one event per week. The latter would correspond to a loose online selection still leading to affordable fake alarm rates. The efficiency of the neutral networks to detect the O3 catalog events is discussed. In the case of a fake rate threshold of at most one event per week, the scan leads to the detection of about 50% of the O3 catalog events. Once the search is limited to the catalog events within the mass range used for neural networks training, the detection efficiency increases up to 70%. A further improvement in the search efficiency, using the same kind of algorithms, will require the implementation of new criteria for the suppression of detector glitches.</description>

      <title>Follow-up LOFAR observations of the $\tau$ Bo\"{o}tis exoplanetary system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context. Observing the radio emission from exoplanets is among the most promising methods to detect their magnetic fields and a measurement of an exoplanetary magnetic field will help constrain the planet's interior structure, star-planet interactions, atmospheric escape and dynamics, and habitability. Recently, circularly polarized bursty and slow emission from the $\tau$ Bo\"{o}tis ($\tau$ Boo) exoplanetary system was tentatively detected using LOFAR (LOW-Frequency ARray) beamformed observations. If confirmed, this detection will be a major contribution to exoplanet science. However, follow-up observations are required to confirm this detection.
  Aims. Here, we present such follow-up observations of the $\tau$ Boo system using LOFAR. These observations cover 70$\%$ of the orbital period of $\tau$ Boo b including the orbital phases of the previous tentative detections.
  Methods. We used the BOREALIS pipeline to mitigate radio frequency interference and to search for bursty and slowing varying radio signals. BOREALIS was previously used to find the tentative radio signals from $\tau$ Boo.
  Results. Our new observations do not show any signs of bursty or slow emission from the $\tau$ Bo\"{o}tis exoplanetary system.
  Conclusions. The cause for our non-detection is currently degenerate. It is possible that the tentative radio signals were an unknown instrumental systematic or that we are observing variability in the planetary radio emission due to changes in its host star. More radio data (preferably multi-site) and ancillary observations (e.g. magnetic maps) are required to further investigate the potential radio emission from the $\tau$ Bo\"{o}tis exoplanetary system.</description>

      <title>Binary asteroid candidates in Gaia DR3 astrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Asteroids with companions constitute an excellent sample for studying the collisional and dynamical evolution of minor planets. The currently known binary population were discovered by different complementary techniques that produce, for the moment, a strongly biased distribution, especially in a range of intermediate asteroid sizes (approximately 20 to 100 km) where both mutual photometric events and high-resolution adaptive optic imaging are poorly efficient. A totally independent technique of binary asteroid discovery, based on astrometry, can help to reveal new binary systems and populate a range of sizes and separations that remain nearly unexplored. In this work, we describe a dedicated period detection method and its results for the Gaia DR3 data set. This method looks for the presence of a periodic signature in the orbit post-fit residuals. After conservative filtering and validation based on statistical and physical criteria, we are able to present a first sample of astrometric binary candidates, to be confirmed by other observation techniques such as photometric light curves and stellar occultations.</description>
