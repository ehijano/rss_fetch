      <title>Between equilibrium and fluctuation: Einstein's heuristic argument and Boltzmann's principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We critically revisit Einstein's 1905 heuristic argument for lightquanta, considering its internal coherence and the scope of its applicability. We argue that Einstein's reasoning, often celebrated for its originality, is ambiguous because it can be understood as a fluctuation or as a comparison between equilibrium states. A historical and conceptual analysis of Einstein's use of Boltzmann's principle in those years reveals his evolving stance on its meaning and the role of probability, as well as his persistent doubts about the nature of radiation. We use our analysis to examine the limitations of extending the notion of Einstein's lightquanta across the electromagnetic spectrum: the relevant parameter is not the frequency, but the occupancy number.</description>

      <title>Why do we do astrophysics?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At time of writing, large language models (LLMs) are beginning to obtain the ability to design, execute, write up, and referee scientific projects on the data-science side of astrophysics. What implications does this have for our profession? In this white paper, I list - and argue for - a set of facts or "points of agreement" about what astrophysics is, or should be; these include considerations of novelty, people-centrism, trust, and (the lack of) clinical value. I then list and discuss every possible benefit that astrophysics can be seen as bringing to us, and to science, and to universities, and to the world; these include considerations of love, weaponry, and personal (and personnel) development. I conclude with a discussion of two possible (extreme and bad) policy recommendations related to the use of LLMs in astrophysics, dubbed "let-them-cook" and "ban-and-punish." I argue strongly against both of these; it is not going to be easy to develop or adopt good moderate policies.</description>

      <title>Pilot-Wave Theories as Hidden Markov Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The original version of the de Broglie-Bohm pilot-wave theory, also called Bohmian mechanics, attempted to treat the wave function or pilot wave as a part of the physical ontology of nature. More recent versions of the de Broglie-Bohm theory appearing in the last few decades have tried to regard the pilot wave instead as an aspect of the theory's nomology, or dynamical laws. This paper argues that neither of these views is correct, and that the de Broglie-Bohm pilot wave is best understood as a collection of latent variables in the sense of a hidden Markov model, a construct that was not available when de Broglie and Bohm originally formulated what became their pilot-wave theory. This paper also discusses several other challenges for the ontological view of the pilot wave. One such challenge is due to Foldy-Wouthuysen gauge transformations, which connect up with the Deotto-Ghirardi ambiguity in the de Broglie-Bohm theory. Another challenge arises from the freedom to carry out canonical transformations in the wave function's own notion of phase space, as defined by Strocchi and Heslot.</description>
