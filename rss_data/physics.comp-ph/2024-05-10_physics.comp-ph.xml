      <title>GCMe: Efficient implementation of the Gaussian core model with smeared electrostatic interactions for molecular dynamics simulations of soft matter systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08148</link>

Abstract: In recent years, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have emerged as a pivotal tool for understanding the structure, dynamics, and phase behavior in charged soft matter systems. To explore phenomena across greater length and time scales in MD simulations, molecules are often coarse-grained for better computational performance. However, commonly-used force fields represent particles as hard-core interaction centers with point charges, which often overemphasizes the packing effect and short-range electrostatics, especially in systems with bulky deformable organic molecules and systems with strong coarse-graining. This underscores the need for an efficient soft-core model to physically capture the effective interactions between coarse-grained particles. To this end, we implement a soft-core model uniting the Gaussian core model with smeared electrostatic interactions that is phenomenologically equivalent to recent theoretical models. We first parameterize it generically using water as the model solvent. Then, we benchmark its performance in the OpenMM toolkit for different boundary conditions to highlight a computational speedup of up to $34\times$ compared to commonly used force fields and existing implementations. Finally, we demonstrate its utility by investigating how boundary polarizability affects the adsorption behavior of a polyelectrolyte solution on perfectly conducting and nonmetal electrodes.</description>

      <title>Understanding solid nitrogen through machine learning simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a fast, transferable, general purpose, machine-learning interatomic potential suitable for large-scale simulations of $N_2$. The potential is trained only on high quality quantum chemical molecule-molecule interactions, no condensed phase information is used. The potential reproduces the experimental phase diagram including the melt curve and the molecular solid phases of nitrogen up to 10 GPa. This demonstrates that many-molecule interactions are unnecessary to explain the condensed phases of $N_2$. With increased pressure, transitions are observed from cubic ($\alpha-N_2$), which optimises quadrupole-quadrupole interactions, through tetragonal ($\gamma-N_2$) which allows more efficient packing, through to monoclinic ($\lambda-N_2$) which packs still more efficiently. On heating, we obtain the hcp 3D rotor phase ($\beta-N_2$) and, at pressure, the cubic $\delta-N_2$ phase which contains both 3D and 2D rotors, tetragonal $\delta^\star-N_2$ phase with 2D rotors and the rhombohedral $\epsilon-N_2$. Molecular dynamics demonstrates where these phases are indeed rotors, rather than frustrated order. The model does not support the existence of the wide range of bondlengths reported for the complex $\iota-N_2$ phase. The thermodynamic transitions involve both shifts of molecular centres and rotations of molecules. We simulate these phase transitions between finding that the onset of rotation is rapid whereas motion of molecular centres is inhibited and the cause of the observed sluggishness of transitions. Routine density functional theory calculations give a similar picture to the potential.</description>

      <title>Fast, high-order numerical evaluation of volume potentials via polynomial density interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.03844v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article presents a high-order accurate numerical method for the evaluation of singular volume integral operators, with attention focused on operators associated with the Poisson and Helmholtz equations in two dimensions. Following the ideas of the density interpolation method for boundary integral operators, the proposed methodology leverages Green's third identity and a local polynomial interpolant of the density function to recast the volume potential as a sum of single- and double-layer potentials and a volume integral with a regularized (bounded or smoother) integrand. The layer potentials can be accurately and efficiently evaluated everywhere in the plane by means of existing methods (e.g. the density interpolation method), while the regularized volume integral can be accurately evaluated by applying elementary quadrature rules. Compared to straightforwardly computing corrections for every singular and nearly-singular volume target, the method significantly reduces the amount of required specialized quadrature by pushing all singular and near-singular corrections to near-singular layer-potential evaluations at target points in a small neighborhood of the domain boundary. Error estimates for the regularization and quadrature approximations are provided. The method is compatible with well-established fast algorithms, being both efficient not only in the online phase but also to set-up. Numerical examples demonstrate the high-order accuracy and efficiency of the proposed methodology; applications to inhomogeneous scattering are presented.</description>

      <title>Quantum Classical Algorithm for the Study of Phase Transitions in the Hubbard Model via Dynamical Mean-Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating quantum many-body systems is believed to be one of the most promising applications of near-term noisy quantum computers. However, in the near term, system size limitation will remain a severe barrier for applications in materials science or strongly correlated systems. A promising avenue of research is to combine many-body physics with machine learning for the classification of distinct phases. In this paper, we propose a workflow that synergizes quantum computing, many-body theory, and quantum machine learning(QML) for studying strongly correlated systems. In particular, it can capture a putative quantum phase transition of the stereotypical strongly correlated system, the Hubbard model. Following the recent proposal of the hybrid classical-quantum algorithm for the two-site dynamical mean-field theory(DMFT), we present a modification that allows the self-consistent solution of the single bath site DMFT. The modified algorithm can easily be generalized for multiple bath sites. This approach is used to generate a database of zero-temperature wavefunctions of the Hubbard model within the DMFT approximation. We then use a QML algorithm to distinguish between the metallic phase and the Mott insulator phase to capture the metal-to-Mott insulator phase transition. We train a quantum convolutional neural network(QCNN) and then utilize the QCNN as a quantum classifier to capture the phase transition region. This work provides a recipe for application to other phase transitions in strongly correlated systems and represents an exciting application of small-scale quantum devices realizable with near-term technology.</description>

      <title>AniMAIRE - A New Openly Available Tool for Calculating Atmospheric Ionising Radiation Dose Rates and Single Event Effects During Anisotropic Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AniMAIRE (Anisotropic Model for Atmospheric Ionising Radiation Effects) is a new model and Python toolkit for calculating radiation dose rates experienced by aircraft during anisotropic solar energetic particle events. AniMAIRE expands the physics of the MAIRE+ model such that dose rate calculations can be performed for anisotropic solar energetic particle conditions by supplying a proton or alpha particle rigidity spectrum, a pitch angle distribution, and the conditions of Earth's magnetosphere. In this paper, we describe the algorithm and top-level structure of AniMAIRE and showcase AniMAIRE's capabilities by analysing the dose rate maps that AniMAIRE produces when the time-dependent spectra and pitch angle distribution for GLE71 are inputted. We find that the dose rates AniMAIRE produces for the event fall between the dose rates produced by the WASAVIES and CRAC:DOMO models. Dose rate maps that evolve throughout the event are also shown, and it is found that each peak in the inputted pitch angle distribution generates a dose rate hotspot in each of the polar regions. AniMAIRE has been made available openly online so that it can be downloaded and run freely on local machines and so that the space weather community can easily contribute to it using Github forking.</description>

      <title>Comparison of two different integration methods for the (1+1)-Dimensional Schr\"odinger-Poisson Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compare two different numerical methods to integrate in time spatially delocalized initial densities using the Schr\"odinger-Poisson equation system as the evolution law. The basic equation is a nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with an auto-gravitating potential created by the wave function density itself. The latter is determined as a solution of Poisson's equation modelling, e.g., non-relativistic gravity. For reasons of complexity, we treat a one-dimensional version of the problem whose numerical integration is still challenging because of the extreme long-range forces (being constant in the asymptotic limit). Both of our methods, a Strang splitting scheme and a basis function approach using B-splines, are compared in numerical convergence and effectivity. Overall, our Strang-splitting evolution compares favourably with the B-spline method. In particular, by using an adaptive time-stepper rather large one-dimensional boxes can be treated. These results give hope for extensions to two spatial dimensions for not too small boxes and large evolution times necessary for describing, for instance, dark matter formation over cosmologically relevant scales.</description>
