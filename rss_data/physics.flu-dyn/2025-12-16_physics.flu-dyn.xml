      <title>Reduced-Order Hydrodynamic Modelling of a Sphere Near a Wall Using Sparse Regression and Neural Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents an interpretable parametric surrogate model motivated by the need to identify a hydrodynamic model for resolving the trajectory of an object in real-time. The surrogate is formulated as a reduced-order model for a canonical configuration in which a one-degree-of-freedom heaving sphere operates near a vertical wall. High-fidelity CFD simulations are used to generate a parametric dataset of heave-decay responses over varying wall distances (WD) and drop heights (DH). Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) is then applied to each CFD trajectory to identify a low-order nonlinear ordinary differential equation (ODE) with polynomial terms representing effective hydrostatic restoring and radiation damping, and the harmonic terms representing the wave-induced excitation forces. The SINDy identified coefficients are then used as a prior constraint in a neural operator network (ONet) that learns a smooth mapping from wall distance and drop height to the ODE coefficients, yielding a surrogate capable of predicting dynamics at arbitrary points in the input space without rerunning expensive CFD calculations. The resulting surrogate reproduces CFD heave-decay responses with near-optimal accuracy given the limiting assumptions while being capable of running in real time. The approach provides a practical pathway toward real-time, physics-informed surrogate modelling for launch-and-recovery operations.</description>

      <title>The role of the second normal stress difference in rod-climbing effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Weissenberg (rod-climbing) effect, i.e., the rise of a viscoelastic fluid along a thin rotating rod, has long served as a canonical demonstration of elasticity and normal-stress differences in complex fluids. The effect is most commonly attributed to the first normal stress difference $N_{1}$, which induces tensile hoop stresses that draw fluid upward along the rod. The second normal stress difference $N_{2}$, in contrast, is often presumed negligible or dynamically unimportant. However, many polymer solutions and industrial fluids, such as suspensions, exhibit $N_{2}$ of appreciable magnitude, and modern constitutive models predict that it can significantly modify free-surface stresses and thereby the climbing behaviour. In this work, we perform high-resolution axisymmetric simulations of the Linear Phan--Thien--Tanner (LPTT) model to systematically isolate the influence of $N_{2}$ on rod climbing. We show that increasing the magnitude of $N_{2}$ progressively weakens the climbing response and ultimately reverses it, producing rod-descending once the normal-stress ratio exceeds a critical value $\psi_{0}\approx 0.25$. Larger $N_{2}$ also destabilises the flow, promoting early onset (in terms of the rotation speed) of bubble formation, subcritical Hopf oscillations, and fully asymmetric three-dimensional motion that culminates in rupture. By mapping these regimes in the $(Wi,\psi_{0})$ parameter space, where $Wi$ is the Weissenberg number, we reconcile discrepancies among perturbation theory, experiments, and numerical simulations. These results establish $N_{2}$ as a crucial control parameter governing free-surface stability in viscoelastic liquids.</description>

      <title>Model for self-organized Leidenfrost rotating polygons as cnoidal waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The remarkable appearance of self-organized regular and peaked polygonal rotating patterns in shallow Leidenfrost rings is investigated as a balance between surface tension geometry and nonlinear terms of Euler equation. Using the Boussinesq shallow convection approximation and a specialized expansion of the Laplace equation solutions, we derive a nonlinear equation that can be integrated in terms of elliptic functions. The model rigorously accounts for surface tension, the contribution of the poloidal rolling vortex, and the interplay between buoyancy-driven and thermocapillary flows. We obtain cnoidal waves solutions describing the dynamics of the inner free surface of the Leidenfrost ring, to predict polygonal patterns in liquid nitrogen. These predictions are compared with experimental observations.Additionally, we introduce a simplified model based on poloidal averaging of the capillary pressure, leading to a Korteweg-de Vries-type equation. This simplified model not only reproduces the cnoidal wave solutions but also predicts new trigonometric solutions, offering insights into the formation of peaked polygons.</description>

      <title>Data-driven modeling of multivariate stochastic trajectories -- Application to water waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A data-driven methodology is proposed to model the distribution of multivariate stochastic trajectories from an observed sample. As a first step, each trajectory in the sample is reduced to a vector of features by means of Functional Principal Component Analysis. Next, the joint distribution of features is modeled using (i) a non-parametric vine copula approach for the bulk of the distribution, and (ii) the conditional modeling framework of Heffernan and Tawn (2004) for the multivariate tail. The method is applied to the modeling of water waves. The dataset used is the DeRisk database, which consists of numerical simulations of water waves. The analysis is restricted to the portion of the wave period between the free-surface zero-upcrossing and the wave crest. The kinematic variables considered are the free-surface slope, the normal component of the fluid velocity at the free surface, and the vertical Lagrangian acceleration of the fluid at the free surface. The stochastic trajectories of these three variables are modeled jointly. The vertical Lagrangian acceleration of the fluid is employed to enforce a wave-breaking filter in the stochastic model. The capabilities of the model are illustrated by predicting the distributions of selected response variables and by generating synthetic trajectories.</description>

      <title>Interplay between streaks and vortices in shock-boundary layer interactions with conditional bubble events over a turbine airfoil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The shock-boundary layer interaction over the convex wall of a supersonic turbine vane is studied with a focus on extreme separation bubble events and the interplay between the bubble, streaks, and streamwise vortices. The present analysis is performed on a dataset computed by a LES of a supersonic turbine at Ma = 2.0 and Re = 395000. Building on findings related to near-wall streaks and vortices that drive the bubble breathing motion, here, we employ conditional analysis to study extreme bubble events. In events where the recirculation region is small, near-wall high-speed streaks penetrate the bubble and lead to higher tangential Reynolds stresses upstream of the incident shock compared to those with large recirculation. The streaks are accompanied by streamwise vortices that meander and induce intense fluid mixing, leading to higher wall-normal and spanwise Reynolds stresses, and consequently, higher turbulent kinetic energy. This turbulent activity also causes intense fluctuations in wall pressure and skin-friction coefficient along the separation region. In contrast, during events with bubble expansion, high-speed streaks are advected over the separation region, with streamwise vortices appearing only downstream of the shock, resulting in minimal fluid mixing inside the bubble. The analysis of mass flux along the bubble surface reveals that during its contraction phase, mass flux out of the bubble occurs predominantly upstream of the incident shock because of high-speed streaks dragged towards the wall by the streamwise vortices. In the expansion phase, pronounced mass flux into the bubble is observed downstream of the shock, near reattachment. This increased fluid injection is associated with the presence of streamwise vortices and low-momentum flow structures near reattachment, suggesting that fluid entrainment by vortices plays a key role in the mass flux into the bubble.</description>

      <title>Shear Stress and Fluid-Wall Interaction Force in LBM Simulations of Hydrodynamic and MHD Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chapman-Enskog analysis of the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is adopted to recover the Navier-Stokes (N-S) equation for the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flows driven by external body forces other than the induced Lorentz force. Various numerical schemes are discussed for the implementation of external body forces, leading to different artefact terms. An order-of-magnitude analysis is provided to demonstrate that the artefact terms are negligible in calculating the shear stress and strain rate tensors, which keeps the study of fluid-wall interaction and the implementation of large eddy simulation (LES) simple. This clarifies the confusion in the literature, where both considering and not considering the artefact terms have been adopted without discussion. Additionally, the fluid-wall interaction force can be computed as the intuitive momentum exchange rate using a special distribution function after a half-step propagation, and consistency is obtained with the formula derived using the Chapman-Enskog analysis. The momentum flux tensor for moving boundaries is uncovered as the cause of violating Galilean invariance and the Maxwell stress tensor for Lorentz force is also contained in this intuitively calculated interaction force for MHD flows due to the modification of equilibrium distribution function. Both extra terms should be removed for an interaction force associated with the hydrodynamic pressure and viscous shear stress. The implication of extra terms for the global balance of different physical forces is discussed.</description>

      <title>A Computational Approach for Multi-Body Potential-Flow Interaction Effects Using Matrix-Free FEM and Body-Conforming Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a unified and computationally efficient framework for predicting incompressible, irrotational (potential) flow around multiple immersed bodies in two-dimensional domains, with particular emphasis on quantifying irrotational interaction effects in multi-body configurations. The methodology integrates three components: a fast body-conforming mesh-generation strategy, a matrix-free finite-element solution of the Laplace equation, and a systematic procedure for determining the stream-function values associated with each immersed solid.
  Body-fitted grids are generated by imposing boundary displacements on a Cartesian background mesh followed by Laplacian smoothing, yielding simple, robust, and accurate meshes for domains containing multiple immersed bodies. The potential-flow field is obtained by solving the Laplace equation using a matrix-free Conjugate Gradient method, wherein element-level operators are evaluated without assembling global stiffness matrices. Immersed bodies are treated as constant-\,$\psi$ streamlines, and their unknown stream-function values are determined through multi-point constraints that naturally capture inter-body flow connectivity.
  The results highlight the ability of the proposed approach to resolve subtle multi-body interaction phenomena with minimal case-setup effort and very low memory requirements, while providing a quantitative measure of potential-flow interference in complex immersed-body systems.</description>

      <title>Experimental and Numerical Analysis of the Intermittentency in a Nozzle Overexpanded-Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work reports an investigation into the statistical properties of wall-pressure fluctuations in a highly over-expanded nozzle flow, characterized by significant shock-induced flow separation. This regime is extremely hazardous to rocket nozzles, as it leads to very high off-axis loads. The database under investigation has been obtained both experimentally and numerically by means of a hybrid RANS/LES simulation of the flow issuing from a sub-scale Truncated Ideal Contour (TIC) nozzle, fed with cold air and operating at a Reynolds number on the order of 10^6. The experimental campaign was conducted in the S150 supersonic wind tunnel at the Institut PPRIME in Poitiers.
  The degree of over-expansion is quantified by the nozzle pressure ratio (NPR). Pressure fluctuations are extracted from several probes positioned along the nozzle wall, considering different NPR values. The intermittent behavior is investigated using conditional statistics based on the wavelet transform, which demonstrates that the aerodynamic loads of the over-expanded jet consist of intermittent bursts rather than continuous variations. The wavelet analysis reveals scale-by-scale intermittency and, in particular, shows that the wall-pressure signals exhibit a significant degree of intermittency around the frequency associated with aerodynamic side-loads. The statistics of these intermittent events, in terms of the time delay between occurrences and in terms of their amplitude, are found to be weakly sensitive to NPRs and to locations along the nozzle wall and appear to follow a universal behaviour that can be modelled by a log-normal distribution. This finding may support the development of a stochastic model of the aerodynamic side-loads.</description>

      <title>Inclination-Driven Thin-Film Hydrodynamics: Universal Trajectory in the {Da, Pe, Bo} Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a unified theoretical framework for thin-film hydrodynamics on inclined solid substrates, integrating capillarity, intermolecular forces, gravitational symmetry breaking, confined transport and stochastic wetting into a single formulation. Starting from lubrication theory with capillary curvature and disjoining-pressure interactions, we derive a general thin-film equation that incorporates inclination-driven advection, nanoscale stabilization and humidity-controlled source-sink fluxes. A dimensionless analysis shows that, within the long-wave lubrication approximation, inclination induces a leading-order coupling of the Bond, Peclet and Damkohler numbers. This coupling defines a characteristic trajectory in the parameter space (Da, Pe, Bo), determined by the structure of the lubrication flux. Coupling this deterministic framework to a minimal stochastic formulation captures the intermittent wet-dry dynamics characteristic of ultrathin films under environmental forcing. The framework provides a general surface-physics description of confined films under geometric asymmetry, applicable across wetting, interfacial drainage, reactive confinement and soft-matter systems.</description>

      <title>Lift reversal from vortex-surface phase coupling in a heaving foil near a free surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical descriptions of flapping propulsion near a free surface emphasize the energetic penalties of wave generation, treating the interface primarily as an energy sink. Here, we show that the same deformable boundary can also act as a phase-dependent kinematic constraint on vertical force generation. Using force measurements, particle image velocimetry and potential-flow simulations, we characterize how a free surface reorganizes vortex shedding for a heaving hydrofoil at moderate Reynolds number (O(10^4)). For moderate to deep submergence, the cycle-averaged lift undergoes a systematic transition from repulsion to suction as the unsteady number increases. The reversal occurs within a narrow band of unsteady numbers, where the phase-shifted surface motion generates vertical advection that alters the pairing of trailing-edge vortices and redirects the wake momentum flux. A force decomposition shows that the reversal arises from a coordinated change in quasi-steady pressure loading and wake-induced force. These results identify the phase of the free-surface response, organized by unsteady number, as a key parameter governing near-surface lift and illustrate how deformable boundaries can reconfigure unsteady loading through vortex-surface phase coupling.</description>

      <title>Integrating Fourier Neural Operator with Diffusion Model for Autoregressive Predictions of Three-dimensional Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately autoregressive prediction of three-dimensional (3D) turbulence has been one of the most challenging problems for machine learning approaches. Diffusion models have demonstrated high accuracy in predicting two-dimensional (2D) turbulence, but their applications in 3D turbulence are relatively limited. To achieve reliable autoregressive predictions of 3D turbulence, we propose the DiAFNO model which integrates the implicit adaptive Fourier neural operator (IAFNO) with diffusion model. IAFNO can effectively capture the global frequency and structural features, which is crucial for global consistent reconstructions of the denoising process in diffusion models. Furthermore, based on conditional generation from diffusion models, we design an autoregressive framework in DiAFNO to achieve long-term stable predictions of 3D turbulence. The proposed DiAFNO model is systematically tested with fixed hyperparameters in several types of 3D turbulence, including forced homogeneous isotropic turbulence (HIT) at Taylor Reynolds number $Re_{\lambda}\approx100$, decaying HIT at initial Taylor Reynolds number at $Re_{\lambda}\approx100$ and turbulent channel flow at friction Reynolds numbers $Re_{\tau}\approx395$ and $Re_{\tau}\approx590$. The results in the a posteriori tests demonstrate that DiAFNO exhibits a significantly higher accuracy in terms of the velocity spectra, the root-mean-square (RMS) values of both velocity and vorticity, and Reynolds stresses, as compared to the elucidated diffusion model (EDM) and the traditional large-eddy simulation (LES) using dynamic Smagorinsky model (DSM). Meanwhile, the well-trained DiAFNO is faster than LES with the DSM.</description>

      <title>The interactions between two drops floating on a partially miscible liquid pool</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction of drops floating on liquid surfaces is important for many natural processes and industrial applications. In many of the cases, the system is multicomponent, leading to Marangoni flows on the surface. Here we investigate the competing effect of the attractive ``Cheerios effect'' and the repulsive solutal Marangoni flow by observing the behaviors of two identical oil drops floating on partially miscible pool made of ethanol-water mixtures. Three typical behaviors are found: Repel, Coalesce and Rebound, in which the drops repel each other, attract each other and then coalesce, and attract and rebound upon contact. A scaling theory based on the two competing forces is developed to distinguish the repulsive and attractive behaviors of the drops. For the transition from Coalesce to Rebound, a lubrication layer is found to form when the immersed lower halves of the drops are more than half a sphere, which prevents the drops from coalescing.</description>

      <title>Mesoscale Simulations of Thrombin Activation and Fibrin Formation in Microvascular and In Vitro Settings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blood coagulation is governed by tightly regulated reaction networks that unfold within a flowing, heterogeneous microvascular environment. Reduced kinetic models of the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways have seen limited in vitro validation, and their behavior within spatially resolved flow fields remains largely unexplored. Here, we embed two established reduced networks into a recently proposed mesoscale particle-based framework that resolves fluid momentum transport alongside multispecies advection-diffusion-reaction dynamics. We investigate the initiation phase of coagulation by simulating thrombin formation in microvascular geometries and in vitro assays, and we assess the framework's ability to reproduce thrombin generation curves (TGCs) under physiologically relevant conditions. We further examine how variations in fibrinogen levels - an important determinant of clot structure and a biomarker for inflammation and thrombosis - affect thrombin and fibrin formation. Overall, this study provides a unified computational approach for analysing how biochemical kinetics interact with transport processes, offering insights relevant to thrombosis modeling and blood diagnostics.</description>

      <title>A Corrected Open Boundary Framework for Lattice Boltzmann Immiscible Pseudopotential Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pseudopotential lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is a prominent approach for simulating multiphase flows, valued for its physical intuitiveness and computational tractability. However, existing immiscible pseudopotential methods for modeling dynamic multi-component immiscible fluid systems involving open boundaries face persistent challenges, notably the influence of spurious currents on interface formation and breakup, as well as the effects of inlet and outlet boundary configurations on simulation stability. Therefore, this paper proposes a corrected open boundary framework based on Multiple-relaxation-time (MRT) for the immiscible pseudopotential model. Our method includes three key improvements: firstly, introducing correction coefficients to reconstruct the distribution function, in order to accurately recover the macroscopic quantities at the inlet boundary. Secondly, based on real-time mass flow rates at the inlet and outlet, the outlet boundary velocity is adjusted to ensure global mass conservation in the computational domain. Finally, the relaxation coefficient related to numerical stability is adjusted based on the viscosity of two-phase fluids to reduce spurious currents. To validate the reliability of the proposed corrected method, four benchmark cases were simulated: Laplace tests and Taylor deformation, two-phase Poiseuille flow, migration of droplets in microchannels, as well as droplet generation in T-shaped and co-flow devices. The results demonstrate that the corrected approach accurately captures various dynamic complex immiscible multiphase flows.</description>

      <title>Frequency Scaling Laws for Flat Plate Wing Active Separation Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dimensionless frequency scaling laws for active separation control on flat-plate wings, using dielectric barrier discharge plasma actuators, were examined on the basis of maximum increases to lift coefficient, and compared with hovering insect wing-flapping frequencies. Data for a range of angles of attack ($24^\circ$ to $32^\circ$), Reynolds numbers (3,000 to 20,000) and semispan wing aspect ratios (0.75 to $\infty$), collapsed best when scaled with the streamwise-directed height of the chord length. The ``forcing Strouhal number'' that produced the largest lift coefficient increments, equal to $0.26 \pm 0.04$, was linked to the conventional bluff-body Strouhal number by recognizing that drag and lift on flat plate wings are directly proportional at a fixed angle of attack. Flowfield measurements, to determine the time-averaged separation bubble height and local velocity at separation, showed that the universal Strouhal number of approximately $0.16 \pm 0.01$ --developed for bluff-body and separation bubble vortex shedding--can be further generalized to active separation control, when the natural shedding frequency is substituted by the forcing frequency. Insect wing flapping frequencies in hover were examined on the basis of Strouhal number scaling and corresponded reasonably well to the optimum forcing Strouhal number range, although angle of attack estimates were a source of uncertainty. Furthermore, universal Strouhal number scaling can only be validated with accurate separation bubble height and separation velocity measurements.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian Heterogeneous Multiscale Method (LHMM) for Simulating Polymer Solutions/Melts Behavior under Complex Flows using DPD-SPH</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Lagrangian Heterogeneous Multiscale Method (LHMM) for simulating the non-Newtonian rheology of polymer melts in complex two-dimensional flows. The method couples Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) at the microscale with a GENERIC-compliant Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) at the macroscale, in a concurrent framework, overcoming the limitations of traditional Eulerian-based methods in capturing long-memory and history-dependent effects. At the microscale, DPD serves as a virtual rheometer, employing FENE (Finitely Extensible Nonlinear Elastic) bead-spring polymer chains. This approach provides key rheological properties, including shear-thinning and zero-shear-rate viscosities, relaxation times, and viscoelastic dynamics, which are quantified via Carreau-Yasuda fitting and spectral analysis. The LHMM couples SPH-derived strain rates with microscopic stress responses using the Irving-Kirkwood formalism. This approach enables a concurrent interaction between macroscopic strain rates and microscopic stress tensors, ensuring a consistent viscoelastic response across scales.The method is validated against benchmark flows, including Reverse Poiseuille Flow and flow through a Periodic Array of Cylinders, across Weissenberg numbers $0.5&lt;\text{Wi}&lt;30$ and low Reynolds numbers ($\text{Re}&lt;1$). A final demonstration of flow in a 2D porous medium highlights LHMM's capability to handle highly heterogeneous geometries. The LHMM is implemented in LAMMPS, making it suitable for integrating multiple models to describe microscales. In contrast, large-scale simulations efficiently utilize GPU and CPU resources, managing multiple coupling and time-scaling levels to maintain numerical stability and accuracy. The framework offers a predictive, constitutive-free tool that links microscopic polymer dynamics to macroscopic flow behavior, making it suitable for multiscale applications.</description>

      <title>On the complex interplay of temperature, phase change and natural convection in self-pressurization-an investigation using segregated modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of self-pressurization in cryogenic tanks requires resolving the coupled effects of heat ingress, natural convection, and phase change. This work introduces a segregated numerical framework in which the liquid and vapor phases are treated with incompressible and compressible solvers, respectively, and the liquid-vapor interface is modeled as a sharp boundary subject to energy-jump conditions derived from first principles, without accommodation or tuning coefficients. Conjugate heat transfer through the tank walls is accounted for by solving the heat-conduction equation in the solid domain rather than prescribing external heat-flux conditions. The framework is validated against laboratory-scale LN2 and large-scale LH2 experiments, reproducing the spatio-temporal evolution of pressure and temperature without adjustable parameters. In both settings, the simulations identify two distinct regimes in self-pressurization: an initial heating-driven phase that establishes a self-similar temperature profile in the vapor, followed by an evaporation-driven phase in which the pressure rise is governed by the saturation relation. The comparison between these largely different scales motivated a revised scaling for self-pressurization, based on ullage thermodynamics. Finally, the influence of buoyancy was examined by reducing the strength of the gravitational body force, which revealed that natural convection modifies the duration of the transient heating phase but has a limited impact on the long-term pressurization rate. This analysis also clarifies the mechanism controlling the development of thermal stratification in the liquid. Overall, the segregated approach provides a predictive, parameter-free tool for analyzing cryogenic storage and offers a physically grounded basis for scaling self-pressurization across fluids, geometries, and heat-flux conditions.</description>

      <title>Sheared stratified turbulence driven by Kolmogorov flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate three-dimensional turbulence in a stably stratified fluid driven by a vertically sheared Kolmogorov flow using direct numerical simulations of the Boussinesq equations. As stratification increases, mean profiles evolve toward piecewise-linear shapes while layered density structures emerge, with sharp interfaces separating well-mixed bulk layers. These highly stable interfaces form in the low-shear regions of the mean velocity profile and tend to promote flow relaminarisation, while shear-generated turbulence persists in the bulk layers. We analyse turbulent fluctuations, buoyancy transport and its spatial organisation, and flow stability via profiles of the gradient Richardson number $Ri_g$. The Richardson number in the bulk layers remains of order unity or less, $Ri_g \lesssim 1$, so that efficient turbulent shear production can take place there. Mixing efficiency analysis shows that the Nusselt number scales with the buoyancy Reynolds number $Re_b$ as $Nu = 1 + \Gamma Re_b$ (with $\Gamma = \epsilon_p / \epsilon$), with the data collapsing onto a robust master curve and roughly following a power-law $Nu \sim Re_b^{0.8}$. Further increase of stratification leads to a temporally intermittent turbulent regime, characterised by quasi-periodic bursts. We propose that the transition from stationary turbulence to this temporally intermittent regime is controlled by the buoyancy Reynolds number and highlight the mechanisms disrupting the turbulence and layered structures.</description>

      <title>On the conservation of physical properties in operator interpolation of parameterized hydrodynamic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reduced-order models (ROMs) that capture changes in fluid systems due to variations in parameters, such as the Reynolds number or the shape of a stationary body placed in the flow, are attracting increasing attention in engineering applications. In this study, we identify linear operators that characterize the behavior of fluid systems across a wide parameter range by using flow field datasets at several representative parameter values. We then comprehensively assess the applicability of ROMs constructed through the interpolation of these operators. Specifically, we consider two intrusive operator-based ROMs: one derived from Galerkin projection and the other based on operator inference using dynamic mode decomposition (DMD). The performance of these ROMs is evaluated for flows around circular and elliptical cylinders over a range of Reynolds numbers and aspect ratios. The Galerkin-based ROM successfully predicts only the eigenvalue and eigenmode corresponding to the fundamental frequency of the K\'arm\'an vortex shedding, while other frequencies are not captured and show a decaying behavior. In contrast, the DMD-based ROM accurately predicts both the fundamental frequency and its higher harmonics. Furthermore, visualization of the linear operator matrix elements reveals that interpolation fails when the subspace includes bases contaminated by numerical errors. However, by carefully selecting the subspace dimension and reference conditions, it is possible to accurately predict eigenvalues and corresponding modes even under conditions where multiple low-frequency modes exist outside the harmonic structure of the fundamental frequency. These findings underscore the robustness of the DMD-based parametric operator ROM approach.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Sampling for Hydrodynamic Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An adaptive sampling approach for efficient detection of bifurcation boundaries in parametrized fluid flow problems is presented herein. The study extends the machine-learning approach of Silvester (Machine Learning for Hydrodynamic Stability, arXiv:2407.09572), where a classifier network was trained on preselected simulation data to identify bifurcated and nonbifurcated flow regimes. In contrast, the proposed methodology introduces adaptivity through a flow-based deep generative model that automatically refines the sampling of the parameter space. The strategy has two components: a classifier network maps the flow parameters to a bifurcation probability, and a probability density estimation technique (KRnet) for the generation of new samples at each adaptive step. The classifier output provides a probabilistic measure of flow stability, and the Shannon entropy of these predictions is employed as an uncertainty indicator. KRnet is trained to approximate a probability density function that concentrates sampling in regions of high entropy, thereby directing computational effort towards the evolving bifurcation boundary. This coupling between classification and generative modeling establishes a feedback-driven adaptive learning process analogous to error-indicator based refinement in contemporary partial differential equation solution strategies. Starting from a uniform parameter distribution, the new approach achieves accurate bifurcation boundary identification with significantly fewer Navier--Stokes simulations, providing a scalable foundation for high-dimensional stability analysis.</description>

      <title>Spectral analysis of attached and separated turbulent flows over a Gaussian-shaped bump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the broadband turbulent dynamics of attached and separated flows over a Gaussian bump, focusing on the origin of low-frequency coherent structures. The analysis combines time-resolved experimental measurements with physics-based linear models, using mean fields previously assimilated from the same dataset as base flows. Spectral proper orthogonal decomposition reveals coherent dynamics in low- and medium-frequency regimes for both flows, with the low-frequency dynamics being substantially stronger in the separated case. In the separated flow, these dynamics are linked to a three-dimensional zero-frequency modal instability that generates large-scale streaks downstream of the bump. A standing-wave model based on resolvent modes, incorporating sidewall effects, reproduces the experimentally observed spanwise structure of the dynamics and highlights the limitations of simulations with small spanwise extent and periodic boundary conditions. In the attached flow, similar low-frequency streaks are identified. These are weaker, do not form a prominent standing-wave pattern, and cannot be definitively classified as either modal or non-modal. The three-dimensional zero-frequency instability and finite-span standing-wave dynamics, identified as the main drivers of low-frequency coherent structures in the separated flow, offer an explanation for persistent discrepancies between simulations and experiments on the Gaussian bump, and provide guidance on spanwise domain size and boundary conditions for future simulations.</description>

      <title>Matrix Product State Simulation of Reacting Shear Flows</title>

Abstract: Direct numerical simulation (DNS) of turbulent reactive flows has been the subject of significant research interest for several decades. Accurate prediction of the effects of turbulence on the rate of reactant conversion, and the subsequent influence of chemistry on hydrodynamics remain a challenge in combustion modeling. The key issue in DNS is to account for the wide range of temporal and spatial physical scales that are caused by complex interactions of turbulence and chemistry. In this work, a new computational methodology is developed that is shown to provide a viable alternative to DNS. The framework is the matrix product state (MPS), a form of tensor network (TN) as used in computational many body physics. The MPS is a well-established ansatz for efficiently representing many types of quantum states in condensed matter systems, allowing for an exponential compression of the required memory compared to exact diagonalization methods. Due to the success of MPS in quantum physics, the ansatz has been adapted to problems outside its historical domain, notably computational fluid dynamics. Here, the MPS is used for computational simulation of a shear flow under non-reacting and nonpremixed chemically reacting conditions. Reductions of 30% in memory are demonstrated for all transport variables, accompanied by excellent agreements with DNS. The anastaz accurately captures all pertinent flow physics such as reduced mixing due to exothermicity &amp; compressibility, and the formation of eddy shocklets at high Mach numbers. A priori analysis of DNS data at higher Reynolds numbers shows compressions as large as 99.99% for some of the transport variables. This level of compression is encouraging and promotes the use of MPS for simulations of complex turbulent combustion systems.</description>

      <title>Numerical Assessment of Advective and Diffusive Dynamics of Interacting and Isolated Prototypical Convectively Initiated Circulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The bulk circulation associated with convective clouds includes not only a region of updraft and cloudy air but also a region of compensating descent and cloud-free air and horizontal motions coupling these regions. The Kinematic Representation of Non-rotating Updraft Tori (KRoNUT) model is a simple representation of this entire flow. First, the skill of the KRoNUT in representing flows from a high resolution full-physics simulation of marine tropical convection is compared to various plume representations of convection. Then the KRoNUT is used to construct bulk descriptions of the dry dynamics of isolated and interacting convective circulations under the influence of advection and diffusion (only). Cross sections of advective and diffusive tendencies show that while vertical advection of the vertical wind is the most important advective tendency in clouds, the horizontal component of the convective circulation and advection thereof plays a crucial role in the evolution of circulations in the absence of buoyancy. Strong curvature of the flow near the surface and near the updraft core results in locally strong diffusive tendencies that depend on scale. Cross sections of tendencies from the KRoNUT compare favourably to results from the simulation. Interacting circulations are shown to exhibit a wide range of dynamics with some cases of interactions leading to unique stability of geometric properties of otherwise evolving flows and some leading to geometric clustering of circulation centers.</description>

      <title>Unlocking the full potential of jumping condensation on microstructured surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Water condensation on superhydrophobic surfaces can generate spontaneous droplet jumping, enabling rapid condensate removal and improved thermal and mass transfer. Although this effect has been extensively demonstrated on densely packed nanostructures, the capability of microscale textures to support jumping condensation remains poorly understood. Here, we show that engineered microscale conical arrays can achieve efficient microdroplet jumping and reveal a previously unreported spacing-dependent critical transition between jumping and non-jumping regimes. In the jumping regime, by varying only the cone pitch, we identify a geometric threshold below which sub-10 micron droplets are rapidly removed, and above which jumping is suppressed, resulting in slower dynamics and larger departing droplets. In situ optical and environmental scanning electron microscopies reveal the mechanistic origin of this transition: dense arrays favour full Cassie droplets, which depart cleanly, while wider spacing favours partial Cassie droplets that retain a localized wet region initiating new nucleation. From these results, we construct a geometry-wetting design map linking microstructure spacing, droplet morphology, and nucleation density. These findings establish design principles for scalable, mechanically robust microstructured surfaces capable of high-performance condensation management for anti-fogging, water harvesting, and heat-transfer applications.</description>

      <title>Perturbation of Traveling Boussinesq Solitons by Periodic Bathymetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the perturbations induced by a periodic bathymetry on traveling Boussinesq solitons in a two-dimensional configuration. We present two perturbation approaches to solve the nonlinear, dispersive and non-autonomous differential equations of the model and compare the solutions with numerical simulations of the original system of equations. In the approximation for small periodic corrugations we built the solutions as modulated traveling waves using Fourier series. The coefficients of the series are solved using the Green function method and the pathordered exponential method. At the second order in the relative height of bed corrugations, we obtain the perturbation as the fourth-order linear dispersive waves generated by the modulated traveling soliton in its wake. In the second approach, we rewrite the Boussinesq system into a perturbed Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) nonlinear equation, and obtain the corresponding perturbed solitons. These analytic solutions are compared with the results of numerical simulations, for various parameters that characterize the effects of nonlinearity, dispersion, and bottom bathymetry. We also discuss the stability of the perturbed solitons in time. The perturbation approaches developed in this study are valid for any type of periodic bathymetries, and the method can readily be extended to non-periodic ones.</description>

      <title>Residual energy in weakly compressible turbulence with a mean guide field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The energy distribution is a fundamental property of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence. In strongly magnetized turbulence energy imbalances can arise, quantified by the so-called residual energy: $E_r~=~(E_{kin}~ - ~E_{mag})$; $E_{kin}$ and $E_{mag}$ stand for the volume-averaged kinetic and magnetic energy, respectively. Numerical simulations of incompressible turbulence yield $E_r &lt; 0$, which is consistent with Solar wind observations, while in highly compressible turbulence simulations $E_r &gt; $ 0. Differences arise in the cascade of $E_r$ between the two regimes. We explore the properties of $E_r$ in weakly compressible MHD turbulence in the presence of an initially strong (guide) magnetic field. We study the influence of different driving mechanisms and field strengths on the cascade of $E_r$. We run a suite of direct numerical simulations with the PENCIL code. All simulations are maintained through forcing in a quasi-static regime with sonic Mach numbers close to 0.1. We solely change the Alfv\'en Mach number, or equivalently the plasma beta ($\beta$) of the simulations. We drive turbulence by either injecting velocity or magnetic fluctuations at large scales and study the power spectra of kinetic, magnetic, density, and $E_r$. Magnetically-driven simulations show locally imbalanced Alfv\'enic fluctuations and a $\propto k^{-3/2}$ cascade, consistent with the dynamic alignment theory. Kinetically-driven simulations give rise to a $\propto k^{-1}$ scaling, consistent with interactions between Alfv\'en waves scattered by density inhomogeneities -- a hallmark of reflection-driven turbulence. Residual energy is positive with a spectral slope ($\alpha$) depending on $\beta$ as: for $\beta = 4.0$, $-2 \lesssim \alpha \lesssim -5/3$, for $\beta = 1.0$, $-5/3 \lesssim \alpha \lesssim -3/2$, and for $\beta = 0.3$, $\alpha \approx -1$.</description>

Abstract: We consider nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) for advection-diffusion processes which are augmented by an auxiliary parameter $\delta$ such that $\delta=0$ corresponds to linear advection-diffusion. We derive potentially non-perturbative series expansions in $\delta$ that provide a process to obtain the solution of the nonlinear PDE through solving a hierarchical system of linear, forced PDEs with the forcing terms dependent on solutions at lower orders in the hierarchy. We rigorously detail our approach for a particular deformation that interpolates between linear advection-diffusion and the canonical Burgers' equation modeling nonlinear advection. In this case, we prove that the series has infinite radius of convergence for arbitrary integrable initial data, analyze the cases of a Dirac-delta initial condition (IC) (i.e., the fundamental solution) in an infinite domain and arbitrary IC in a periodic domain, and demonstrate the approach to turbulent behavior in a scenario with periodic forcing. We then treat models of nonlinear diffusion involving the $p$-Laplacian operator, including generalizations of the Poisson equation in $1$ and $2$ dimensions, and the heat equation in $1+1$ dimensions. We detail series expansions for two different deformations of these equations about their linear (ordinary Laplacian) counterparts, providing numerical evidence for the convergence of the series outside of a perturbative regime and demonstrating that the rate and radius of convergence are affected by choice of deformation. Our results provide a rigorous foundation for using series expansion techniques to study nonlinear advection-diffusion PDEs, opening new pathways for analysis and potential applications for quantum-assisted computational fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>Soft-Lubrication Drainage and Rupture in Particle-Driven Vesicles</title>

Abstract: The deformation and rupture of a lipid vesicle due to the forced normal approach of an inclusion are essential for optimizing the design of magnetic giant unilamellar vesicles [magGUVs, Malik et al., Nanoscale 17, 13720 (2025)], with implications for active colloid-membrane interactions and cellular-scale chemical delivery. Here, we investigate vesicles propelled by a force-driven rigid inclusion and reveal a robust elastohydrodynamic mechanism: the inclusion outpaces the vesicle, sustaining a thinning film that drains symmetrically and self-similarly, largely independent of initial shape. For soft membranes and small inclusions, coupling drives a monotonic tension increase that can exceed the lysis tension. Evaluating the maximal tension over a delivery distance, we map an operating window in vesicle reduced area and size relative to the inclusion.</description>

      <title>Morphogenesis of bacterial colonies in liquid crystalline environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Natural bacterial habitats are often complex fluids with viscoelastic and anisotropic responses to stress; for example, they can take the form of liquid crystals (LCs), with elongated microscopic constituents that collectively align while still retaining the ability to flow. However, laboratory studies typically focus on cells in simple liquids or complex fluids with randomly-oriented constituents. Here, we show how interactions with LCs shape bacterial proliferation in multicellular colonies. Using experiments, we find that in a nematic LC, cells generically form aligned single-cell-wide "chains" as they reproduce. As these chains lengthen, they eventually buckle in a highly localized manner. By combining our measurements with a continuum mechanical theory, we demonstrate that this distinctive morphogenetic program emerges because cells are kept in alignment due to the LC's elasticity; as each chain lengthens, growth-induced viscous stresses along its contour eventually overcome the elasticity of the surrounding nematic, leading to buckling. Our work thus reveals and provides mechanistic insight into the previously-overlooked role of LCs in sculpting bacterial life in complex environments.</description>

      <title>Field-Particle Interactions in Curved Flows for Shape-Asymmetric Active Particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that curvatures in general ambient flow profiles can align shape-asymmetric active particles, revealing a previously overlooked competition with externally applied aligning fields. Focusing on the ubiquitous case of channel flows, we then investigate the fundamental consequences of this competition for the dynamics of shape-asymmetric active particles in microchannels in the presence of orienting fields. We find that this interplay gives rise to novel mechanisms for controlling particle dynamics, with potentially broad applications, and suggests exciting possibilities such as active-particle analogs of electronic systems.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Full-waveform Monitoring of CO2 Storage with Fluid-flow Priors via Generative Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantitative monitoring of subsurface changes is essential for ensuring the safety of geological CO2 sequestration. Full-waveform monitoring (FWM) can resolve these changes at high spatial resolution, but conventional deterministic inversion lacks uncertainty quantification and incorporates only limited prior information. Deterministic approaches can also yield unreliable results with sparse and noisy seismic data. To address these limitations, we develop a Bayesian FWM framework that combines reservoir flow physics with generative prior modeling. Prior CO2 saturation realizations are constructed by performing multiphase flow simulations on prior geological realizations. Seismic velocity is related to saturation through rock physics modeling. A variational autoencoder (VAE) trained on the priors maps high-dimensional CO2 saturation fields onto a low-dimensional, approximately Gaussian latent space, enabling efficient Bayesian inference while retaining the key geometrical structure of the CO2 plume. Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is used to infer CO2 saturation changes from time-lapse seismic data and to quantify associated uncertainties. Numerical results show that this approach improves inversion stability and accuracy under extremely sparse and noisy acquisition, whereas deterministic methods become unreliable. Statistical seismic monitoring provides posterior uncertainty estimates that identify where additional measurements would most reduce ambiguity and mitigate errors arising from biased rock physics parameters. The framework combines reservoir physics, generative priors, and Bayesian inference to provide uncertainty quantification for time-lapse monitoring of CO2 storage and other subsurface processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a solitary Alfv\'en wave model that exhibits nontrivial three-dimensional twisting of open magnetic field lines while preserving constant $|B|$. Embedded rotational discontinuities sharply deflect the otherwise uniform field lines, producing localized, large-amplitude field reversals in one-dimensional profiles that closely resemble the ``switchbacks'' observed by the Parker Solar Probe in the inner heliosphere. This indicates that switchbacks, as seen in one-dimensional spacecraft time series, arise from traversals through strongly curved segments of open magnetic field lines.</description>

      <title>Multi-fidelity aerodynamic data fusion by autoencoder transfer learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate aerodynamic prediction often relies on high-fidelity simulations; however, their prohibitive computational costs severely limit their applicability in data-driven modeling. This limitation motivates the development of multi-fidelity strategies that leverage inexpensive low-fidelity information without compromising accuracy. Addressing this challenge, this work presents a multi-fidelity deep learning framework that combines autoencoder-based transfer learning with a newly developed Multi-Split Conformal Prediction (MSCP) strategy to achieve uncertainty-aware aerodynamic data fusion under extreme data scarcity. The methodology leverages abundant Low-Fidelity (LF) data to learn a compact latent physics representation, which acts as a frozen knowledge base for a decoder that is subsequently fine-tuned using scarce HF samples. Tested on surface-pressure distributions for NACA airfoils (2D) and a transonic wing (3D) databases, the model successfully corrects LF deviations and achieves high-accuracy pressure predictions using minimal HF training data. Furthermore, the MSCP framework produces robust, actionable uncertainty bands with pointwise coverage exceeding 95%. By combining extreme data efficiency with uncertainty quantification, this work offers a scalable and reliable solution for aerodynamic regression in data-scarce environments.</description>

      <title>Scaling laws for stationary Navier-Stokes-Fourier flows and the unreasonable effectiveness of hydrodynamics at the molecular level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrodynamics provides a universal description of the emergent collective dynamics of vastly different many-body systems, based solely on their symmetries and conservation laws. Here we harness this universality, encoded in the Navier-Stokes-Fourier (NSF) equations, to find general scaling laws for the stationary uniaxial solutions of the compressible NSF problem far from equilibrium. We show for general transport coefficients that the steady density and temperature fields are functions of the pressure and a kinetic field that quantifies the quadratic excess velocity relative to the ratio of heat flux and shear stress. This kinetic field obeys in turn a spatial scaling law controlled by pressure and stress, which is inherited by the stationary density and temperature fields. We develop a scaling approach to measure the associated master curves, and confirm our predictions through compelling data collapses in large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of paradigmatic model fluids. Interestingly, the robustness of the scaling laws in the face of significant finite-size effects reveals the surprising accuracy of NSF equations in describing molecular-scale stationary flows. Overall, these scaling laws provide a novel characterization of stationary states in driven fluids.</description>

      <title>Self-assembled filament layers in drying sessile droplets: from morphology to electrical conductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling the deposition of filaments, such as nanowires and nanotubes, from evaporating droplets is critical for the performance of emerging technologies like flexible sensors and printed electronics. The final deposit morphology strongly governs functional properties, such as electrical conductivity, yet remains challenging to control. In this work, we numerically investigate how filament length, stiffness, and concentration affect deposition patterns during the drying process. We compare reaction-limited and diffusion-limited evaporation regimes, demonstrating that their distinct velocity fields and flow magnitudes fundamentally alter filament arrangement. While diffusion-limited evaporation drives the ``coffee-ring effect", compromising network uniformity, reaction-limited evaporation suppresses edge accumulation, promoting centered conductive deposits. We map out the spatial variation of filament alignment - tangential at the contact line, radial in the intermediate region, and random near the center. Longer filaments tend to favour more tangential alignment overall and suppress edge accumulation. We find that by tuning the evaporation regime, filament deposition can lead to significantly lower percolation thresholds and significantly higher conductivity exponents. These results quantify the link between evaporation kinetics and microstructure, providing guidelines for optimizing conductive network formation in printed electronics.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional numerical simulations of neutron star cores in the two-fluid MHD approximation: simple configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic field evolution in neutron star cores is not fully understood. We describe the field evolution both for one barotropic fluid as well as two collisionally coupled barotropic fluids with different density profiles using the anelastic approximation and the Navier-Stokes equations to simulate the evolution in three dimensions. In the one-fluid case, a single fluid describes the motion of the charged particles. In the two-fluid model, the neutral fluid is coupled to the electrically conductive fluid by collisions, the latter being dragged by the magnetic field. In this model, both fluids have distinct density profiles. This forces them to move at slightly different velocities, resulting in a relative motion between the two barotropic fluids -- ambipolar diffusion. We develop a code based on Dedalus and study the evolution of simple poloidal dipolar and toroidal magnetic fields. Previous 2D studies found that poloidal magnetic fields evolve towards a stable Grad-Shafranov equilibrium. In our 3D simulations we find an instability of the two-fluid system similar to the one in the barotropic fluid system. After the instability saturates, a highly non-linear Lorentz force introduces small-scale fluid motion that leads to turbulence, development of a cascade and significant, non-axially symmetric changes in the magnetic field configuration. Fluid viscosity plays an essential role in regularizing the small-scale fluid motion, providing an energy drain.</description>

      <title>Towards Animate Droplets: Active, Adaptive, and Autonomous</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Droplets, sub-millilitre liquid volumes with at least one interface, have traditionally served as compartments for storing, transporting, and delivering materials. Beyond familiar applications in food, coatings, and consumer goods, they find cutting-edge use in energy storage, sensing, and tissue engineering. The next frontier is their integration into animate matter, emerging materials defined by their levels of activity, adaptiveness, and autonomy. Easy to produce and dispense or print into complex structures, and with enormous chemical versatility, droplets are ideal building blocks for animate matter. In this Perspective, we outline a roadmap for advancing animacy in droplets and call for a more concerted effort to integrate novel mechanisms for motility, sensing, and decision-making into droplet design. Although research on active droplets spans more than a century, achieving true autonomy, where droplets process multiple stimuli and respond without external control, remains a central challenge. We hope to inspire interdisciplinary collaboration towards applications in consumer goods, microfluidics, adaptive optics, tissue engineering, and soft robotics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present TURB-MHD, a database formed by six datasets of three-dimensional incompressible homogeneous magnetohydrodynamic turbulence maintained by a large-scale random forcing with minimal injection of cross helicity. Five of them describe a stationary state including one characterised by a weak background magnetic field. The remaining dataset is non-stationary and is featured by a strong background magnetic field. The aim is to provide datasets that clearly exhibit the phenomenon of the total energy cascade from the large to the small scales generated by the large-scale energy injection and one showing a partial inverse kinetic energy cascade from the small to the large scales. This database offers the possibility to realize a wide variety of analyses of fully developed magnetohydrodynamic turbulence from the sub-grid scale filtering up to the validation of an a posteriori LES. TURB-MHD is available for download using the SMART-Turb portal http://smart-turb.roma2.infn.it.</description>

      <title>Vielbein Lattice Boltzmann approach for fluid flows on spherical surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a lattice Boltzmann scheme based on the Vielbein formalism for the study of fluid flows on spherical surfaces. The Vielbein vector field encodes all details related to the geometry of the underlying spherical surface, allowing the velocity space to be treated as on the Cartesian space. The resulting Boltzmann equation exhibits inertial (geometric) forces that ensure that fluid particles follow paths that remain on the spherical manifold, which we compute by projection onto the space of Hermite polynomials. Due to the point-dependent nature of the advection velocity in the polar coordinate $\theta$ , exact streaming is not feasible, and we instead employ finite-difference schemes. We provide a detailed formulation of the lattice Boltzmann algorithm, with particular attention to boundary conditions at the north and south poles. We validate our numerical implementation against two analytical solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations derived in this work: the propagation of sound and shear waves. Additionally, we assess the robustness of the scheme by simulating the compressible flow of an axisymmetric shock wave and analyzing vortex dynamics on the spherical surface.</description>

      <title>Propulsion of a flexible foil in a wavy flow: resonance, antiresonance, and destructive self-interference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Swimming and flying animals demonstrate remarkable adaptations to diverse flow conditions in their environments. In this study, we aim to advance the fundamental understanding of the interaction between flexible bodies and heterogeneous flow conditions. We develop a linear inviscid model of an elastically mounted foil that passively pitches in response to a prescribed heaving motion and an incoming flow that consists of a traveling wave disturbance superposed on a uniform flow. In addition to the well-known resonant response, the wavy flow induces an antiresonant response for non-dimensional phase velocities near unity due to the emergence of non-circulatory forces that oppose circulatory forces. We also find that the wavy flow destructively interferes with itself, effectively rendering the foil a low-pass filter. The net result is that the waviness of the flow always improves thrust and efficiency when the wavy flow is of a different frequency than the prescribed heaving motion. Such a simple statement cannot be made when the wavy flow and heaving motion have the same frequency. Depending on the wavenumber and relative phase, the two may work in concert or in opposition, but they do open the possibility of simultaneous propulsion and net energy extraction from the flow, which, according to our model, is impossible in a uniform flow.</description>

      <title>On physical considerations regarding development and validation of Heat Flux Partitioning models: Application to vertical boiling flows simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As part of a critical assessment of wall boiling modeling through Heat Flux Partitioning approach, a new model dedicated to vertical boiling flows is proposed, with a revisited partitioning including a boiling heat flux related to bubble coalescence. Closure laws include a recent model for bubble dynamics, a new correlation for the bubble maximum lift-off diameter, and comprehensive selection of existing models for nucleation site density and bubble wait time. Each formulation are compared to relevant existing data from the literature in order to emphasize the importance of separate validation in such a modeling framework. The whole model is then confronted to detailed wall boiling experiments to simultaneously compare boiling curve predictions along other physical parameters such as boiling time scales (bubble growth, transient conduction, bubble wait), nucleation frequency, or nucleation site density. Finally, validation against wall heat flux measurements in various conditions are used to assess the model accuracy and further discuss the limits of the Heat Flux Partitioning approach.</description>

      <title>Wave-induced drift in third-order deep-water theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of this work is to investigate particle motions beneath unidirectional, deep-water waves up to the third-order in nonlinearity. A particular focus is on the approximation known as Stokes drift, and how it relates to the particle kinematics as computed directly from the particle trajectory mapping. The reduced Hamiltonian formulation of Zakharov and Krasitskii serves as a convenient tool to separate the effects of weak nonlinearity, in particular the appearance of bound harmonics and the mutual corrections to the wave frequencies. By numerical integration of the particle trajectory mappings we are able to compute motions and resulting drift for sea-states with one, two and several harmonics. We find that the classical formulation provides a slight underestimate of the drift at the surface, and a slight overestimate at depth. Incorporating difference harmonic terms into the formulation yields an improved agreement with the drift obtained from nonlinear wave theories, particularly at greater depth. The consequences of this are explored for regular and irregular waves, as well as parametric wave spectra.</description>

      <title>Influence of dissolved gas concentration on the lifetime of surface bubbles in volatile liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09436v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bubbles at the air-liquid interface are important for many natural and industrial processes. Factors influencing the lifetime of such surface bubbles have been investigated extensively, yet the impact of dissolved gas concentration remains unexplored. Here we investigate how the lifetime of surface bubbles in volatile liquids depends on the dissolved gas concentration. The bubble lifetime is found to decrease with the dissolved gas concentration. Larger microbubbles at increased gas concentration are found to trigger bubble bursting at earlier times. Combined with the thinning rate of the bubble cap thickness, a scaling law of the bubble lifetime is developed. Our findings may provide new insight on bubble and foam stability.</description>

      <title>Temporal decay of vortex line density in rotating thermal counterflow of He II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Horizontally ($\mathbf{\Omega} \perp \mathbf{v}_{\rm{ns}}$) and axially ($\mathbf{\Omega} \parallel \mathbf{v}_{\rm{ns}}$) rotating counterflow of superfluid $^4$He (He~II) generated thermally in a square channel is studied using the second sound attenuation technique, detecting statistically steady state and temporal decay of the density of quantized vortex lines $L(t,\Omega)$. The array of rectilinear quantized vortices created by rotation at angular velocity $\Omega$ strongly affects the transient regimes of quantum turbulence characterized by counterflow velocity $\mathbf{v}_{\rm{ns}}$, differently in both geometries. Two effects are observed, acting against each other and affecting the late temporal decay $L(t,\Omega)$. The first is gradual decrease of the decay exponent $\mu$ of the power law $L(t,\Omega) \propto t^{-\mu}$, associated with the fact that under rotation thermal counterflow acquires two-dimensional features, clearly observed and recently reported by us (Phys. Fluids \textbf{36}, 105121 (2024)) in the $\mathbf{\Omega} \parallel \mathbf{v}_{\rm{ns}}$ geometry. It exists in the $\mathbf{\Omega} \perp \mathbf{v}_{\rm{ns}}$ geometry as well, however, it is screened here by the influence of the effective Ekman layer built within the effective Ekman time of order seconds. For faster rotation rates $L(t,\Omega)$ gradually ceases to display a clear power law. Instead, rounded and ever steeper decays occur, gradually shifted toward shorter and shorter times, significantly shortening the time range for a possible self-similar decay of vortex line density. This effect is not observed in $\mathbf{\Omega} \parallel \mathbf{v}_{\rm{ns}}$ geometry, as here the much longer effective Ekman time of order minutes cannot affect the observed $L(t,\Omega)$ decay appreciably.</description>

      <title>A Unified Spectrum for Turbulence in Microfluidic Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a predictive master spectrum describing turbulence-like flows in microfluidic systems. Extending Pao's viscous-range closure, the model introduces (i) an adaptive inertial-range slope dependent on measurable dimensionless numbers and (ii) a physics-specific cutoff that captures entropy-producing sinks such as electrokinetic forcing, compliant walls, active stresses, and interfacial tension. This formulation unifies turbulence regimes -- electrokinetic, active, interfacial, and compressible -- within one compact expression. Comparison with reported data reproduces both spectral slopes and dissipation cutoffs while requiring only global observables (velocity, viscosity, Taylor microscale, and forcing strength). The framework provides a design-level predictive tool for turbulent microflows prior to computationally heavy DNS or CFD.</description>

      <title>Implications of the Four-Color Theorem on the Dynamics of N-Component Phase Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study phase separation dynamics of $N &gt;2$ immiscible fluid components. In two-dimensions, as a consequence of the four-color theorem in mathematics, there is a change in topological constraints for $N = 3$ and $N \ge 4$ components. This leads to a suppression of hydrodynamic effects and we show that the diffusion-dominated coarsening dynamics for $N \ge 4$ can be collapsed to a single master curve. The behaviour extends to thin three-dimensional systems as the fluid domain size reaches the smallest system dimension. However, by varying the fluid interfacial tensions, cloaking may occur, resulting in highly complex coarsening dynamics that can differ for each component. In full three-dimensional cases, the absence of the four-color theorem (or its equivalent) means that the diffusive scaling law is only reached asymptotically for large $N$ rather than at a certain critical $N$.</description>

      <title>Testing the consistency of the resonant wave interaction approximation with simulated dynamics of idealized 2D internal wave fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.02758v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear interaction and breaking of internal ocean waves are responsible for much of the interior ocean mixing, affecting ocean carbon storage and the global overturning circulation. These interactions may affect the observed Garrett-Munk wave energy spectrum, in addition to the recently explored interaction of waves with ocean eddies. According to the resonant wave interaction approximation, that is commonly used to derive the kinetic equation for the energy spectrum, the dominant interactions are between wave triads whose wavevectors satisfy $\mathbf{k}=\mathbf{p}+\mathbf{q}$, and whose frequencies satisfy $\omega_{\mathbf{k}}=|\omega_{\mathbf{p}}\pm\omega_{\mathbf{q}}|$. In order to test the validity of the resonant wave interaction approximation, we examine several analytical derivations of the theory. The assumptions underlying each derivation are tested using idealized direct 2D numerical simulations, representing near-observed energy levels of the oceanic internal wave field. We show that the slow-amplitude assumptions underlying the derivations are inconsistent with the simulated dynamics in this particular set of simulations. In addition, most of the triads satisfying the resonant conditions do not contribute significantly to nonlinear wave energy transfer in our simulations, while some interactions that are dominant in nonlinear energy transfers do not satisfy the resonance conditions. We also point to possible self-consistency issues with some derivations found in the literature.</description>

      <title>Neural equilibria for long-term prediction of nonlinear conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06933v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Neural Discrete Equilibrium (NeurDE), a machine learning framework for stable and accurate long-term forecasting of nonlinear conservation laws. NeurDE leverages a kinetic lifting that decomposes the dynamics into a fixed linear transport component and a local nonlinear relaxation to equilibrium. This structure provides a natural and principled interface between physics, numerical methods, and machine learning methodologies, enabling NeurDE to be viewed as a ``neural twin'' to Boltzmann-BGK. The transport step can be implemented efficiently in solvers such as lattice Boltzmann (LB), while the equilibrium is modeled by a neural network that maps macroscopic observables to a discrete equilibrium distribution. When integrated into a LB solver, the transport step becomes an efficient lattice streaming operation, and NeurDE yields a hybrid algorithm that robustly captures shock propagation and complex compressible dynamics over long time horizons. The NeurDE method is highly data-efficient: a small network trained on limited data generalizes far beyond the training regime, resolving shocks that evolve well outside the initial training distribution. Unlike traditional kinetic solvers, NeurDE achieves this accuracy without costly root-finding procedures or large velocity lattices. These results establish NeurDE as a scalable, efficient, and physics-informed paradigm for learning-based simulation of nonlinear conservation laws</description>

      <title>Supernovae drive large-scale, incompressible turbulence through small-scale instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07354v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The sources of turbulence in our Galaxy may be diverse, but core-collapse supernovae (SNe) alone provide enough energy to sustain a steady-state galactic turbulence cascade at the observed velocity dispersion. By localizing and analyzing supernova remnants (SNRs) in high-resolution SN-driven galactic disk cut-out simulations from Beattie et al. (2025), I show that isolated SNRs source incompressible turbulence through baroclinic vorticity generation localized at the unstable contact discontinuity. Through the spherical harmonic power spectrum of the corrugations, I provide evidence that this process is seeded by surface instabilities and 2D turbulence on the shell, which corrugates and folds the interface, becoming the strongest source of baroclinicity in the simulations. I present an analytical relation for a baroclinicity-fed incompressible mode (co)spectrum, which matches that observed in the simulated SNRs, and reveals a $k^{-17/20}$ spectrum that drives the turbulence. I show that vortex stretching allows for modes to be shed from the contact discontinuity into the surrounding medium and derive a timescale criteria for this process, revealing that young SNR with radii close to the cooling radius are efficient at radiating turbulence. The unstable layer produces a spectrum of incompressible modes $\propto k^{-3/2}$ locally within the SNRs. Through the inverse cascade mechanism revealed in Beattie et al. (2025), this opens the possibility that the $k^{-3/2}$ spectrum, arising from corrugated folds in the unstable layer, imprints itself on kiloparsec scales, thereby connecting small-scale structure in the layer to the large-scale incompressible turbulence cascade.</description>
