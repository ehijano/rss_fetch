      <title>Polynomial Property Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Property testers are fast, randomized "election polling"-type algorithms that determine if an input (e.g., graph or hypergraph) has a certain property or is $\varepsilon$-far from the property. In the dense graph model of property testing, it is known that many properties can be tested with query complexity that depends only on the error parameter $\varepsilon$ (and not on the size of the input), but the current bounds on the query complexity grow extremely quickly as a function of $1/\varepsilon$. Which properties can be tested efficiently, i.e., with $\mathrm{poly}(1/\varepsilon)$ queries? This survey presents the state of knowledge on this general question, as well as some key open problems.</description>

      <title>Better Indexing for Rectangular Pattern Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the complexity of building, given a two-dimensional string of size $n$, an indexing structure that allows locating all $k$ occurrences of a two-dimensional pattern of size $m$. While a structure of size $\mathcal{O}(n)$ with query time $\mathcal{O}(m+k)$ is known for this problem under the additional assumption that the pattern is a square [Giancarlo, SICOMP 1995], a popular belief was that for rectangular patterns one cannot achieve such (or even similar) bounds, due to a lower bound for a certain natural class of approaches [Giancarlo, WADS 1993]. We show that, in fact, it is possible to construct a very simple structure of size $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$ that supports such queries for any rectangular pattern in $\mathcal{O}(m+k\log^{\varepsilon}n)$ time, for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$. Further, our structure can be constructed in $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n)$ time.</description>

      <title>A Little Clairvoyance Is All You Need</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the classical problem of minimizing the total flow time of jobs on a single machine in the online setting where jobs arrive over time. It has long been known that the Shortest Remaining Processing Time (SRPT) algorithm is optimal (i.e., $1$-competitive) when the job sizes are known up-front [Schrage, 1968]. But in the non-clairvoyant setting where job sizes are revealed only when the job finishes, no algorithm can be constant-competitive [Motwani, Phillips, and Torng, 1994].
  We consider the $\varepsilon$-clairvoyant setting, where $\varepsilon \in [0,1]$, and each job's processing time becomes known once its remaining processing time equals an $\varepsilon$ fraction of its processing time. This captures settings where the system user uses the initial $(1-\varepsilon)$ fraction of a job's processing time to learn its true length, which it can then reveal to the algorithm. The model was proposed by Yingchareonthawornchai and Torng (2017), and it smoothly interpolates between the clairvoyant setting (when $\epsilon = 1$) and the non-clairvoyant setting (when $\varepsilon = 0$). In a concrete sense, we are asking: how much knowledge is required to circumvent the hardness of this problem?
  We show that a little knowledge is enough, and that a constant competitive algorithm exists for every constant $\varepsilon &gt; 0$. More precisely, for all $\varepsilon \in (0,1)$, we present a deterministic $\smash{\lceil \frac{1}{\varepsilon}\rceil}$-competitive algorithm, which is optimal for deterministic algorithms. We also present a matching lower bound (up to a constant factor) for randomized algorithms. Our algorithm to achieve this bound is remarkably simple and applies the ``optimism in the face of uncertainty'' principle. The proof relies on maintaining a matching between the jobs in the optimum's queue and the algorithm's queue, with small prefix expansion.</description>

      <title>Towards Constant Time Multi-Call Rumor Spreading on Small-Set Expanders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a multi-call variant of the classic PUSH&amp;PULL rumor spreading process where nodes can contact $k$ of their neighbors instead of a single one during both PUSH and PULL operations. We show that rumor spreading can be made faster at the cost of an increased amount of communication between the nodes. As a motivating example, consider the process on a complete graph of $n$ nodes: while the standard PUSH&amp;PULL protocol takes $\Theta(\log n)$ rounds, we prove that our $k$-PUSH&amp;PULL variant completes in $\Theta(\log_{k} n)$ rounds, with high probability.
  We generalize this result in an expansion-sensitive way, as has been done for the classic PUSH&amp;PULL protocol for different notions of expansion, e.g., conductance and vertex expansion. We consider small-set vertex expanders, graphs in which every sufficiently small subset of nodes has a large neighborhood, ensuring strong local connectivity. In particular, when the expansion parameter satisfies $\phi &gt; 1$, these graphs have a diameter of $o(\log n)$, as opposed to other standard notions of expansion. Since the graph's diameter is a lower bound on the number of rounds required for rumor spreading, this makes small-set expanders particularly well-suited for fast information dissemination. We prove that $k$-PUSH&amp;PULL takes $O(\log_{\phi} n \cdot \log_{k} n)$ rounds in these expanders, with high probability. We complement this with a simple lower bound of $\Omega(\log_{\phi} n+ \log_{k} n)$ rounds.</description>

      <title>Spectral Refutations of Semirandom $k$-LIN over Larger Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of strongly refuting semirandom $k$-LIN$(\mathbb{F})$ instances: systems of $k$-sparse inhomogeneous linear equations over a finite field $\mathbb{F}$. For the case of $\mathbb{F} = \mathbb{F}_2$, this is the well-studied problem of refuting semirandom instances of $k$-XOR, where the works of [GKM22,HKM23] establish a tight trade-off between runtime and clause density for refutation: for any choice of a parameter $\ell$, they give an $n^{O(\ell)}$-time algorithm to certify that there is no assignment that can satisfy more than $\frac{1}{2} + \varepsilon$-fraction of constraints in a semirandom $k$-XOR instance, provided that the instance has $O(n) \cdot \left(\frac{n}{\ell}\right)^{k/2 - 1} \log n /\varepsilon^4$ constraints, and the work of [KMOW17] provides good evidence that this tight up to a $\mathrm{polylog}(n)$ factor via lower bounds for the Sum-of-Squares hierarchy. However for larger fields, the only known results for this problem are established via black-box reductions to the case of $\mathbb{F}_2$, resulting in an $|{\mathbb{F}}|^{3k}$ gap between the current best upper and lower bounds.
  In this paper, we give an algorithm for refuting semirandom $k$-LIN$(\mathbb{F})$ instances with the "correct" dependence on the field size $|{\mathbb{F}}|$. For any choice of a parameter $\ell$, our algorithm runs in $(|{\mathbb{F}}|n)^{O(\ell)}$-time and strongly refutes semirandom $k$-LIN$(\mathbb{F})$ instances with at least $O(n) \cdot \left(\frac{|{\mathbb{F}^*}| n}{\ell}\right)^{k/2 - 1} \log(n |{\mathbb{F}^*}|) /\varepsilon^4$ constraints. We give good evidence that this dependence on the field size $|{\mathbb{F}}|$ is optimal by proving a lower bound for the Sum-of-Squares hierarchy that matches this threshold up to a $\mathrm{polylog}(n |{\mathbb{F}^*}|)$ factor. Our results also extend to the more general case of finite Abelian groups.</description>

      <title>Exact Optimization for Minimum Dominating Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Minimum Dominating Set (MDS) problem is a well-established combinatorial optimization problem with numerous real-world applications. Its NP-hard nature makes it increasingly difficult to obtain exact solutions as the graph size grows. This paper introduces ParDS, an exact algorithm developed to address the MDS problem within the branch-and-bound framework. ParDS features two key innovations: an advanced linear programming technique that yields tighter lower bounds and a set of novel reduction rules that dynamically simplify instances throughout the solving process. Compared to the leading exact algorithms presented at IJCAI 2023 and 2024, ParDS demonstrates theoretically superior lower-bound quality. Experimental results on standard benchmark datasets highlight several significant advantages of ParDS: it achieves fastest solving times in 70% of graph categories, especially on large, sparse graphs, delivers a speed-up of up to 3,411 times on the fastest individual instance, and successfully solves 16 out of 43 instances that other algorithms were unable to resolve within the 5-hour time limit. These findings establish ParDS as a state-of-the-art solution for exactly solving the MDS problem.</description>

      <title>On the Parameterized Complexity of Grundy Domination and Zero Forcing Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider two different problem families that deal with domination in graphs. On the one hand, we focus on dominating sequences. In such a sequence, every vertex dominates some vertex of the graph that was not dominated by any earlier vertex in the sequence. The problem of finding the longest dominating sequence is known as $\mathsf{Grundy~Domination}$. Depending on whether the closed or the open neighborhoods are used for domination, there are three other versions of this problem. We show that all four problem variants are $\mathsf{W[1]}$-hard when parameterized by the solution size. On the other hand, we consider the family of Zero forcing problems which form the parameterized duals of the Grundy domination problems. In these problems, one looks for the smallest set of vertices initially colored blue such that certain color change rules are able to color all other vertices blue. Bhyravarapu et al. [IWOCA 2025] showed that one of these problems, known as $\mathsf{Zero~Forcing~Set}$, is in $\mathsf{FPT}$ when parameterized by the treewidth or the solution size. We extend their treewidth result to the other three variants of zero forcing and their respective Grundy domination problems. Our algorithm also implies an $\mathsf{FPT}$ algorithm for $\mathsf{Grundy~Domination}$ when parameterized by the number of vertices that are not in the dominating sequence.</description>

      <title>Testing frequency distributions in a stream</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study how to verify specific frequency distributions when we observe a stream of $N$ data items taken from a universe of $n$ distinct items. We introduce the \emph{relative Fr\'echet distance} to compare two frequency functions in a homogeneous manner. We consider two streaming models: insertions only and sliding windows. We present a Tester for a certain class of functions, which decides if $f $ is close to $g$ or if $f$ is far from $g$ with high probability, when $f$ is given and $g$ is defined by a stream. If $f$ is uniform we show a space $\Omega(n)$ lower bound. If $f$ decreases fast enough, we then only use space $O(\log^2 n\cdot \log\log n)$. The analysis relies on the Spacesaving algorithm \cite{MAE2005,Z22} and on sampling the stream.</description>

      <title>Optimization with pattern-avoiding input</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04236v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Permutation pattern-avoidance is a central concept of both enumerative and extremal combinatorics. In this paper we study the effect of permutation pattern-avoidance on the complexity of optimization problems.
  In the context of the dynamic optimality conjecture (Sleator, Tarjan, STOC 1983), Chalermsook, Goswami, Kozma, Mehlhorn, and Saranurak (FOCS 2015) conjectured that the amortized search cost of an optimal binary search tree (BST) is constant whenever the search sequence is pattern-avoiding. The best known bound to date is $2^{\alpha{(n)}(1+o(1))}$ recently obtained by Chalermsook, Pettie, and Yingchareonthawornchai (SODA 2024); here $n$ is the BST size and $\alpha(\cdot)$ the inverse-Ackermann function. In this paper we resolve the conjecture, showing a tight $O(1)$ bound. This indicates a barrier to dynamic optimality: any candidate online BST (e.g., splay trees or greedy trees) must match this optimum, but current analysis techniques only give superconstant bounds.
  More broadly, we argue that the easiness of pattern-avoiding input is a general phenomenon, not limited to BSTs or even to data structures. To illustrate this, we show that when the input avoids an arbitrary, fixed, a priori unknown pattern, one can efficiently compute a $k$-server solution of $n$ requests from a unit interval, with total cost $n^{O(1/\log k)}$, in contrast to the worst-case $\Theta(n/k)$ bound; and a traveling salesman tour of $n$ points from a unit box, of length $O(\log{n})$, in contrast to the worst-case $\Theta(\sqrt{n})$ bound; similar results hold for the euclidean minimum spanning tree, Steiner tree, and nearest-neighbor graphs.
  We show both results to be tight. Our techniques build on the Marcus-Tardos proof of the Stanley-Wilf conjecture, and on the recently emerging concept of twin-width.</description>

      <title>A Tie-breaking based Local Search Algorithm for Stable Matching Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stable marriage problem with incomplete lists and ties (SMTI) and the hospitals/residents problem with ties (HRT) are important in matching theory with broad practical applications. In this paper, we introduce a tie-breaking based local search (TBLS) algorithm designed to achieve a weakly stable matching of maximum size for both the SMTI and HRT problems. TBLS begins by arbitrarily resolving all ties and iteratively refines the tie-breaking strategy by adjusting the relative order within ties based on preference ranks and the current stable matching. Additionally, we introduce TBLS-E, an equity-focused variant of TBLS, specifically designed for the SMTI problem. This variant maintains the objective of maximizing matching size, while enhancing equity through two simple modifications. In comparison with ten other approximation and local search algorithms, TBLS achieves the highest matching size, while TBLS-E exhibits the lowest sex equality cost. Significantly, TBLS-E preserves a matching size comparable to that of TBLS. Both our algorithms demonstrate faster computational speed than other local search algorithms in solving large-scale instances. Moreover, our scalability analysis shows that both algorithms maintain efficient performance as problem size increases.</description>

      <title>Achieving constant regret for dynamic matching via state-independent policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a centralized discrete-time dynamic two-way matching model with finitely many agent types. Agents arrive stochastically over time and join their type-dedicated queues waiting to be matched. We focus on state-independent greedy policies that achieve constant regret at all times by making matching decisions based solely on agent availability across types, rather than requiring complete queue-length information. Such policies are particularly appealing for life-saving applications such as kidney exchange, as they require less information and provide more transparency compared to state-dependent policies.
  First, for acyclic matching networks, we analyze a deterministic priority policy proposed by Kerimov et al. [2023] that follows a static priority order over matches. We derive the first explicit regret bound in terms of the general position gap (GPG) parameter $\epsilon$, which measures the distance of the fluid relaxation from degeneracy. Second, for general two-way matching networks, we design a randomized state-independent greedy policy that achieves constant regret with optimal scaling $O(\epsilon^{-1})$, matching the existing lower bound established by Kerimov et al. [2024].</description>

      <title>Tight Guarantees for Cut-Relative Survivable Network Design via a Decomposition Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04473v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the classical \emph{survivable-network-design problem} (SNDP), we are given an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$, non-negative edge costs, and some $(s_i,t_i,r_i)$ tuples, where $s_i,t_i\in V$ and $r_i\in\mathbb{Z}_+$. We seek a minimum-cost subset $H \subseteq E$ such that each $s_i$-$t_i$ pair remains connected even if any $r_i-1$ edges fail. It is well-known that SNDP can be equivalently modeled using a weakly-supermodular \emph{cut-requirement function} $f$, where we seek a minimum-cost edge-set containing at least $f(S)$ edges across every cut $S \subseteq V$.
  Recently, Dinitz et al. proposed a variant of SNDP that enforces a \emph{relative} level of fault tolerance with respect to $G$, where the goal is to find a solution $H$ that is at least as fault-tolerant as $G$ itself. They formalize this in terms of paths and fault-sets, which gives rise to \emph{path-relative SNDP}. Along these lines, we introduce a new model of relative network design, called \emph{cut-relative SNDP} (CR-SNDP), where the goal is to select a minimum-cost subset of edges that satisfies the given (weakly-supermodular) cut-requirement function to the maximum extent possible, i.e., by picking $\min\{f(S),|\delta_G(S)|\}$ edges across every cut $S\subseteq V$.
  Unlike SNDP, the cut-relative and path-relative versions of SNDP are not equivalent. The resulting cut-requirement function for CR-SNDP (as also path-relative SNDP) is not weakly supermodular, and extreme-point solutions to the natural LP-relaxation need not correspond to a laminar family of tight cut constraints. Consequently, standard techniques cannot be used directly to design approximation algorithms for this problem. We develop a \emph{novel decomposition technique} to circumvent this difficulty and use it to give a \emph{tight $2$-approximation algorithm for CR-SNDP}. We also show new hardness results for these relative-SNDP problems.</description>

      <title>Faithful universal graphs for minor-closed classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19582v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It was proved by Huynh, Mohar, \v{S}\'amal, Thomassen and Wood in 2021 that any countable graph containing every countable planar graph as a subgraph has an infinite clique minor. We prove a finite, quantitative version of this result: for fixed $t$, if a graph $G$ is $K_t$-minor-free and contains every $n$-vertex planar graph as a subgraph, then $G$ has $2^{\Omega(n)}$ vertices. On the other hand, we construct a polynomial size $K_4$-minor-free graph containing every $n$-vertex tree as an induced subgraph, and a polynomial size $K_7$-minor-free graph containing every $n$-vertex $K_4$-minor-free graph as induced subgraph. This answers several problems raised recently by Bergold, Ir\v{s}i\v{c}, Lauff, Orthaber, Scheucher and Wesolek.
  We study more generally the order of universal graphs for various classes (of graphs of bounded degree, treedepth, pathwidth, or treewidth), if the universal graphs retain some of the structure of the original class.</description>

      <title>Cycle-factors of regular graphs via entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is a classical result that a random permutation of $n$ elements has, on average, about $\log n$ cycles. We generalise this fact to all directed $d$-regular graphs on $n$ vertices by showing that, on average, a random cycle-factor of such a graph has $\mathcal{O}((n\log d)/d)$ cycles. This is tight up to the constant factor and improves the best previous bound of the form $\mathcal{O}(n/\sqrt{\log d})$ due to Vishnoi. Our results also yield randomised polynomial-time algorithms for finding such a cycle-factor and for finding a tour of length $(1+\mathcal{O}((\log d)/d)) \cdot n$ if the graph is connected. This makes progress on a conjecture of Magnant and Martin and on a problem studied by Vishnoi and by Feige, Ravi, and Singh. Our proof uses the language of entropy to exploit the fact that the upper and lower bounds on the number of perfect matchings in regular bipartite graphs are extremely close.</description>

      <title>$\mathrm{TIME}[t]\subseteq \mathrm{SPACE}[O(\sqrt{t})]$ via Tree Height Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a square-root space simulation for deterministic multitape Turing machines, showing $\mathrm{TIME}[t]\subseteq \mathrm{SPACE}[O(\sqrt{t})]$ \emph{measured in tape cells over a fixed finite alphabet}. The key step is a Height Compression Theorem that uniformly (and in logspace) reshapes the canonical left-deep succinct computation tree for a block-respecting run into a binary tree whose evaluation-stack depth along any DFS path is $O(\log T)$ for $T=\lceil t/b\rceil$, while preserving $O(b)$ workspace at leaves and $O(1)$ at internal nodes. Edges have \emph{addressing/topology} checkable in $O(\log t)$ space, and \emph{semantic} correctness across merges is witnessed by an exact $O(b)$ bounded-window replay at the unique interface. Algorithmically, an Algebraic Replay Engine with constant-degree maps over a constant-size field, together with pointerless DFS and index-free streaming, ensures constant-size per-level tokens and eliminates wide counters, yielding the additive tradeoff $S(b)=O(b+t/b)$. Choosing $b=\Theta(\sqrt{t})$ gives $O(\sqrt{t})$ space with no residual multiplicative polylog factors. The construction is uniform, relativizes, and is robust to standard model choices. Consequences include branching-program upper bounds $2^{O(\sqrt{s})}$ for size-$s$ bounded-fan-in circuits, tightened quadratic-time lower bounds for $\mathrm{SPACE}[n]$-complete problems via the standard hierarchy argument, and $O(\sqrt{t})$-space certifying interpreters; under explicit locality assumptions, the framework extends to geometric $d$-dimensional models. Conceptually, the work isolates path bookkeeping as the chief obstruction to $O(\sqrt{t})$ and removes it via structural height compression with per-path analysis rather than barrier-prone techniques.</description>

      <title>Fermion-to-Fermion Low-Density Parity-Check Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15323v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating fermionic systems on qubit-based quantum computers often demands significant computational resources due to the requirement to map fermions to qubits. Thus, designing a fault-tolerant quantum computer that operates directly with fermions offers an effective solution to this challenge. Here, we introduce a protocol for fault-tolerant fermionic quantum computation utilizing fermion-to-fermion low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. Our method employs a fermionic LDPC memory, which transfers its state to fermionic color code processors, where logical operations are subsequently performed. We propose using odd-weight logical Majorana operators to form the code space, serving as memory for the fermionic LDPC code, and provide an algorithm to identify these logical operators. We present examples showing that the coding rate of fermionic codes often matches that of qubit codes, while the logical error rate can be significantly lower than the physical error rate. Furthermore, we propose two methods for performing fermionic lattice surgery to facilitate state transfer. Finally, we simulate the dynamics of a fermionic system using our protocol, illustrating effective error suppression.</description>
