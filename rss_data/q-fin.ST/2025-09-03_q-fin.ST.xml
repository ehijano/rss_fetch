      <title>Multi Scale Analysis of Nifty 50 Return Characteristics Valuation Dynamics and Market Complexity 1990 to 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a unified, distribution-aware, and complexity-informed framework for understanding equity return dynamics in the Indian market, using 34 years (1990 to 2024) of Nifty 50 index data. Addressing a key gap in the literature, we demonstrate that the price to earnings ratio, as a valuation metric, may probabilistically map return distributions across investment horizons spanning from days to decades.
  Return profiles exhibit strong asymmetry. One-year returns show a 74 percent probability of gain, with a modal return of 10.67 percent and a reward-to-risk ratio exceeding 5. Over long horizons, modal CAGRs surpass 13 percent, while worst-case returns remain negative for up to ten years, defining a historical trapping period. This horizon shortens to six years in the post-1999 period, reflecting growing market resilience.
  Conditional analysis of the P/E ratio reveals regime-dependent outcomes. Low valuations (P/E less than 13) historically show zero probability of loss across all horizons, while high valuations (P/E greater than 27) correspond to unstable returns and extended breakeven periods.
  To uncover deeper structure, we apply tools from complexity science. Entropy, Hurst exponents, and Lyapunov indicators reveal weak persistence, long memory, and low-dimensional chaos. Information-theoretic metrics, including mutual information and transfer entropy, confirm a directional and predictive influence of valuation on future returns.
  These findings offer actionable insights for asset allocation, downside risk management, and long-term investment strategy in emerging markets. Our framework bridges valuation, conditional distributions, and nonlinear dynamics in a rigorous and practically relevant manner.</description>

      <title>Bridging Human Cognition and AI: A Framework for Explainable Decision-Making Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explainability in AI and ML models is critical for fostering trust, ensuring accountability, and enabling informed decision making in high stakes domains. Yet this objective is often unmet in practice. This paper proposes a general purpose framework that bridges state of the art explainability techniques with Malle's five category model of behavior explanation: Knowledge Structures, Simulation/Projection, Covariation, Direct Recall, and Rationalization. The framework is designed to be applicable across AI assisted decision making systems, with the goal of enhancing transparency, interpretability, and user trust. We demonstrate its practical relevance through real world case studies, including credit risk assessment and regulatory analysis powered by large language models (LLMs). By aligning technical explanations with human cognitive mechanisms, the framework lays the groundwork for more comprehensible, responsible, and ethical AI systems.</description>

      <title>Jump detection in high-frequency order prices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose methods to infer jumps of a semi-martingale, which describes long-term price dynamics, based on discrete, noisy, high-frequency observations. Different to the classical model of additive, centered market microstructure noise, we consider one-sided microstructure noise for order prices in a limit order book.
  We develop methods to estimate, locate and test for jumps using local minima of best ask quotes. We provide a local jump test and show that we can consistently estimate jump sizes and jump times. One main contribution is a global test for jumps. We establish the asymptotic properties and optimality of this test. We derive the asymptotic distribution of a maximum statistic under the null hypothesis of no jumps based on extreme value theory. We prove consistency under the alternative hypothesis. The rate of convergence for local alternatives is determined and shown to be much faster than optimal rates for the standard market microstructure noise model. This allows the identification of smaller jumps. In the process, we establish uniform consistency for spot volatility estimation under one-sided noise. Online jump detection based on the new approach is shown to achieve a speed advantage compared to standard methods applied to mid quotes.
  A simulation study sheds light on the finite-sample implementation and properties of the new approach and draws a comparison to a popular method for market microstructure noise. We showcase how our new approach helps to improve jump detection in an empirical analysis of intra-daily limit order book data.</description>

      <title>Agent Trading Arena: A Study on Numerical Understanding in LLM-Based Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language tasks, yet their performance in dynamic, real-world financial environments remains underexplored. Existing approaches are limited to historical backtesting, where trading actions cannot influence market prices and agents train only on static data. To address this limitation, we present the Agent Trading Arena, a virtual zero-sum stock market in which LLM-based agents engage in competitive multi-agent trading and directly impact price dynamics. By simulating realistic bid-ask interactions, our platform enables training in scenarios that closely mirror live markets, thereby narrowing the gap between training and evaluation. Experiments reveal that LLMs struggle with numerical reasoning when given plain-text data, often overfitting to local patterns and recent values. In contrast, chart-based visualizations significantly enhance both numerical reasoning and trading performance. Furthermore, incorporating a reflection module yields additional improvements, especially with visual inputs. Evaluations on NASDAQ and CSI datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method, particularly under high volatility. All code and data are available at https://github.com/wekjsdvnm/Agent-Trading-Arena.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Cryptocurrency Sentiment Analysis with Multimodal Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As cryptocurrencies gain popularity, the digital asset marketplace becomes increasingly significant. Understanding social media signals offers valuable insights into investor sentiment and market dynamics. Prior research has predominantly focused on text-based platforms such as Twitter. However, video content remains underexplored, despite potentially containing richer emotional and contextual sentiment that is not fully captured by text alone. In this study, we present a multimodal analysis comparing TikTok and Twitter sentiment, using large language models to extract insights from both video and text data. We investigate the dynamic dependencies and spillover effects between social media sentiment and cryptocurrency market indicators. Our results reveal that TikTok's video-based sentiment significantly influences speculative assets and short-term market trends, while Twitter's text-based sentiment aligns more closely with long-term dynamics. Notably, the integration of cross-platform sentiment signals improves forecasting accuracy by up to 20%.</description>
