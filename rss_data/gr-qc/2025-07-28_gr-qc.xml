      <title>Non-singular bouncing cosmology in $f(T, \mathcal{T})$ gravity with energy condition violations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The singularity and inflationary problems have posed significant challenges for understanding the universe's origin and evolution. Bouncing cosmology has emerged as a promising alternative to standard cosmological models, offering a non-singular approach to early universe dynamics by facilitating a "bounce" rather than a singular beginning. In this study, we explore the feasibility of modeling specific bouncing scenarios within the framework of $ f(T, \mathcal{T}) $ gravity, allowing for a comprehensive coupling between the torsion scalar $T$ and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor $\mathcal{T}$. We analyze two $f(T, \mathcal{T})$ models: a linear model $f(T, \mathcal{T}) = \alpha T + \beta \mathcal{T}$ and a non-linear model $f(T, \mathcal{T}) = \alpha \sqrt{-T} + \beta \mathcal{T}$, with a parameterized scale factor $a(t) = \sqrt{a_0^2 + \gamma^2 t^2}$ to capture the bounce behavior. The analysis confirms a cosmic bounce at $t = 0 $, where the Hubble parameter $H = 0$ signals a transition from contraction to expansion. A crucial condition for achieving the bounce is the violation of the null energy condition (NEC) near the bounce, enabling the equation of state (EoS) parameter to enter the phantom region ($\omega &lt; -1$). Both models exhibit an increase in energy density as the universe approaches the bounce, peaking at the bounce epoch and then decreasing post-bounce. Pressure remains negative throughout, with the EoS parameter crossing into the phantom region near the bounce in both positive and negative time zones. Our findings show that NEC and strong energy condition (SEC) violations are essential for the non-singular bounce, while the dominant energy condition (DEC) is satisfied, ensuring a consistent matter distribution...</description>

      <title>Doubly Separable Spacetimes and Symmetry Constraints on their Self-Gravitating Matter Content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A popular approach to constructing exact stationary and axisymmetric nonvacuum solutions in general relativity has been to use solution-generating techniques. Here we revisit a recent variant of the Newman-Janis-Azreg-Ainou algorithm, restricted to asymptotically-flat spacetimes, and demonstrate that this method exclusively generates Konoplya-Stuchlik-Zhidenko spacetimes. Therefore, the equations for geodesic motion and scalar-wave propagation are both separable. We call these "doubly separable" spacetimes. We identify a subclass of the spacetimes that might admit a separable Dirac equation by explicitly obtaining the Killing-Yano tensor. The high degree of symmetry in these spacetimes suggests that the self-gravitating matter must also be in specialized field configurations. For this reason, we investigate whether these spacetimes can even be sourced by arbitrary types of matter. We show that doubly separable spacetimes cannot be sourced by massless real scalar fields or perfect fluids, and that electromagnetic fields lead only to the Kerr-Newman family. Notably, this rules out the elusive spinning counterpart of the Janis-Newman-Winicour naked singularity spacetime, which contains a scalar field, as a member of this metric class. While the algorithm generates spacetimes with rich symmetry structures, valuable for studying phenomena like black hole shadows and quasinormal modes, our results highlight the need for caution when using it to construct physically consistent solutions with prespecified matter content.</description>

      <title>Horizon quantum geometries and decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is mounting theoretical evidence that black hole horizons induce decoherence on a quantum system, say a particle, put in a superposition of locations, with the decoherence functional, evaluated after closure of the superposition, increasing linearly with the time the superposition has been kept open. This phenomenon has been shown to owe its existence to soft modes, that is modes with very low frequencies, of the quantum fields -- sourced by the particle -- which pierce through the horizon, or also can be understood as coming from the interaction with the black hole described as a thermodynamic quantum system at Hawking's temperature. Here we investigate the effects of ensuing quantum aspects of the geometry itself of the horizon, in an effective perspective in which the quantum geometry of the horizon is captured by existence of a limit length or by horizon area quantisation. We show that the discreteness of the energy levels associated to the different geometric configurations might have strong impact on the results, in particular reducing the decoherence effects even to a negligible level in case of quanta of area $A_0 = \mathcal{O}(1) \, \, l_p^2$ or larger, with $l_p$ the Planck length.</description>

      <title>White dwarf structure in $f(R,T,L_m)$ gravity: beyond the Chandrasekhar mass limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the relativistic structure of white dwarfs (WDs) within the framework of modified gravity theory $f(R, T, L_m) = R + \alpha T L_m$, which introduces a non-minimal coupling between matter and curvature. Using a realistic equation of state (EoS) that includes contributions from a relativistic degenerate electron gas and ionic lattice effects, we solve the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations for two standard choices of the matter Lagrangian density: $L_m = p$ and $L_m = -\rho$. We show that the extra $\alpha TL_m$ term significantly alters the mass-radius relation of WDs, especially at high central densities $( \rho_c \gtrsim 10^8 - 10^9\,\rm g/cm^3)$, allowing for stable super-Chandrasekhar configurations. In particular, depending on the sign and magnitude of the parameter $\alpha$, the maximum mass can increase or decrease, and in some regimes, the usual critical point indicating the transition from stability to instability disappears. Our findings suggest that $f(R,T,L_m)$ gravity provides a viable framework to explain the existence of massive WDs beyond the classical Chandrasekhar limit.</description>

      <title>Effects of matter with anisotropic pressure on the Fan-Wang regular black hole shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We here investigate the consequences of an exotic fluid, exhibiting negative radial and tangential pressures, \emph{de facto} violating the Zel'dovich limit, on a regular solution that easily generalizes the Schwarzschild black hole. More precisely, we focus on the regular Fan-Wang spacetime, computing how the black hole shadow images, surrounded by the quoted fluid, is modified through the presence of \emph{negative} equations of state for the two pressure components. Even though quite different from quintessence, we consider constant radial and tangential equations of state with the aim of emulating, but not reproducing, dark energy effects. Moreover, we explore the main properties of infalling spherical accretion flows and, accordingly, the influence of the equations of state on the horizons, photosphere, and impact parameter of the Fan-Wang black hole. Afterwards, we examine the luminosities of the shadow and the photon ring in two distinct spherically accretion flows, as well as the observed specific intensity of the shadow itself. Last but not least, we physically interpret the impact of negative pressures on our findings and discuss possible extensions to the isotropic case.</description>

      <title>Radial oscillations of neutron stars in Starobinsky gravity and its Gauss-Bonnet extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starobinsky gravity, as one of the simplest and best-behaved higher-curvature gravity theories, has been extensively studied in the context of neutron stars over the past few decades. In this work, we investigate the adiabatic radial oscillation stability of neutron stars within the framework of Starobinsky gravity. We find that gravitational modifications can significantly impact stellar stability. Specifically, the higher-derivative nature of the theory causes the exterior spacetime to dynamically respond to fluid oscillations, in contrast to general relativity where Birkhoff's theorem ensures a static exterior. For stellar models with low central densities, the fundamental frequency becomes nearly independent of the central density when the coupling constant is large. For stellar models with high central densities, the transition from stability to instability still approximately occurs near the maximum-mass configuration, similar to the case in general relativity. Our main analysis is conducted in the Jordan frame of the scalar-tensor gravity equivalent to Starobinsky gravity, and we explicitly verify consistency with results obtained in the Einstein frame. We further extend our study to a class of Gauss-Bonnet extensions of Starobinsky gravity.</description>

      <title>Relativistic scalar dark matter drag forces on a black hole binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter around black holes can induce drag forces through dynamical friction and accretion, potentially affecting the orbital evolution and gravitational wave emission of binary systems. While dynamical friction from scalar field dark matter has been studied in the relativistic regime for single black holes, the case of a binary black hole (BBH) has remained unexplored. As a first step, we present a series of two-dimensional general-relativistic simulations of BBH in a wind tunnel for an asymptotically homogeneous scalar field background. We extract the drag forces, torque, mass and charge accretion acting on the binary, and analyze their dependence on the binary separation, velocity and the scalar field parameters. We find that the binary's drag is not a simple superposition of two isolated black holes; the presence of a companion modifies the gravitational wake and yields significant nonlinearities. This additional force and torque can (in principle) modify the inspiral and induce a dephasing of the gravitational wave signal.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By applying a particular kind of modified gravity, we study the inflation. Precisely, we extend our investigations beyond the Einstein's gravity to explore the Natural inflation model via the term $F(\phi)T$. We compute the inflation dynamics to derive the slow-roll parameters, i.e., the tensor-to-scalar ratio ``$r$'' and the scalar spectral index ``$n_s$''. This modified form of the gravity yields not only the predictions of the original models but also better-fitting with the Planck/BICEP/Keck data.</description>

      <title>Kalb-Ramond Black Holes Sourced by ModMax Electrodynamics: Some Perturbative Properties in the Phantom Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate and analyze a new class of electrically charged black hole (BH) solutions in Lorentz-violating gravity, where nonlinear ModMax electrodynamics is nonminimally coupled to a Kalb-Ramond (KR) two-form field. The spontaneous breaking of local Lorentz symmetry is triggered by a nonzero vacuum expectation value of the KR field, characterized by a small dimensionless parameter $\ell$. To incorporate both standard and phantom sectors, we introduce a discrete sign-flip parameter $\zeta = \pm1$, which flips the gauge-kinetic terms in the phantom ($\zeta = -1$) branch. Assuming a vanishing cosmological constant and a self-interacting potential with minimum $V' = 0$, we obtain exact analytical solutions for the metric function and electric potential. The resulting spacetime interpolates between Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstrom, and ModMax BHs, with curvature scalars showing deviations controlled by $(\ell, \gamma, \zeta)$. We study scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational perturbations using both frequency-domain (Pade-averaged WKB) and time-domain (Gundlach-Price-Pullin plus Prony) methods. We find that increasing either $\ell$ or the ModMax parameter $\gamma$ enhances the real and imaginary parts of QNMs, indicating higher oscillation frequencies and faster damping, especially in the phantom sector. The effective potentials deepen under phantom deformation, supporting more tightly bound modes. Furthermore, we analyze the greybody factors and compute the sparsity $\eta$ of Hawking radiation, which quantifies the nonthermal character of particle emission. We show that $\eta$ is significantly affected by $\ell$, decreasing with increasing Lorentz violation and asymptotically approaching a scaled version of the Schwarzschild value.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of noncommutative geometry-inspired dirty black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of noncommutative geometry-inspired dirty black holes, focusing on both non-extremal and extremal configurations. These gravitational objects, characterized by smeared energy distributions within a modified de Sitter-like equation of state, modify the classical Schwarzschild metric and regularize central singularities. We employ a spectral method based on Chebyshev polynomials to solve the eigenvalue problem for scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational perturbations. Our results reveal new overdamped modes indicative of rapid decay without oscillation, particularly prominent in near-extremal and extremal regimes. Additionally, we establish that the QNMs converge to classical Schwarzschild values for large mass parameters, validating our method's robustness. Our findings highlight the impact of dirtiness and noncommutative effects on black hole QNM spectra, offering potential observational signatures for distinguishing these objects in gravitational-wave detections.</description>

      <title>Short-Range Approximation to Casimir Wormholes Inspired by Scalar and Electric Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a static traversable wormhole sustained by a combination of a minimally coupled scalar field and an electric field, with exotic matter sourced by Casimir energy. Considering two scenarios, where the Casimir plate separation is either radially variable or fixed, we derive analytical near-throat solutions for both massless and massive scalar fields. To ensure consistency of the field equations, a thermal tensor is also incorporated, consisting solely of pressure terms that vanish at the throat. In all cases, we obtain well-behaved wormhole manifolds with throat sizes that scale proportionally with the number of elementary charges the wormhole can support.</description>

Abstract: Laser Interferometer Space Antenna LISA represents the next frontier in gravitationalwave GW astronomy targeting the detection of millihertz gravitational signals Central to LISAs operation is the nanosecondprecision estimation of the light travel times LTTs between its constituent spacecraft Precise LTT estimates are critical for suppressing dominant laser noise with timedelay interferometry TDI and ensuring the required sensitivity to GW signals The baseline method is to modulate a pseudorandom noise PRN code on the laser beams exchanged between the spacecraft Timedelay interferometric ranging TDIR was proposed as a simpler alternative LTT estimation method TDIR LTT estimates are chosen to minimize the TDI residual noise over the full LISA frequency band TDIR can be used in case of PRN failure or to calibrate the biases of the PRN method In this study we introduce modulationassisted TDIR MATDIR an enhanced variant of TDIR that significantly improves LTT estimation precision and resilience MATDIR achieves this by modulating the laser phase at specific frequencies close to 1Hz thereby artificially elevating the laser phase content relative to secondary unsuppressed noises This modulation strategy not only enhances the signaltonoise ratio for TDIR but also mitigates the impact of GW signals and instrumental artifacts enabling more reliable LTT estimates with reduced integration times We develop the theoretical framework of MATDIR incorporating the full constellation of three spacecraft laser locking and multiple Michelson TDI combinations Analytical predictions confirmed by numerical simulations indicate that MATDIR can achieve LTT estimates comparable to the 1mrms at fs 4 Hz of the PRNbased baseline method We therefore suggest that the possibility to modulate lasers is added to the laser system requirements of LISA</description>

      <title>Fermion quasinormal modes on modified RN background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noncommutative (NC) geometry may open an alternative route to quantum gravity. We study the influence of the spacetime noncommutativity on the Dirac quasinormal modes in the modified Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole spacetime. The framework for the latter study is provided by a certain effective model of gravity coupled to fermions which in itself encapsulates noncommutative deformation. This model describes a classical Dirac field coupled to a modified Reissner-Nordstr\"om geometry where the corresponding metric acquires an additional nonvanishing $r-\varphi $ component. As the earlier study shows, this model appears to be equivalent to a model of semiclassical NC gauge theory in which a NC gauge field is being coupled to a NC fermion field on the one side and the classical Reissner-Nordstr\"om background on the other. In comparison to the undeformed model where the Dirac field is coupled to the commutative Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole, the numerical results show that the oscillation frequencies and magnitude of damping of the Dirac quasinormal modes change to an extent that cannot be neglected. In fact, the influence of spacetime noncommutativity is shown to produce features reminiscent of a Zeeman-like splitting in the effective potential and quasinormal-mode spectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a general algorithm to construct a Hamiltonian, such that its dynamical flow covariantly defines any given spherically symmetric and static metric. This Hamiltonian is defined as a linear combination of the standard (general relativistic) radial diffeomorphism constraint plus a Hamiltonian constraint that is appropriately deformed as compared to its corresponding form in general relativity though it does not include higher-derivative terms. Therefore, given a static model of spherical gravity, it is possible to obtain its Hamiltonian, and, thus, its canonical (second-order) equations of motion. A particularly relevant application of this construction is the study of regular black holes, where proposed geometries often lack an underlying dynamical theory. The present method provides such a theory. In particular, for a wide class of deformations of the Schwarzschild geometry, we explicitly obtain their corresponding Hamiltonian. This construction can be further used to covariantly couple matter. In this way, one can analyze the backreaction of matter fields on the geometry of interest, and, specifically, whether a particular black-hole model may emerge as the end state of a dynamical collapse.</description>

      <title>Remnant properties of binary neutron star mergers undergoing prompt collapse</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the properties of remnants formed in prompt-collapse binary neutron star mergers. We consider non-spinning binaries over a range of total masses and mass ratios across a set of 22 equations of state, totaling 107 numerical relativity simulations. We report the final mass and spin of the systems (including the accretion disk and ejecta) to be constrained in a narrow range, regardless of the binary configuration and matter effects. This sets them apart from binary black-hole merger remnants. We assess the detectability of the postmerger signal in a future 40 km Cosmic Explorer observatory and find that the signal-to-noise ratio in the postmerger of an optimally located and oriented binary at a distance of 100 Mpc can range from ${&lt;}1$ to 8, depending on the binary configuration and equation of state, with a majority of them greater than 4 in the set of simulations that we consider. We also consider the distinguishability between prompt-collapse binary neutron star and binary black hole mergers with the same masses and spins. We find that Cosmic Explorer will be able to distinguish such systems primarily via the measurement of tidal effects in the late inspiral. Neutron star binaries with \emph{reduced tidal deformability} $\tilde\Lambda$ as small as ${\sim}3.5$ can be identified up to a distance of 100 Mpc, while neutron star binaries with $\tilde\Lambda\sim22$ can be identified to distances greater than 250 Mpc. This is larger than the distance up to which the postmerger will be visible. Finally, we discuss the possible implications of our findings for the equation of state of neutron stars from the gravitational-wave event GW230529.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Flux Emergence in Binary Neutron Star Remnants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using high-resolution AthenaK simulations of a twisted toroidal flux tube, we study the flux emergence of magnetic structures in the shear layer of a hot massive neutron star typical of a binary neutron star remnant. High-resolution simulations demonstrate that magnetic buoyant instabilities allow for emergence only for extremely large magnetic fields significantly exceeding $10^{17}~\mathrm{G}$, and more typical fields around $10^{16}~\mathrm{G}$ are instead dominated by hydrodynamic effects. Because merger remnants tend to be stable against hydrodynamic convection, our work places strong limitations on the mechanisms by which massive binary neutron star remnants can produce the magnetically-driven outflows needed to power jets.</description>

      <title>A New Framework to Detect Multi-Messenger Signals from Bright Sporadic Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The temporal dependence of the astrophysical stochastic gravitational-wave (GW) background (SGWB) in the hecto-hertz band brings a unique avenue to identify multi-messenger signals to these sources by using coincident detection in both GW and multi-band EM signals. We developed a new analysis pipeline, \textit{Multi-messenger Cross-Correlation} (MC$^2$) that can search for EM counterparts to the SGWB signal originating from both modeled and unmodeled sources by harnessing the nearly full-sky gamma-ray sky map. We provide an observation strategy that can be followed by current and future missions to discover EM counterparts to the weak GW signal hidden in the SGWB. We demonstrate the ability of this technique to drastically reduce the false alarm rates when involving EM multi-band analysis. This formalism aims towards advancing the multi-messenger observation frontier and improving our understanding of the population of bright SGWB sources present in the high-redshift universe and can also be applied to other messengers such as neutrinos in the future.</description>

      <title>Non-linear Dynamics and Primordial Black Hole Formation During Kination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of large scalar inhomogeneities during the kination epoch, a period in which the universe's dynamics are dominated by the kinetic energy of a scalar field, by fully evolving the Einstein equations using numerical relativity. By tracking the non-linear growth of scalar perturbations with both sub-horizon and super-horizon initial wavelengths, we are able to compare their evolution to perturbative results. Our key findings show that in the deep sub-horizon limit, the perturbative behaviour remains valid, whereas in the super-horizon regime, non-linear dynamics exhibit a much richer phenomenology. Finally, we discuss the possibility of primordial black hole formation from the collapse of such perturbations and assess whether this process could serve as a viable mechanism to reheat the universe in the post-inflationary era.</description>

Abstract: The recent fit of cosmological parameters by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration will have a significant impact on our understanding of the universe. Given its importance, we conduct several consistency checks and draw conclusions from the fit. Specifically, we focus on the following key issues relevant to cosmology: (i) the acceleration of the universe's expansion, which, according to the fit, differs over cosmological time compared to the standard cosmological model; (ii) the age of the universe, which appears slightly shorter than the age of the oldest stars; and (iii) the solution of the scale factor, both numerically and in an approximate analytical form.</description>

      <title>Universal structure of spherically symmetric astrophysical objects in f(R) gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03759v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $f(R)$ gravity is a well-known modification of General Relativity, that can be reduced to a scalar-tensor theory by a conformal transformation (Einstein frame). We study static spherically symmetric (SSS) asymptotically flat vacuum configurations of the $f(R)$ gravity in the Einstein frame for three known scalaron potentials. The main attention is paid to solutions in case of astrophysically relevant configuration masses and scalaron mass $\mu$ larger than several $meV$. Analytical and numerical analysis reveals remarkably similar properties of some elements of the SSS solutions for different $M$, $\mu$ and sizes of the scalarization region $r_0$. In particular, the scalaron field has universal behavior regardless of the configurations mass and $r_0&gt;100 r_g$ in case of each of the models considered. Moreover, some elements of the solutions are practically the same for the different models. Asymptotic parameters of the metric near the naked singularity at the center of the SSS configuration are obtained for all the models.</description>

      <title>Computing the graph-changing dynamics of loop quantum gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In loop quantum gravity (LQG), quantum states of the gravitational field are represented by labelled graphs called spinnetworks. Their dynamics can be described by a Hamiltonian constraint, which modifies the spinnetwork graphs. Fixed graph approximations of the dynamics have been extensively studied, but its full graph-changing action so far remains elusive. The latter, alongside the solutions of its constraint, are arguably the missing features to access physically correct quantum-relativistic phenomenology from canonical LQG. Here, we introduce the first numerical tool that implements graph-changing dynamics via the Hamiltonian constraint. We find new solutions to this constraint and show that some quantum-geometrical observables behave differently than in the graph-preserving truncation. This work aims at fostering a new era of numerical simulations in canonical LQG that, crucially, embrace the graph-changing aspects of its dynamics, laying aside debated approximations.</description>

      <title>Taming Thiemann's Hamiltonian constraint in canonical loop quantum gravity: reversibility, eigenstates and graph-change analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hamiltonian constraint remains an elusive object in loop quantum gravity because its action on spinnetworks leads to changes in their corresponding graphs. As a result, calculations in loop quantum gravity are often considered unpractical, and neither the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian constraint, which form the physical space of states, nor the concrete effect of its graph-changing character on observables are entirely known. Much worse, there is no reference value to judge whether the commonly adopted graph-preserving approximations lead to results anywhere close to the non-approximated dynamics. Our work sheds light on many of these issues, by devising a new numerical tool that allows us to implement the action of the Hamiltonian constraint without the need for approximations and to calculate expectation values for geometric observables. To achieve that, we fill the theoretical gap left in the derivations of the action of the Hamiltonian constraint on spinnetworks: we provide the first complete derivation of such action for the case of 4-valent spinnetworks, while updating the corresponding derivation for 3-valent spinnetworks. Our derivations also include the action of the volume operator. By proposing a new approach to encode spinnetworks into functions of lists and the derived formulas into functionals, we implement both the Hamiltonian constraint and the volume operator numerically. We are able to transform spinnetworks with graph-changing dynamics perturbatively and verify that volume expectation values have rather different behavior from the approximated, graph-preserving results. Furthermore, using our tool we find a family of potentially relevant solutions of the Hamiltonian constraint. Our work paves the way to a new generation of calculations in loop quantum gravity, in which graph-changing results and their phenomenology can finally be accounted for and understood.</description>

Abstract: The gravitational wave (GW) spectrum from the first-order phase transition can be characterized by a few phenomenological parameters but with high degeneracies in model/data distinguishments. In this paper, we look into the high-frequency power law of the GW spectrum with preliminary numerical simulations for both quantum and semiclassical pictures of vacuum decay. We first reveal an anticorrelation of the high-frequency power law to a certain power of the ratio between the wall thickness and bubble radius at the onset of bubble collisions, which can be further approximated analytically by some other phenomenological model characteristics to break the model degeneracy.</description>

Abstract: Static spherically symmetric (SSS) solutions of f(R) gravity are studied in the Einstein frame. The solutions involve SSS configuration mass M and scalaron mass $\mu$ (in geometrized units); for typical astrophysical masses, the dimensionless parameter $M\mu$ has very large value. We found analytic solutions on a finite interval for $M\mu\to \infty$ in case of a family of scalaron potentials. The asymptotically flat solutions on $(0,\infty)$ have been studied numerically for $M\mu$ up to $10^{20}$ in case of the quadratic f(R) model.</description>

Abstract: We investigate strong gravitational lensing by a marginally unstable photon sphere in a Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m naked singularity spacetime. Using the Picard-Fuchs equation, we derive full-order power series expressions for the deflection angle in various regimes, including the strong deflection limits from both outside and inside the photon sphere. We show that the deflection angle diverges non-logarithmically in both cases, refining existing asymptotic formulae. Comparing truncated approximations with numerical results, we find that higher-order corrections are essential to achieve comparable accuracy to logarithmic divergence cases. Using these improved formulae, we also derive precise approximations for image positions that are not restricted to the almost perfectly aligned cases.</description>

Abstract: This study investigates quantum gravity effects within the framework of an effective loop quantum gravity (LQG) black hole model parameterized by $\zeta$, utilizing precision measurements from solar system experiments and astrophysical observations. We analyze three classical tests of general relativity (GR): (1) Light deflection constrained by very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations of quasar radio signals, (2) Shapiro time delay measurements from the Cassini mission, and (3) Mercury's perihelion precession determined by MESSENGER mission data. Additionally, we extend our analysis to Earth-orbiting LAGEOS satellites and the relativistic trajectory of the S2 star orbiting the Galactic Center supermassive black hole Sagittarius $\rm{A}^*$ (Sgr $\rm{A}^{*}$). Our multi-probe approach reveals that the tightest constraint on the LQG parameter comes from Mercury's perihelion precession, yielding an upper bound $\zeta \lesssim 10^{-2}$. These results establish new observational benchmarks for probing quantum gravity effects.</description>

Abstract: Instrumental artefacts, such as glitches, can significantly compromise the scientific output of LISA. Our methodology employs advanced Bayesian techniques, including Reversible Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo and parallel tempering to find and characterize glitches and astrophysical signals. The robustness of the pipeline is demonstrated through its ability to simultaneously handle diverse glitch morphologies and it is validated with a 'Spritz'-type data set from the LISA Data Challenge. Our approach enables accurate inference on Massive Black Hole Binaries, while simultaneously characterizing both instrumental artefacts and noise. These results present a significant development in strategies for differentiating between instrumental noise and astrophysical signals, which will ultimately improve the accuracy and reliability of source population analyses with LISA.</description>

      <title>Light Rings, Accretion Disks and Shadows of Hayward Boson Stars in asymptotically AdS Spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we employ numerical methods to investigate the fundamental properties of Hayward boson stars and the optical appearance of their accretion disks in asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime. Our results show that variations in the negative cosmological constant significantly affect the relationship between ADM mass and frequency, the critical magnetic monopole charge, the size of the photon ring, and the kinematic characteristics of particles at the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO). Through ray-tracing studies of the accretion disk's appearance, we find that for non-frozen boson stars, the absence of an event horizon leads to multiple photon rings appearing within the central shadow region. In contrast, for frozen boson stars, the presence of a critical event horizon causes their images to resemble those of Schwarzschild black holes, with no additional photon rings appearing within the shadow region. Furthermore, the negative cosmological constant significantly alters the image structure: a smaller ISCO radius leads to photon rings being obscured at specific viewing angles, preventing their appearance within the shadow region.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the weak cosmic censorship conjecture by analyzing the dynamics of spinning timelike particles dropped along the rotational axis of an extremal Kerr (anti)de Sitter black hole. This idea was first considered in a seminal paper by Wald and later by Needham but both analyses were restricted to asymptotically flat spacetimes. We generalize these studies, involving spinning particles, to rotating spacetimes with non vanishing cosmological constant. We examine whether the absorption of such particles can overspin the black hole beyond extremality, potentially leading to the formation of a naked singularity. In asymptotically de Sitter spacetime, we find that particles that are captured cannot overspin the black hole. Similar conclusions hold also with anti-de Sitter asymptotics, but the analysis is more subtle, requiring careful consideration of the point particle approximation.</description>

      <title>Shear transport in far-from-equilibrium isotropization of supersymmetric Yang-Mills plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10706v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We holographically study the far-from-equilibrium isotropization dynamics of the strongly coupled $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills plasma. The dual gravitational background is driven to be out of equilibrium and anisotropic by a time-dependent change in boundary conditions. At late times, the system relaxes and asymptotically approaches a static configuration. The large initial energy densities accelerate the isotropization significantly compared to the initial geometry corresponding to the supersymmetric Yang-Mills vacuum. We analyze shear transport during isotropization by directly computing the time-dependent stress tensor, which is now a nonlinear function of the shear rate. The shear viscosity far from equilibrium displays much richer dynamics than its near-equilibrium counterpart. Moreover, we uncover that the equilibrium viscosity-to-entropy ratio at late times depends on the details of the quench function and the initial data, which could be due to a resummation of the hydrodynamic description. In particular, this ratio can be parametrically smaller than the Kovtun-Son-Starinets bound calculated from linear response theory.</description>

      <title>Gaussian generally covariant hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17152v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a version of fluctuating relativistic hydrodynamics in a way very different from the usual derivation: Instead of treating it as a coarse-grained deterministic theory expanded in gradients of equilibrium quantities, we treat it as a stochastic theory, characterized by partition functions in each cells, expanded in cumulants. We show that the Gaussian ansatz allows us, via the gravitational Ward identities acting as a constraint between the variance and the average, to maintain full general covariance, with hydrodynamic flow emerging as an approximate Killing vector. If the symmetry of relativistic hydrodynamics, volume-preserving diffeomorphisms, is preserved, we show that linear response formulae are also generally covariant. We discuss our results and argue that in this approach, the applicability of the effective theory is parametrized around a very different quantity than the Knudsen number, offering hope of understanding the applicability of hydrodynamics to small systems.</description>

      <title>Neutrino flavor instabilities in a binary neutron star merger remnant: Roles of a long-lived hypermassive neutron star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the post-merger evolution of binary neutron star merger (BNSM) requires accurate modeling of neutrino transport and microphysics including neutrino flavor conversions. Many previous studies have suggested that fast flavor instability (FFI) and collisional flavor instability (CFI) pervade inner regions of BNSM remnant, and they could impact on fluid dynamics and r-process nucleosynthesis. In this work, we re-examine prospects of occurrences of FFI and CFI using Boltzmann neutrino transport, assuming a frozen fluid background obtained from a numerical relativity simulation of BNSM. We pay special attention to a case involving a long-lived ($&gt;1\,$ s) hypermassive neutron star (HMNS). Apart from confirming the claim that these flavor instabilities can occur in BNSM remnants, some new insights are revealed. We identify multiple mechanisms responsible for generating electron neutrino lepton number (ELN) angular crossings, corresponding to a key indicator of FFI onset, which differ notably from those in black hole (BH) accretion disk systems. We argue that the appearance of positive chemical potential of electron-type neutrinos plays important roles on generating ELN angular crossings. For CFI, their growth rates are generally lower than FFI, but they can persistently occur in most of the accretion disk up to $\sim 1\,$ s. We also find that neglecting contributions of heavy-leptonic neutrinos results in overestimating growth rate and area of unstable regions of CFI. Our result suggests that FFI (CFI) tends to occur transiently (persistently) and locally (widespread in the disk), and FFI is more sensitive to the central compact object (HMNS or BH) than CFI, though more self-consistent simulations with incorporating effects of flavor conversions are needed to confirm these claims.</description>

      <title>Beyond Noether: A Covariant Study of Poisson-Lie Symmetries in Low Dimensional Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14942v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore global Poisson-Lie (PL) symmetries using a Lagrangian, or ``covariant phase space" approach, that manifestly preserves spacetime covariance. PL symmetries are the classical analog of quantum-group symmetries. In the Noetherian framework symmetries leave the Lagrangian invariant up to boundary terms and necessarily yield (on closed manifolds) $\mathfrak{g}^{*}$-valued conserved charges which serve as Hamiltonian generators of the symmetry itself. Non-trivial PL symmetries transcend this framework by failing to be symplectomorphisms and by admitting (conserved) non-Abelian group-valued momentum maps. In this paper we discuss various structural and conceptual challenges associated with the implementation of PL symmetries in field theory, focusing in particular on non-locality. We examine these issues through explicit examples of low-dimensional field theories with non-trivial PL symmetries: the deformed spinning top (or, the particle with curved momentum and configuration space) in 0+1D; the non-linear $\sigma$-model by Klim\v{c}\'ik and \v{S}evera (KS) in 1+1D; and gravity with a cosmological constant in 2+1D. Although these examples touch on systems of different dimensionality, they are all ultimately underpinned by 2D $\sigma$-models, specifically the A-model and KS model.</description>

      <title>Quantum Gravity Corrections to the Scalar Quasi-Normal Modes in Near-Extremal Reissener-Nordstr\"{o}m Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate quantum corrections to scalar quasi-normal modes (QNMs) in the near-extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole background with quantum correction in the near-horizon AdS$_2\times \mathrm{S}^2$ region. By performing a dimensional reduction, we obtain an effective Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity theory, whose quantum fluctuations are captured by the Schwarzian action. Using path integral techniques, we derive the quantum-corrected scalar field equation, which modifies the effective potential governing the QNMs. These corrections are extended from the near-horizon region to the full spacetime via a matching procedure. We compute the corrected QNMs using both the third-order WKB method and the Prony method and find consistent results. Our analysis reveals that quantum corrections can lead to substantial shifts in the real parts of QNM frequencies, particularly for small-mass or near-extremal black holes, while the imaginary parts remain relatively stable. This suggests that quantum gravity effects may leave observable imprints on black hole perturbation spectra, which could be potentially relevant for primordial or microscopic black holes.</description>

      <title>Nonperturbative effects in $T\bar{T}$-deformed conformal field theories: A toy model for Planckian physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a nonperturbative completion of two-point correlators in $T\bar{T}$-deformed conformal field theories (CFTs), and analyze their behavior at distance scales shorter than the fundamental length scale set by the $T\bar{T}$ deformation. Building on the interpretation of the $T\bar{T}$ deformation as a coupling to two-dimensional quantum gravity with a unique built-in length scale, we advance the study of $T\bar{T}$-deformed CFTs as a toy model for Planckian physics. As we probe shorter distances, trans-Planckian oscillations are followed by a super-Planckian regime in which correlations are typically suppressed by geometric randomness, in contrast to the power-law growth characteristic of CFTs. Moreover, their dependence on distance becomes exponentially weaker, suggesting that the underlying geometric structure has been largely erased -- a behavior broadly consistent with expectations for quantum spacetime in this regime.</description>
