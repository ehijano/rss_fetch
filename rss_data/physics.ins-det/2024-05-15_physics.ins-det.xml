      <title>Fine residual stress distribution measurement of steel materials by SOI pixel detector with synchrotron X-rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Residual stress is an important factor governing evaluating and controlling the quality of metal materials in industrial products. X-ray measurements provide one of the most effective means of evaluating residual stress without destruction. In such measurements, the effects of residual stress on the crystal structure can be observed through the Debye ring deformation.
  In previous studies, we developed a residual stress measurement system based on the $cos \alpha$ method, using a two-dimensional (2D) silicon-on-insulator pixel (SOIPIX) detector known as INTPIX4. In a typical laboratory setup, this system requires only 1 second to measure a specified point. This is drastically faster than the conventional system based on the $sin^{2} \psi$ method, which requires more than 10 min, and the $cos \alpha$-based system using an imaging plate, which requires 1 min. Compared to other systems, it can evaluate the 2D distribution of residual stress faster and provide more detailed information for evaluating materials. We first attempted to measure the 2D distribution in a laboratory setup with a Cr X-ray tube (Cr K$\alpha$ 5.4 keV) and obtained satisfactory results. We subsequently took measurements using synchrotron monochromatic X-rays to determine the fine accuracy and fine sampling pitch distribution. In this paper, we report the results of the initial synchrotron experiment, including the residual stress distribution of the standard specimen obtained by the first prototype setup. Furthermore, we compare the synchrotron measurements with those from the laboratory.</description>

      <title>X-ray imaging camera using INTPIX4NA SOIPIX detector with SiTCP-XG 10GbE based high-speed readout system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The silicon-on-insulator pixel (SOIPIX) detector is a unique monolithic-structure imaging device currently being developed by the SOIPIX group led by the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK). The detector team at KEK Photon Factory (PF) is also developing an X-ray camera using INTPIX4NA with a 14.1 $\times$ 8.7 $\mathsf{mm^2}$ sensitive area and 425,984 (832 column $\times$ 512 row matrix) pixels, with a pixel size of 17 $\times$ 17 $\mathsf{\mu m^2}$. The detector has high resolution and sensitivity for low-intensity X-rays, making it suitable for imaging in optical systems with lower X-ray intensities, such as an X-ray zooming microscope using two Fresnel zone plates (FZPs), which is also under development at PF. To enable imaging under such conditions, we developed a detector cooling system using a Peltier element to support longer exposure time (~0.5 seconds per frame). Additionally, we developed a new readout system using DAQ boards developed by PF, equipped with SiTCP-XG (network controller implemented on field-programmable gate array) that supports 10 Gbps Ethernet for high-frame-rate imaging at several hundred hertz. The new X-ray camera was tested at the PF BL-14A, BL-14B, and AR-NE1A experimental stations, and the resolution and sensitivity characteristics were confirmed. Given these confirmed characteristics, this X-ray camera is suitable for X-ray imaging using 5--20 keV X-rays under low-intensity, low-contrast conditions. These conditions are ideal for capturing soft tissues with poor contrast, objects with fine structures, and specimens vulnerable to radiation damage.</description>

      <title>Magnetic shielding simulation for particle detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cherenkov-type particle detectors or scintillators use as a fundamental element photomultiplier tubes, whose efficiency decreases when subjected to the Earth's magnetic field. This work develops a geomagnetic field compensation system based on coils for large scale cylindrical detectors. The effect of different parameters such as the size of the detector, the distance between coils or the magnetic field strength on the compensation using a basic coil system composed of circular and rectangular coils is studied. The addition of coils of very specific geometry and position to the basic configuration is proposed in order to address the compensation in the areas of the detector where it is more difficult to influence, in order to minimize the loss of efficiency. With such improvement, in the considered simulated system, more than 99.5% of the photomultiplier tubes in the detector experience an efficiency loss of less than 1% due to the effect of the magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>A Determination of the Local Gravitational Acceleration for the Tsinghua Tabletop Kibble Balance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kibble balance requires a measurement of the local gravitational acceleration, $g$, with a typical relative measurement uncertainty of $10^{-9}$. In this paper, the determination of $g$ for the Tsinghua tabletop Kibble balance is presented. A polynomial fitting method is proposed for blind transfers of the absolute gravitational acceleration using relative gravimeters, showing agreement with the value obtained by the tide correction within a few parts in $10^{9}$. Horizontal and vertical gravity gradients are extracted by mapping the gravity distribution at different heights. The self-attraction effect of major components in the experiment, as well as some time-varying systematic effects, are modeled. The final determination of the gravitational acceleration at the mass position, with a relative uncertainty of 5.4 $\mu$Gal ($k=2$), is achieved for the Tsinghua tabletop Kibble balance experiment.</description>

      <title>Characterisation and simulation of stitched CMOS strip sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In high-energy physics, there is a need to investigate alternative silicon sensor concepts that offer cost-efficient, large-area coverage. Sensors based on CMOS imaging technology present such a silicon sensor concept for tracking detectors. The CMOS Strips project investigates passive CMOS strip sensors fabricated by LFoundry in a 150nm technology. By employing the technique of stitching, two different strip sensor formats have been realised. The sensor performance is characterised based on measurements at the DESY II Test Beam Facility. The sensor response was simulated utilising Monte Carlo methods and electric fields provided by TCAD device simulations. This study shows that employing the stitching technique does not affect the hit detection efficiency. A first look at the electric field within the sensor and its impact on generated charge carriers is being discussed.</description>

      <title>A magnetically silent optically pumped magnetometer for a neutron electric dipole moment experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the performance of a magnetically silent optically pumped cesium magnetometer with a statistical sensitivity of 3.9 pT and a stability of 90 fT over 150 seconds of measurement. Optical pumping with coherent, linearly-polarized, resonant light leads to a relatively long-lived polarized ground state of the cesium vapour contained in a measurement cell. The state precesses at its Larmor frequency in the magnetic field to be measured. Nonlinear magneto-optical rotation then leads to the rotation of the plane of polarization of a linearly polarized probe laser beam. The rotation angle is modulated at twice the Larmor frequency. A measurement of this frequency constitutes an absolute measurement of the magnetic field magnitude. Featuring purely optical operation, non-magnetic construction, low noise floor, and high stability, this sensor will be used for the upcoming TUCAN electric dipole moment experiment and other highly sensitive magnetic applications.</description>

      <title>Initial Calibration of Large Timing Arrays for the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In preparation for HL-LHC operation a number of new detector systems are being constructed with timing precision on physics objects of &lt;50 picoseconds. These time stamps will reduce the level of pileup induced backgrounds in this LHC phase where the number of interactions per crossing will reach of order 100-200. In the case of CMS, three new systems have initially to be corrected for the usual amplitude walk resulting from the effect of variations in signal size on leading edge timing. In these systems the resulting timing spread (ie walk) ranges from one to four nanoseconds. In the following note we advocate approaching this initial calibration for walk as a calculable correction given early calibration during commissioning -- rather than depending on special collider data to perform the calibration. We derive a simple analytic expression for the walk correction and confirm its effectiveness with lab data.</description>

      <title>Validation of the VUV-reflective coating for next-generation liquid xenon detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coating detector materials with films highly reflective in the ultraviolet region improves sensitivity of the rare-event detectors that use liquid xenon. In this work, we investigate the MgF$_2$-Al-MgF$_2$ coating designed to achieve high reflectance at 175 nm, the mean wavelength of liquid xenon (LXe) scintillation. The coating was applied to an unpolished, passivated copper substrate mimicking a realistic detector component of the proposed nEXO experiment, as well as to two unpassivated substrates with "high" and "average" levels of polishing. After confirming the composition and morphology of the thin-film coating using TEM and EDS, the samples underwent reflectance measurements in LXe and gaseous nitrogen (GN2). Measurements in LXe exposed the coated samples to -100 $\deg$C for several hours. No peeling of the coatings was observed after several thermal cycles. Polishing is found to strongly correlate with the measured specular reflectance ($R_{\mathrm{spec}}$). In particular, 5.8(5)% specular spike reflectance in LXe was measured for the realistic sample at 20$\deg$ of incidence, while the values for similar angles of incidence on the high and average polish samples are 62.3(1.3)% and 27.4(7)%, respectively. At large angles (66\deg--75$\deg$), the $R_{\mathrm{spec}}$ in LXe for the three samples increases to 23(5)%, 80(8)%, and 84(18)%, respectively. The $R_{\mathrm{spec}}$ at around 45$\deg$ was measured in both GN2 and LXe for average polish sample and shows a reasonable agreement. Importantly, the total reflectance of the samples is comparable and estimated to be 92(8)%, 85(8)%, and 83(8)% in GN2 for the realistic, average, and high polish samples, respectively. This is considered satisfactory for the next-generation LXe experiments that could benefit from using reflective films, such as nEXO and DARWIN, thus validating the design of the coating.</description>

      <title>Estimating the detection of antineutrinos in the future Brazilian neutron source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17812v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In line with the tradition of employing nuclear reactors for neutrino physics research, we present potential experiments that could be undertaken using the new Brazilian neutron source, the Brazilian Multipurpose Reactor (RMB). This upcoming facility has clearly defined objectives, including the production of radioisotopes for the healthcare system, material irradiation testing, and research using neutron beams to investigate the micro and mesostructures of various materials. However, we anticipate that the RMB will generate up to $3,500$ antineutrinos daily, potentially expanding the facility's scope to include neutrino physics experiments involving beta and inverse beta reactions. The modern operational conditions of the RMB and its location in the Iper\'o-Brazil region may also enable neutrino oscillation experiments and the determination of the $\theta_{13}$ parameter, as well as support safeguards activities by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), allowing for the monitoring of nuclear fuel burning cycles and isotope fractions. We discuss the potential utilization of the RMB as an antineutrino source, proposing experiments and addressing associated technical limitations.</description>

      <title>3D surface profilometry using neutral helium atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11114v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional mapping of surface structures is important in a wide range of biological, technological, healthcare and research applications, including taxonomy, microfluidics and fabrication. Neutral helium atom beams have been established as a sensitive probe of topography and have already enabled structural information to be obtained from delicate samples, where conventional probes would cause damage. Here, we demonstrate empirical reconstruction of a complete surface profile using measurements from a scanning helium microscope (SHeM), using the heliometric stereo method and a single detector instrument geometry. Results for the surface profile of tetrahedral aluminum potassium sulphate crystals demonstrate the areas of surfaces and facet orientations can be recovered to within 5% of the expected values.</description>
