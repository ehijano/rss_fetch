      <title>Lepton Flavor Violation: From Muon Decays to Muon Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the unique potential of a high-energy muon collider to probe lepton-flavor-violating signals arising from physics beyond the Standard Model (SM). Low-energy, precision searches for charged lepton-flavor violation (LFV) are projected to dramatically improve their sensitivity in the coming years, and could provide the first evidence of new physics. We interpret the sensitivity of these searches in terms of a set of LFV operators in the SM Effective Field Theory. The same operators are then probed at the TeV scale by evaluating the projected reach of a muon collider while accounting for SM backgrounds and using a parameterized detector simulation. We find that for most operators, a muon collider could confirm signals if they are seen at future low energy experiments, whereas for certain flavor combinations it extends the reach to scales well beyond those accessible at lower energies. We also project the sensitivity of a muon collider to lepton flavor-violating decays of the SM Higgs boson and demonstrate improved sensitivity to $h \to e\tau$ and $h \to \mu\tau$ by an order of magnitude compared to the High-Luminosity LHC. The importance of having multiple, complementary probes is illustrated by considering both various combinations of operators and relative sizes of flavor-violating transitions between generations under various assumptions for the flavor structure of new physics.</description>

      <title>Constraining inhomogeneous energy injection from annihilating dark matter and primordial black holes with 21-cm cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cosmic dawn 21-cm signal is a highly sensitive probe of any process which injects energy into the intergalactic medium, enabling novel searches for anomalous energy injection by through dark matter interactions. In addition to modifying the global 21-cm signal, these processes would leave distinct imprints on the frequency-resolved 21-cm power spectrum with a morphology jointly set by the time- and spatial-dependence of energy emission and absorption. In this work, we extend the DM21cm code package, which models the effects of spatially inhomogeneous energy emission and deposition on 21-cm cosmology, to study three well-motivated scenarios which 21-cm measurements are particularly well-suited to probe: dark matter annihilation through $p$-wave processes, the Hawking radiation of light primordial black holes, and energetic emission from accreting solar-mass primordial black holes. We project sensitivities to each of these scenarios, demonstrating that leading or near leading sensitivity to each can be achieved through 21-cm probes. We also make public our updates to the DM21cm code package that enable it to accommodate energy injection processes for general continuum spectra with arbitrary spatial and temporal dependence in an accompanying release.</description>

      <title>Toward the Analytic Bootstrap of Energy Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a framework for the analytic bootstrap of three-point energy correlators, a crucial observable in $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory and quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Our approach combines spherical contour techniques, general physical constraints such as pole cancellations, and power correction data in the singular limits to determine its analytic expression. In contrast to previous bootstrap studies restricted to scattering amplitudes for supersymmetric theories, our framework makes use of the properties of Feynman integrals, marking a significant step toward bootstrapping realistic QCD observables. Using this method, we derive analytic expressions for leading-order three-point energy correlators with equal and unequal energy weights, where the latter are crucial ingredients for projected $N$-point energy correlators. We also apply the recently developed technique of analytic regression with lattice reduction as a way to bypass needing explicit expressions for the singular limits. Bridging theoretical advances in scattering amplitudes with the renewed interest in weighted cross-sections, our work opens the door to precision tests of QCD dynamics through analytic event-shape predictions.</description>

      <title>BBN bounds on neutrinophilic ultralight Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high densities in the early Universe provide a unique laboratory to constrain couplings between feebly interacting particles, such as dark matter and neutrinos. In this article, we study how Big Bang Nucleosynthesis can constrain models of Ultra-Light Dark Matter diagonally coupled to neutrinos. We follow an adiabatic formalism which allows to average-out the rapid oscillations of the Dark Matter field and consistently take into account the feedback between the neutrino and the Dark Matter fields. This feedback alters the early Universe dynamics, causing the Dark Matter energy density to scale as radiation, while the neutrino mass scales as $a^{-1}$. These two effects modify primordial element abundances by modifying interaction rates and the expansion rate during nucleosynthesis. Then, we use primordial abundances to obtain leading cosmological bounds on the coupling in the range $m_\phi/{\rm eV}\in (10^{-22},10^{-17})$, namely $g\lesssim 0.13(m_\phi/{\rm eV})$ for $m_\phi \gtrsim 3\times 10^{-20}\,\rm eV$ and $g\lesssim 1.8\times 10^{-11}\sqrt{m_\phi/\rm eV}$ for $m_\phi \lesssim 3\times 10^{-20}\,\rm eV$. This consistent cosmological treatment emphasizes that, in the mass interval where its physical assumptions hold, neutrino masses cannot be generated refractively by a direct coupling with an Ultra-Light Dark Matter field.</description>

      <title>BCS superconductivity in the presence of wave dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the established era of dark matter, condensed matter Hamiltonians-including those of superconductors-may require extension to account for the surrounding Galactic environment. We show that if dark matter is wave-like and couples weakly to electrons, superconducting parameters such as the gap and critical temperature become dynamical quantities that oscillate in time. This modifies the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer framework and produces distinctive temporal signatures whose sensitivity increases with longer measurement durations. Our results illustrate how condensed matter systems, traditionally treated as isolated from their cosmological environment, may acquire new dynamical degrees of freedom from their cosmic embedding. This, in turn, offers a novel window into the dark sector.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic study of $ss\bar{b}\bar{b}$ and $bb\bar{b}\bar{b}$ Tetraquarks using Regge phenomenology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the mass spectra of doubly strange-doubly bottom (ssbb) and fully bottom (bbbb) tetraquark states using the framework of Regge phenomenology. By modeling these tetraquarks as bound diquark-antidiquark systems, we employ quasi-linear Regge trajectories to study both orbital and radial excitations. Within this formalism, we derive linear and quadratic mass inequalities that impose constraints on the masses of ground and excited states of tetraquarks in the (J, M^2) plane. We further extend the analysis to radial excitations through the construction of Regge trajectories in the (n, M^2) plane. Our results show that this phenomenological approach offers a simple yet robust tool for describing tetraquark mass spectra, reproducing trends consistent with other theoretical predictions. The findings serve as valuable references for future experimental searches and may aid in the spin-parity classification of exotic hadrons. Overall, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of multiquark dynamics and hadron spectroscopy within the framework of Quantum Chromodynamics.</description>

      <title>Scrutinizing dark-matter scenarios with $B\to(K,K^*)\bar\nu\nu$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conceivable explanations of Belle-II measurements of a (surprising) excess of missing-energy decays of the $B$ meson to the $K$ meson not covered by standard-model neutrino-antineutrino pairs might be offered by additional contributions of dark-matter fermion-antifermion pairs. Assuming the excessive missing-energy events to be mediated by a (generic) scalar or vector boson, a simultaneous inspection of both of the missing-energy $B$ decays into a pseudoscalar $K$ meson or a vector $K^*$ meson allows to gain information on the nature of bosons relating standard-model and dark-matter sectors, irrespective of any (unknown) dark-sector details. Upon availability of indispensable experimental data, most prominent among such insights might be the identification of the mediator spin from the differential $B$-meson decay widths.</description>

      <title>Higher-order QCD and electroweak corrections for $t{\bar t}H$ production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate higher-order QCD and electroweak (EW) corrections for the associated production of a top-antitop quark pair and a Higgs boson ($t{\bar t}H$ production). Using soft-gluon resummation in one-particle-inclusive (1PI) kinematics, we present cross sections through approximate N$^3$LO (aN$^3$LO) in QCD and NLO in EW for $t{\bar t}H$ production at LHC energies. These aN$^3$LO QCD + NLO EW results provide significant enhancements over lower orders and a reduced scale dependence. Based on our results and current experimental data, we derive a constraint on the deviation of the top quark Yukawa coupling from the Standard Model value which is a probe of new physics beyond it. We also calculate top-quark differential distributions in transverse momentum and rapidity.</description>

      <title>Complete Classification of Domain Wall Solutions in the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric 2HDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a complete classification of domain wall solutions in the two-Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) with a global $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, categorised as superconducting, CP-violating, or neither, depending on the scalar particle masses and the ratio of the two Higgs doublets' vacuum expectation values. We demonstrate that any domain wall solution can be reduced to depend on only six of the eight general field components, with further field reductions possible within different regions of the parameter space. Furthermore, we show that the superconducting solutions can be used to construct stable, current-carrying domain walls in two spatial dimensions. Similarly, the CP-violating solutions allow for two-dimensional configurations where CP symmetry is locally broken on the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric wall, which could provide an out-of-equilibrium environment for CP-violating processes to occur.</description>

      <title>The Light Neutralino Dark Matter at Future Colliders in the MSSM with the Generalized Minimal Supergravity (GmSUGRA)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a detailed investigation of light right-handed slepton bulk regions, together with the Higgs- and $Z$-resonance regimes, in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) with Generalized Minimal Supergravity (GmSUGRA), focusing on the higgsino mass parameter scenario $\mu &lt; 0$, given that the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon may now be consistent with the Standard Model (SM) prediction. A systematic numerical exploration of the parameter space is carried out, where the bulk region is conservatively defined by the mass-splitting ratio \[ \mathcal{R}_{\tilde{\phi}} = \frac{m_{\tilde{\phi}} - m_{\tilde{\chi}_1^0}}{m_{\tilde{\chi}_1^0}} \gtrsim 10\%. \] In particular, we analyze the case in which the right-handed stau ($\tilde{\tau}_R$) emerges as the Next-to-Lightest Supersymmetric Particle (NLSP). We uncover a sizeable parameter space consistent with current experimental bounds, including limits from LHC supersymmetry searches, the Planck 2018 relic density measurement, and direct detection constraints on neutralino-nucleon scattering. This region naturally accommodates bulk annihilation channels mediated by right-handed sleptons. We obtain robust upper bounds on the masses of the lightest neutralino, $m_{\tilde{\chi}_1^0} \lesssim 143~\text{GeV}$, and the right-handed stau, $m_{\tilde{\tau}_R} \lesssim 158~\text{GeV}$. The identified bulk region lies within the prospective reach of forthcoming dark matter direct detection facilities such as LUX-ZEPLIN, as well as future high-energy $e^+e^-$ colliders including FCC$_{\text{ee}}$ and CEPC. Conversely, scenarios with the right-handed selectron as the NLSP have already been excluded by current LHC data. Furthermore, the parameter space consistent with our findings yields contributions to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, $a_\mu = (g_\mu - 2)/2$.</description>

      <title>Study of the Semileptonic Decay $\Lambda \to p\,\ell\,\bar{\nu}_{\ell}$ in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct a comprehensive study of the semileptonic decay process \(\Lambda \to p\,\ell\,\bar{\nu}_{\ell}\), focusing on the determination of all six vector and axial-vector form factors that govern the low-energy hadronic matrix elements of the underlying theory. These invariant form factors constitute the essential inputs for describing the decay, and their dependence on the momentum transfer \(q^{2}\) is analyzed across the entire physical kinematic region. To parameterize the \(q^{2}\)-dependence, we adopt both the \(z\)-expansion formalism and a polynomial fitting approach. Utilizing these parameterizations, we compute the exclusive decay widths for both the electron and muon channels and subsequently extract the corresponding branching ratios. Furthermore, we evaluate the ratio of decay widths between the muon and electron channels, defined as $R^{\mu e} \equiv \frac{\Gamma(\Lambda \to p\,\mu\,\bar{\nu}_{\mu})}{\Gamma(\Lambda \to p\,e\,\bar{\nu}_{e})}$, obtaining \(R^{\mu e} = 0.196^{+0.009}_{-0.012}\) from the polynomial fit and \(R^{\mu e} = 0.174^{+0.002}_{-0.005}\) from the \(z\)-expansion. While both ratios are compatible with previously reported values in the literature, the result from the \(z\)-expansion exhibits particularly strong agreement with the averages reported by the Particle Data Group (PDG).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electroweak properties of Dirac neutrinos within the context of the Minimally Extended Standard Model are explored. In particular, the dipolar form factors that result from the radiative correction, at one-loop level, of the $ Z\nu \bar{\nu}$ coupling are identified. The calculation is carried out in the covariant general gauge $R_{\xi}$. The results are shown to be independent of the gauge parameter. The outcome numerical evaluation establishes that the neutrino weak-magnetic dipole moment is of the same order of magnitude as the known prediction of the neutrino magnetic dipole moment.</description>

      <title>Type I + II Seesaw Model in light of the New Neutrino Oscillation Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global analysis of neutrino oscillation data slightly favors normal mass ordering. In this work, we investigate an extended scalar sector that naturally gives rise to a type I + II seesaw mechanism after spontaneous symmetry breaking and explore the interplay between collider physics and lepton flavor violation, adopting normal ordering. In particular, we focus on the rare muon decays $\mu \rightarrow e \gamma$ and $\mu \rightarrow 3e$ and the same-sign dilepton searches at LHC, a canonical signature of a doubly charged scalar. We conclude that neither the precise value of the sum of the neutrino masses, taken from DESI data that favors $\sum m_\nu=0.07$~eV, nor alternative cosmological fits which prefer a more relaxed limit $\sum m_\nu=0.1$~eV, significantly changes the theoretical prediction for these rare decays. However, we observe an interesting interplay between collider physics and lepton flavor violation depending on the choices of the vacuum expectation value of the triplet scalar. In particular, we find that $\mu \rightarrow 3e$ is more constraining than $\mu \rightarrow e\gamma$, and the $\mu \rightarrow 3e$ decay can yield a lower mass limit of $3$~TeV on the doubly charged scalar, surpassing current LHC constraint.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Searches for intrinsic electric dipole moments (EDMs) of nucleons, atoms and molecules are precision flavor-diagonal probes of new $CP$-odd physics, as motivated by the need to explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe. We review and summarise the effective field theory analysis of the observable EDMs in terms of a general set of $CP$-odd operators at 1~GeV, and the ensuing model-independent constraints on new physics. We also review and discuss the EDMs induced by $CP$-violation in the Standard Model, and the implications of EDM limits for various models of physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>A non-inflationary solution to the monopole problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic monopoles are a long-standing prediction of Grand Unified Theories, yet their efficient production in early universe phase transitions would lead to a monopole abundance that far exceeds observational limits. The standard solution of the problem invokes inflation occurring after monopole production, diluting their density to undetectable levels and eliminating any possibility of present-day observation. Here, we propose an alternative solution based on the breaking, in the early universe prior to Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, of the Weyl conformal symmetry of the gauge kinetic sector of the Lagrangian. This mechanism enhances monopole annihilation, thereby reducing their abundance to acceptable levels without requiring inflation. This scenario also predicts a residual flux of GUT monopoles potentially within the sensitivity of current and upcoming cosmic ray detectors, making their discovery possible in the near future.</description>

      <title>Finite-temperature stability from doublet inflation field with right-handed neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the augmentation of the Standard Model (SM) with another $SU(2)$ Higgs doublet and right-handed neutrinos. The second Higgs doublet ($\Phi_2$) is defined to be odd under the $Z_2$ symmetry, and hence, the lightest stable neutral particle from the additional doublet becomes the cold dark matter candidate. The right-handed neutrino field coupled to the Higgs field provides non-zero mass for the neutrinos. The inert doublet field coupled non-minimally to gravity as $\zeta_2 \Phi_2^\dagger \Phi_2 R$ also acts as an inflaton field. The inflationary bounds restrict the interaction couplings as $\lambda_2/\zeta_2^2 \approx 4\times 10^{-10}$. After inflation ends, the scalar bosonic degrees of freedom from the inert doublet can contribute to the electroweak phase transition. The strongly first-order phase transition bound, i.e., $\frac{\phi_{+}(T_c)}{T_c} \geq 1.0$ restricts the bare mass parameter of the additional doublet to $m_{22}=400.0$ GeV, demanding GUT scale perturbative unitarity for $Y_N=0.01$. The increase in $Y_N$ reduces the strength of phase transition, and it is no longer satisfied even for vanishing bare mass parameter. The Planck scale perturbative unitarity allows for the first-order phase transition, $\frac{\phi_{+}(T_c)}{T_c} \geq 0.6$, until $m_{22}=70.0$ GeV for $Y_N=0.01$, and none of the mass values satisfies the first-order phase transition for $Y_N=0.4$. The thermal corrections also affect the probability of tunneling from the false vacuum to the true vacuum, and hence, the finite temperature stability of the electroweak vacuum has been studied, including the finite-temperature effects.</description>

      <title>Diffusion wake: a distinctive consequence of the Mach-cone wake induced by supersonic jets in high-energy heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this Research Perspective, we briefly review the diffusion wake, a distinctive consequence of the Mach-cone wake induced by the supersonic jets in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. The diffusion wake depletes soft hadrons in the direction opposite to the propagating jet. According to coupled transport and hydrodynamic simulations, a valley in the 2-dimensional jet-hadron correlation in azimuthal angle and rapidity arises on the top of the multiple parton interaction ridge as an unambiguous signal of the diffusion wake induced by $\gamma$-jets in heavy-ion collisions. In dijet events with a finite rapidity gap, the rapidity asymmetry of the jet-hadron correlation has been shown to be a robust signal of the diffusion wake. The same rapidity asymmetry can also be applied to $\gamma$-jet events and both are background free. Experimental measurements of these signals can provide valuable insights into the properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formed in high-energy heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Revisiting constraints on magnetogenesis from baryon asymmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic fields in the universe potentially serve as a messenger of primordial physics. The observationally suggested intergalactic magnetic fields may be a relic of helical primordial $\mathrm{U}(1)_Y$ magnetic fields, which may also explain the origin of the baryon asymmetry of the universe. This scenario has been considered to be not viable, which we revisit as well as the baryon isocurvature problem for non-helical primordial $\mathrm{U}(1)_Y$ magnetic fields, based on the recent discussion on the hot electroweak theory. We find that maximally helical fields can be the origin of both the intergalactic magnetic fields and the baryon asymmetry of the universe and that there can be a window for non-helical fields to explain the origin of the intergalactic magnetic fields if the Higgs dynamics during the electroweak crossover compensate the helicity decay with a $\lesssim10^{-9\text{--}-10}$ precision.</description>

      <title>Soft-hard factorization of heavy-quark transport in QCD matter at finite chemical potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the collisional energy loss and momentum diffusion coefficients of heavy quarks traversing a hot and dense QCD medium at finite quark chemical potential, $\mu\neq0$. The analysis is performed within an extended soft-hard factorization model (SHFM) that consistently incorporates the $\mu$-dependence of the Debye screening mass $M_D(\mu)$ and of the fermionic thermal distribution functions. Both the energy loss and the diffusion coefficients are found to increase with $\mu$, with the enhancement being most pronounced at low temperatures where the chemical potential effects dominate the medium response. To elucidate the origin of this dependence, we derive analytic high-energy approximations in which the leading $\mu$-corrections appear as logarithmic terms: a soft logarithm $\sim\mu^{2}\ln(|t^{*}|/M_{D}^{2})$ from $t$-channel scattering off thermal gluonic excitations, and a hard logarithm $\sim\mu^{2}\ln(E_{1}T/|t^{*}|)$ from scattering off thermal quarks. In the complete result the dependence on the intermediate separation scale $t^{\ast}$ cancels, as required. We also confirm the expected mass hierarchy $-dE/dz(charm)&lt;-dE/dz(bottom)$ at fixed velocity. Our findings demonstrate that finite chemical potential plays a significant role in heavy-quark transport and must be included in theoretical descriptions of heavy-flavor dynamics in baryon-rich environments, such as those probed in the RHIC Beam Energy Scan, and at FAIR and NICA.</description>

      <title>One-loop expressions for $H^{\pm} \rightarrow W^{\pm} Z$ and their implications at muon--TeV colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One-loop contributions for decay process $H^{\pm} \rightarrow W^{\pm}Z$ within the Two-Higgs-Doublet Model are computed in the general $\mathcal{R}_{\xi}$ gauge, and its phenomenological applications at future muon--TeV colliders are studied in this paper. The analytic results are confirmed by several consistency tests, for example, the $\xi$-independence, the renormalization-scale stability and the ultraviolet finiteness of the one-loop amplitude. We first perform an updated parameter scan of the Type-X THDM in the phenomenological studies. The production of charged Higgs boson pairs at future muon--TeV colliders is investigated through the two processes $\mu^+\mu^- \rightarrow H^+H^- \rightarrow W^{\pm}W^{\mp}Zh$ and $\mu^+\mu^- \rightarrow \gamma\gamma \rightarrow H^+H^- \rightarrow W^{\pm}W^{\mp}Zh$. Both signal events and their significances are evaluated with taking into account the corresponding Standard Model backgrounds. We find that the signal significances can exceed $5\sigma$ at several benchmark points in the viable parameter space of the Type-X THDM.</description>

      <title>Probing Scalar-Mediated Sterile Neutrinos with Gravitational Wave and Colliders Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a UV-complete extension of the Standard Model in which a gauge-singlet scalar $S$ acquires a vacuum expectation value, generates a Majorana mass for a sterile neutrino $N$, and mixes with the Higgs field. This framework addresses neutrino masses via a seesaw mechanism and, for sufficiently large scalar mixing, can also drive a strong first-order electroweak phase transition, producing gravitational-wave (GW) signals potentially detectable by GW observatories. The Higgs-$S$ mixing also enhances sterile-neutrino pair production at colliders through $s$-channel exchange of the Higgs and $S$. Owing to the small active-sterile mixing angle, $N$ is generically long-lived, yielding characteristic displaced-vertex signatures. The combination of GW observations and displaced-vertex searches at colliders provides complementary cross-checks of the model parameter space.</description>

      <title>Searching for axion-like particles from tau exotic decays at the Super Tau-Charm Facility and its far detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leptophilic axion-like particles (ALPs) extend the Standard Model (SM) with brand-new interactions between the ALP and leptons. In this work, we focus on studying exotic $\tau$ decays to explore such ALPs. Both the tauphilic and lepton flavor universal (LFU) scenarios, with electroweak preserving and violating benchmarks, have been investigated at a future $\tau$-factory, namely the Super Tau-Charm Facility (STCF) under development in China. Both prompt and far detection are proposed, targeting on leptonic $\tau$ decays, $\tau^- \to \ell^-\bar\nu_\ell \nu_\tau a$. For prompt detection, the $\tau^+\tau^-$ threshold $\sqrt s=3.56$ GeV and higher central energy $\sqrt s=4.2$ GeV are taken into account. In addition, a cylinder-like far detector has been proposed to complement prompt detection. We demonstrate the huge potential to detect leptophilic ALPs at the STCF. Concretely, for tauphilic scenario, the STCF is mostly sensitive in the currently unprobed region with $m_a\sim 1000$ MeV. However, in the LFU scenario, the dilepton channel tremendously shortens the ALP lifetime, and eventually the STCF only allows a precise measurement in the new regime with $100~\text{MeV}\lesssim m_a\lesssim 200~\text{MeV}$.</description>

      <title>Decoupling hydrodynamization from thermalization via nonlinear Boltzmann equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The early thermalization puzzle arises from the unexpectedly early applicability of hydrodynamics in heavy-ion collisions. While hydrodynamics has traditionally been associated with the onset of local thermal equilibrium, its derivations -- whether microscopic or macroscopic -- rely instead on linearization around equilibrium. However, the linearization timescale -- the time at which a system's evolution begins to follow a linearized equation -- has not been systematically investigated. In this work, we employ the spectral nonlinear Boltzmann equation -- the lowest-order truncation of the spectral Bogoliubov--Born--Green--Kirkwood--Yvon (BBGKY) hierarchy -- to analyze the timescales of linearization and thermalization under three distinct truncation schemes. The first two truncations allow for analytic treatment via recursive spectral equations, while the third requires numerical methods for generic initial conditions. The analysis is performed for a homogeneous, massless system with a constant differential cross section. For this simplified setup, we find a robust separation: the linearization time is consistently about half the thermalization time ($\tau_{\mathrm{lin}}/\tau_{\mathrm{therm}} \approx 1/2$). This separation of timescales suggests an explanation for the early applicability of hydrodynamics and points toward a possible quantitative resolution of the early thermalization puzzle.</description>

Abstract: We present the first evaluation of resonance contributions to the charged-current (anti)neutrino-nucleon elastic scattering at GeV energies, focusing on the dominant $\Delta(1232)$ resonance. We approximate the vector part of the $N \to \Delta$ transition by the leading magnetic dipole term. Our results for the cross-section corrections at fixed neutrino energy indicate the permille-level contribution of resonance intermediate states to the elastic and radiative scattering cross sections. This calculation exhibits the expected infrared behavior of the invariant amplitudes and unpolarized cross sections. Our findings provide important insights into inelastic excitations in the charged-current (anti)neutrino-nucleon elastic scattering at GeV energies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning techniques are used to predict theoretical constraints such as unitarity and boundedness from below in extensions of the Standard Model. This approach has proven effective for models incorporating additional SU(2) scalar multiplets, in particular the quadruplet and sixplet cases. High predictive performance is achieved through the use of suitable neural network architectures and well-prepared training datasets. Moreover, machine learning provides a substantial computational advantage, enabling significantly faster evaluations compared to scalar potential minimization.</description>

      <title>Energy loss of heavy-flavor quarks in color string medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents preliminary estimates of heavy-flavor (HF) quark energy loss during its propagation through the non-equilibrated medium formed in minimum bias proton-proton (p+p) collisions at LHC energies. The study is inspired by the ongoing hot debates on whether tiny droplets of Quark-Gluon Plasma can be created in collisions of small systems. In this work, we model a p+p event with a fluctuating number of color strings originated from multi-pomeron exchanges. Considered longitudinal oscillations of strings dynamically initialize medium at each time step. Their varying overlaps create fluctuations in the color field energy density that governs the elastic scattering rate of HF quarks with the gluons present within the string volume. We calculate the transverse momentum dependence of the momentum loss for charm (anti-)quarks that are produced in initial hard scatterings and traverse the described environment. The simulation is performed using a developed hybrid approach on an event-by-event basis. Our results show significantly lower HF quarks energy loss compared to that obtained in the expanding hydrodynamic scenario of the new EPOS4HQ model.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an extension of the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) sum rules, termed the Resonance sum rules (RSR), to access resonance poles in the complex energy plane. By strategically introducing a contour in the complex plane and conformal mapping, the method intends to reach resonance poles on the second Riemann sheet. To validate this approach, we apply RSR to the square-well potential model, for which the pole locations are known. The analysis demonstrates a successful extraction of the pole positions and residues for both the $S$-wave and $P$-wave resonances. The results are in good agreement with the analytic solutions, with discrepancies within $5\%$ for the pole positions and $20\%$ for the residues.This framework provides a basis for future applications to realistic hadronic resonances, promising new insights into spectral properties of QCD.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24366v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate photon, pion, and rho-meson production from proton synchrotron radiation in the presence of strong magnetic fields. The proton decay widths and the luminosities of the emitted particles are calculated within a relativistic quantum framework that incorporates Landau quantization. A scaling rule is derived for the transition probability between different Landau levels. This allows an evaluation of transitions for extremely high Landau numbers exceeding $10^{15}$. Furthermore, we calculate the momentum distribution of the emitted particles by properly including the proton recoil effect associated with particle emission. The results differ significantly from conventional semiclassical approaches.</description>

Abstract: In QCD, the production of heavy quark-antiquark pairs can proceed through different mechanisms, each imprinting characteristic correlations between the heavy quarks. In this work, we use the EPOS4 event generator to study how these correlations affect quarkonium production in pp collisions. Our results demonstrate that the observed correlations between heavy mesons directly reflect the underlying production mechanisms and simultaneously shape the transverse-momentum distributions of quarkonia.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty in the time of arrival of ultra high energetic neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the light of the recent observation by the KM3NeT collaboration of an ultrahigh energetic neutrino, we analyse it in its rest frame, where shortly after creation of the neutrino a muon arrives and interacts. Since the neutrino is at rest we use (in this first analysis) a non relativistic Gaussian wave function, and consider its spread. Due to the finite size of the packet, the time of the interaction of the muon will have an uncertainty. This uncertainty is small in the neutrino rest frame, but boosted to our frame, increases 18 orders of magnitude, making it extremely large. This effectively prevents the possibility of the observation of bursts, or the correlation with other events. A similar analysis for less energetic neutrinos show that the uncertainty is smaller than the duration of the observed bursts.</description>

      <title>A brief introduction to dispersive methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These lectures aim to provide a basic introduction to dispersive methods and their modern applications to the phenomenology of the Standard Model at low energy. This approach exploits analyticity properties of Green functions and scattering amplitude, often combined with unitarity constraints. To find a logically coherent set of topics in this vast subject, I start with the two-point Green's function, show that this needs the three-point function as input which in turn needs the four-point function. The sequence stops here, just like these lectures, because the four-point function is related only to itself (if one ignores inelastic effects), I will discuss these dispersion relations both in the case of toy models, simple scalar theories, as well as in the phenomenologically relevant case of QCD.</description>

      <title>Focusing the Axion Wind with Ferrite Flux Concentrators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axion dark matter may couple to fermion spins through an effective oscillating magnetic field, the ``axion wind". Existing approaches for detecting axion wind via axion-electron coupling $g_{ae}$ face sensitivity limitations due to the extremely weak pseudomagnetic field generated, typically a few times $10^{-18}$ tesla for $g_{ae} \sim 10^{-10}$. We propose to use ferrimagnetic flux concentrators to amplify the pseudomagnetic field into a genuine magnetic field, which can then be measured using general precision magnetometry techniques. This greatly expands the experimental possibilities beyond conventional methods that rely on detecting small transverse magnetic fields from spin precession induced by axion wind. Here we utilize the libration mode of a levitated ferromagnet, which can achieve sub-femtotesla sensitivity, enabling detection of axion-electron coupling strengths $g_{ae} \lesssim 10^{-11}$ in the frequency range $1-500$ Hz.</description>

      <title>QCD phase diagram and thermodynamic properties of the non-extensive NJL model with chiral chemical potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the two-flavor NJL model with Tsallis non-extensive statistics, this work explores the QCD phase structure and thermodynamic properties under strong magnetic fields and chiral imbalance. The Tsallis parameter \( q \) captures non-equilibrium effects relevant to heavy-ion collisions. Key findings reveal that the pseudocritical temperature \(T_{\textrm{pc}} \) decreases with increasing \( q \), indicating that non-equilibrium conditions promote chiral symmetry restoration at lower temperatures. The chiral chemical potential \( \mu_5 \) significantly alters the magnetic response, with a transition from magnetic catalysis to inverse magnetic catalysis under certain conditions. For \( q&gt;1 \), non-monotonic behavior of \(T_{\textrm{pc}} \) with magnetic field \( eB \) emerges. Pressure becomes anisotropic under strong \( eB \), and the speed of sound exhibits a dip near \(T_{\textrm{pc}} \), shifting to lower temperatures with larger \( q \). These results highlight how non-extensive statistics, chiral imbalance, and magnetic fields collectively influence the QCD phase diagram and thermodynamic observables, offering insights for interpreting heavy-ion collision data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effect of the glasma fields, formed in the early stage of heavy-ion collisions, on the transport of $Q\bar{Q}$ pairs produced back-to-back. We find that for pairs with moderate initial transverse momentum $p_T$ evolving in glasma fields with sufficiently large saturation momentum $Q_s$, the azimuthal correlation $C({\Delta\phi})$ is quickly affected. The decorrelation widths $\sigma_{\Delta\phi}$ during the glasma and Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) phases are comparable.</description>

      <title>Lepton number violating signals of a parity symmetric model at $\mu$TRISTAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The parity solution to the strong CP problem necessarily extends the Standard Model to include the SU$(2)_{\rm R}$ gauge sector and imposes restrictions on the structure of the Yukawa interactions. In this framework, one can consider an appealing structure of the neutrino sector in which the smallness of the neutrino masses is naturally explained, while lepton number symmetry is substantially violated at the TeV scale. Observation of distinctive lepton number violating signals at collider experiments can therefore be expected, since the rates are not suppressed by the small neutrino masses. We study the constraints from neutrinoless double beta decay and discuss the prospects for discovering new TeV-scale particles, such as the $W'$ boson of SU$(2)_{\rm R}$, via lepton number violating processes at a $\mu^+ \mu^+$ collider, $\mu^+ \mu^+ \to W^+ W'^+$. A $\mu^+ \mu^+$ collider with a center-of-mass energy of 10 TeV can probe the $W'$ boson mass up to about 10 TeV through on-shell production, and the reach can extend to 16 TeV by studying processes involving off-shell $W'$ boson.</description>

      <title>The real-time QCD static potential at high temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a procedure to analytically calculate higher-order contributions to the high-temperature real-time static potential in QCD. It is based on the introduction of a semi-hard external scale, which lies between the hard scale (the temperature) and the soft scale (the screening mass), and the method of integration by regions. We calculate the leading and next-to-leading corrections in the region where bound states transit from narrow resonances to wide ones. The calculation involves both loop diagrams calculated in the Hard Thermal Loop (HTL) effective theory and power corrections to the HTL Lagrangian calculated in QCD. We also calculate the thermal corrections to the heavy quarkonium spectrum, and estimate the dissociation temperatures. We compare our results with recent lattice data and discuss their usefulness to guide lattice inputs in inverse problems.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Flux Tube Model Predictions from Charmed Mesons to Double-Charmed Baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing comprehensive experimental data on charmed mesons, we systematically investigate masses of the higher radial and orbital excitations of the $D$ and $D_s$ meson families using the relativistic flux tube model. Our study employs mass splitting induced by spin-dependent interactions within the j-j coupling scheme. Our predicted masses align well with the experimental measurements for the well-established $D$ and $D_s$ states. However, anomalous resonances such as $D_{s0}(2317)$ and $D_{s1}(2460)$ do not align with conventional meson states within our theoretical framework. Based on our reliable mass predictions for low-lying states, we propose spectroscopic assignments for several recently observed high-mass resonances: $D_2(2740)^{0}$, $D^*_3(2750)$, $D_0(2550)^{0}$, $D^*_1(2600)^{0}$, $D_1^*(2760)^0$, $D^*_J(3000)$, $D_J(3000)$, $D^*_2(3000)$, $D^*_{s1}(2860)^{\pm}$ and $D^*_{s3}(2860)^{\pm}$.Additionally, the resonance $D_{sJ}(3040)^+$ is identified as a $2P$ excitation with spin-parity quantum numbers $J^P = 1^+$. Extending our model, we also calculate the mass spectra of doubly charmed $\Xi_{cc}$ and $\Omega_{cc}$ baryons within the heavy-diquark-light-quark picture. These theoretical predictions provide crucial guidance for ongoing and future experimental searches for higher radial and orbital excitations in the charmed meson and doubly charmed baryon sectors.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Prevention of Topological Defect Formation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological defects can have significant cosmological consequences, so their production must be examined carefully. It is usually assumed that topological defects are produced if the temperature becomes sufficiently high, but in reality their formation depends on the post-inflationary dynamics of a symmetry-breaking scalar. We analyze the dynamics of a symmetry-breaking scalar field in the early universe within models that provide an effective negative mass term at the origin, and show that the symmetry can remain broken so that topological defects are never formed. In particular, we demonstrate that nonthermally produced particles (such as the Standard Model Higgs) during preheating can generate such an effective negative mass term, allowing the scalar field to follow a time-dependent minimum even in renormalizable models with a quartic coupling. We also discuss the implications of this result for the Peccei-Quinn scalar in axion models.</description>

      <title>High Reheating Temperature without Axion Domain Walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a cosmological scenario in which the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry remains broken in the entire history of the Universe, thereby avoiding the formation of axion strings and domain walls. Contrary to the conventional expectation, it is demonstrated that appropriately chosen scalar interactions are able to keep the PQ symmetry broken at arbitrarily high temperatures. We carefully examine the finite-temperature effective potential in a model with two PQ breaking scalar fields. The existence of flat directions plays a vital role in suppressing axion isocurvature perturbations during inflation by stabilizing a PQ field at a large field value. The viable parameter space consistent with theoretical and observational constraints is identified. Our scenario provides a minimal path for PQ symmetry breaking that addresses both the axion domain wall and isocurvature problems while permitting arbitrarily high reheating temperatures accommodating high-scale baryogenesis scenarios such as thermal leptogenesis.</description>

      <title>Direct detection of electromagnetically interacting ultraheavy dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At a level too faint for astronomy, particle dark matter may interact with Standard Model states via the photon. We derive limits from direct detection experiments on photon-mediated nuclear interactions up to operator dimension-6, viz., via a millicharge, charge radius, electric and magnetic dipole moment, and anapole moment, up to dark matter masses $\lesssim 10^{17}$ GeV, where detectors become flux-limited. We derive constraints for XENON1T, XENONnT, LZ, PANDAX-II, PANDAX-4T, DarkSide-50, DEAP-3600, PICO-60, and CDMS-II, and estimate future sensitivities for the multi-deca-tonne scale experiments DarkSide-20k, DARWIN/XLZD, PANDAX-xT, and Argo. Special attention is paid to millicharged dark matter, for which we constrain new parameter space by deriving the ceiling on sensitivity to its electric charge, arising from the nuclear-vs-electron recoil discriminants used in liquid argon and bubble chamber detectors. This result goes beyond ceilings previously identified in liquid xenon and semiconductor detectors from electron recoil vetoes. In particular, the ceiling from PICO-60 closes a large window between direct detection and neutrino experiment limits for dark matter masses below $10^{12}$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Vector dark matter production during inflation in the gradient-expansion formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A massive vector field is a highly promising candidate for dark matter in the universe. A salient property of dark matter is its negligible or null coupling to ordinary matter, with the exception of gravitational interaction. This poses a significant challenge in producing the requisite amount of dark particles through processes within the Standard Model. In this study, we examine the production of a vector field during inflation due to its direct interaction with the inflaton field through kinetic and axion-like couplings as well as the field-dependent mass. The gradient-expansion formalism, previously proposed for massless Abelian gauge fields, is extended to include the longitudinal polarization of a massive vector field. We derive a coupled system of equations of motion for a set of bilinear functions of the vector field. This enables us to address the nonlinear dynamics of inflationary vector field production, including backreaction on background evolution. To illustrate this point, we apply our general formalism to a low-mass vector field whose kinetic and mass terms are coupled to the inflaton via the Ratra-type exponential function. The present study investigates the production of its transverse and longitudinal polarization components in a benchmark inflationary model with a quadratic inflaton potential. It has been demonstrated that pure mass coupling is able to enhance only the longitudinal components. By turning on also the kinetic coupling, one can get different scenarios. As the coupling function decreases, the primary contribution to the energy density is derived from the transverse polarizations of the vector field. Conversely, for an increasing coupling function, the longitudinal component becomes increasingly significant and rapidly propels the system into the strong backreaction regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent note [1], J. M. Cline criticised our idea that, besides the known Higgs boson with mass $m_h=$ 125 GeV, the Higgs field $\cal H$ could exhibit a relatively narrow, second resonance with theoretical mass $(M_H)^{\rm Theor} = 690\,(30)$ GeV. His criticism addresses both the basic theory part as well as our phenomenological analysis, in which we show that the characteristic, experimental signature of the proposed new resonance may already be visible in various LHC data. As for the comparison with experiment, Cline altogether ignores our most recent article [2], except for its title, and limits himself to just show an old plot from a preprint from five years ago. For this reason, as far as the phenomenology is concerned, there is nothing to reply to. Instead, we will briefly reply to his criticism on the theoretical part. Our conclusion is that Cline has completely ignored basic aspects of our work.</description>

Abstract: We update our previous extraction of transverse momentum distributions of unpolarized quarks in the pion by implementing a more comprehensive description of theoretical uncertainties and, for the first time, by exploring possible differences among quark flavors. We extract such distributions from all available data for unpolarized pion-nucleus Drell-Yan processes, where the cross section is differential in the transverse momentum of the final lepton pair. The cross section involves transverse momentum distributions in the nucleon, that we consistently take from our previous studies.</description>

Abstract: The speed and fidelity of detector simulations in particle physics pose compelling questions about LHC analysis and future colliders. The sparse high-dimensional data, combined with the required precision, provide a challenging task for modern generative networks. We present a comparison between solutions with different trade-offs, including accurate Conditional Flow Matching and faster coupling-based Normalising Flows. Vision Transformers allows us to emulate the energy deposition from detailed Geant4 simulations. We evaluate the networks using high-level observables, neural network classifiers, and sampling timings, showing minimum deviations from Geant4 while achieving faster generation. We use the CaloChallenge benchmark datasets for reproducibility and further development.</description>

Abstract: It has been established in both high and low spacetime dimensions that existing constructions of entanglement islands, at least in the study of black holes, are all in the context of massive gravity. In fact, later studies realized that the graviton mass is not an accident and it is necessary for the consistency of the holographic interpretation for entanglement islands. An important lesson we learned from these studies is that the graviton mass is a manifestation of the deep relationship between quantum entanglement and emergent geometry (EPR=ER). Nevertheless, various interesting questions and counter-arguments exist regarding whether this connection is of any relevance, either by modifying the definition of entanglement islands or denying the graviton mass as a physically relevant concept. In this paper, we will revisit the necessity of graviton mass for the consistency of entanglement islands and address the above questions in and out of the literature. Since the calculations in higher dimensions are already well understood, we will start with a demonstration of massive islands in a frequently used lower dimensional model, AdS$_{2}$ Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity coupled with transparent conformal matter fields, for which the relationship between energy dissipation and the graviton mass manifests. We will then discuss the necessity of graviton mass for entanglement islands in general situations and clarify the physical meaning of graviton mass. In the end, we will comment on the attempts to construct entanglement islands in massless gravity and suggest the search for a new type of entanglement wedges in holography.
  The purpose of this paper is to summarize the recent progress, clarifying potential confusions and convey key messages to both experts and non-experts in the field.</description>

      <title>Gauging the Standard Model 1-form symmetry via gravitational instantons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the fate of the Standard Model (SM) $\mathbb Z_6^{(1)}$ electric $1$-form global symmetry in the background of gravitational instantons, focusing on Eguchi-Hanson (EH) geometries. We show that EH instantons support quantized $\mathbb Z_6^{(1)}$ fluxes localized on their $S^2$ bolt, inducing fractional topological charge without backreacting on the geometry. The requirement that quark and lepton wavefunctions be globally well-defined under parallel transport imposes boundary conditions, removing ill-defined fermion zero modes; the surviving spectrum is confirmed by an explicit solution of the Dirac equation and by the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index theorem. The Euclidean path integral in the EH background can be interpreted as a transition amplitude from an entangled state between two identical halves of space to the vacuum. Summing over all $\mathbb{Z}_6^{(1)}$ flux sectors in the path integral gauges the SM $1$-form symmetry; thus, it cannot persist as an exact global symmetry in the semiclassical limit of gravity. We further show that these fluxes induce baryon- and lepton-number violating processes, which are exponentially suppressed due to the smallness of the hypercharge coupling constant.</description>

      <title>Quantum Yang-Mills Charges in Strongly Coupled 2D Lattice QCD with Three Flavors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum properties of the truly gauge-invariant and conserved charges of two-dimensional Yang-Mills theories, focusing on lattice QCD in the strong coupling regime. The construction of those charges uses the integral version of the (1+1)-dimensional Yang-Mills equations, and they correspond to the eigenvalues of a charge operator. The gauge invariance of the charges suggests that they are not confined, hence hadronic states may carry them. Using the Feynman-Kac formalism, we evaluate the correlation functions of those charges on baryon and meson states through functional integrals over the gauge group SU(N) (N=2,3) and Grassmannian variables - the fermionic fields. Our results show that the expectation values of the lowest non-trivial charges are nonzero for baryon and meson states but vanish for non-gauge-invariant states, supporting the interpretation that hadrons indeed carry these charges. While renormalization effects and higher-order contributions remain to be analyzed, these findings point toward a potential link between gauge-invariant charges and confinement.</description>

      <title>Steady state of fast-oscillating neutrinos in an inhomogeneous medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The streaming of neutrinos in an inhomogeneous medium is known to affect the physics of flavor conversion. We employ an ensemble of single-crossed angular distributions and explore the physics of flavor conversion, while neutrinos propagate across a one-dimensional inhomogeneous medium. The advective term in the neutrino equations of motion is responsible for the cascade of flavor waves towards ever smaller spatial and angular scales. However, as the system evolves, perturbations with large wavenumbers are damped, with a resulting smearing of the flavor configuration. We provide a simple recipe that allows to forecast the steady-state flavor configuration achieved by neutrinos without solving their kinetic equations. In particular, we find that flavor equipartition on one side of the angular spectrum and the cancellation of the spectral crossing in the lepton number distributions, proposed in the literature as generic flavor outcome, is a special solution depending on the degree of neutrino-antineutrino asymmetry. This work constitutes a step forward towards the development of semi-analytic schemes to account for flavor conversion physics in hydrodynamic simulations of core-collapse supernovae and neutron-star merger remnants.</description>

      <title>Regularized Lednicky-Lyuboshitz formula for higher-partial waves in femtoscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Femtoscopy is one of the promising experimental approaches to put constraints on interactions between various species of hadrons from the momentum correlation functions measured in high-energy nuclear collision experiments. The Koonin-Pratt and Lednicky-Lyuboshitz formulae provide useful expressions of the correlation functions and have been widely used to analyze the experimental data based on the assumption that the effect of higher partial waves is negligible. Those formulae can be generalized for higher partial waves, but the generalized Lednicky-Lyuboshitz formula produces wrong results due to a singular behavior of the asymptotic wave function at the origin. In this study, we attempt to solve the problem by regularizing the generalized Lednicky-Lyuboshitz formula with a cutoff and validate it using the Koonin-Pratt formula as a reference. We also show the relationship between the cutoff in the regularized Lednicky-Lyuboshitz and the effective-range correction in the original Lednicky-Lyuboshitz formula. Using the obtained formula, we investigate the source-size dependence, the validity of the effective range expansion, and the cutoff dependence of the correlation function. We also discuss the interaction dependence using the heatmap as a function of the scattering-length parameter $1/a_l$ and the momentum $q$.</description>

      <title>Exploring parameter dependence of heavy-flavor dynamics in small collision systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations from high-multiplicity proton-lead ($p$-Pb) collisions indicate that small systems may exhibit collective behavior in both heavy and light hadrons. This work investigates the roles of initial- and final-state interactions in shaping the nuclear modification factor and elliptic flow of $D$ mesons measured in $p$-Pb collisions. Initial-state effects, including the Cronin and shadowing effects, are considered in the heavy-quark initial conditions, while final-state interactions are simulated through Langevin evolution combined with the coalescence model of hadronization. Different initial geometries attributed to fluctuations in the medium's energy density are parametrized and translated into the momentum anisotropies of both light and heavy quarks. The corresponding $R_{pPb}$ and $v_2$ of D mesons in 8.16 TeV $p$-Pb collisions are calculated under different assumptions for the final-state interactions. Assuming that the initial-state effects only modify the transverse momentum spectra without altering the azimuthal distribution of heavy quarks, the measured $R_{pPb}$ of D mesons can be qualitatively reproduced by the combined influence of initial- and final-state effects. However, the observed $v_2$ cannot be accounted for by final-state interactions alone. These results suggest that additional contributions to azimuthal anisotropies of heavy quarks originating from initial-state effects are required to explain the experimentally observed $v_2$.</description>

      <title>Constraining Inflationary Particle Production with CMB Polarization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inflation generates correlated temperature ($T$) and polarization ($E$-mode) fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), which differ only by their transfer functions. Following Philcox et al. (2025), we investigate a scenario with a massive partner to the inflaton ($\mathcal{O}(100)$ times the inflationary Hubble scale), in which particles are produced during a narrow time period, leaving characteristic hot- or cold-spots in the CMB. Using tools developed for thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich cluster-finding, we search component-separated $\textit{Planck}$ PR4 $E$-mode maps for these hotspots, and compare to analogous results in $T$. Our analysis pipeline is validated on simulated observations and gives unbiased constraints for sufficiently large and bright hotspots. We find no strong evidence for primordial hotspots and thereby place novel bounds on the marginal and relevant coupling between the inflaton and massive scalars during inflation, probing physics at energies many orders of magnitude above any feasible terrestrial collider. Due to the large noise in $\textit{Planck}$ polarization, the temperature data dominate constraints for small hotspots, but for sufficiently large hotspots, our bounds improve on those of Philcox et al. (2025) by $\sim 25\%$. We also forecast the inferred bounds on inflationary physics for a search using Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) data, and from an optimistic cosmic-variance-limited experiment (CV), for which $E$-mode data provide stronger constraints than $T$ on nearly all scales. ACT should improve on the $\textit{Planck}$ constraints by $\gtrsim25\%$, nearing the CV limit on intermediate scales. Finally, we compare the constraining power of localized searches to that of a power spectrum analysis, and demonstrate that for sufficiently few produced particles the localized search performed herein is dominant.</description>

      <title>Vector Horndeski black holes in nonlinear electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On a spherically symmetric and static background, we study the existence of linearly stable black hole (BH) solutions in nonlinear electrodynamics (NED) with a Horndeski vector-tensor (HVT) coupling, with and without curvature singularities at the center ($r=0$). Incorporating the electric charge $q_E$ and the magnetic charge $q_M$, we first show that nonsingular BHs can exist only if $q_M = 0$. We then study the stability of purely electric BHs by analyzing the behavior of perturbations in the metric and the vector field. Nonsingular electric BHs are unstable due to a Laplacian instability in the vector perturbation near the regular center. In the absence of the HVT coupling ($\beta=0$), singular BHs in power-law NED theories can be consistent with all linear stability conditions, while Born-Infeld BHs encounter strong coupling due to a vanishing propagation speed as $r \to 0$. In power-law NED and Born-Infeld theories with $\beta \neq 0$, the electric fields for singular BHs are regular near $r=0$, while the metric functions behave as $\propto r^{-1}$. Nevertheless, we show that Laplacian instabilities occur for regions inside the outer horizon $r_h$, unless the HVT coupling constant $\beta$ is significantly smaller than $r_h^2$. For $\beta \neq 0$, we also reconstruct the NED Lagrangian so that one of the metric functions takes the Reissner-Nordstr\"om form. In this case, there exists a branch where all squared propagation speeds are positive, but the ghost and strong coupling problems are present around the BH center. Thus, the dominance of the HVT coupling generally leads to BH instability in the high-curvature regime.</description>

      <title>Emergence of General Relativity from Cosmological Constant Via Ghost Condensation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that starting with a cosmological constant in a curved space-time, the Einstein-Hilbert term of general relativity is generated through a ghost condensation. We fix Weyl symmetry, or equivalently local scale symmetry by a gauge condition $R = 0$ \`{a} la BRST formalism, and see that the condensation of the Faddeev-Popov ghosts, $\langle \bar c c \rangle \neq 0$ leads to a generation of the Einstein-Hilbert action of general relativity. This dynamical mechanism of symmetry breakdown for a global scale symmetry is new in the sense that the reduction of fermionic degrees of freedom effectively leads to a generation of bosonic degrees of freedom. We also discuss this mechanism from the viewpoint of the problem of a bound state, and show that asymptotic fields corresponding to the bound states are ``confined'' to the unphysical Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Quantum Resonance Beyond Direct Measurement: Insights from Weak Measurement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aharonov's weak value amplification realized via weak measurement provides a versatile means to measure physical parameters with high accuracy, similar to quantum resonance epitomized by the Rabi and Ramsey resonances. The similarity between the two is not accidental: in fact, these two methods of precision measurement have recently been shown to be interconnected for the particular case of direct weak measurement. Here we show that this connection also holds in the case of indirect weak measurement, which is the standard scheme used mostly for studies of weak value amplification. We present a unified framework of weak measurements in which direct measurement appears as a special case of indirect measurement. This allows us to compare the measurement precision of different methods on a common basis, as demonstrated explicitly for the Rabi and Ramsey resonances, showing how the precision of the latter surpasses that of the former in the context of weak value amplification.</description>

Abstract: Scalar-tensor gravity represents a natural extension of general relativity. Testing such models experimentally provides a crucial pathway to probing physics at high-energy scales, particularly in the context of string theory. This paper investigates a string-theory-inspired scalar-tensor gravity -- the dilaton model -- and identifies regions of its parameter space potentially constrained by gravitational redshift experiments in future. By further modeling the mass distribution in low-density environments with a discrete representation, we go beyond the standard continuous approximation. Despite limitations inherent to specific experimental configurations, our analysis reveals that a significant portion of the parameter space remains accessible. Consequently, high-precision gravitational redshift experiments hold the potential to exclude significant regions of this parameter space in future.</description>

Abstract: We present a lattice QCD calculation of the S-wave interactions between the spin-1/2 doubly charmed baryons ($\Xi_{cc},\Omega_{cc}$) and Goldstone bosons ($\pi,K,\bar{K}$) using the $N_f=2+1$ CLQCD ensembles with lattice spacing $a = 0.07746$ fm and two pion masses $M_\pi \simeq 210$ and 300 MeV. Four single-channel interactions, $I=1/2$ $\Omega_{cc}\bar{K}$, $I=1$ $\Xi_{cc}K$, $I=0$ $\Xi_{cc}K$ and $I=3/2$ $\Xi_{cc}\pi$, are investigated, since they are free of disconnected diagrams. L\"uscher's finite volume method is utilized to extract the scattering parameters in the effective range expansion, i.e., the scattering lengths and effective ranges, from the finite-volume spectra. Our obtained results agree well with previous baryon chiral perturbation theory predictions.</description>

      <title>Finite-volume formalism for $N\pi\pi$ at maximal isospin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the relativistic field theoretic finite-volume formalism to $N \pi \pi$ scattering states at maximal isospin, $I=5/2$. As in previous work using the relativistic field theory approach, we work to all orders in a generic low-energy effective theory, and determine the quantization condition that relates finite-volume energies to intermediate K matrices, and the integral equations connecting the latter to the physical scattering amplitudes. We discuss the parametrization of the K matrices, and explain in detail the new features that arise in implementing the quantization condition due to the spin of the nucleon in combination with the use of non-degenerate particles. As a concrete example, we provide a sample numerical application including the $\Delta$ resonance in the $N\pi$ subchannel. The extension to the $I=3/2$ and $1/2$ channels is more involved, due to mixing with $N\pi$ states, and we do not provide a complete formalism for these cases. We explain why $N\pi$ states cannot be included by treating the nucleon as a pole in $p$-wave $N\pi$ scattering, an approach that has been successful in studying $D D^*$ scattering using the three-particle $DD\pi$ formalism. We additionally provide results for all isospins under the assumption of no two-to-three mixing, thereby laying the groundwork for a follow-up paper in which all $N\pi\pi \leftrightarrow N\pi$ systems are fully treated. Finally, we study the singularities in $N\pi\pi$ amplitudes arising from $N\pi\pi\pi$ intermediate states, and find that our subthreshold cutoff functions must be modified to avoid such singularities.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from axion inflation in the gradient expansion formalism II: Fermionic axion inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axion inflation represents an intriguing source of gravitational waves (GWs) from the early Universe. In a companion paper arXiv:2508.00798, we previously leveraged the gradient expansion formalism (GEF) to investigate pure axion inflation (PAI), i.e., axion inflaton coupled to a pure gauge sector. In this paper, we extend our analysis to fermionic axion inflation (FAI), i.e., we allow for the presence of fermions in the gauge sector. PAI predicts a strongly blue-tilted GW spectrum; in our GEF benchmark study, all parameter regions leading to observable GWs turned out to violate the upper limit on the number of extra relativistic degrees of freedom, $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$. As we demonstrate in this paper, the situation is different for FAI: Schwinger pair creation of the charged fermions results in a damping of the gauge-field production, which attenuates the GW signal. As a result, the GW signal from FAI can fall into the sensitivity reach of LISA and ET without violating the upper limit on $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$. This result notably applies to the arguably most realistic variant of Abelian axion inflation, in which the axion couples to the hypercharge sector of the Standard Model. Besides, we discuss GW emission from the fermion gas, which may further enhance the total GW signal but which also requires a more quantitative investigation in future work. Additionally, we identify a new backreaction regime in which fermion production moderates the axion--vector dynamics. In this regime, the axion velocity and all energy-density components exhibit oscillations analogous to the strong backreaction in PAI, but here, the oscillations occur around the slow-roll trajectory and are damped by the presence of charged fermions. These observations define again an interesting GEF benchmark for future lattice studies.</description>

      <title>Extended mass distribution of PBHs during QCD phase transition: SGWB and mini-EMRIs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are one of the most important tracers of cosmic history. In this work, we investigate the formation of PBHs around the time of the QCD phase transition from a broadly peaked inflationary scalar power spectrum, which naturally produces an extended PBH mass function. This scenario yields two distinct stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWB): (i) scalar-induced, second-order tensor perturbations generated at PBH formation, and (ii) a merger-driven SGWB from the subsequent PBH binary population. Using Bayesian analysis, we examine both SGWB channels with the data from the NANOGrav 15-year dataset and the first three observing runs of LVK. We also forecast continuous-wave signals from mini extreme mass ratio inspirals (mini-EMRIs) for direct comparison with NANOGrav and LVK constraints. Our parameter scans identify regions of the parameter space where the combined SGWB is detectable in future ground-based and space-based detectors. A broad PBH mass distribution naturally gives rise to mini-EMRIs, which future ground-based observatories, such as LVK A+, ET, and CE, can detect. For a large part of the PBH parameter space, the SGWB of astrophysical origin masks the primordial SGWB in the frequency band of ground-based detectors. Thus, for extended PBH mass distributions, we find that the detection of mini-EMRIs is a more robust channel for probing the PBH parameter space than the corresponding SGWB.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13003v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This report presents a possible attempt at renormalisable quantum gravity based on the standard BRST quantisation used for Yang-Mills theory. We have provided the BRST invariant Lagrangian of the gravitationally interacting U(1) gauge theory, namely the Quantum GraviElectro Dynamics (QGED), including the gauge fixing and the ghost Lagrangian. We have extracted a set of Feynman rules in the local inertial frame where gravity locally vanishes from this Lagrangian. Using the Feynman rules of the QGED constructed here, we have built all the renormalisation constants and show that the theory is perturbatively renormalisable, at least in the one-loop order. All infinite naked objects in the naked Lagrangian can replace experimentally measured ones. In addition to the standard QED parameters, we have shown that the gravitational coupling constant can be experimentally measured.
  We have also discussed a running effect of the gravitational coupling constant and the perturbative estimation of the Hawking radiation as examples of perturbative QGED. The difference between our theory and the widely known un-renormalisable quantum general relativity is clarified.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative Origin of the Electroweak Scale: RGE in Strongly-coupled Dark Gauge Theories via Dyson-Schwinger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel pathway to generate the electroweak scale (EW) via non-perturbative dynamics of a dark gauge sector based on the SU(N) gauge group. Imposing the scale invariance of the theory, we investigate the electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) which is triggered dynamically via the condensation of gauge fields. Instead of the usual dimension-4 triggered breaking, a dimension 6 term (with Wilson coefficient compatible with SMEFT bounds) coupling the Higgs boson and the Yang-Mills field quadratic term in the Lagrangian provides feedback from the gauge to the Higgs sector. We provide a novel method to estimate a non-perturbative EW scale generation using the exact solution of a truncated set of the background equations of motion in Yang-Mills theory in terms of Jacobi elliptic functions and the exact beta-function valid in the strongly coupled regimes via the Dyson-Schwinger approach. Particularly, we find an analytical result for the Renormalization Group Equation (RGE) of the gauge coupling in the $SU(N)$ sector in the strongly-coupled regime. The dynamics studied in this paper pave the way to a more realistic model building with possible resolution to the hierarchy problem and, in general, dynamical generation of scales.</description>

      <title>Minimal Dark Matter Freeze-in with Low Reheating Temperatures and Implications for Direct Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of the reheating temperature of the visible sector on the freeze-in dark matter (DM) benchmark model for direct detection experiments, where DM production is mediated by an ultralight dark photon. Here we consider a new regime for this benchmark: we take the initial temperature of the thermal Standard Model (SM) bath to be below the DM mass. The production rate from the SM bath is drastically reduced due to Boltzmann suppression, necessitating a significant increase in the portal coupling between DM and the SM to match the observed relic DM abundance. This enhancement in coupling strength increases the predicted DM-electron scattering cross section, making freeze-in DM more accessible to current direct detection experiments.</description>

      <title>Superfluids in expanding backgrounds and attractor times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We determine the behavior of an out-of-equilibrium superfluid, composed of a $U(1)$ Goldstone mode coupled to hydrodynamic modes in a M\" uller-Israel-Stewart theory, in expanding backgrounds relevant to heavy ion collision experiments and cosmology. For suitable initial conditions, the evolution of the hydrodynamic variables leads to a change in the potential of the Goldstone mode, spontaneously breaking the symmetry. After some time, the condensate becomes small, leading the system evolution to be well described via hydrodynamic attractors for a timescale that we determine in Bjorken and Gubser flows. We define this new timescale as the \textit{attractor time} and show its dependence on initial conditions. In the case of the Gubser flow, we provide for the first time a complete description of the nonlinear evolution of the system, including a novel nonlinear regime of constant anisotropy not found in the Bjorken evolution. Finally, we consider the superfluid in the dynamical FLRW (Friedmann-Lemaitre-Roberston-Walker) background, where we observe a similar attractor behavior, dependent on the initial conditions, that at late times approaches a regime dominated by the condensate.</description>

      <title>Casimir effect in magnetic dual chiral density waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the Casimir effect originating from Dirac fields in finite-density matter under a magnetic field. In particular, we focus on quark fields in the magnetic dual chiral density wave (MDCDW) phase as a possible inhomogeneous ground state of interacting Dirac-fermion systems. In this system, the distance dependence of Casimir energy shows a complex oscillatory behavior by the interplay between the chemical potential, magnetic field, and inhomogeneous ground state. By decomposing the total Casimir energy into contributions of each Landau level, we elucidate what types of Casimir effects are realized from each Landau level: the lowest or some types of higher Landau levels lead to different behaviors of Casimir energies. Furthermore, we point out characteristic behaviors due to level splitting between different fermion flavors, i.e., up/down quarks. These findings provide new insights into Dirac-fermion (or quark) matter with a finite thickness.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of effective field theories via on-shell methods: the case of axion-like particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the most general axion-like particle effective field theory, including both CP-odd and CP-even types of interactions, and evaluate the corresponding renormalization group equations, improving and extending previous results in the literature. Our calculations exploit on-shell and unitarity-based methods. The relevant phase-space cut-integrals are carried out using different integration methods, among which the double-cut integration via Stokes' theorem proves to be technically simpler. A close comparison between the standard Feynman diagrammatic approach and the unitarity-based method enables us to explicitly verify the reduction of complexity in the latter case, along with a more direct and elegant way to establish a connection among anomalous dimensions of operators that are dual under the CP symmetry.</description>

      <title>A $Z_4$ symmetric inverse seesaw model for neutrino masses and FIMP dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A theoretical framework based on a spontaneously broken $Z_4$ symmetry is proposed to simultaneously explain neutrino mass generation via the inverse seesaw mechanism and dark matter (DM) production through a freeze-in scenario. This work extends the standard model with right-handed neutrinos $N_i$, additional fermions $\chi_i$, and a complex scalar $S$. An unbroken $Z_2$ subgroup ensures the stability of the DM candidate, whose relic abundance is dominantly produced via decay and scattering processes involving heavy singlet fermions. Phenomenological analyses show that this relatively minimal construction accommodates the observed neutrino oscillation parameters, consistent with the latest global fit data. Furthermore, the model successfully reproduces the observed DM relic density within the parameter space relevant to neutrino phenomenology, establishing a connection between neutrino properties and DM production.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and Bell Nonlocality in $\tau^+ \tau^-$ at the BEPC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement and Bell nonlocality are two phenomena that occur only in quantum systems. In both cases, these are correlations between two subsystems that are classically absent. Traditionally, these phenomena have been measured in low-energy photon and electron experiments, but more recently they have also been measured in high-energy particle collider environments. In this work, we propose measuring the entanglement and Bell nonlocality in the $\tau^+\tau^-$ state near and above its kinematic threshold at the Beijing Electron Positron Collider (BEPC). We find that in the existing dataset, entanglement is observable if systematic uncertainties are kept to 1%. In the upcoming run between 4.0 and 5.6 GeV, the entanglement is predicted to be measurable with a precision better than 4% and Bell nonlocality can be established at $5\sigma$ as long as systematic uncertainty can be controlled at level of 0.5% - 2.0%, depending on the center-of-mass energy.</description>

      <title>Fermion Dark Matter Effect on Electroweak Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The addition of extra scalars to the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics enriches the vacuum structure and consequently gives rise to strong first-order phase transitions (EWPT) in the early universe. We raise the question that how the EWPT is affected by the addition of fermions in models beyond the SM, and address this question by studying the EWPT in a dark matter model comprising a singlet scalar and two Dirac fermions. The singlet scalar develops a nonzero vacuum expectation value (VEV), and the lighter fermion plays the role of the dark matter. The model evades the stringent direct detection bounds due to the presence of two fermions. We first show that applying the high-temperature approximation, no first-order phase transition is found. Then we demonstrate that when including the full finite temperature corrections to the effective potential, the first-order phase transition becomes possible, nevertheless, all the phase transitions will be weak. We therefore deduce that the addition of fermions reduces the strength of the EWPT.</description>

Abstract: Leptophilic sub-MeV spin-zero dark matter (DM) decays into photons via one-loop processes, a scenario that has been in part overlooked in current literature. In this work, we provide updated and comprehensive upper limits on scalar, pseudo-scalar, and axion-like DM-electron couplings based on the latest NPIPE cosmic microwave background data from Planck. Our bounds on the couplings are not only competitive with astrophysical and terrestrial experiments, but outperform them in certain regions of parameter space. Notably, we present the most stringent limits to date on scalar DM with masses around a few keV and pseudo-scalar DM with masses between 100 eV and a few keV. Additionally, we explore, for the first time, the impact of implementing a cosmology-consistent treatment of energy deposition into the cosmic medium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Experiments at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have accumulated an unprecedented amount of data corresponding to a large variety of quantum states. Although searching for new particles beyond the Standard Model of particle physics remains a high priority for the LHC program, precision measurements of the physical processes predicted in the Standard Model continue to lead us to a deeper understanding of nature at high energies. We carry out detailed simulations for the process $pp \to \tau^+\tau^- X$ to perform quantum tomography and to measure the quantum entanglement and the Bell nonlocality of the $\tau^+\tau^-$ two qubit state, including both statistical and systematic uncertainties. By using advanced machine learning techniques for neutrino momentum reconstruction, we achieve precise measurements of the full spin density matrix, a critical advantage over previous studies limited by reconstruction challenges for missing momenta. Our analysis reveals a clear observation of Bell nonlocality with high statistical significance, surpassing 5$\sigma$, establishing $\tau^+ \tau^-$ as an ideal system for quantum information studies in high-energy collisions. Given its experimental feasibility and the high expected sensitivity for Bell nonlocality, we propose that $\tau^+ \tau^-$ should be regarded as the new benchmark system for quantum information studies at the LHC, complementing and extending the insights gained from the $t\bar{t}$ system.</description>

      <title>Dark photons from dineutron decays in neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05447v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We focus on a novel baryon-number ($\mathcal{B}$) violating process within neutron stars, where two neutrons convert into two dark photons ($nn \rightarrow VV$) via new Higgs-like scalar bosons. This process is believed to be greatly suppressed at low energies but could be highly amplified in a dense neutron environment like neutron stars. The $nn \rightarrow VV$ process could give rise to non-trivial effects that are distinct from similar processes in previous studies and could alter the properties of neutron stars, such as orbital periods, collapse thresholds, stability conditions, cooling rates, gravitational wave emissions, etc. The emitted dark photons may serve as dark-matter candidates and exhibit special red-shifted energy spectra mainly linked to the compactness of the neutron star. We point out that the dark photons emitted from neutron stars may yield detectable signals in future experiments. We also show that the precision pulsar-timing data provides a powerful tool to constrain the parameter space of new-physics models. The study of the $nn \rightarrow VV$ process, which combines astronomical observations and particle physics models together, may open new windows into the detection of the $\mathcal{B}$-violating effects and may also provide new insights on the study of dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02657v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Formal connections between the spin density matrix and the Wigner function for spin-1/2 particles forming a relativistic gas are explored to determine their general structures. They suggest that the commonly used form of the local equilibrium Wigner function should be replaced by a new expression. The latter fulfills the necessary condition for the normalization of the mean spin polarization, which the former fails to reproduce. The new definition of the Wigner function leads to generalized thermodynamic relations for perfect spin hydrodynamics, identical to those obtained earlier using the classical concept of spin. Moreover, one can prove that the perfect spin hydrodynamics based on the new equilibrium Wigner function is nonlinearly causal and stable. Finally, the selection rule for the Lagrange multipliers, which is satisfied by real systems, is discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the scalar singlet extension of type-I seesaw, where a scalar singlet $S$ and heavy neutral lepton $N$ are further introduced. The Majorana mass term of heavy neutral lepton is generated through the Yukawa interaction with the scalar singlet, which then induces the lepton number violation decays of SM Higgs $h$ and heavy Higgs $H$ via mixing of scalars. As a pathway to probe the origin of heavy neutral lepton mass, we investigate the lepton number violation Higgs decay signature at the TeV-scale muon collider. The dominant production channel of Higgs bosons at the TeV-scale muon collider is via vector boson fusion. So we perform a detailed analysis of the signal process $\mu^+\mu^-\to \nu_\mu \bar{\nu}_\mu h/H \to \nu_\mu \bar{\nu}_\mu NN $ followed by $ N \to \mu^\pm jj$, where the two jets from $W$ boson decay are treated as one fat-jet $J$. With an integrated luminosity of $1(10)~\text{ab}^{-1}$, the 3 (10) TeV muon collider could discover the lepton number violation SM Higgs decay $h\to \mu^\pm\mu^\pm JJ$ signature for the Higgs mixing parameter $\sin\alpha&gt;0.05(0.009)$. Meanwhile, a large parameter space can be detected by the lepton number violation heavy Higgs decay $H\to \mu^\pm\mu^\pm JJ$ signature for $m_H\lesssim1 (3)$ TeV and $\sin\alpha\gtrsim0.03(0.005)$ at the 3 (10) TeV muon collider. Therefore, the lepton number violation SM and heavy Higgs decay signatures are both promising at the TeV scale muon collider.</description>

      <title>A Superalgebra Within: representations of lightest standard model particles form a $\mathbb{Z}_2^5$-graded algebra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is demonstrated how a set of particle representations, familiar from the Standard Model, collectively form a superalgebra. Those representations mirroring the behaviour of the Standard Model's gauge bosons, and three generations of fermions, are each included in this algebra, with exception only to those irreps involving the top quark. This superalgebra is isomorphic to the Euclidean Jordan algebra of $16\times 16$ hermitian matrices, $H_{16}(\mathbb{C}),$ and is generated by division algebras. The division algebraic substructure enables a natural factorization between internal and spacetime symmetries. It also allows for the definition of a $\mathbb{Z}_2^5$ grading on the algebra. Those internal symmetries respecting this substructure are found to be $\mathfrak{su}(3)_C \oplus \mathfrak{su}(2)_L \oplus \mathfrak{u}(1)_Y,$ in addition to four iterations of $\mathfrak{u}(1)$. For spatial symmetries, one finds multiple copies of $\mathfrak{so}(3)$. Given its Jordan algebraic foundation, and its apparent non-relativistic character, the model may supply a bridge between particle physics and quantum computing.
  We close by describing how this article fits into the larger picture of Bott Periodic Particle Physics, first introduced in [1], [2], [3].</description>

      <title>Effects of virtual Majorana neutrinos on charged Lepton Flavor Violation decays from a seesaw variant with radiatively induced light neutrino masses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lepton flavor violating decays $\ell_{\alpha} \to \ell_{\beta} \gamma$, being forbidden in the Standard Model framework, provide a sensitive probe for new physics. We study these processes in a seesaw variant in which small neutrino masses are generated radiatively. By analyzing the parameter space constrained by electroweak precision data, we investigate the correlation between these decays and non-unitary effects from TeV-scale heavy neutrinos. According to our results, $\mu \to e \gamma$ is the most promising channel for new physics searches, with the bound $|\eta_{\mu e}| \lesssim 10^{-6}$ obtained for non-unitary effects in this radiative seesaw variant. Our estimations of $\mathcal{BR} \left( \mu \to e \gamma \right)$, which depends on the mass of the heavy neutrinos, shows that both current and future experimental facilities might be sensitive to these effects.</description>

      <title>Constraining anti-baryonic dark matter through correlated nucleon decay signatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Baryon number violation in the visible sector induced by anti-baryonic dark matter provides a viable mechanism for low-scale baryogenesis. Two of the most sensitive probes of this scenario are neutron decay processes such as $n \to \bar{\nu} + \text{invisible}$ and $n \to \pi^0 + \text{invisible}$. In this work, we discuss the possible spontaneous breaking of baryon symmetry in the dark sector and the generation of di-nucleon decay processes such as $nn \to \bar{\nu}\bar{\nu}$ and $nn \to \pi^0\pi^0$ at one-loop, arising from the operators responsible for induced nucleon decays. While the induced nucleon decay rates in this model depend on the dark matter density, di-nucleon decay processes do not, providing a complementary probe of the new physics. We thus use nucleon and di-nucleon decay bounds to constrain the local density and mass of the anti-baryonic dark matter.</description>

      <title>F-mode Oscillations of Neutron Stars with Dark Matter from Neutron Decay: Implications for Gravitational-Wave Detectability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17355v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, the impact of neutron decay into dark matter and various dark matter self-interaction strengths on neutron star properties have been explored. Using the quark-meson coupling (QMC) model for nucleon-only equations of state (EoSs), the effects of different matter compositions have been compared, including strange matter and self-interacting dark matter. The results demonstrate that increasing DM-DM self-repulsion stiffens the EoS, influencing the mass-radius relationship and stability of neutron stars. Furthermore, fundamental mode (f-mode) oscillations have been analyzed, which serve as a diagnostic tool for probing neutron star interiors. The f-mode frequencies follow universal relations, reinforcing their applicability for constraining dense matter properties. It has been shown that neutron stars composed of nucleons-only and self-interacting dark matter exhibit a universal behavior in damping time and angular frequency, whereas strange matter and non-self-interacting dark matter deviate from this trend. Importantly, it has been shown that for a GW energy release of E = 10^{52} erg and a source distance of 25 Mpc, the characteristic strain and signal-to-noise ratio exceed the ET-D sensitivity threshold below 2.1 kHz for all models except the non-interacting DM case, demonstrating that neutron-to-dark matter decay scenarios, including the role of DM self-interactions, can be tested through next-generation gravitational-wave asteroseismology, offering a new probe of DM physics and the neutron lifetime anomaly.</description>

      <title>Bayesian inference of the magnetic field and chemical potential on holographic jet quenching in heavy-ion collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00340v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Jet quenching is studied in a background magnetic field and a finite baryon chemical potential. The production of energetic partons is calculated using the next-to-leading order (NLO) perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (pQCD) parton model, while the parton energy loss formula is obtained from the AdS/CFT correspondence incorporating the magnetic field and baryon chemical potential effects. Using Bayesian inference, we systemically compare the theoretical calculations with experimental data for the nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$ of the large transverse momentum hadrons in different-centrality nucleus-nucleus collisions at 0.2, 2.76 and 5.02 TeV, respectively. The form of the holographic energy loss leads to a strong negative correlation between the magnetic field and the chemical potential after the calibration, from which we discussed the sensitivity of jet quenching phenomena to magnetic field and baryon chemical potential.</description>

      <title>QCD phase transition at finite temperature and chemical potential with the non-extensive statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The intrinsic fluctuations, memory effects and long-range color interactions in high energy nuclear collisions imply the presence of non-Markovian processes in the fireball evolution, which affects the thermalization process towards equilibrium and produces a non-extensive behavior. In order to investigate the non-equilibrium effect on the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) phase transition at finite temperature ($T$) and chemical potential ($\mu$), we apply a non-extensive correction to the equation of state in the parton (hadron resonance) gas at high (low) temperature and interpolate these two equation of states with a smooth crossover. The non-extensive statistics is characterized by a non-extensivity parameter $q$, which measures the degrees of deviation from the thermal equilibrium. It is found that the dimensionless thermodynamic quantities such as the entropy density, the pressure, the energy density, the specific heat at constant volume and the trace anomaly are sensitive to the deviation of $q$ from unity and they become large both in the hadronic and quark-gluon plasma phases with the increase of $q$. Moreover, this deviation leads to nontrivial corrections of the squared speed of sound ($(c_s^2)_q$) in the vicinity of the critical point ($T_c$) and at lower temperatures. Additionally, these thermodynamic quantities are sensitive to the deviation of $\mu$ from zero. With increasing $\mu$, they become enhanced in both phases. Specifically, for $(c_s^2)_q$, the value increases near $T_c$ but decreases at lower temperatures. Finally, we observe that our results with $q=1$ agree well with those from the Lattice QCD, the hadron resonance gas model, and the Thermal-Fist fit to the hadron yields in high energy nuclear collisions in the low temperature region up to $T\sim 150$ MeV.</description>

Abstract: In the $SO(5) \times U(1) \times SU(3)$ gauge-Higgs unification in the Randall-Sundrum (RS) warped space neutrino oscillations and the Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) matrix in the $W$ couplings originate from Majorana mass terms on the ultraviolet brane in the RS space. Tiny neutrino masses are generated by an inverse seesaw mechanism. The PMNS matrix in the normal ordering with $\delta_{CP}=\pi$ naturally arises consistently with the NuFit-6.0 analysis of neutrino oscillation data.</description>

      <title>Thermal Gravitons from Warm Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In warm inflation (WI), the persistent thermal bath that is sustained by dissipative interactions with the inflaton field produces a stochastic background of gravitational waves (GWs). In this paper we study the production and evolution of these GWs. Specifically, we investigate the emission of thermal gravitons (gravitons emitted by a thermal bath) from particle scattering in the bath and the evolution of the corresponding GWs. We find that the bulk of thermal graviton production in WI occurs during the transition to radiation domination after inflation. Further, the energy density of thermal gravitons is enhanced by roughly one to two orders of magnitude compared to that in a radiation-dominated scenario with the same reheating temperature. We also calculate the spectrum of the resulting stochastic GW background and find that it has a distinctive shape, consisting of a peak at high frequencies ~100 GHz and an almost flat spectrum extending to low frequencies. The peak arises from emission of sub-horizon modes that follow the temperature of the bath. The flat part of the spectrum corresponds to the modes that exit the horizon during WI and re-enter during radiation domination. We show that the detection prospects for the high-frequency peak of the GW spectrum, while improved slightly compared to the radiation-dominated case, still remain challenging. The thermal spectrum's low-frequency plateau is typically subdominant to the amplitude of the standard vacuum tensor modes from inflation, although WI models can exist where the thermal graviton plateau surpasses the vacuum contribution without exceeding current observational limits on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. Furthermore, we calculate the thermal graviton contribution from WI to dark radiation and show that WI models are generally expected to satisfy current observational bounds, including those from the cosmic microwave background.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15646v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a novel approach for the self-consistent solution of coupled sets of Bethe-Salpeter and Schwinger-Dyson equations in QCD. This framework allows us to maintain the axial Ward-Takahashi identities of the theory within advanced approximation schemes, such as the skeleton or three-particle irreducible expansions. For this purpose we reformulate the Schwinger-Dyson equation of the axial-vector vertex such that the bulk of its quantum corrections is expressed in terms of a novel vertex. Crucially, this vertex satisfies a symmetry-induced relation of its own, which involves the full quark-gluon vertex. As a result, the Schwinger-Dyson equation reproduces the standard Ward-Takahashi identity satisfied by the axial-vector vertex. Consequently, the known relation between the quark mass function and the wave function of the pion in the chiral limit is duly fulfilled. The present approach offers valuable insights into the interplay between symmetry and dynamics, and provides a practical path towards computations of hadron physics within sophisticated approximations. In particular, the one-loop dressed truncation of the key dynamical equations, including that of the quark-gluon vertex, is shown to be completely compatible with the required symmetry relations. Further extensions and potential phenomenological applications of the developed framework are briefly discussed.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we consider the general structure of irreducible tensor representations of the Poincare group of arbitrary dimension with multiple sets of Lorentz indices and different ways to construct them from basic elements (Lorentz vectors and the metric tensor). Then we apply the same methods to obtain the expansion of general hadronic tensors in terms of these irreducible tensors. We propose to use an effective approach in hadronic diffraction, which was usually called covariant reggeization, and obtain basic functions to calculate all the diffractive cross-sections.</description>

Abstract: A flux of ultra-high-energy (UHE) neutrinos, produced by astrophysical sources at cosmological distances, is anticipated to exist and reach Earth. In this paper, we investigate the impact on the total flux, energy spectrum, and arrival directions of UHE neutrinos of neutrino-dark matter (DM) scatterings. We study scatterings both in the intergalactic medium and in the Milky Way. We emphasize the complementarity among neutrino detectors at different latitudes, that can probe anisotropies induced by neutrinos scattering with the Milky Way DM halo. We also discuss that, with mild astrophysical assumptions, limits on the DM-$\nu$ scattering cross section can be placed even if the neutrino sources are unknown. Finally, we explore all this phenomenology with the recent UHE neutrino event KM3230213A, and place the corresponding limits on the DM-$\nu$ scattering cross section.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the resent BESIII Collaboration measurements of the process $D^+\to\pi^+\eta\eta$, we investigate this process by considering the contribution from the resonance $a_0(980)$, which is generated by $S$-wave pseudoscalar meson-pseudoscalar meson interaction, and the contribution from the intermediate scalar meson $f_0(1370)$. Our results could give a good description of the $\pi^+\eta$ and $\eta\eta$ invariant mass distributions, which implies that the contribution from the intermediate $f_0(1370)$, neglected in BESIII analysis, could play a role in this process. Furthermore, the predicted Dalitz plots are also consistent with the BESIII measurements. The more precise measurements about this process in future could shed light on the mechanism of this process and the properties of $f_0(1370)$ and $a_0(980)$.</description>

Abstract: We provide a modern pedagogical introduction to light mesons. We discuss their masses and widths, their classification into multiplets of isospin and flavor SU(3), as well as other quantum numbers, mixing schemes, observable states, and their disposition in Regge trajectories. We briefly introduce the relevant concepts of Quantum Chromodynamics, including confinement, chiral symmetry, and the relationship between poles and resonances. We discuss their interpretation in terms of quark-model ordinary quark-antiquark states or non-ordinary states like exotics, multiquarks, or glueballs. Finally, we comment on the open issues that are still under discussion.</description>

Abstract: The higher-twist (HT) formalism is used at $O(\alpha^2_s)$ to compute all possible medium-induced single-scattering emission kernels for an incoming highly energetic and virtual quark traversing the nuclear environment. The effects of the heavy-quark mass scale are taken into account [Phys. Rev. C 94, 054902 (2016)] both in the initial state as well as in the final state, along with interactions involving both in-medium Glauber gluons and quarks [Nucl. Phys. A 793, 128 (2007)], as well as coherence effects [Phys. Rev. C 105, 024908 (2022)]. As this study is a continuation of our work on medium-induced photon production [Phys. Rev. C 112, 025204 (2025)], the general factorization procedure for $e$-$A$ deep-inelastic scattering is still used. An incoming quark energy loss in the nuclear medium yields four possible scattering kernels $K_i$ with the following final states: (i) $q+g$, (ii) $g+g$, (iii) $q+\bar{q}'$, where the quark $q$ may have a flavor different from the antiquark $\bar{q}'$, and (iv) $q+q'$, where, again, $q$ may have a flavor different from $q'$. The collisional kernels include full phase factors from all non-vanishing diagrams and complete first-order derivative in the longitudinal direction ($k^-$) as well as second-order derivative in the transverse momentum ($k_{\perp}$) gradient expansion. Furthermore, in-medium parton distribution functions and the related jet transport coefficients have a hard transverse-momentum dependence (of the emitted quark or gluon) present within the phase factor.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of Weak Interactions in Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weak interactions cause small parity-violating energy differences between left- and right-handed chiral systems. Although normally tiny, these effects may be significantly enhanced during collective phenomena such as phase transitions. We propose a theoretical model describing the enhancement of weak interactions in phase transitions. The enhancement factor is proportional to the critical number of atoms, $N_c$, in the nucleus of the new phase. After the nucleus reaches its critical size, it grows until it fills the entire system. Measurement of the ratio of produced left and right chiral structures may provide a way to measure this critical number $N_c$. Experiments where definite spin-chiral structures are formed during a phase transition in crossed electric and magnetic fields, indicate $N_c \sim 10^9 - 10^{10}$. An open question is whether a similar enhancement could operate during cosmological phase transitions - thereby boosting CP-violating effects sufficiently to contribute to the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry (baryogenesis).</description>

      <title>Dark Photon Oscillations in Waveguide</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark photons, which can kinetically mix with ordinary photons, represent the simplest extension to the standard model. Detecting their oscillations with visible photons could provide crucial insights into the nature of dark matter and fundamental interactions beyond the standard model. We propose a novel laboratory-based approach to detect dark photon oscillations using a laser in an Optical Time-domain Relectometry (OTDR) setup. The laser light propagating through the optical fiber undergoes oscillations with the dark photon, leading to measurable changes in the power flow. These oscillations can precisely measured,
  leveraging its high sensitivity and efficiency in detecting small variations in the optical signal. This approach could provide a new avenue for probing dark photon oscillations in the laboratory and greatly improve the current experimental sensitivity to dark photon in a wide mass range.</description>

      <title>Till the core collapses: the evolution and properties of self-interacting dark matter subhalos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09910v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the hottest questions in the cosmology of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) is whether scatterings can induce detectable core-collapse in halos by the present day. Because gravitational tides can accelerate core-collapse, the most promising targets to observe core-collapse are satellite galaxies and subhalo systems. However, simulating small subhalos is computationally intensive, especially when subhalos start to core-collapse. In this work, we present a hierarchical framework for simulating a population of SIDM subhalos, which reduces the computation time to linear order in the total number of subhalos. With this method, we simulate substructure lensing systems with multiple velocity-dependent SIDM models, and show how subhalo evolution depends on the SIDM model, subhalo mass and orbits. We find that an SIDM cross section of $\gtrsim 200$ cm$^2$/g at velocity scales relevant for subhalos' internal heat transfer is needed for a significant fraction of subhalos to core-collapse in a typical lens system at redshift $z=0.5$, and that core-collapse has unique observable features in lensing. We show quantitatively that core-collapse in subhalos is typically accelerated compared to field halos, except when the SIDM cross section is non-negligible ($\gtrsim \mathcal{O}(1)$ cm$^2$/g) at subhalos' orbital velocities, in which case evaporation by the host can delay core-collapse. This suggests that substructure lensing can be used to probe velocity-dependent SIDM models, especially if line-of-sight structures (field halos) can be distinguished from lens-plane subhalos. Intriguingly, we find that core-collapse in subhalos can explain the recently reported ultra-steep density profiles of substructures found by lensing with the \emph{Hubble Space Telescope}</description>

      <title>Defying eternal inflation in warm inflation with a negative running</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03487v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It was pointed out previously~\cite{Kinney:2014jya} that a sufficiently negative running of the spectral index of curvature perturbations from (ordinary i.e. cold) inflation is able to prevent eternal inflation from ever occurring. Here, we reevaluate those original results, but in the context of warm inflation, in which a substantial radiation component (produced by the inflaton) exists throughout the inflationary period.
  We demonstrate that the same general requirements found in the context of ordinary (cold) inflation also hold true in warm inflation; indeed an even tinier amount of negative running is sufficient to prevent eternal inflation. This is particularly pertinent, as models featuring negative running are more generic in warm inflation scenarios. Finally, the condition for the existence of eternal inflation in cold inflation -- that the curvature perturbation amplitude exceed unity on superhorizon scales -- becomes more restrictive in the case of warm inflation. The curvature perturbations must be even larger, i.e. even farther out on the potential, away from the part of the potential where observables, e.g. in the Cosmic Microwave Background, are produced.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Position deformation of a Heisenberg algebra and Hilbert space representation of both maximal length and minimal momentum uncertainties may lead to loss of Hermiticity of some operators that generate this algebra. Consequently, the Hamiltonian operator constructed from these operators are also not Hermitian. In the present paper, with an appropriate positive-definite Dyson map, we establish the Hermiticity of these operators by means of a quasi-similarity transformation. We then construct Hilbert space representations associated with these quasi-Hermitian operators that generate a quasi-Hermitian Heisenberg algebra. With the help of these representations we establish the path integral formulation of any systems in this quasi-Hermitian algebra. Finally, using the path integral of a free particle as an example, we demonstrate that the Euclidean propagator, action, and kinetic energy of this system are constrained by the standard classical mechanics limits.</description>

      <title>2D BAO vs 3D BAO: Hints for new physics?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05453v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As next-generation telescopes and observational surveys continue to expand the boundaries of our understanding, tensions and discrepancies between observational datasets are becoming increasingly prominent. In this work, we focus on one such discrepancy: the differences between 2D and 3D Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements. Without extending beyond the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework, we systematically study and highlight this discrepancy in different parameter spaces. This work examines the constraints on fundamental cosmological parameters ($H_0$, $r_d$, $\Omega_m$) derived from Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) and Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa) data. By analyzing BAO observational datasets from two distinct methodologies (2D and 3D) alongside the Pantheon Plus SNIa sample, we identify a significant systematic difference: 2D BAO measurements consistently yield higher values of $hr_d$ compared to both 3D BAO and DESI analyses. While 2D BAO measurements appear to bridge the Hubble tension by simultaneously accommodating both a higher $H_0$ value (aligning with SH0ES) and a larger sound horizon $r_d$ (matching Planck), this apparent reconciliation comes at the cost of introducing tension with the well-constrained Planck measurement of $\Omega_{m0}h^2$. This behavior arises because of systematically higher values of the product $H_0r_d$ observed in 2D BAO analysis compared to 3D analyses. Therefore, given these systematic differences, we advocate for careful consideration when using 2D BAO measurements to address the Hubble tension, suggesting that understanding the origin of this 2D-3D discrepancy should be a priority for future investigations.</description>

      <title>Diversity and universality: evolution of dwarf galaxies with self-interacting dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14621v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark matter halos with self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) experience a unique evolutionary phenomenon, in that their central regions eventually collapse to high density through the runaway gravothermal process after initially forming a large and low-density core. When coupled with orbital evolution, this is expected to naturally produce a large diversity in dark-matter halos' inner mass distribution, potentially explaining the diversity problem of dwarf galaxies. However, it remains unknown how the diversity in SIDM dark-matter halos propagates to the more easily observed luminous matter at the center of the halo, especially the stellar component. In this work, we use idealized N-body simulations with two species of particles (dark matter and stars) to study the response of the stellar properties of field and satellite dwarf galaxies to SIDM evolution and orbital effects on their halos. Galaxies' stellar components, including galaxy size, mass-to-light ratio, and stellar velocity dispersion, display a much larger scatter in SIDM than the standard cold dark matter (CDM) model. Importantly, we find signs of universality in the evolution pathways, or "tidal tracks", of SIDM dwarf satellites, which are physically interpretable and potentially parameterizable. This type of tidal-track model can be layered onto larger-scale, cosmological simulations to reconstruct the evolution of populations of SIDM dwarfs in cases where high-resolution simulations of galaxies are otherwise prohibitively expensive.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00295v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) can form from gravitational collapse of large overdensities in the early Universe, giving rise to rich phenomena in astrophysics and cosmology. We develop a novel, general, and systematic method based on theory of density contrast peaks to calculate the abundance of PBHs for a broad power spectrum of curvature perturbations with Gaussian statistics. We introduce a window function to account for the relevant perturbation scales associated with PBHs of different masses, along with a filter function that removes unphysical contributions from super-horizon-scale overdensities. While some uncertainties remain due to the limited understanding of the nonlinear collapse process, our approach substantially reduces the discrepancy previously observed between peaks theory and the Press-Schechter formalism.</description>

      <title>Free-Streaming Neutrinos and Their Phase Shift in Current and Future CMB Power Spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13788v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cosmic neutrino background and other light relics leave distinct imprints in the cosmic microwave background anisotropies through their gravitational influence. Since neutrinos decoupled from the primordial plasma about one second after the big bang, they have been free-streaming through the universe. This induced a characteristic phase shift in the acoustic peaks as a unique signature. In this work, we constrain the free-streaming nature of these relativistic species and other light relics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics by establishing two complementary template-based approaches to robustly infer the size of this phase shift from the temperature and polarization power spectra. One template shifts the multipoles in these spectra, while the other novel template more fundamentally isolates the phase shift at the level of the underlying photon-baryon perturbations. Applying these methods to Planck data, we detect the neutrino-induced phase shift at about $10\sigma$ significance, which rises to roughly $14\sigma$ with additional data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope and the South Pole Telescope. We also infer that the data is consistent with the Standard Model prediction of three free-streaming neutrinos. In addition, we forecast the capabilities of future experiments which will enable significantly more precise phase-shift measurements, with the Simons Observatory and CMB-S4 reducing the $1\sigma$ uncertainties to roughly 4.3% and 2.5%, respectively. More generally, we establish a new analysis pipeline for the phase shift induced by neutrinos and other free-streaming dark radiation which additionally offers new avenues for exploring physics beyond the Standard Model in a signature-driven and model-agnostic way.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories is an important avenue to gain insights into both particle physics phenomena and constrained quantum many-body dynamics. There is a growing interest in probing analogs of high energy collision phenomena in lattice gauge theories that can be implemented on current quantum simulators. Motivated by this, we characterize the confined mesons that originate from a local high energy excitation in a particle-conserving 1D $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory. We focus on a simple, experimentally accessible setting that does not require preparation of colliding wavepackets and isolates the effects of gauge field confinement strength and initial state energy on the nature of propagating excitations. We find that the dynamics is characterized by the propagation of a superposition of differently sized mesons. The linear confinement leads to meson size oscillations in time. The average meson size and oscillation frequency are controlled by the strength of the gauge field confinement. At a constant confinement field, the average meson length is controlled by the initial excitation's energy. Higher energies produce longer mesons and their effective mass depends strongly on their size: longer mesons propagate more slowly out of the central excitation. Mesons of different sizes get spatially filtered with time due to different speeds. We show that this phenomenology is a consequence of linear confinement and remains valid in both the strong and weak confinement limit. We present simple explanations of these phenomena supported by exact numerics.</description>

      <title>On entanglement c-functions in confining gauge field theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement entropy has proven to be a powerful tool for probing renormalization group (RG) flows in quantum field theories, with c-functions derived from it serving as candidate measures of the effective number of degrees of freedom. While the monotonicity of such c-functions is well established in many settings, notable exceptions occur in theories with a mass scale. In this work, we investigate entanglement c-functions in the context of holographic RG flows, with a particular focus on flows across dimensions induced by circle compactifications. We argue that in spacetime dimensions $d \geq 4$, standard constructions of c-functions, which rely on higher derivatives of the entanglement entropy of either a ball or a cylinder, generically lead to non-monotonic behavior. Working with known dual geometries, we argue that the non-monotonicity stems not from any pathology or curvature singularity, but from a transition in the holographic Ryu--Takayanagi surface. In compactifications from four to three dimensions, we propose a modified construction that restores monotonicity in the infrared, although a fully monotonic ultraviolet extension remains elusive. Furthermore, motivated by entanglement entropy inequalities, we conjecture a bound on the cylinder entanglement c-function, which holds in all our examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02495v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address double parton scattering (DPS) in pA collisions. Within the Light-Front approach, we formally derive the two contributions to the nuclear double parton distribution (DPD), namely: DPS1, involving two partons from the same nucleon, and DPS2, where the two partons belong to different parent nucleons. We then generalize the sum rule for hadron DPDs to the nuclear case and analytically show how all contributions combine to give the expected results. In addition partial sum rules for the DPDs related to DPS1 and DPS2 mechanisms are discussed for the first time. The deuteron system is considered for the first calculation of the nuclear DPD by using a realistic wave function obtained from the very refined nucleon-nucleon AV18 potential, embedded in a rigorous Poincar\'e covariant formalism. Results are used to test sum rules and properly verify that DPS1 contribution compares with the DPS2 one, although smaller. We also introduce EMC-like ratios involving nuclear and free DPDs to address the potential role of DPS in understanding in depth the EMC effect.</description>

      <title>The Non-Abelian Casimir Effect for Plates, Symmetrical Tube and Box on the Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present non-perturbative results of the Casimir potential in non-abelian SU(3) gauge theory in (2+1)D and (3+1)D in the confined and deconfined phase. For the first time, geometries beyond parallel plates in (3+1)D are explored and we show that the Casimir effect for the symmetrical tube and symmetrical box is attractive. The Casimir potential for the tube differs from the massless non-interacting scalar field theory prediction, where a repulsive Casimir potential is expected. Unlike the parallel plate geometry where the plate-size is fixed, in the case of the tube and box, the sizes of the faces forming the walls of the geometries changes with separation distance. We propose various methods that can be used to account for the energy contributions from creating the boundaries. We show that increasing the temperature from a confined to a deconfined phase does not alter the Casimir potential. This observation is consistent with prior work suggesting that the region inside the walls is a boundary induced deconfined phase.</description>

      <title>Probing For Non-Gravitational Long-Range Dark Matter Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark matter remains a mystery in fundamental physics. The only evidence for dark matter's existence is from gravitational interactions. We constructed a precision torsion balance experiment to search for non-gravitational, long-range interactions between ordinary matter in our lab and the Milky Way's dark matter. We find no evidence of such interaction and set strict upper bounds on its strength. These results suggest that dark matter only interacts gravitationally over long distances and constrains a variety of dark matter theories.</description>
