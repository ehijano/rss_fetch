      <title>Nonlocally coupled moisture model for convective self-aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clouds play a central role in climate physics by interacting with precipitation, radiation, and circulation. Although the self-aggregation of clouds is a fundamental problem in convective organization, a theoretical explanation of how it occurs has not been established owing to its complexity. Here, we introduce an idealized mathematical model of the phenomenon in which the state of the system is represented solely by the atmospheric columns' vertically integrated water vapor content. By analyzing the nonlinear dynamics of this simplified system, we mathematically elucidated the mechanisms that determine the onset of self-aggregation and the spatial scale of the self-aggregated state. Nonlocal coupling between atmospheric columns makes the system bistable with dry and moist equilibria, reflecting the effect of circulation driven by horizontal differential heating due to convection and radiation. The bistable self-aggregated state is realized when destabilization by nonlocal coupling triggered by finite-amplitude disturbances in the uniform state overwhelms the stabilization by diffusion. For globally coupled systems in which all the columns are equally coupled, the perturbation of the maximum wavelength has the maximum growth rate. A solution with an infinitely long wavelength exists, which can be understood as the dynamical system's heteroclinic trajectories describing the steady state's spatial evolution. In contrast, for nonlocally coupled systems with finite filter lengths, perturbation of the wavelength close to the characteristic length of the coupling is preferred. The results revealed that the balance between nonlocal coupling and diffusion is essential for understanding convective self-aggregation.</description>

      <title>From trees to rain: Enhancement of cloud glaciation and precipitation by pollen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability of pollen to enable the glaciation of supercooled liquid water has been demonstrated in laboratory studies; however, the potential large-scale effect of trees and pollen on clouds, precipitation and climate is pressing knowledge to better understand and project clouds in the current and future climate. Combining ground-based measurements of pollen concentrations and satellite observations of cloud properties within the United States, we show that enhanced pollen concentrations during springtime lead to a higher cloud ice fraction. We further establish the link from the pollen-induced increase in cloud ice to a higher precipitation frequency. In light of anthropogenic climate change, the extended and strengthened pollen season and future alterations in biodiversity can introduce a localized climate forcing and a modification of the precipitation frequency and intensity.</description>

      <title>A data-driven framework for dimensionality reduction and causal inference in climate fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14433v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a data-driven framework to simplify the description of spatiotemporal climate variability into few entities and their causal linkages. Given a high-dimensional climate field, the methodology first reduces its dimensionality into a set of regionally constrained patterns. Time-dependent causal links are then inferred in the interventional sense through the fluctuation-response formalism, as shown in Baldovin et al. (2020). These two steps allow to explore how regional climate variability can influence remote locations. To distinguish between true and spurious responses, we propose a novel analytical null model for the fluctuation-dissipation relation, therefore allowing for uncertainty estimation at a given confidence level. Finally, we select a set of metrics to summarize the results, offering a useful and simplified approach to explore climate dynamics. We showcase the methodology on the monthly sea surface temperature field at global scale. We demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed framework by studying few individual links as well as "link maps", visualizing the cumulative degree of causation between a given region and the whole system. Finally, each pattern is ranked in terms of its "causal strength", quantifying its relative ability to influence the system's dynamics. We argue that the methodology allows to explore and characterize causal relationships in high-dimensional spatiotemporal fields in a rigorous and interpretable way.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Model-based Probabilistic Downscaling for 180-year East Asian Climate Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As our planet is entering into the "global boiling" era, understanding regional climate change becomes imperative. Effective downscaling methods that provide localized insights are crucial for this target. Traditional approaches, including computationally-demanding regional dynamical models or statistical downscaling frameworks, are often susceptible to the influence of downscaling uncertainty. Here, we address these limitations by introducing a diffusion probabilistic downscaling model (DPDM) into the meteorological field. This model can efficiently transform data from 1{\deg} to 0.1{\deg} resolution. Compared with deterministic downscaling schemes, it not only has more accurate local details, but also can generate a large number of ensemble members based on probability distribution sampling to evaluate the uncertainty of downscaling. Additionally, we apply the model to generate a 180-year dataset of monthly surface variables in East Asia, offering a more detailed perspective for understanding local scale climate change over the past centuries.</description>
