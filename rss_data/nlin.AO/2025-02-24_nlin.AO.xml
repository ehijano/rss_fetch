      <title>Antifragility and response to damage in the synchronization of oscillators on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a mathematical framework to assess the impact of damage, defined as the reduction of weight in a specific link, on identical oscillator systems governed by the Kuramoto model and coupled through weighted networks. We analyze how weight modifications in a single link affect the system when its global function is to achieve the synchronization of coupled oscillators starting from random initial phases. We introduce different measures that allow the identification of cases where damage enhances synchronization (antifragile response), deteriorates it (fragile response), or has no significant impact. Using numerical solutions of the Kuramoto model, we investigate the effects of damage on network links where antifragility emerges. Our analysis includes lollipop graphs of varying sizes and a comprehensive evaluation and all the edges of 109 non-isomorphic graphs with six nodes. The approach is general and can be applied to study antifragility in other oscillator systems with different coupling mechanisms, offering a pathway for the quantitative exploration of antifragility in diverse complex systems.</description>

      <title>Collective behaviors of self-propelled particles with tunable alignment angles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel aligning active matter model by extending the nematic alignment rule in self-propelled rods to tunable alignment angles, as represented by collision of cone-shaped particles. Non-vanishing alignment angles introduce frustration in the many-body interactions, and we investigate its effect on the collective behavior of the system. Through numerical simulations of an agent-based microscopic model, we found that the system exhibits distinct phenomenology compared to the original self-propelled rods. In particular, anti-parallel bands are observed in an intermediate parameter range. The linear stability analysis of the continuum description derived from the Boltzmann approach demonstrates qualitative consistency with the microscopic model, while frustration due to many-body interactions in the latter destabilizes homogeneous nematic order over a wide range of the alignment angle.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal-coupling-based control of stochastic resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that nonlocal coupling provides for controlling the collective noise-induced dynamics in the regime of stochastic resonance. This effect is demonstrated by means of numerical simulation on an example of coupled overdamped bistable oscillators. In particular, it has been established that increasing the coupling radius and coupling strength allows to enhance or to suppress the effect of stochastic resonance which is reflected in the evolution of the dependence of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) on the noise intensity for varying coupling parameters. Nonlocal coupling is considered as an intermediate option between local and global (pairwise or higher-order interactions) coupling topologies which are also discussed in the context of the stochastic resonance control.</description>

      <title>Harnessing omnipresent oscillator networks as computational resource</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nature is pervaded with oscillatory behavior. In networks of coupled oscillators patterns can arise when the system synchronizes to an external input. Hence, these networks provide processing and memory of input. We present a universal framework for harnessing oscillator networks as computational resource. This reservoir computing framework is introduced by the ubiquitous model for phase-locking, the Kuramoto model. We force the Kuramoto model by a nonlinear target-system, then after substituting the target-system with a trained feedback-loop it emulates the target-system. Our results are two-fold. Firstly, the trained network inherits performance properties of the Kuramoto model, where all-to-all coupling is performed in linear time with respect to the number of nodes and parameters for synchronization are abundant. Secondly, the learning capabilities of the oscillator network can be explained using Kuramoto model's order parameter. This work provides the foundation for utilizing nature's oscillator networks as a new class of information processing systems.</description>
