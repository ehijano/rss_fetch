      <title>Semi-Algebraic Off-line Range Searching and Biclique Partitions in the Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $P$ be a set of $m$ points in ${\mathbb R}^2$, let $\Sigma$ be a set of $n$ semi-algebraic sets of constant complexity in ${\mathbb R}^2$, let $(S,+)$ be a semigroup, and let $w: P \rightarrow S$ be a weight function on the points of $P$. We describe a randomized algorithm for computing $w(P\cap\sigma)$ for every $\sigma\in\Sigma$ in overall expected time $O^*\bigl( m^{\frac{2s}{5s-4}}n^{\frac{5s-6}{5s-4}} + m^{2/3}n^{2/3} + m + n \bigr)$, where $s&gt;0$ is a constant that bounds the maximum complexity of the regions of $\Sigma$, and where the $O^*(\cdot)$ notation hides subpolynomial factors. For $s\ge 3$, surprisingly, this bound is smaller than the best-known bound for answering $m$ such queries in an on-line manner. The latter takes $O^*(m^{\frac{s}{2s-1}}n^{\frac{2s-2}{2s-1}}+m+n)$ time.
  Let $\Phi: \Sigma \times P \rightarrow \{0,1\}$ be the Boolean predicate (of constant complexity) such that $\Phi(\sigma,p) = 1$ if $p\in\sigma$ and $0$ otherwise, and let $\Sigma\mathop{\Phi} P = \{ (\sigma,p) \in \Sigma\times P \mid \Phi(\sigma,p)=1\}$. Our algorithm actually computes a partition ${\mathcal B}_\Phi$ of $\Sigma\mathop{\Phi} P$ into bipartite cliques (bicliques) of size (i.e., sum of the sizes of the vertex sets of its bicliques) $O^*\bigl( m^{\frac{2s}{5s-4}}n^{\frac{5s-6}{5s-4}} + m^{2/3}n^{2/3} + m + n \bigr)$. It is straightforward to compute $w(P\cap\sigma)$ for all $\sigma\in \Sigma$ from ${\mathcal B}_\Phi$. Similarly, if $\eta: \Sigma \rightarrow S$ is a weight function on the regions of $\Sigma$, $\sum_{\sigma\in \Sigma: p \in \sigma} \eta(\sigma)$, for every point $p\in P$, can be computed from ${\mathcal B}_\Phi$ in a straightforward manner. A recent work of Chan et al. solves the online version of this dual point enclosure problem within the same performance bound as our off-line solution. We also mention a few other applications of computing ${\mathcal B}_\Phi$.</description>

      <title>Semialgebraic Range Stabbing, Ray Shooting, and Intersection Counting in the Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polynomial partitioning techniques have recently led to improved geometric data structures for a variety of fundamental problems related to semialgebraic range searching and intersection searching in 3D and higher dimensions (e.g., see [Agarwal, Aronov, Ezra, and Zahl, SoCG 2019; Ezra and Sharir, SoCG 2021; Agarwal, Aronov, Ezra, Katz, and Sharir, SoCG 2022]). They have also led to improved algorithms for offline versions of semialgebraic range searching in 2D, via lens-cutting [Sharir and Zahl (2017)]. In this paper, we show that these techniques can yield new data structures for a number of other 2D problems even for online queries:
  1. Semialgebraic range stabbing. We present a data structure for $n$ semialgebraic ranges in 2D of constant description complexity with $O(n^{3/2+\varepsilon})$ preprocessing time and space, so that we can count the number of ranges containing a query point in $O(n^{1/4+\varepsilon})$ time, for an arbitrarily small constant $\varepsilon&gt;0$.
  2. Ray shooting amid algebraic arcs. We present a data structure for $n$ algebraic arcs in 2D of constant description complexity with $O(n^{3/2+\varepsilon})$ preprocessing time and space, so that we can find the first arc hit by a query (straight-line) ray in $O(n^{1/4+\varepsilon})$ time.
  3. Intersection counting amid algebraic arcs. We present a data structure for $n$ algebraic arcs in 2D of constant description complexity with $O(n^{3/2+\varepsilon})$ preprocessing time and space, so that we can count the number of intersection points with a query algebraic arc of constant description complexity in $O(n^{1/2+\varepsilon})$ time. In particular, this implies an $O(n^{3/2+\varepsilon})$-time algorithm for counting intersections between two sets of $n$ algebraic arcs in 2D.</description>

      <title>Structural Validation Of Synthetic Power Distribution Networks Using The Multiscale Flat Norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of comparing a pair of geometric networks that may not be similarly defined, i.e., when they do not have one-to-one correspondences between their nodes and edges. Our motivating application is to compare power distribution networks of a region. Due to the lack of openly available power network datasets, researchers synthesize realistic networks resembling their actual counterparts. But the synthetic digital twins may vary significantly from one another and from actual networks due to varying underlying assumptions and approaches. Hence the user wants to evaluate the quality of networks in terms of their structural similarity to actual power networks. But the lack of correspondence between the networks renders most standard approaches, e.g., subgraph isomorphism and edit distance, unsuitable.
  We propose an approach based on the multiscale flat norm, a notion of distance between objects defined in the field of geometric measure theory, to compute the distance between a pair of planar geometric networks. Using a triangulation of the domain containing the input networks, the flat norm distance between two networks at a given scale can be computed by solving a linear program. In addition, this computation automatically identifies the 2D regions (patches) that capture where the two networks are different. We demonstrate through 2D examples that the flat norm distance can capture the variations of inputs more accurately than the commonly used Hausdorff distance. As a notion of stability, we also derive upper bounds on the flat norm distance between a simple 1D curve and its perturbed version as a function of the radius of perturbation for a restricted class of perturbations. We demonstrate our approach on a set of actual power networks from a county in the USA.</description>

      <title>Morse Theory for the k-NN Distance Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $k$-th nearest neighbor distance function from a finite point-set in $\mathbb{R}^d$. We provide a Morse theoretic framework to analyze the sub-level set topology. In particular, we present a simple combinatorial-geometric characterization for critical points and their indices, along with detailed information about the possible changes in homology at the critical levels. We conclude by computing the expected number of critical points for a homogeneous Poisson process. Our results deliver significant insights and tools for the analysis of persistent homology in order-$k$ Delaunay mosaics, and random $k$-fold coverage.</description>

      <title>Fr\'{e}chet Edit Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define and investigate the Fr\'{e}chet edit distance problem. Given two polygonal curves $\pi$ and $\sigma$ and a threshhold value $\delta&gt;0$, we seek the minimum number of edits to $\sigma$ such that the Fr\'{e}chet distance between the edited $\sigma$ and $\pi$ is at most $\delta$. For the edit operations we consider three cases, namely, deletion of vertices, insertion of vertices, or both. For this basic problem we consider a number of variants. Specifically, we provide polynomial time algorithms for both discrete and continuous Fr\'{e}chet edit distance variants, as well as hardness results for weak Fr\'{e}chet edit distance variants.</description>

      <title>Plane Hamiltonian Cycles in Convex Drawings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A conjecture by Rafla from 1988 asserts that every simple drawing of the complete graph $K_n$ admits a plane Hamiltonian cycle. It turned out that already the existence of much simpler non-crossing substructures in such drawings is hard to prove. Recent progress was made by Aichholzer et al. and by Suk and Zeng who proved the existence of a plane path of length $\Omega(\log n / \log \log n)$ and of a plane matching of size $\Omega(n^{1/2})$ in every simple drawing of $K_{n}$.
  Instead of studying simpler substructures, we prove Rafla's conjecture for the subclass of convex drawings, the most general class in the convexity hierarchy introduced by Arroyo et al. Moreover, we show that every convex drawing of $K_n$ contains a plane Hamiltonian path between each pair of vertices (Hamiltonian connectivity) and a plane $k$-cycle for each $3 \leq k \leq n$ (pancyclicity), and present further results on maximal plane subdrawings.</description>
