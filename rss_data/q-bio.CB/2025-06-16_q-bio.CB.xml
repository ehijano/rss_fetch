      <title>HEIST: A Graph Foundation Model for Spatial Transcriptomics and Proteomics Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-cell transcriptomics has become a great source for data-driven insights into biology, enabling the use of advanced deep learning methods to understand cellular heterogeneity and transcriptional regulation at the single-cell level. With the advent of spatial transcriptomics data we have the promise of learning about cells within a tissue context as it provides both spatial coordinates and transcriptomic readouts. However, existing models either ignore spatial resolution or the gene regulatory information. Gene regulation in cells can change depending on microenvironmental cues from neighboring cells, but existing models neglect gene regulatory patterns with hierarchical dependencies across levels of abstraction. In order to create contextualized representations of cells and genes from spatial transcriptomics data, we introduce HEIST, a hierarchical graph transformer-based foundation model for spatial transcriptomics and proteomics data. HEIST models tissue as spatial cellular neighborhood graphs, and each cell is, in turn, modeled as a gene regulatory network graph. The framework includes a hierarchical graph transformer that performs cross-level message passing and message passing within levels. HEIST is pre-trained on 22.3M cells from 124 tissues across 15 organs using spatially-aware contrastive learning and masked auto-encoding objectives. Unsupervised analysis of HEIST representations of cells, shows that it effectively encodes the microenvironmental influences in cell embeddings, enabling the discovery of spatially-informed subpopulations that prior models fail to differentiate. Further, HEIST achieves state-of-the-art results on four downstream task such as clinical outcome prediction, cell type annotation, gene imputation, and spatially-informed cell clustering across multiple technologies, highlighting the importance of hierarchical modeling and GRN-based representations.</description>

      <title>Entropy-Constrained Noise Yields Superdiffusive Dynamics in Axonal Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a coarse-grained stochastic model for axonal extension on periodic arrays of parallel micropatterns that integrates three key biophysical mechanisms: (i) the molecular clutch that couples actin retrograde flow to substrate adhesions, (ii) an active biopolymer-based mechanism generating traction-force fluctuations, and (iii) the mechanical interaction of the growth cone with the micropatterned substrate. Using the Shannon-Jaynes maximum entropy principle with constraints derived from experimental observations, we derive a unique probability distribution for the colored acceleration noise that enters the Langevin equation. The resulting stationary process exhibits power-law temporal correlations with negative exponent, which accounts for the observed superdiffusive dynamics of axons. For biologically relevant parameters the model predicts this exponent to be -1/2, in close quantitative agreement with measurements of cortical neurons cultured on patterned substrates.</description>
