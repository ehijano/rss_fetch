      <title>In-band supratransmission in nonlinear flat band lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying wave propagation in nonlinear discrete systems is essential for understanding energy transfer in lattices. While linear systems prohibit wave propagation within the natural band gap, nonlinear systems exhibit {supratransmission}, enabling energy transfer above a critical driving amplitude. This work investigates novel \emph{in-band supratransmissions} for waves with frequencies in a \emph{flat} or \emph{nearly flat} linear band. Flat bands, characterized by zero group velocity and localized modes due to destructive interference, provide an ideal framework for studying wave confinement and energy dynamics. In-band supratransmission originates from a bifurcation of evanescent waves at the flat band frequency. Using nonlinear \emph{diamond} and \emph{stub} lattices as model systems, we explore how lattice topology, nonlinearity, and driving amplitude affect supratransmission. Through bifurcation analysis, stability evaluations, and time-dependent simulations, we examine the transition from energy localization to supratransmission.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Trajectory Drift and Geometric Phases of Cyclic Spinor Solitons Induced by Virtual Magnetic Monopoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate with spin-orbit coupling numerically and analytically. Under the drive of a weak segmented rotational external field, we observe that the system exhibits cyclic soliton motion; however, in contrast to the predictions of quasi-particle theory, the trajectory of the soliton center shows a distinct drift. The underlying mechanism of this anomalous drift is revealed: the moving soliton experiences a Lorentz force induced by a virtual magnetic monopole field in momentum space. We further calculate the phase evolution of the soliton during this cyclic motion and find that its geometric component comprises both an adiabatic Berry phase and a nonadiabatic Aharonov-Anandan phase. Notably, the Berry phase can be expressed in terms of the magnetic flux of the aforementioned virtual monopole field. Our findings hold implications for geometric phase theory and experiments on two-component Bose-Einstein condensates, and may establish a novel link between quantum geometry and soliton dynamics.</description>

      <title>Oscillating ring ferrodark solitons with breathing nematic core in a homogeneous spinor superfluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of ring ferrodark solitons (FDSs) in a homogeneous quasi-two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnetic spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). In contrast to the usual expanding dynamics of ring dark solitons in a homogeneous system, the ring FDS radius exhibits self-sustained oscillations accompanied by the nematic tensor breathing at the magnetization-vanishing ring FDS core. When the ring radius greatly exceeds the FDS width, motion is nearly elastic, and we derive the ring-radius equation of motion (EOM) which admits exact solutions. This equation can be recast into a form analogous to the inviscid Rayleigh-Plesset equation governing spherical bubble dynamics in classical fluids, but with anomalous terms. At the ring FDS core, the nematic tensor motion is parameterized by a single parameter that connects the two types of FDSs monotonically. Beyond the hydrodynamics regime, density and spin wave emissions become significant and cause energy loss, shrinking the ring FDS radius oscillation; below a threshold, collapses occur followed by the ring FDS annihilation. In the zero quadratic Zeeman energy limit, the ring radius and eigenvalues of the nematic tensor become stationary, while oscillations of the nematic tensor components, driven by the ring curvature, persist at the core. Excellent agreements are found between analytical predictions and numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional magnetization textures as quaternionic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thanks to the recent progress in bulk full three-dimensional nanoscale magnetization distribution imaging, there is a growing interest to three-dimensional (3D) magnetization textures, promising new high information density spintronic applications. Compared to 1D domain walls or 2D magnetic vortices/skyrmions, they are a much harder challenge to represent, analyze and reason about. In this Letter we build analytical representation for such a textures (with arbitrary number of singularity-free hopfions and singular Bloch point pairs) as products of simple quaternionic functions. It can be useful as a language for expressing theoretical models of 3D magnetization textures and specifying a variety of topologically non-trivial initial conditions for micromagnetic simulations.</description>

      <title>Dirac monopole magnets in non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15186v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically establish that non-Hermitian perturbations induce a topological transformation of point-like Dirac monopoles into extended monopole distributions, characterized by distinct charge configurations emergent from three distinct Berry connection forms. Using piecewise adiabatic evolution, we confirm the validity of these configurations through observations of complex geometric phases. Most critically, we find a quantitative relation $\Delta \phi_d = \Delta \phi_g$, which quantifies how cumulative minute energy differences (\(\Delta \phi_d\)) manifest as geometric phase shifts (\(\Delta \phi_g\)) uniquely in non-Hermitian systems. We further propose a scheme leveraging soliton dynamics in dissipative two-component Bose-Einstein condensates, enabling direct measurement of these topological signatures. These results establish a milestone for understanding Dirac monopole charge distributions and measuring complex geometric phases in non-Hermitian systems, with far-reaching implications for topological quantum computing and non-Hermitian photonics.</description>
