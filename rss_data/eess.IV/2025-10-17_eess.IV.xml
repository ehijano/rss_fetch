      <description>arXiv:2510.13867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JPEG AI is an emerging learning-based image coding standard developed by Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG). The scope of the JPEG AI is the creation of a practical learning-based image coding standard offering a single-stream, compact compressed domain representation, targeting both human visualization and machine consumption. Scheduled for completion in early 2025, the first version of JPEG AI focuses on human vision tasks, demonstrating significant BD-rate reductions compared to existing standards, in terms of MS-SSIM, FSIM, VIF, VMAF, PSNR-HVS, IW-SSIM and NLPD quality metrics. Designed to ensure broad interoperability, JPEG AI incorporates various design features to support deployment across diverse devices and applications. This paper provides an overview of the technical features and characteristics of the JPEG AI standard.</description>

      <title>Incomplete Multi-view Clustering via Hierarchical Semantic Alignment and Cooperative Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incomplete multi-view data, where certain views are entirely missing for some samples, poses significant challenges for traditional multi-view clustering methods. Existing deep incomplete multi-view clustering approaches often rely on static fusion strategies or two-stage pipelines, leading to suboptimal fusion results and error propagation issues. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel incomplete multi-view clustering framework based on Hierarchical Semantic Alignment and Cooperative Completion (HSACC). HSACC achieves robust cross-view fusion through a dual-level semantic space design. In the low-level semantic space, consistency alignment is ensured by maximizing mutual information across views. In the high-level semantic space, adaptive view weights are dynamically assigned based on the distributional affinity between individual views and an initial fused representation, followed by weighted fusion to generate a unified global representation. Additionally, HSACC implicitly recovers missing views by projecting aligned latent representations into high-dimensional semantic spaces and jointly optimizes reconstruction and clustering objectives, enabling cooperative learning of completion and clustering. Experimental results demonstrate that HSACC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on five benchmark datasets. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the hierarchical alignment and dynamic weighting mechanisms, while parameter analysis confirms the model's robustness to hyperparameter variations.</description>

      <title>Millimeter Wave Inverse Pinhole Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millimeter wave (mmWave) radars are popular for perception in vision-denied contexts due to their compact size. This paper explores emerging use-cases that involve static mount or momentarily-static compact radars, for example, a hovering drone. The key challenge with static compact radars is that their limited form-factor also limits their angular resolution. This paper presents Umbra, a mmWave high resolution imaging system, that introduces the concept of rotating mmWave "inverse pinholes" for angular resolution enhancement. We present the imaging system model, design, and evaluation of mmWave inverse pinholes. The inverse pinhole is attractive for its lightweight nature, which enables low-power rotation, upgrading static-mount radars. We also show how propellers in aerial vehicles act as natural inverse pinholes and can enjoy the benefits of high-resolution imaging even while they are momentarily static, e.g., hovering. Our evaluation shows Umbra resolving up to 2.5$^{\circ}$ with just a single antenna, a 5$\times$ improvement compared to 14$^{\circ}$ from a compact mmWave radar baseline.</description>

      <title>Image-based Facial Rig Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an image-based rig inversion framework that leverages two modalities: RGB appearance and RGB-encoded normal maps. Each modality is processed by an independent Hiera transformer backbone, and the extracted features are fused to regress 102 rig parameters derived from the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). Experiments on synthetic and scanned datasets demonstrate that the method generalizes to scanned data, producing faithful reconstructions.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation in Spatio-Temporal Echocardiography Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain adaptation methods aim to bridge the gap between datasets by enabling knowledge transfer across domains, reducing the need for additional expert annotations. However, many approaches struggle with reliability in the target domain, an issue particularly critical in medical image segmentation, where accuracy and anatomical validity are essential. This challenge is further exacerbated in spatio-temporal data, where the lack of temporal consistency can significantly degrade segmentation quality, and particularly in echocardiography, where the presence of artifacts and noise can further hinder segmentation performance. To address these issues, we present RL4Seg3D, an unsupervised domain adaptation framework for 2D + time echocardiography segmentation. RL4Seg3D integrates novel reward functions and a fusion scheme to enhance key landmark precision in its segmentations while processing full-sized input videos. By leveraging reinforcement learning for image segmentation, our approach improves accuracy, anatomical validity, and temporal consistency while also providing, as a beneficial side effect, a robust uncertainty estimator, which can be used at test time to further enhance segmentation performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on over 30,000 echocardiographic videos, showing that it outperforms standard domain adaptation techniques without the need for any labels on the target domain. Code is available at https://github.com/arnaudjudge/RL4Seg3D.</description>

      <title>A Density-Informed Multimodal Artificial Intelligence Framework for Improving Breast Cancer Detection Across All Breast Densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mammography, the current standard for breast cancer screening, has reduced sensitivity in women with dense breast tissue, contributing to missed or delayed diagnoses. Thermalytix, an AI-based thermal imaging modality, captures functional vascular and metabolic cues that may complement mammographic structural data. This study investigates whether a breast density-informed multi-modal AI framework can improve cancer detection by dynamically selecting the appropriate imaging modality based on breast tissue composition. A total of 324 women underwent both mammography and thermal imaging. Mammography images were analyzed using a multi-view deep learning model, while Thermalytix assessed thermal images through vascular and thermal radiomics. The proposed framework utilized Mammography AI for fatty breasts and Thermalytix AI for dense breasts, optimizing predictions based on tissue type. This multi-modal AI framework achieved a sensitivity of 94.55% (95% CI: 88.54-100) and specificity of 79.93% (95% CI: 75.14-84.71), outperforming standalone mammography AI (sensitivity 81.82%, specificity 86.25%) and Thermalytix AI (sensitivity 92.73%, specificity 75.46%). Importantly, the sensitivity of Mammography dropped significantly in dense breasts (67.86%) versus fatty breasts (96.30%), whereas Thermalytix AI maintained high and consistent sensitivity in both (92.59% and 92.86%, respectively). This demonstrates that a density-informed multi-modal AI framework can overcome key limitations of unimodal screening and deliver high performance across diverse breast compositions. The proposed framework is interpretable, low-cost, and easily deployable, offering a practical path to improving breast cancer screening outcomes in both high-resource and resource-limited settings.</description>

      <title>EdgeNavMamba: Mamba Optimized Object Detection for Energy Efficient Edge Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deployment of efficient and accurate Deep Learning models has long been a challenge in autonomous navigation, particularly for real-time applications on resource-constrained edge devices. Edge devices are limited in computing power and memory, making model efficiency and compression essential. In this work, we propose EdgeNavMamba, a reinforcement learning-based framework for goal-directed navigation using an efficient Mamba object detection model. To train and evaluate the detector, we introduce a custom shape detection dataset collected in diverse indoor settings, reflecting visual cues common in real-world navigation. The object detector serves as a pre-processing module, extracting bounding boxes (BBOX) from visual input, which are then passed to an RL policy to control goal-oriented navigation. Experimental results show that the student model achieved a reduction of 67% in size, and up to 73% in energy per inference on edge devices of NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano and Raspberry Pi 5, while keeping the same performance as the teacher model. EdgeNavMamba also maintains high detection accuracy in MiniWorld and IsaacLab simulators while reducing parameters by 31% compared to the baseline. In the MiniWorld simulator, the navigation policy achieves over 90% success across environments of varying complexity.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed autoencoder for DSC-MRI Perfusion post-processing: application to glioma grading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: DSC-MRI perfusion is a medical imaging technique for diagnosing and prognosing brain tumors and strokes. Its analysis relies on mathematical deconvolution, but noise or motion artifacts in a clinical environment can disrupt this process, leading to incorrect estimate of perfusion parameters. Although deep learning approaches have shown promising results, their calibration typically rely on third-party deconvolution algorithms to generate reference outputs and are bound to reproduce their limitations.
  To adress this problem, we propose a physics-informed autoencoder that leverages an analytical model to decode the perfusion parameters and guide the learning of the encoding network. This autoencoder is trained in a self-supervised fashion without any third-party software and its performance is evaluated on a database with glioma patients. Our method shows reliable results for glioma grading in accordance with other well-known deconvolution algorithms despite a lower computation time. It also achieved competitive performance even in the presence of high noise which is critical in a medical environment.</description>

      <title>Optical Computation-in-Communication enables low-latency, high-fidelity perception in telesurgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) holds significant promise for enhancing intraoperative perception and decision-making in telesurgery, where physical separation impairs sensory feedback and control. Despite advances in medical AI and surgical robotics, conventional electronic AI architectures remain fundamentally constrained by the compounded latency from serial processing of inference and communication. This limitation is especially critical in latency-sensitive procedures such as endovascular interventions, where delays over 200 ms can compromise real-time AI reliability and patient safety. Here, we introduce an Optical Computation-in-Communication (OCiC) framework that reduces end-to-end latency significantly by performing AI inference concurrently with optical communication. OCiC integrates Optical Remote Computing Units (ORCUs) directly into the optical communication pathway, with each ORCU experimentally achieving up to 69 tera-operations per second per channel through spectrally efficient two-dimensional photonic convolution. The system maintains ultrahigh inference fidelity within 0.1% of CPU/GPU baselines on classification and coronary angiography segmentation, while intrinsically mitigating cumulative error propagation, a longstanding barrier to deep optical network scalability. We validated the robustness of OCiC through outdoor dark fibre deployments, confirming consistent and stable performance across varying environmental conditions. When scaled globally, OCiC transforms long-haul fibre infrastructure into a distributed photonic AI fabric with exascale potential, enabling reliable, low-latency telesurgery across distances up to 10,000 km and opening a new optical frontier for distributed medical intelligence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Camera movement conveys spatial and narrative information essential for understanding video content. While recent camera movement classification (CMC) methods perform well on modern datasets, their generalization to historical footage remains unexplored. This paper presents the first systematic evaluation of deep video CMC models on archival film material. We summarize representative methods and datasets, highlighting differences in model design and label definitions. Five standard video classification models are assessed on the HISTORIAN dataset, which includes expert-annotated World War II footage. The best-performing model, Video Swin Transformer, achieves 80.25% accuracy, showing strong convergence despite limited training data. Our findings highlight the challenges and potential of adapting existing models to low-quality video and motivate future work combining diverse input modalities and temporal architectures.</description>

      <title>TABSurfer: a Hybrid Deep Learning Architecture for Subcortical Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Subcortical segmentation remains challenging despite its important applications in quantitative structural analysis of brain MRI scans. The most accurate method, manual segmentation, is highly labor intensive, so automated tools like FreeSurfer have been adopted to handle this task. However, these traditional pipelines are slow and inefficient for processing large datasets. In this study, we propose TABSurfer, a novel 3D patch-based CNN-Transformer hybrid deep learning model designed for superior subcortical segmentation compared to existing state-of-the-art tools. To evaluate, we first demonstrate TABSurfer's consistent performance across various T1w MRI datasets with significantly shorter processing times compared to FreeSurfer. Then, we validate against manual segmentations, where TABSurfer outperforms FreeSurfer based on the manual ground truth. In each test, we also establish TABSurfer's advantage over a leading deep learning benchmark, FastSurferVINN. Together, these studies highlight TABSurfer's utility as a powerful tool for fully automated subcortical segmentation with high fidelity.</description>

      <title>Pruning Sparse Tensor Neural Networks Enables Deep Learning for 3D Ultrasound Localization Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultrasound Localization Microscopy (ULM) is a non-invasive technique that allows for the imaging of micro-vessels in vivo, at depth and with a resolution on the order of ten microns. ULM is based on the sub-resolution localization of individual microbubbles injected in the bloodstream. Mapping the whole angioarchitecture requires the accumulation of microbubbles trajectories from thousands of frames, typically acquired over a few minutes. ULM acquisition times can be reduced by increasing the microbubble concentration, but requires more advanced algorithms to detect them individually. Several deep learning approaches have been proposed for this task, but they remain limited to 2D imaging, in part due to the associated large memory requirements. Herein, we propose to use sparse tensor neural networks to reduce memory usage in 2D and to improve the scaling of the memory requirement for the extension of deep learning architecture to 3D. We study several approaches to efficiently convert ultrasound data into a sparse format and study the impact of the associated loss of information. When applied in 2D, the sparse formulation reduces the memory requirements by a factor 2 at the cost of a small reduction of performance when compared against dense networks. In 3D, the proposed approach reduces memory requirements by two order of magnitude while largely outperforming conventional ULM in high concentration settings. We show that Sparse Tensor Neural Networks in 3D ULM allow for the same benefits as dense deep learning based method in 2D ULM i.e. the use of higher concentration in silico and reduced acquisition time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present VoxelPrompt, an end-to-end image analysis agent that tackles free-form radiological tasks. Given any number of volumetric medical images and a natural language prompt, VoxelPrompt integrates a language model that generates executable code to invoke a jointly-trained, adaptable vision network. This code further carries out analytical steps to address practical quantitative aims, such as measuring the growth of a tumor across visits. The pipelines generated by VoxelPrompt automate analyses that currently require practitioners to painstakingly combine multiple specialized vision and statistical tools. We evaluate VoxelPrompt using diverse neuroimaging tasks and show that it can delineate hundreds of anatomical and pathological features, measure complex morphological properties, and perform open-language analysis of lesion characteristics. VoxelPrompt performs these objectives with an accuracy similar to that of specialist single-task models for image analysis, while facilitating a broad range of compositional biomedical workflows.</description>

      <title>A Clinically-Grounded Two-Stage Framework for Renal CT Report Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objective Renal cancer is a common malignancy and a major cause of cancer-related deaths. Computed tomography (CT) is central to early detection, staging, and treatment planning. However, the growing CT workload increases radiologists' burden and risks incomplete documentation. Automatically generating accurate reports remains challenging because it requires integrating visual interpretation with clinical reasoning. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI), especially large language and vision-language models, offer potential to reduce workload and enhance diagnostic quality.
  Methods We propose a clinically informed, two-stage framework for automatic renal CT report generation. In Stage 1, a multi-task learning model detects structured clinical features from each 2D image. In Stage 2, a vision-language model generates free-text reports conditioned on the image and the detected features. To evaluate clinical fidelity, generated clinical features are extracted from the reports and compared with expert-annotated ground truth.
  Results Experiments on an expert-labeled dataset show that incorporating detected features improves both report quality and clinical accuracy. The model achieved an average AUC of 0.75 for key imaging features and a METEOR score of 0.33, demonstrating higher clinical consistency and fewer template-driven errors.
  Conclusion Linking structured feature detection with conditioned report generation provides a clinically grounded approach to integrate structured prediction and narrative drafting for renal CT reporting. This method enhances interpretability and clinical faithfulness, underscoring the value of domain-relevant evaluation metrics for medical AI development.</description>

      <title>HANS-Net: Hyperbolic Convolution and Adaptive Temporal Attention for Accurate and Generalizable Liver and Tumor Segmentation in CT Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11325</link>

Abstract: Accurate liver and tumor segmentation on abdominal CT images is critical for reliable diagnosis and treatment planning, but remains challenging due to complex anatomical structures, variability in tumor appearance, and limited annotated data. To address these issues, we introduce Hyperbolic-convolutions Adaptive-temporal-attention with Neural-representation and Synaptic-plasticity Network (HANS-Net), a novel segmentation framework that synergistically combines hyperbolic convolutions for hierarchical geometric representation, a wavelet-inspired decomposition module for multi-scale texture learning, a biologically motivated synaptic plasticity mechanism for adaptive feature enhancement, and an implicit neural representation branch to model fine-grained and continuous anatomical boundaries. Additionally, we incorporate uncertainty-aware Monte Carlo dropout to quantify prediction confidence and lightweight temporal attention to improve inter-slice consistency without sacrificing efficiency. Extensive evaluations of the LiTS dataset demonstrate that HANS-Net achieves a mean Dice score of 93.26%, an IoU of 88.09%, an average symmetric surface distance (ASSD) of 0.72 mm, and a volume overlap error (VOE) of 11.91%. Furthermore, cross-dataset validation on the AMOS 2022 dataset obtains an average Dice of 85.09%, IoU of 76.66%, ASSD of 19.49 mm, and VOE of 23.34%, indicating strong generalization across different datasets. These results confirm the effectiveness and robustness of HANS-Net in providing anatomically consistent, accurate, and confident liver and tumor segmentation.</description>

      <title>Bit Allocation Transfer for Perceptual Quality Enhancement of VVC Intra Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mainstream image and video coding standards -- including state-of-the-art codecs like H.266/VVC, AVS3, and AV1 -- adopt a block-based hybrid coding framework. While this framework facilitates straightforward optimization for Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), it struggles to effectively optimize perceptually-aligned metrics such as Multi-Scale Structural Similarity (MS-SSIM). To address this challenge, this paper proposes a low-complexity method to enhance perceptual quality in VVC intra coding by transferring bit allocation knowledge from end-to-end image compression. We introduce a lightweight model trained with perceptual losses to generate a quantization step map. This map implicitly captures block-level perceptual importance, enabling efficient derivation of a QP map for VVC. Experiments on Kodak and CLIC datasets demonstrate significant advantages, both in execution time and perceptual metric performance, with more than 11% BD-rate reduction in terms of MS-SSIM. Our scheme provides an efficient, practical pathway for perceptual enhancement of traditional codecs.</description>

      <title>MetaQAP - A Meta-Learning Approach for Quality-Aware Pretraining in Image Quality Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) is a critical task in a wide range of applications but remains challenging due to the subjective nature of human perception and the complexity of real-world image distortions. This study proposes MetaQAP, a novel no-reference IQA model designed to address these challenges by leveraging quality-aware pre-training and meta-learning. The model performs three key contributions: pre-training Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on a quality-aware dataset, implementing a quality-aware loss function to optimize predictions, and integrating a meta-learner to form an ensemble model that effectively combines predictions from multiple base models. Experimental evaluations were conducted on three benchmark datasets: LiveCD, KonIQ-10K, and BIQ2021. The proposed MetaQAP model achieved exceptional performance with Pearson Linear Correlation Coefficient (PLCC) and Spearman Rank Order Correlation Coefficient (SROCC) scores of 0.9885/0.9812 on LiveCD, 0.9702/0.9658 on KonIQ-10K, and 0.884/0.8765 on BIQ2021, outperforming existing IQA methods. Cross-dataset evaluations further demonstrated the generalizability of the model, with PLCC and SROCC scores ranging from 0.6721 to 0.8023 and 0.6515 to 0.7805, respectively, across diverse datasets. The ablation study confirmed the significance of each model component, revealing substantial performance degradation when critical elements such as the meta-learner or quality-aware loss function were omitted. MetaQAP not only addresses the complexities of authentic distortions but also establishes a robust and generalizable framework for practical IQA applications. By advancing the state-of-the-art in no-reference IQA, this research provides valuable insights and methodologies for future improvements and extensions in the field.</description>

      <title>Towards Inclusive Communication: A Unified Framework for Generating Spoken Language from Sign, Lip, and Audio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Audio is the primary modality for human communication and has driven the success of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technologies. However, such audio-centric systems inherently exclude individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing. Visual alternatives such as sign language and lip reading offer effective substitutes, and recent advances in Sign Language Translation (SLT) and Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) have improved audio-less communication. Yet, these modalities have largely been studied in isolation, and their integration within a unified framework remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose the first unified framework capable of handling diverse combinations of sign language, lip movements, and audio for spoken-language text generation. We focus on three main objectives: (i) designing a unified, modality-agnostic architecture capable of effectively processing heterogeneous inputs; (ii) exploring the underexamined synergy among modalities, particularly the role of lip movements as non-manual cues in sign language comprehension; and (iii) achieving performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art models specialized for individual tasks. Building on this framework, we achieve performance on par with or better than task-specific state-of-the-art models across SLT, VSR, ASR, and Audio-Visual Speech Recognition. Furthermore, our analysis reveals a key linguistic insight: explicitly modeling lip movements as a distinct modality significantly improves SLT performance by capturing critical non-manual cues.</description>

      <title>Time-causal and time-recursive wavelets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05834v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When to apply wavelet analysis to real-time temporal signals, where the future cannot be accessed, it is essential to base all the steps in the signal processing pipeline on computational mechanisms that are truly time-causal.
  This paper describes how a time-causal wavelet analysis can be performed based on concepts developed in the area of temporal scale-space theory, originating from a complete classification of temporal smoothing kernels that guarantee non-creation of new structures from finer to coarser temporal scale levels. By necessity, convolution with truncated exponential kernels in cascade constitutes the only permissable class of kernels, as well as their temporal derivatives as a natural complement to fulfil the admissibility conditions of wavelet representations. For a particular way of choosing the time constants in the resulting infinite convolution of truncated exponential kernels, to ensure temporal scale covariance and thus self-similarity over temporal scales, we describe how mother wavelets can be chosen as temporal derivatives of the resulting time-causal limit kernel.
  By developing connections between wavelet theory and scale-space theory, we characterize and quantify how the continuous scaling properties transfer to the discrete implementation, demonstrating how the proposed time-causal wavelet representation can reflect the duration of locally dominant temporal structures in the input signals.
  We propose that this notion of time-causal wavelet analysis could be a valuable tool for signal processing tasks, where streams of signals are to be processed in real time, specifically for signals that may contain local variations over a rich span of temporal scales, or more generally for analysing physical or biophysical temporal phenomena, where a fully time-causal analysis is called for to be physically realistic.</description>
