      <title>Observational characteristics of circum-planetary-mass-object disks in the era of James Webb Space Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations have confirmed circumplanetary disks (CPDs) embedded in parental protoplanetary disks (PPDs). On the other hand, planetary-mass companions (PMCs) and planetary-mass objects (PMOs) are likely to harbor their own accretion disks. Unlike PPDs, CPDs and other disks around planet analogues are generally too compact to be spatially resolved by current instrumentation. In this study, we generate over 4,000 spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of circum-PMO-disks (CPMODs) with various host temperature and disk properties, which can be categorized into four prototypes, i.e., full, pre-transitional, transitional and evolved CPMODs. We propose a classification scheme based on their near-to-mid-infrared colors. Using those CPMOD models, we synthesize JWST (NIRCam and MIRI) photometry for F444W, F1000W and F2550W wide filters. We show F444W - F1000W and F444 - F2550W colors can be applied to distinguish different types of CPMODs, especially for those around hot hosts. Our results indicate that the ongoing and future JWST observations are promising to unveil structures and properties of CPMODs.</description>

      <title>JWST/NIRCam 4-5 $\mu$m Imaging of the Giant Planet AF Lep b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With a dynamical mass of $3 \, M_\mathrm{Jup}$, the recently discovered giant planet AF Lep b is the lowest-mass imaged planet with a direct mass measurement. Its youth and spectral type near the L/T transition make it a promising target to study the impact of clouds and atmospheric chemistry at low surface gravities. In this work, we present JWST/NIRCam imaging of AF Lep b. Across two epochs, we detect AF Lep b in F444W ($4.4 \, \mathrm{\mu m}$) with S/N ratios of 9.6 and 8.7, respectively. At the planet's separation of $320 \, \mathrm{mas}$ during the observations, the coronagraphic throughput is ${\approx}7\%$, demonstrating that NIRCam's excellent sensitivity persists down to small separations. The F444W photometry of AF Lep b affirms the presence of disequilibrium carbon chemistry and enhanced atmospheric metallicity. These observations also place deep limits on wider-separation planets in the system, ruling out $1.1 \, M_\mathrm{Jup}$ planets beyond $15.6 \, \mathrm{au}$ (0.58 arcsec), $1.1 \, M_\mathrm{Sat}$ planets beyond $27 \, \mathrm{au}$ (1 arcsec), and $2.8 \, M_\mathrm{Nep}$ planets beyond $67 \, \mathrm{au}$ (2.5 arcsec). We also present new Keck/NIRC2 $L'$ imaging of AF Lep b; combining this with the two epochs of F444W photometry and previous Keck $L'$ photometry provides limits on the long-term 3-$5 \, \mathrm{\mu m}$ variability of AF Lep b on months-to-years timescales. AF Lep b is the closest-separation planet imaged with JWST to date, demonstrating that planets can be recovered well inside the nominal (50% throughput) NIRCam coronagraph inner working angle.</description>

      <title>HD 21520 b: a warm sub-Neptune transiting a bright G dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery and validation of HD 21520 b, a transiting planet found with TESS and orbiting a bright G dwarf (V=9.2, $T_{eff} = 5871 \pm 62$ K, $R_{\star} = 1.04\pm 0.02\, R_{\odot}$). HD 21520 b was originally alerted as a system (TOI-4320) consisting of two planet candidates with periods of 703.6 and 46.4 days. However, our analysis supports instead a single-planet system with an orbital period of $25.1292\pm0.0001$ days and radius of $2.70 \pm 0.09\, R_{\oplus}$. Three full transits in sectors 4, 30 and 31 match this period and have transit depths and durations in agreement with each other, as does a partial transit in sector 3. We also observe transits using CHEOPS and LCOGT. SOAR and Gemini high-resolution imaging do not indicate the presence of any nearby companions, and MINERVA-Australis and CORALIE radial velocities rule out an on-target spectroscopic binary. Additionally, we use ESPRESSO radial velocities to obtain a tentative mass measurement of $7.9^{+3.2}_{-3.0}\, M_{\oplus}$, with a 3-$\sigma$ upper limit of 17.7 $M_{\oplus}$. Due to the bright nature of its host and likely significant gas envelope of the planet, HD 21520 b is a promising candidate for further mass measurements and for atmospheric characterization.</description>

      <title>Phase-resolving the absorption signatures of water and carbon monoxide in the atmosphere of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-121b with GEMINI-S/IGRINS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-hot Jupiters are among the best targets for atmospheric characterization at high spectral resolution. Resolving their transmission spectra as a function of orbital phase offers a unique window into the 3D nature of these objects. In this work, we present three transits of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-121b observed with Gemini-S/IGRINS. For the first time, we measure the phase-dependent absorption signals of CO and H$_{\text{2}}$O in the atmosphere of an exoplanet, and we find that they are different. While the blueshift of CO increases during the transit, the absorption lines of H$_{\text{2}}$O become less blueshifted with phase, and even show a redshift in the second half of the transit. These measurements reveal the distinct spatial distributions of both molecules across the atmospheres of ultra-hot Jupiters. Also, we find that the H$_{\text{2}}$O signal is absent in the first quarter of the transit, potentially hinting at cloud formation on the evening terminator of WASP-121b. To further interpret the absorption trails of CO and H$_{\text{2}}$O, as well as the Doppler shifts of Fe previously measured with VLT/ESPRESSO, we compare the data to simulated transits of WASP-121b. To this end, we post-processes the outputs of global circulation models with a 3D Monte-Carlo radiative transfer code. Our analysis shows that the atmosphere of WASP-121b is subject to atmospheric drag, as previously suggested by small hotspot offsets inferred from phase-curve observations. Our study highlights the importance of phase-resolved spectroscopy in unravelling the complex atmospheric structure of ultra-hot Jupiters and sets the stage for further investigations into their chemistry and dynamics.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Magnetic Fields on the Decoupling of H and H+ in the Escaping Atmosphere of GJ436</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of transmission spectra reveals that hot Jupiters and Neptunes are likely to possess 13 escaping atmospheres driven by stellar radiation. Numerous models predict that magnetic fields may 14 exert significant influences on the atmospheres of hot planets. Generally, the escaping atmospheres 15 are not entirely ionized, and magnetic fields only directly affect the escape of ionized components 16 within them. Considering the chemical reactions between ionized components and neutral atoms, 17 as well as collision processes, magnetic fields indirectly impact the escape of neutral atoms, thereby 18 influencing the detection signals of planetary atmospheres in transmission spectra.In order to simulate 19 this process, we developed a magneto-hydrodynamic multi-fluid model based on MHD code PLUTO. 20 As an initial exploration, we investigated the impact of magnetic fields on the decoupling of H+ and 21 H in the escaping atmosphere of the hot Neptune GJ436 b. Due to the strong resonant interactions 22 between H and H+. The coupling between them is tight even if the magnetic field is strong. However, 23 our simulation results indicate that under the influence of magnetic fields, there are noticeable regional 24 differences in the decoupling of H+ and H. With the increase in magnetic field strength, the degree of 25 decoupling also increases. For heavier particles such as O, the decoupling between O and H+ is more 26 pronounced. our findings provide important insights for future studies on the decoupling processes 27 of heavy atoms in the escaping atmospheres of hot Jupiters and hot Neptunes under the influence of 28 magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Morning-to-Evening Limb Asymmetry on the Cool Low-Density Exoplanet WASP-107b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transmission spectroscopy has enabled unprecedented insights into the makeup of exoplanet atmospheres. A transmission spectrum combines contributions from a planet's morning and evening limbs, but these limbs may have different temperatures, compositions, and aerosol properties due to atmospheric circulation. High-resolution ground-based observations have detected limb asymmetry on several ultra-hot (&gt;2000 K) exoplanets, but space-based investigation into limb asymmetry is in its infancy, and limb asymmetry's prevalence in the broader exoplanet population remains unexplored. We find evidence for limb asymmetry on the exoplanet WASP-107b via transmission spectroscopy from 2.5 to 4.0 micrometers with JWST/NIRCam. This is one of the first low-resolution space-based measurements of limb asymmetry and is unique because, at 770 K, WASP-107b is in a relatively cool regime where planetary terminators are expected to be homogeneous. These observations imply a difference in temperature and cloud properties between WASP-107b's limbs, challenging our models of limb asymmetry in this cooler regime.</description>

      <title>The nucleosynthetic fingerprint of the outermost protoplanetary disk and early Solar System dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge of the nucleosynthetic isotope composition of the outermost protoplanetary disk is critical to understand the formation and early dynamical evolution of the Solar System. We report the discovery of outer disk material preserved in a pristine meteorite based on its chemical composition, organic-rich petrology, and 15N-rich, deuterium-rich, and 16O-poor isotope signatures. We infer that this outer disk material originated in the comet-forming region. The nucleosynthetic Fe, Mg, Si and Cr compositions of this material reveal that, contrary to current belief, the isotope signature of the comet-forming region is ubiquitous amongst outer Solar System bodies, possibly reflecting an important planetary building block in the outer Solar System. This nucleosynthetic component represents fresh material added to the outer disk by late accretion streamers connected to the ambient molecular cloud. Our results show that most Solar System carbonaceous asteroids accreted material from the comet-forming region, a signature lacking in the terrestrial planet region.</description>

      <title>Searching for Jupiter and Saturn analog planets with potential icy exomoons -- a Panspermia perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considering the possibility of complex organic molecules and microbial life appearing under the ice shell of those satellites in the Solar system, this study investigates the possible analog sources (targeting the potential ice satellite hosting, Jupiter and Saturn-like planets in exoplanet databases) and the transport of such bioaerosols in an attempt to support or contradict Panspermia, a fringe theory about the fertilization of Earth. Along many general parameters of the candidate planets, the host star, and the star system, additional factors thought to be related to Panspermia were also considered (e.g., the evolution of icy satellites, the frequency of impact related ejection, the traveling time from a source, and so on), revealing the following results. Eleven exosystems, with candidate gas giants hosting icy satellites, were found in a database listing more than 5000 exoplanets. The exomoons of the oldest systems (c.a. &gt; 8 Ga; HD 191939, HD 4203, and HD 34445) could have developed rapidly considering the short formation time (~100 Myrs), which may result in the overlap of the putative early biological evolution and asteroid bombardment phase, providing a higher chance to bioaerosol ejection to space due to frequent collisions. However, the direct transfer might have occurred too early, even before our Solar system was formed, which prevented the fertilization of the latter. A longer formation of the exomoons (~3 Gyrs) significantly reduces the chance of ejection into space by asteroid impacts, which become less frequent over time, but increased the chance of arrival in time to the Solar system. Younger systems, such as HD 217107, HD 219828, HD 140901, and HD 156279 (c.a. 4 to 6 Ga), are better candidates of putative microbe source if the short icy satellite formation, along the higher impact and ejection frequency are expected considering direct transport from those systems.</description>

      <title>GASTLI: An open-source coupled interior-atmosphere model to unveil gas giant composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The metal mass fractions of gas giants are a powerful tool to constrain their formation mechanisms and evolution. The metal content is inferred by comparing mass and radius measurements with interior structure and evolution models. In the midst of the JWST, CHEOPS, TESS, and the forthcoming PLATO era, we are at the brink of obtaining unprecedented precision in radius, age and atmospheric metallicity measurements. To prepare for this wealth of data, we present the GAS gianT modeL for Interiors (GASTLI), an easy-to-use, publicly available Python package. The code is optimized to rapidly calculate mass-radius relations, and radius and luminosity thermal evolution curves for a variety of envelope compositions and core mass fractions. Its applicability spans planets with masses $17 \ M_{\oplus} &lt; M &lt; 6 \ M_{Jup}$, and equilibrium temperatures $T_{eq} &lt; 1000$ K. The interior model is stratified in a core composed of water and rock, and an envelope constituted by H/He and metals (water). The interior is coupled to a grid of self-consistent, cloud-free atmospheric models to determine the atmospheric and boundary interior temperature, as well as the contribution of the atmosphere to the total radius. We successfully validate GASTLI by comparing it to previous work and data of the Solar System's gas giants and Neptune. We also test GASTLI on the Neptune-mass exoplanet HAT-P-26 b, finding a bulk metal mass fraction between 0.60-0.78 and a core mass of 8.5-14.4 $M_{\oplus}$. Finally, we explore the impact of different equations of state and assumptions, such as C/O ratio and transit pressure, in the estimation of bulk metal mass fraction. These differences between interior models entail a change in radius of up to 2.5% for Jupiter-mass planets, but more than 10\% for Neptune-mass. These are equivalent to variations in core mass fraction of 0.07, or 0.10 in envelope metal mass fraction.</description>

      <title>Latitudinal Asymmetry in the Dayside Atmosphere of WASP-43b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two-dimensional near-infrared temperature maps of the canonical hot Jupiter WASP-43b using a phase-curve observation with JWST NIRSpec/G395H. From the white-light planetary transit, we improve constraints on the planet's orbital parameters and measure a planet-to-star radius ratio of $0.15883^{+0.00056}_{-0.00053}$. Using the white-light phase curve, we measure a longitude of maximum brightness of $6.9^{+0^\circ.5}_{-0^\circ.5}$ east of the substellar point and a phase-curve offset of $10.0^{+0^\circ.8}_{-0^\circ.8}$. We also find an $\approx4\sigma$ detection of a latitudinal hotspot offset of $-13.4^{+3^\circ.2}_{-1^\circ.7}$, the first significant detection of a non-equatorial hotspot in an exoplanet atmosphere. We show that this detection is robust to variations within planetary parameter uncertainties, but only if the transit is used to improve constraints, showing the importance of transit observations to eclipse mapping. Maps retrieved from the NRS1 and NRS2 detectors are similar, with hotspot locations consistent between the two detectors at the $1\sigma$ level. Our JWST data show brighter (hotter) nightsides and a dimmer (colder) dayside at the shorter wavelengths relative to fits to \textit{Spitzer} 3.6 and 4.5 \microns\ phase curves. Through comparison between our phase curves and a set of general circulation models, we find evidence for clouds on the nightside and atmospheric drag or high metallicity reducing the eastward hotspot offset.</description>

      <title>MINDS. A multi-instrument investigation into the molecule-rich JWST-MIRI spectrum of the DF Tau binary system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most stars form in multiple systems whose properties can significantly impact circumstellar disk evolution. We investigate the physical and chemical properties of the equal-mass, small separation (~66 mas, ~9 au) DF Tau binary system. Previous observations indicated that only DF Tau A has a circumstellar disk. We present JWST-MIRI MRS observations of DF Tau. The MIRI spectrum shows a forest of H2O lines and emission from CO, C2H2, HCN, CO2, and OH. LTE slab models are used to determine the properties of the gas, and we analyze high angular spatial and spectral resolution data from ALMA, VLTI-GRAVITY, and IRTF-iSHELL to aid in the interpretation of the JWST data. The 1.3 mm ALMA continuum data show two equal-brightness sources of compact (R&lt;3 au) emission, with separations and movement consistent with astrometry from VLTI-GRAVITY and the known orbit. This is interpreted as a robust detection of a disk around DF Tau B, which we suggest may host a small (~1 au) cavity to reconcile all observations. The disk around DF Tau A is expected to be a full disk, and spatially and spectrally resolved dust and gas emission points to hot, close-in (&lt;0.2 au) material. Hot (~500-1000 K) H2O, HCN, and C2H2 emission in the MIRI data likely originate in the DF Tau A disk, while a cold (&lt;200 K) H2O component with an extended emitting area is consistent with an origin from both disks. Despite the very compact outer disks, the inner disk composition and conditions are similar to isolated systems, suggesting that the close binary nature is not a driving factor in setting the inner disk chemistry. However, constraining the geometry of the disks, for instance, via higher resolution ALMA observations, would provide additional insight into the mid-infrared gas emission. JWST observations of spatially resolved binaries will be important for understanding the impact of binarity on inner disk chemistry more generally.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the properties of circumstellar discs (CDs) produced in hydrodynamical simulations of gravoturbulent core collapse considering Kolmogorov and Burger-type turbulence. We report that massive discs are more prevalent in the Kolmogorov regime than for Burger-type turbulence. A significant number of discs are formed with a radius of $\sim$ 15 au in both cases. However, the number of extended discs with radii $&gt;$ 15 au is significantly larger in case of Kolmogorov turbulence. The two regimes of turbulence, in general, yield disc radii in the ranges of 7 au $-$ 30 au, and 13 au $-$ 39 au, respectively. The corresponding ranges of the disc masses are 30.37 $M_{\rm Jup}$ $-$ 0.92 M$_{\odot}$, and 2.09 $M_{\rm Jup}$ $-$ 0.13 M$_{\odot}$, respectively. Moreover, the ratio $M_{\rm disc}$/$M_{\rm star}$ is higher in models of Kolmogorov-type turbulence than in models of Burgers-type turbulence. We do not find any correlation between $R_{\rm disc}$ and $M_{\rm disc}$ over the explored range of initial temperatures (8 K $-$ 14 K) and the type of turbulence. Also, for these initial thermal variations, the turbulent circumstellar disc structures do not exhibit signs of turbulent diffusion. Nonetheless, both sub and supersonic velocity dispersions cause variations in the specific angular momentum (AM) of infalling gas, especially for CDs with radii $\sim$ 16 au $-$ 21 au. The radial profiles of CDs do not correlate with the initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Simulating Brown Dwarf Observations for Various Mass Functions, Birthrates, and Low-mass Cutoffs</title>

Abstract: After decades of brown dwarf discovery and follow-up, we can now infer the functional form of the mass distribution within 20 parsecs, which serves as a constraint on star formation theory at the lowest masses. Unlike objects on the main sequence that have a clear luminosity-to-mass correlation, brown dwarfs lack a correlation between an observable parameter (luminosity, spectral type, or color) and mass. A measurement of the brown dwarf mass function must therefore be procured through proxy measurements and theoretical models. We utilize various assumed forms of the mass function, together with a variety of birthrate functions, low-mass cutoffs, and theoretical evolutionary models, to build predicted forms of the effective temperature distribution. We then determine the best fit of the observed effective temperature distribution to these predictions, which in turn reveals the most likely mass function. We find that a simple power law ($dN/dM \propto M^{-\alpha}$) with $\alpha \approx 0.5$ is optimal. Additionally, we conclude that the low-mass cutoff for star formation is $\lesssim0.005M_{\odot}$. We corroborate the findings of Burgasser (2004) which state that the birthrate has a far lesser impact than the mass function on the form of the temperature distribution, but we note that our alternate birthrates tend to favor slightly smaller values of $\alpha$ than the constant birthrate. Our code for simulating these distributions is publicly available. As another use case for this code, we present findings on the width and location of the subdwarf temperature gap by simulating distributions of very old (8-10 Gyr) brown dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Lichen-Mediated Self-Growing Construction Materials for Habitat Outfitting on Mars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02522v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As its next step in space exploration, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) revealed plans to establish a permanent human presence on Mars. Habitat outfitting, i.e., the technology to provide the crew with the necessary equipment to perform mission tasks as well as a comfortable, safe, and livable habitable volume, has not been fully explored yet. This study proposes that, rather than shipping prefabricated outfitting elements to Mars, habitat outfitting can be realized by in-situ construction using cyanobacteria and fungi as building agents. A synthetic lichen system, composed of diazotrophic cyanobacteria and filamentous fungi, can be created to produce abundant biominerals (CaCO3) and biopolymers, which will glue Martian regolith into consolidated building blocks. These self-growing building blocks can be assembled into various structures, such as floors, walls, partitions, and furniture.</description>
