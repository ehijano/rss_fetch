      <title>Adaptive network dynamics and behavioral contagion in multi-state drug use propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Addictive behavior spreads through social networks via feedback among choice, peer pressure, and shifting ties, a process that eludes standard epidemic models. We present a comprehensive multi-state network model that integrates utility-based behavioral transitions with adaptive network rewiring, capturing the co-evolutionary dynamics between drug use patterns and social structure. Our framework distinguishes four distinct individual states by combining drug use behavior with addiction status, while allowing individuals to strategically disconnect from drug-using neighbors and form new connections with non-users. Monte Carlo simulations show that rewiring reshapes contagion, pulling high-degree nodes into drug-free clusters and stranding users on sparse fringes. Systematic exploration of the four-dimensional parameter space reveals sharp phase transitions reminiscent of critical phenomena in statistical physics, where small changes in recovery rates or addiction conversion rates trigger dramatic shifts in population-level outcomes. Most significantly, the rewiring probability emerges as the dominant control parameter, establishing adaptive network management as more influential than biological susceptibility factors in determining addiction prevalence. Our findings challenge traditional intervention paradigms by revealing that empowering individuals to curate their social environments may be more effective than targeting individual behavioral change alone.</description>

      <title>When Networks Mislead: How Partisan Communication Undermines Democratic Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Democratic societies increasingly rely on communication networks to aggregate citizen preferences and information, yet these same networks can systematically mislead voters under certain conditions. We introduce an agent-based model that captures two rival forces in partisan networks: honest noise filtering that lifts accuracy and strategic bluffing that embeds bias. Extensive simulations show that communication architecture shapes voting accuracy more than any individual-level trait. When candidate quality gaps are moderate, partisan bluffing overpowers honest signals and steers supporters of weaker contenders into collective error. However, positioning independents in central network roles serves as an epistemic circuit breaker, preventing echo chambers from spiraling toward systematic error. Counterintuitively, we discover that competitive elections with meaningful quality differences prove most vulnerable to collective delusion. Small numbers of extreme partisans can contaminate entire communities through cascading bias effects that persist across hundreds of communication rounds. Our findings challenge conventional wisdom about information aggregation in democracy and provide actionable insights for institutional design in an era of algorithmic filtering and social media polarization.</description>

      <title>Ranking dynamics in movies and music</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ranking systems are widely used to simplify and interpret complex data across diverse domains, from economic indicators and sports scores to online content popularity. While previous studies including the Zipf's law have focused on the static, aggregated properties of ranks, in recent years researchers have begun to uncover generic features in their temporal dynamics. In this work, we introduce and study a series of system-level indices that quantify the compositional changes in ranking lists over time, and also characterize the temporal ranking trajectories of individual items' ranking dynamics. We apply our method to analyze ranking dynamics of movies from the over-the-top services, including Netflix, as well as that of music items in Spotify charts. We find that newly released movies or music items influence most the system-level compositional changes of ranking lists; the highest ranks of items are strongly correlated with their lifetimes in the lists more than their first and last ranks. Our findings offer a novel lens to understand collective ranking dynamics and provide a basis for comparing fluctuation patterns across various ordered systems.</description>

      <title>The relationship between episcopal genealogy and ideology in the Roman Catholic Church</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study we investigate how hierarchical structures within the Roman Catholic Church shape the ideological orientation of its leadership. The full episcopal genealogy dataset comprises over 35,000 bishops, each typically consecrated by one principal consecrator and two co-consecrators, forming a dense and historically continuous directed network of episcopal lineage. Within this broader structure, we focus on a dataset of 245 living cardinals to examine whether genealogical proximity correlates with doctrinal alignment on a broad set of theological and sociopolitical issues. We identify motifs that capture recurring patterns of lineage, such as shared consecrators or co-consecrators. In parallel, we apply natural language processing techniques to extract each cardinal's publicly stated positions on ten salient topics, including LGBTQIA+ rights, women's roles in the Church, liturgy, bioethics, priestly celibacy, and migration. Our results show that cardinals linked by specific genealogical motifs, particularly those who share the same principal consecrator, are significantly more likely to exhibit ideological similarity. We find that the influence of pope John Paul II persists through the bishops he consecrated, who demonstrate systematically more conservative views than their peers. These findings underscore the role of hierarchical mentorship in shaping ideological coherence within large-scale religious institutions. Our contribution offers quantitative evidence that institutional lineages, beyond individual background factors, may have an impact on the transmission and consolidation of doctrinal positions over time.</description>

      <title>Harder, shorter, sharper, forward: A comparison of women's and men's elite football gameplay (2020-2025)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elite football is believed to have evolved in recent years, but systematic evidence for the pace and form of that change is sparse. Drawing on event-level records for 13,067 matches in ten top-tier men's and women's leagues in England, Spain, Germany, Italy, and the United States (2020-2025), we quantify match dynamics with two views: conventional performance statistics and pitch-passing networks that track ball movement among a grid of pitch (field) regions. Between 2020 and 2025, average passing volume, pass accuracy, and the percent of passes made under pressure all rose. In general, the largest year-on-year changes occurred in women's competitions. Network measures offer alternative but complementary perspectives on the changing gameplay in recent years, normalized outreach in the pitch passing networks decreased, while the average shortest path lengths increased, indicating a wider ball circulation. Together, these indicators point to a sustained intensification of collective play across contemporary professional football.</description>

      <title>Walking Through Complex Spatial Patterns of Climate and Conflict-Induced Displacements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme weather events are projected to intensify global migration, increase resource competition, and amplify socio-spatial phenomena, including intergroup conflicts, socioeconomic inequalities, and unplanned displacements, among others. Addressing these challenges requires consolidating heterogeneous data to identify, estimate, and predict the dynamical process behind climate-induced movements. We propose a novel hybrid approach to reconstruct hazard-induced displacements by analysing the statistical properties of stochastic walks that explore the spatial network constructed from real movements. The likely trajectories produced by the walker inform the typical journey experienced by individuals, helping identify likely hazards encountered when fleeing high-risk areas. As a proof of concept, we apply this method to Somalia's detailed displacement tracking matrix, containing 20,220 movements dating from February 8th to June 18th, 2025. We reconstruct the likely routes that displaced persons could have taken when fleeing areas affected by conflict or climate hazards. We find that individuals using the most likely paths based on current flows would experience mainly droughts and conflicts, while the latter become less prominent at every next step. We also find that the probability of conflict and drought across all trajectories is widely dispersed, meaning that there is no typical exposure. This work provides an understanding of the mechanisms underlying displacement patterns and a framework for estimating future movements from areas expected to face increasing hazards. We also provide avenues to develop tools that can support policymakers implementing proactive responses and early interventions.</description>

      <title>Characterization Of Diseases In Temporal Comorbidity Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Comorbidity networks, which capture disease-disease co-occurrence usually based on electronic health records, reveal structured patterns in how diseases cluster and progress across individuals. However, how these networks evolve across different age groups and how this evolution relates to properties like disease prevalence and mortality remains understudied. To address these issues, we used publicly available comorbidity networks extracted from a comprehensive dataset of 45 million Austrian hospital stays from 1997 to 2014, covering 8.9 million patients. These networks grow and become denser with age. We identified groups of diseases that exhibit similar patterns of structural centrality throughout the lifespan, revealing three dominant age-related components with peaks in early childhood, midlife, and late life. To uncover the drivers of this structural change, we examined the relationship between prevalence and degree. This allowed us to identify conditions that were disproportionately connected to other diseases. Using betweenness centrality in combination with mortality data, we further identified high-mortality bridging diseases. Several diseases show high connectivity relative to their prevalence, such as iron deficiency anemia (D50) in children, nicotine dependence (F17), and lipoprotein metabolism disorders (E78) in adults. We also highlight structurally central diseases with high mortality that emerge at different life stages, including cancers (C group), liver cirrhosis (K74), subarachnoid hemorrhage (I60), and chronic kidney disease (N18). These findings underscore the importance of targeting age-specific, network-central conditions with high mortality for prevention and integrated care.</description>

      <title>Preliminary analysis of Sus scrofa movement using Hidden Markov Models and Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the complex movement patterns and behavioral characteristics of wild boars using GPS telemetry data collected over a two-month period. Our methodological approach centers on the application of a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to discern distinct behavioral states embedded within the trajectories. Furthermore, the study aimed to construct behavioral networks, derived from these segmented trajectories. The resultant network structures showed that the hidden behavioral patterns are mostly independent of geographical locations. While most locations have many behaviors occuring in them, our findings also suggest that Finally, the research incorporates a spatial trajectory analysis, complemented by raster data validation, to potentially delineate areas acting as repellents within the ecological context of Hainich National Park in Germany.</description>

      <title>Agent-based modeling and the sociology of money: some suggestions for refining monetary theory using social simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The institution of money can be seen as a foundational social mechanism, enabling communities to quantify collectively regulate economic processes. Money can be said, indeed, to constitute the micro-macro link in economics. This paper reviews influential views on the nature of money in economics and sociology, contrasting them to the relatively limited findings of recent agent-based models of "the emergence of money". Noting ample room for novel combinations of sociological and formal methods to drive insight into the many roles played by money in the economy, we conclude by indicating research directions in which we believe this combination can provide new answers to old questions in monetary theory</description>

      <title>How Large Language Models play humans in online conversations: a simulated study of the 2016 US politics on Reddit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as powerful tools for natural language generation, with applications spanning from content creation to social simulations. Their ability to mimic human interactions raises both opportunities and concerns, particularly in the context of politically relevant online discussions. In this study, we evaluate the performance of LLMs in replicating user-generated content within a real-world, divisive scenario: Reddit conversations during the 2016 US Presidential election. In particular, we conduct three different experiments, asking GPT-4 to generate comments by impersonating either real or artificial partisan users. We analyze the generated comments in terms of political alignment, sentiment, and linguistic features, comparing them against real user contributions and benchmarking against a null model. We find that GPT-4 is able to produce realistic comments, both in favor of or against the candidate supported by the community, yet tending to create consensus more easily than dissent. In addition we show that real and artificial comments are well separated in a semantically embedded space, although they are indistinguishable by manual inspection. Our findings provide insights on the potential use of LLMs to sneak into online discussions, influence political debate and shape political narratives, bearing broader implications of AI-driven discourse manipulation.</description>

      <title>Involvement drives complexity of language in online debates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Language is a fundamental aspect of human societies, continuously evolving in response to various stimuli, including societal changes and intercultural interactions. Technological advancements have profoundly transformed communication, with social media emerging as a pivotal force that merges entertainment-driven content with complex social dynamics. As these platforms reshape public discourse, analyzing the linguistic features of user-generated content is essential to understanding their broader societal impact. In this paper, we examine the linguistic complexity of content produced by influential users on Twitter across three globally significant and contested topics: COVID-19, COP26, and the Russia-Ukraine war. By combining multiple measures of textual complexity, we assess how language use varies along four key dimensions: account type, political leaning, content reliability, and sentiment. Our analysis reveals significant differences across all four axes, including variations in language complexity between individuals and organizations, between profiles with sided versus moderate political views, and between those associated with higher versus lower reliability scores. Additionally, profiles producing more negative and offensive content tend to use more complex language, with users sharing similar political stances and reliability levels converging toward a common jargon. Our findings offer new insights into the sociolinguistic dynamics of digital platforms and contribute to a deeper understanding of how language reflects ideological and social structures in online spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply the political stress index as introduced by Goldstone (1991) and implemented by Turchin (2013), to the case study of Poland. The approach quantifies political and social unrest as a single quantity based on a multitude of economic and demographic variables. The present-day data allow us to directly apply index without the need of simulating the elite component, as was done previously. Neither model version shows appreciable unrest levels for the present, while the simulated model applied to partial historical data yields the index in remarkable agreement with the fall of communism in Poland. We next analyze the model's sensitive dependence on its parameters (the hallmark of chaos), which limits its utility and application to other countries. The original equations cannot, by construction, describe the elite fraction for longer time-periods; and we propose a modification to remedy this problem. The model still holds some predictive power, but we argue that some components should be reinterpreted if one wants to keep its dynamical equations.</description>

      <title>Relationship between household attributes and contact patterns in urban and rural South Africa</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Households play a crucial role in the propagation of infectious diseases due to the frequent and prolonged interactions that typically occur between their members. Recent studies advocated for the importance of including socioeconomic variables in epidemic models to account for the heterogeneity induced by human behavior. While sub-Saharan Africa suffers the highest burden of infectious disease diffusion, limited efforts have been carried out to investigate the mixing patterns in the countries and their relation with social indicators. This work analyzes household contact matrices measured with wearable proximity sensors in a rural and an urban village in South Africa. Leveraging a rich data collection describing additional individual and household attributes, we investigate how the household contact matrix varies according to the household type (whether it is composed only of a familiar nucleus or by a larger group), the gender of its head (the primary decision-maker), the rural or urban context and the season in which it was measured. We show the household type and the gender of its head induce differences in the interaction patterns between household members, particularly regarding child caregiving. We argue the observed differences directly influence the basic reproductive number of an epidemic and should hence be accounted for the design of effective epidemic mitigation strategies.</description>

      <title>Photonuclear treatment for spent fuel radiotoxicity reduction: a case study investigation on minor actinides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The management of Spent Nuclear Fuel (SNF) is one of the main challenges in the decommissioning of nuclear power plants. Thermal reactors, such as Light Water Reactors (LWRs), produce significant amounts of minor actinides (MAs) such as Americium, Curium, and Neptunium, which are key contributors to the long-term radiotoxicity and decay heat in SNF. Currently, the long term widely accepted solution is the geological disposal. At the same time, advanced technologies like Partitioning and Transmutation (P\&amp;T) offer promising solutions to reduce SNF long-term radiotoxicity. While most transmutation strategies rely on neutron fluxes, in this study the adoption of photon beam to induce photonuclear reactions in SNF is investigated, without depending on neutron based systems. In particular, the study focuses on the probability of inducing transmutations and fissions on MAs, by leveraging the Giant Dipole Resonance (GDR) region of photonuclear interactions. In the investigated case study, the effect of a photon driven transmutation of minor actinides present in a spent fuel from SMR technology was evaluated. This approach offers a novel solution to the challenges of nuclear waste management which may become an alternative path in treating the radiotoxicity of minor actinides with the adoption of high enough photon fluxes.</description>
