      <title>The underwater Brachistochrone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The brachistochrone, the curve of fastest descent under gravity, is a cycloid when friction is absent. Underwater, however, buoyancy, viscous drag, and the added mass of entrained fluid fundamentally alter the problem. We formulate and solve the brachistochrone for a body moving through a dense fluid, incorporating all three effects together with a Reynolds-number-dependent drag coefficient. The classical cycloid becomes increasingly suboptimal as the body density approaches the fluid density, and below a critical density ratio it fails to reach the endpoint altogether. Near the critical Reynolds number for the drag crisis, the optimal trajectory is acutely sensitive to the density ratio and object size; constant-drag approximations can yield qualitatively incorrect paths. A decomposition of physical effects shows that neglecting drag and added mass together yields a predicted transit time roughly half the realised minimum, and that omitting added mass alone underestimates the transit time by approximately 20%. We extend the formulation to a three-point brachistochrone in which the trajectory must pass through an intermediate waypoint, revealing a finite reachable domain that is absent in the classical problem. The underwater brachistochrone as presented here provides a simple planning tool for short-range trajectories of buoyancy-driven underwater vehicles.</description>

      <title>Time-resolved X-ray radiography of through-thickness liquid transport in partly saturated needle-punched nonwovens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonwoven fibre networks underpin filtration, insulation and geotextiles, where liquid uptake, redistribution and release govern performance. In needle-punched felts, barbed needles mechanically entangle fibres and partially reorient them toward the thickness direction ($z$), creating out-of-plane "pillars" and heterogeneity. While mechanical and structural consequences of needling are well documented, dynamic $z$-direction transport in partly saturated networks remains difficult to access due to opacity and sub-second timescales. Here we combine micro-CT ($\mu$CT) of dry structure with time-resolved X-ray radiography during droplet addition to quantify through-thickness transport as a function of saturation and needling intensity, using a compact Washburn-type descriptor for dynamics. Results show an exponential dependence of $z$-directional liquid transport on saturation, consistent with previous models for in-plane relative permeability of nonwoven networks. Additionally, increased needle-punch intensity reorients fibres toward the $z$-direction, forming preferential flow pathways that enhance through-thickness transport, even as single-phase permeability decreases. These findings underscore needle-punch as a key design parameter for tuning liquid transport in nonwoven fibre networks. The approach provides an experimental and modelling framework for dynamic, capillarity-driven transport in opaque fibrous materials.</description>

      <title>Global phase-space geometry of three-dimensional gliding: terminal velocity manifolds, separatrices, and stability structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a three-dimensional dynamical-systems framework for passive gliding and identify the global phase-space structures that organize its motion. Extending previous two-dimensional models of non-equilibrium gliding, we show that the 3D velocity dynamics possess an attracting, normally hyperbolic invariant surface, the terminal velocity manifold (TVM), onto which all trajectories rapidly collapse before evolving slowly toward a glide equilibrium. There is also a separatrix surface associated with an invariant manifold of an unstable equilibrium within the TVM, which partitions initial conditions into qualitatively distinct descent behaviors: efficient shallow glides versus steep, drag-dominated descent. Using lift-drag data from three representative airfoils--a snake-inspired bluff body, the Zimmerman planform characteristic of Draco lizards, and the classical NACA 0012--we compute the full equilibrium surfaces, analyze their pitch-roll bifurcations, and reconstruct the TVM and separatrix geometry in three dimensions. The results reveal that (i) equilibrium stability changes with both pitch and roll, rather than pitch alone; (ii) separatrix geometry determines the dynamic accessibility of shallow glides; and (iii) bio-inspired airfoils possess compact separatrix regions that make efficient gliding robust across a wide range of initial jump conditions. This work unifies biological and engineered gliders within a single global geometric framework and establishes separatrix geometry on the TVM as a principled diagnostic for glide robustness.</description>

      <title>A Robust Truncated-Domain Approach for Cone--Jet Simulations in Electrospinning and Electrospraying</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct numerical simulations of electrospinning and electrospraying are computationally demanding due to large-scale separation between the needle and the tip-to-collector distance. The cone-jet mode that occurs in the vicinity of the needle arises from a delicate balance between surface tension, viscous stresses, inertia, and electric stresses. This mode has a central role in determining the subsequent instabilities of the jet and the eventual outcomes on the collector. Truncated-domain simulations offer a viable alternative but depend critically on the accuracy of far-field electrostatic boundary conditions. Existing truncated-domain approaches based on analytical expressions for the electric potential systematically underestimate the electric field near the needle tip and require empirical tuning informed by prior experiments or full-domain simulations, thereby limiting their predictive capability. Here, we present a general truncated-domain framework for electrohydrodynamic (EHD) simulations of the cone-jet mode that avoids these limitations. Our approach exploits inexpensive full-domain electrostatic simulations to obtain the exact electric field and potential distributions near the needle, which are then imposed as boundary conditions in an EHD simulation carried out on a truncated domain. Comparisons with full-domain EHD simulations and experimental data demonstrate that the proposed approach accurately reproduces cone-jet shapes as well as key physical quantities, including electric currents, charge distributions, velocity fields, and Maxwell stresses, while converging at substantially smaller domain sizes. The formulation eliminates tunable parameters, does not require prior knowledge of the cone-jet configuration, and significantly reduces computational cost, providing a reliable and predictive framework for studying electrohydrodynamic cone-jet flows.</description>

      <title>Fluids You Can Trust: Property-Preserving Operator Learning for Incompressible Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel property-preserving kernel-based operator learning method for incompressible flows governed by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Traditional numerical solvers incur significant computational costs to respect incompressibility. Operator learning offers efficient surrogate models, but current neural operators fail to exactly enforce physical properties such as incompressibility, periodicity, and turbulence. Our method maps input functions to expansion coefficients of output functions in a property-preserving kernel basis, ensuring that predicted velocity fields analytically and simultaneously preserve the aforementioned physical properties. We evaluate the method on challenging 2D and 3D, laminar and turbulent, incompressible flow problems. Our method achieves up to six orders of magnitude lower relative $\ell_2$ errors upon generalization and trains up to five orders of magnitude faster compared to neural operators. Moreover, while our method enforces incompressibility analytically, neural operators exhibit very large deviations. Our results show that our method provides an accurate and efficient surrogate for incompressible flows.</description>

      <title>Novel distance-based masking and adaptive alpha-shape methods for CNN-ready reconstruction of arbitrary 2D CFD flow domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interpolating scattered CFD datasets onto a uniform Cartesian grid can distort the true geometry, producing a convex-hull type envelope and activating nonphysical regions. This work presents a reconstruction framework that recovers physically consistent masks before exporting CNN-ready fields. It introduces two novel strategies, distance-based masking and an adaptive alpha-shape formulation that normalizes alpha using local data resolution, and evaluates them against classical alpha-shape boundary recovery. A quantitative, topology-aware metric suite is introduced to assess retention, suppression of unsupported regions, overlap consistency, and connectivity. The novel distance-based method is robust across the geometries considered under the same threshold rule, with tau set to the minimum CFD grid spacing, and achieves 500-800 times speedups over classical alpha-shapes. The adaptive alpha-shape remains stable when its control parameter is set to 1 and is 1.7-2.6 times faster than the classical variant, which requires geometry-specific alpha tuning. A lightweight boundary inflation post-process using a minimal dilation further improves retention by up to 2.96% with negligible unsupported activation (less than 0.08%). Overall, the distance-based method is recommended as the default due to its accuracy, stability, minimal tuning, and low cost, while the adaptive alpha-shape is a strong alternative when grid-spacing information for threshold selection is unavailable. A companion web application operationalizes the workflow end to end, enabling 2D ASCII dataset upload, parameter tuning, mask and boundary generation, and export of CNN-ready outputs.</description>

      <title>Uni-Flow: a unified autoregressive-diffusion model for complex multiscale flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal flows govern diverse phenomena across physics, biology, and engineering, yet modelling their multiscale dynamics remains a central challenge. Despite major advances in physics-informed machine learning, existing approaches struggle to simultaneously maintain long-term temporal evolution and resolve fine-scale structure across chaotic, turbulent, and physiological regimes. Here, we introduce Uni-Flow, a unified autoregressive-diffusion framework that explicitly separates temporal evolution from spatial refinement for modelling complex dynamical systems. The autoregressive component learns low-resolution latent dynamics that preserve large-scale structure and ensure stable long-horizon rollouts, while the diffusion component reconstructs high-resolution physical fields, recovering fine-scale features in a small number of denoising steps. We validate Uni-Flow across canonical benchmarks, including two-dimensional Kolmogorov flow, three-dimensional turbulent channel inflow generation with a quantum-informed autoregressive prior, and patient-specific simulations of aortic coarctation derived from high-fidelity lattice Boltzmann hemodynamic solvers. In the cardiovascular setting, Uni-Flow enables task-level faster than real-time inference of pulsatile hemodynamics, reconstructing high-resolution pressure fields over physiologically relevant time horizons in seconds rather than hours. By transforming high-fidelity hemodynamic simulation from an offline, HPC-bound process into a deployable surrogate, Uni-Flow establishes a pathway to faster-than-real-time modelling of complex multiscale flows, with broad implications for scientific machine learning in flow physics.</description>

      <title>Influence of the Inhalation Route on Tracheal Flow Structures in Patient-Specific Airways using 3D PTV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tracheal flow field shapes particle transport into the lower airways and thus influences both the spread of inhaled pathogens and the effectiveness of aerosol-based therapies. Identifying how different inhalation routes modify the flow field is therefore crucial for understanding lower-airway disease transmission and for guiding targeted drug delivery. To gain a detailed understanding of the influence of the inhalation route on the flow structures in the human trachea, the flow field in the trachea is investigated in vitro in a non-compliant, refractive-index matched silicone model of the human respiratory tract. The investigations comprise steady inhalation, and oscillatory flow to simulate calm breathing. A realistic breathing pattern is approximated by a sinusoidal waveform for two Reynolds numbers of $Re_{Tr} = [400, 1200]$, based on the bulk velocity at maximum volume flux and the hydraulic diameter of the trachea and two Womersley numbers of $Wo = [3, 4.5]$, representing the oscillation time scales. To capture the inherently three-dimensional and asymmetric nature of the flow field, 3D particle-tracking velocimetry measurements are performed using the Shake-The-Box algorithm. Using a refractive-index matched fluid consisting of water and glycerin, the complex flow structures inside the trachea are fully resolved. The PTV measurements confirm that the nasal and/or oral cavity must be considered when analyzing the flow field in the lower respiratory tract. In particular, we find that the presence of both cavities significantly alters the flow field compared to idealised, fully developed inflow conditions. However, velocity profiles in the sagittal and coronal plane in the trachea as well as contour plots of the of the normalized velocity magnitude evidence nearly identical flow structures for oral and nasal inhalation, indicating minimal influence of the inhalation route.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We adapt the microcanonical framework of equilibrium statistical mechanics to predict the statistics of short waves in inhomogeneous moving media. For steady inhomogeneities and background flow, we compute the wave spectrum at any location in the domain based on an ergodic prescription for the action density in phase space, constrained by conservation of absolute frequency. We illustrate the method for shallow-water waves subject to a background flow or to topographic inhomogeneities, and for deep-water surface capillary waves over a background flow, validating the predicted maps of rms surface elevation and interfacial slope against numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed data-driven inference of an interpretable equivariant LES model of incompressible fluid turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Restrictive phenomenological assumptions represent a major roadblock for the development of accurate subgrid-scale models of fluid turbulence. Specifically, these assumptions limit a model's ability to describe key quantities of interest, such as local fluxes of energy and enstrophy, in the presence of diverse coherent structures. This paper introduces a symbolic data-driven subgrid-scale model that requires no phenomenological assumptions and has no adjustable parameters, yet it outperforms leading LES models. A combination of a priori and a posteriori benchmarks shows that the model produces accurate predictions of various quantities including local fluxes across a broad range of two-dimensional turbulent flows. While the model is inferred using LES-style spatial coarse-graining, its structure is more similar to RANS models, as it employs an additional field to describe subgrid scales. We find that this field must have a rank-two tensor structure in order to correctly represent both the components of the subgrid-scale stress tensor and the various fluxes.</description>

      <title>Effect of flexibility on the pitch-heave flutter instability of a flexible foil elastically supported on its leading edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An analytical tool is presented to compute the parametric regions of flutter instabilities of a two-dimensional flexible foil elastically mounted. It is based on a new analytical formulation of the unsteady fluid-estructure interaction valid for small-amplitude oscillations and deformations of the foil immersed in an inviscid fluid. The formulation extends a previous analysis by including the effects of gravity and a second flexural mode, increasing its validity range to much smaller rigidities. The analytical results are validated with available numerical results, capturing the first two natural flexural modes down to values of the stiffness parameter $S$ of order $10^{-1}$. When only passive heave, or only passive pitch, is allowed, the rigid foil is stable, existing an upper stiffness bound for the flexural instabilities, wich become coupled with the spring instability mode for small spring constant increasing the growth rate. These coupled spring (linear or torsional) and flexural instability modes occur below a threshold value of $S$ and above a threshold value of $R$, both depending on the corresponding spring constant. Coupled pitch-heave flutter instabilities of a rigid foil occur in a region below a curve of the parametric plane of the two springs constants that depends on $R$, which shrinks to zero as $R$ decreases. For a flexible foil, the flexural unstable modes become coupled with the springs unstable mode as $S$ decreases from infinity, enlarging the mass ratio range for flutter instability and increasing its growth rate, the more so the smaller the springs constants. The parametric regions for flutter instabilities are easily characterized with the present analytical tool, providing the corresponding frequency and critical flutter velocity. The present results can be useful as a guide in the design of future turbines based on flexible oscillating foils.</description>

      <title>A Two-Sink Solution to the Self-Similar Euler Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct the first known example of a self-similar solution to the two-dimensional incompressible Euler equations whose pseudo-velocity has more than one stagnation point. The solution is also a homogeneous steady state of the Euler equations. In contrast, any homogeneous steady state with bounded vorticity necessarily admits only a single stagnation point at the origin. Our construction develops cusps in the velocity along two lines passing through the origin, thereby allowing stagnation points other than the origin.</description>

      <title>Deformation and orientation of a capsule with viscosity contrast in linear flows: a theoretical study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a perturbation theory to study the shape and the orientation of an initially spherical capsule of radius R with a viscosity contrast, a surface tension {\sigma} and a bending rigidity $\kappa$ in linear flows. The elastic mechanical response of membrane to deformations is described by three elastic constitutive law which are either Hookean, Neohookean or Skalak type leading to the introduction of a surface shear elastic modulus $G_s$ and the Poisson ratio (or analog quantities). At the leading order, the deformation, i.e. the so-called Taylor parameter is proportional to the elastic capillary number Ca which evaluates the ratio between the external viscous stress and the elastic membrane response. In this linear regime, the results do not depend on the elastic constitutive law as expected. Without surface tension and bending rigidity, we recover the results of Barthes-Biesel &amp; Rallison (1981) and notably the fact that the Taylor parameter does not depend on the viscosity contrast $\lambda$ contrary to the case of a viscous droplet. In our more general model, the deformation does no longer depend on $\lambda$ at the upper order. Now, the Taylor parameter also depends on two other dimensionless numbers: the surface elastocapillary ratio $\sigma/G_s$ and the dimensionless bending rigidity $B= \kappa/G_sR^2$. At the further order, the angle of inclination of the capsule with the direction of the shear flow, the analog of the Chaffey and Brenner equation for droplets is determined in each case. The results are in excellent agreement with the numerical ones performed with a code based on the boundary integral method providing an useful method to valid numerical developments.</description>

By means of improved Nash inequalities, we establish quantitative estimates for the enstrophy depending on the absolute vorticity decay on balls. The bounds are optimal in several aspects and yield to a conjecturally sharp rate of the dissipation in the Delort's class.</description>

      <title>Multi-stream physics hybrid networks for solving Navier-Stokes equations</title>

Abstract: Understanding and solving fluid dynamics equations efficiently remains a fundamental challenge in computational physics. Traditional numerical solvers and physics-informed neural networks struggle to capture the full range of frequency components in partial differential equation solutions, limiting their accuracy and efficiency. Here, we propose the Multi-stream Physics Hybrid Network, a novel neural architecture that integrates quantum and classical layers in parallel to improve the accuracy of solving fluid dynamics equations, namely ''Kovasznay flow'' problem. This approach decomposes the solution into separate frequency components, each predicted by independent Parallel Hybrid Networks, simplifying the training process and enhancing performance. We evaluated the proposed model against a comparable classical neural network, the Multi-stream Physics Classical Network, in both data-driven and physics-driven scenarios. Our results show that the Multi-stream Physics Hybrid Network achieves a reduction in root mean square error by 36% for velocity components and 41% for pressure prediction compared to the classical model, while using 24% fewer trainable parameters. These findings highlight the potential of hybrid quantum-classical architectures for advancing computational fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>Low-dimensional multiscale dynamics of intermittent reversals in turbulent Rayleigh-Benard convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate whether a strongly turbulent flow with intermittent large-scale reorganizations admits a compact state-space description. As a representative high-dimensional chaotic system we consider two-dimensional Rayleigh--B\'enard convection at high Rayleigh number, whose dynamics are governed by multiscale interactions and rare reversals of the large-scale circulation. We introduce a multiscale latent dynamical framework in which the temporal evolution is first decomposed into slow and fast components and each is mapped to a nonlinear low-dimensional representation that is evolved by a closed dynamical system, showing that temporal scale separation alone enables an autonomous low-dimensional description of the chaotic dynamics. This strategy reduces the system from an original state space dimension of $O(10^5)$ to a compact 20-dimensional latent space while preserving the essential multiscale dynamics. Our model reproduces the main trends of instantaneous flow structures, Reynolds stresses, energy autocorrelations, and long-time quantities such as angular momentum and wall observables, Furthermore, a waiting time analysis of flow reversals validates the statistical alignment of model prediction and DNS results. The explicit modeling of separate slow and fast branches yields significantly improved accuracy in both short-time flow structures and long-time reversal statistics, compared to single-branch alternatives. These results provide evidence that intermittent turbulent dynamics can evolve on a compact manifold when their intrinsic multiscale structure is respected, offering a route toward reduced dynamical descriptions and prediction of rare events in high-dimensional chaos.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00779v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This letter presents a kinetic closure of the filtered Boltzmann-BGK equation, paving the way toward an alternative description of turbulence. The closure naturally incorporates the turbulent subfilter stress tensor without the need for explicit modeling, unlike in classical filtered Navier-Stokes closures. In contrast, it accounts for the subfilter turbulent diffusion in the nonconserved moments by generalizing the BGK collision operator. The model requires neither scale separation between resolved and unresolved scales nor a Smagorinsky-type ansatz for the subfilter stress tensor structure. The Chapman-Enskog analysis shows how its hydrodynamic limit can converge to the filtered Navier-Stokes equations, with velocity gradients isolating subfilter contributions. Validations through lattice Boltzmann simulations of the Taylor-Green vortex and the turbulent mixing layer demonstrate improved stability and reduced dissipation, benchmarked against the Smagorinsky model.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Extended Lubrication Theories for Stokes Flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02595v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lubrication theory makes use of the assumptions of a long and thin fluid domain and a small scaled Reynolds number to formulate a linearized approximation to the Navier-Stokes equations. Extended lubrication theory aims to improve the model accuracy by relaxing these assumptions and including additional terms in the formulation. However, such models are sensitive to large surface gradients which lead the assumptions of the model to break down. In this paper, we present a formulation of extended lubrication theory, and compare our model with several existing models, along with the numerical solution to the Stokes equations. The error in pressure and velocity is characterized for a variety of fluid domain geometries. Our results indicate that the new solution is suitable for a wide range of geometries. The magnitude of surface variation and the length scale ratio are both important factors influencing the accuracy of the extended lubrication theory models.</description>

      <title>Objective detection of coherent vortices from instantaneous flow data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vortices are swirling regions of fluid that structure motion in gases and liquids across a wide range of scales, from laboratory-scale experiments to vast atmospheric currents. They play a key role in mixing, transport, and energy transfer, yet their reliable identification in unsteady flows remained a major challenge. Most existing approaches rely on local, instantaneous properties of the velocity gradient, such as strain or rotation. Although effective in simple or steady flows, these criteria can fail in complex, time-dependent settings, falsely detecting vortices or overlooking coherent structures altogether. Lagrangian methods instead identify vortices as regions of material coherence by tracking fluid trajectories over time. While conceptually sound, these approaches are computationally intensive, require high-quality data, and are impractical for real-time applications. This motivates a central challenge: whether coherent vortices, inherently defined over finite times, can be detected objectively from instantaneous flow measurements. Here we introduce the first Eulerian criterion to overcome these challenges. By examining the temporal evolution of strain and removing from the velocity field the components attributable to rigid-body motion, we construct an objective velocity field that isolates genuine swirling dynamics. The resulting $Q_\text{s}$-criterion consistently identifies coherent vortices in both analytical examples and complex flow data, including cases where traditional methods fail. Our framework provides an observer-independent, computationally efficient tool for vortex detection from instantaneous data, enabling improved analysis and prediction of fluid flows across scales.</description>

      <title>Reduced-Order Hydrodynamic Modelling of a Sphere Near a Wall Using Sparse Regression and Neural Operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents an interpretable parametric surrogate model motivated by the need to identify a hydrodynamic model for resolving the trajectory of an object in real-time. The surrogate is formulated as a reduced-order model for a canonical configuration in which a one-degree-of-freedom heaving sphere operates near a vertical wall. High-fidelity CFD simulations are used to generate a parametric dataset of heave-decay responses over varying wall distances (WD) and drop heights (DH). Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) is then applied to each CFD trajectory to identify a low-order nonlinear ordinary differential equation (ODE) with polynomial terms representing effective hydrostatic restoring and radiation damping, and the harmonic terms representing the wave-induced excitation forces. The SINDy identified coefficients are then used as a prior constraint in a neural operator network (ONet) that learns a smooth mapping from wall distance and drop height to the ODE coefficients, yielding a surrogate capable of predicting dynamics at arbitrary points in the input space without rerunning expensive CFD calculations. The resulting surrogate reproduces CFD heave-decay responses with near-optimal accuracy given the limiting assumptions while being capable of running in real time. The approach provides a practical pathway toward real-time, physics-informed surrogate modelling for launch-and-recovery operations.</description>

      <title>The Unsteady Taylor--Vortex Dynamo is Fast</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.13500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Astrophysical and geophysical fluids commonly generate organized magnetic fields, despite having enormous magnetic Reynolds numbers $\rm{Rm}$ and abundant small-scale turbulence. Flow-induced dynamo action produces these fields, with the ``kinematic dynamo problem'' devoted to determining the rate at which a flow exponentially amplifies weak magnetic fields. However, previous studies on high-Rm kinematic dynamos have generated flows via imposed volumetric forcing or oscillatory boundary conditions. In this letter, we investigate a system with three important attributes: realistic flow conditions, fast dynamo action (operational for $\rm{Rm}\to\infty$), and a subharmonic spatio-temporal structure. We show that unsteady Taylor--vortex flow, a regime observed in laboratory experiments, gives rise to fast dynamos with time and length scales twice those of the flow at high $\rm{Rm}$. By numerically integrating a Floquet system driven by periodic oscillations of Taylor vortices, we solve the kinematic dynamo problem up to $\rm{Rm} = 3.2 \cdot 10^6$, calculating the dynamo's growth rate as a function of Rm and streamwise wavenumber. We find the onset of instability and compute Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponents, which identify the regions of Lagrangian chaos required for fast dynamo action. To our knowledge, unsteady Taylor--vortex flow produces the most physically motivated fast dynamo to date.</description>

      <title>Recursive regularised lattice Boltzmann method for magnetohydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present and test a recursive regularised lattice Boltzmann method for incompressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flows. The approach is based on a double-distribution formulation, in which the magnetic field is evolved using a standard BGK lattice Boltzmann scheme, while the fluid solver is enhanced through a Hermite-based recursive regularisation of the non-equilibrium moments. The method exploits a fourth-order Hermite expansion of the equilibrium distribution on the D2Q9 lattice, allowing higher-order isotropy to be retained while selectively filtering spurious non-hydrodynamic contributions. The regularisation procedure reconstructs the non-equilibrium distribution from physically consistent Hermite coefficients, avoiding explicit evaluation of velocity gradients. The resulting scheme preserves the correct incompressible MHD limit, improves numerical stability at low viscosities, and reduces lattice-dependent artefacts. The proposed formulation provides a robust and versatile framework for MHD simulations and offers a systematic route for extending regularised lattice Boltzmann methods to coupled multiphysics systems.</description>

      <title>Adjoint-based shape optimization of a ship hull using a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) assisted propulsion surrogate model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adjoint-based shape optimization of ship hulls is a powerful tool for addressing high-dimensional design problems in naval architecture, particularly in minimizing the ship resistance. However, its application to vessels that employ complex propulsion systems introduces significant challenges. They arise from the need for transient simulations extending over long periods of time with small time steps and from the reverse temporal propagation of the primal and adjoint solutions. These challenges place considerable demands on the required storage and computing power, which significantly hamper the use of adjoint methods in the industry. To address this issue, we propose a machine learning-assisted optimization framework that employs a Conditional Variational Autoencoder-based surrogate model of the propulsion system. The surrogate model replicates the time-averaged flow field induced by a Voith Schneider Propeller and replaces the geometrically and time-resolved propeller with a data-driven approximation. Primal flow verification examples demonstrate that the surrogate model achieves significant computational savings while maintaining the necessary accuracy of the resolved propeller. Optimization studies show that ignoring the propulsion system can yield designs that perform worse than the initial shape. In contrast, the proposed method produces shapes that achieve more than an 8\% reduction in resistance.</description>

      <title>Fast Solver for the Reynolds Equation on Piecewise Linear Geometries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20841v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Reynolds equation is derived from the incompressible Navier Stokes equations under the lubrication assumptions of a long and thin domain geometry and a small scaled Reynolds number. The Reynolds equation is an elliptic differential equation and a dramatic simplification from the governing equations. When the fluid domain is piecewise linear, the Reynolds equation has an exact solution that we formulate by coupling the exact solutions of each piecewise component. We consider a formulation specifically for piecewise constant heights, and a more general formulation for piecewise linear heights; in both cases the linear system is inverted using the Schur complement. These methods can also be applied in the case of non-linear heights by approximating the height as piecewise constant or piecewise linear, in which case the methods achieve second order accuracy. We assess the time complexity of the two methods, and determine that the method for piecewise linear heights is linear time for the number of piecewise components. As an application of these methods, we explore the limits of validity for lubrication theory by comparing the solutions of the Reynolds and the Stokes equations for a variety of linear and non-linear textured slider geometries.</description>
