      <title>Collective excitation spectra of dipolar bosonic fractional quantum Hall states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the collective excitation of spin-conserving and spin-reversed configuration of rotating diluted ultra-cold dipolar Bose gas. Rotating trapped Bose gas produces a fictitious magnetic field perpendicular to the trapping harmonic potential, which exhibits strongly correlated fractional quantum Hall states. We consider the long-range dipole-dipole interaction and compute the low lying excitations spectrum for the three fractions of the first Jain series $\nu = 1/2, 1/4, 1/6$. We find that for both the spin-conserving and spin-reversed excitation the gap between the fundamental mode and the higher excitation mode increases upon increase in the filling fraction. The fundamental modes and the next higher-energy mode of excitation spectra for each of the three fractions show the presence of double roton for spin-conserving configuration only. Finally we complement our observation by calculating the spectral weight for the fundamental mode of excitation spectra which show the momenta at which the spectral weight exhibits the maxima shifts towards the lower momenta for both the excitations. Our observation for the spectral weight could be related with the inelastic Raman scattering which may be useful for the future experimental study to detect the excitation in ultracold system.</description>

      <title>Entanglement suppression and quantum scars in a three-oscillator gravitational analogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study quantum correlations in a tripartite system of coupled harmonic oscillators, modeling mediator-induced interactions akin to those in quantum gravity proposals. Surprisingly, despite the system's integrability, we identify regimes where bipartite entanglement between distant oscillators vanishes even with non-zero quantum couplings. In the Heavy Mediator Regime, entanglement is restricted to sharply localized islands in parameter space, surrounded by extended regions of suppression, analogous to quantum scars in non-integrable systems. Fidelity analysis reveal that these low-entanglement states exhibit dynamical stability and spectral signatures reminiscent of quantum scars in non-integrable systems, suggesting a continuous-variable analogue of scarring tied to hidden phase-space symmetries. The Light Mediator Regime, by contrast, displays smooth entanglement generation. These results challenge entanglement-based tests of quantum gravity: the absence of entanglement need not imply classical mediation but may instead reflect a mediator dynamically constrained to a quantum subspace-akin to gravitational memory or decoherence-free subspaces. Our findings emphasize the necessity of probing the mediator's dynamical regime to unambiguously diagnose quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Geometric Bloch oscillations and transverse displacement in flat band systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate transport phenomena and dynamical effects in flat bands where the band dispersion plays no role. We show that wavepackets in geometrically non-trivial flat bands can display dynamics when inhomogeneous electric fields are present. This dynamics is revealed both for the wavepacket trajectory and for its variance, for which we derive semiclassical equations extended to the non-Abelian case. Our findings are tested in flat band models in one- and two-dimensional lattices where the dynamics is solely determined by geometric effects, in the absence of band dispersion. In particular, in the one-dimensional case, we show the existence of Bloch oscillations for the wavepacket position and for the wavepacket variance, whereas in the two-dimensional case we observe a transverse displacement of the wavepacket in the absence of Berry curvature. This work paves the way for understanding quantum-geometry-induced dynamical effects in flat band materials and also opens the possibility for their observation with synthetic matter platforms.</description>

      <title>Precision Measurement of Lifetime and Branching Ratios of the $4f^{13}5d6s\,^1[5/2]_{5/2}$ state in Yb$^+$ ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report spectroscopic and time-resolved experimental observations to characterize the $[{\rm Xe}]4f^{13}(^2F^{o}_{5/2}){5d6s(}{^1\!D}){^{1}[5/2]^{o}_{5/2}}$ state in $^{172}$Yb$^+$ ions. We access this state from the metastable $4f^{14}5d (^2D_{3/2,5/2})$ manifold and observe an unexpectedly long lifetime of $\tau=37.9(9) \,\mu$s that allows visible Rabi oscillations and resolved-sideband spectroscopy. Using a combination of coherent population dynamics, high-fidelity detection and heralded state preparation, and optical pumping methods, we measure the branching ratios to the $^{2}D_{3/2}$, $^2D_{5/2}$, $^2S_{1/2}$ states to be 0.359(2), 0.639(2), 0.0023(16), respectively. The branching ratio to the $4f^{13}6s^{2}({^2F}_{7/2})$ is compatible with zero within our experimental resolution. We also report measurements of its Land\'e g-factor and the branching ratio of the ${^{2}{D}_{5/2}}$ to ${^{2}{S}_{1/2}}$ decay in $^{172}$Yb$^+$ to be 0.188(3), improving its relative uncertainty by an order of magnitude. Our measurements pave the way to a better understanding of the atomic structure of Yb$^+$ ions, which still lacks accurate numerical descriptions, and the use of high-lying excited states for partial detection and qubit manipulation in the omg architecture.</description>

      <title>Hybrid between biologically inspired and quantum inspired many-body states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks can represent very different sorts of functions, including complex quantum many-body states. Tensor networks can also represent these states, have more structure and are easier to optimize. However, they can be prohibitively costly computationally in two or higher dimensions. Here, we propose a generalization of the perceptron - the perceptrain - which borrows features from the two different formalisms. We construct variational many-body ansatz from a simple network of perceptrains. The network can be thought of as a neural network with a few distinct features inherited from tensor networks. These include efficient local optimization akin to the density matrix renormalization algorithm, instead of optimizing of all the parameters at once; the possibility to dynamically increase the number of parameters during the optimization; the possibility to compress the state to avoid overfitting; and a structure that remains quantum-inspired. We showcase the ansatz using a combination of Variational Monte-Carlo (VMC) and Green Function Monte-Carlo (GFMC) on a $10\times 10$ transverse field quantum Ising model with a long range $1/r^6$ antiferromagnetic interaction. The model corresponds to the Rydberg (cold) atoms platform proposed for quantum annealing. We consistently find a very high relative accuracy for the ground state energy, around $10^{-5}$ for VMC and $10^{-6}$ for GFMC in all regimes of parameters, including in the vicinity of the quantum phase transition. We used very small ranks ($\sim 2-5$) of perceptrains, as opposed to multiples of thousand used in matrix product states. The optimization of the energy was robust with respect to the choice of initial conditions and hyper-parameters, in contrast to a common experience when using neural network wave functions.</description>

      <title>Light-Assisted Collisions in Tweezer-Trapped Lanthanides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a quantitative investigation of one- and two-body light-mediated processes that occur to few erbium atoms in an optical tweezer, when exposed to near-resonant light. In order to study the intertwined effects of recoil heating, cooling and light-assisted collisions, we develop a first-principles Monte Carlo algorithm that solves the coupled dynamics of both the internal and external degrees of freedom of the atoms. After validating our theoretical model against experimental data, we use the predictive power of our code to guide our experiment and, in particular, we explore the performance of different transitions of erbium for light-assisted collisions in terms of their efficiency and fidelity for single-atom preparation.</description>

      <title>Precision Minimally-destructive detection of ultra-cold atomic ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the last two decades the cold-atom physics has matured from proof-of-principle demonstrations to a versatile platform for precision measurements and study of quantum phenomena. Ultra-cold atomic ensembles have been used both for technological and fundamental science applications. To fully exploit their potential, a precise measurement and control of the atom number in the ensemble is crucial. We report on a precise, minimally-destructive measurement technique that can be used to prepare an atomic ensemble with a desired atom number. The measurement relies on the dispersive light-atom interaction, thus it is expected to have a negligible effect on the ensemble temperature and to induce minimal decoherence in the atomic quantum state. As a result, it can be used to perform quantum-enhanced measurements and prepare the atom-number state at the start of an interferometer sequence.</description>

      <title>Fast real-time arbitrary waveform generation using graphic processing units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-time arbitrary waveform generation (AWG) is essential in various engineering and research applications. This paper introduces a novel AWG architecture using an NVIDIA graphics processing unit (GPU) and a commercially available high-speed digital-to-analog converter (DAC) card, both running on a desktop personal computer (PC). The GPU accelerates the "embarrassingly" data-parallel additive synthesis framework for AWG, and the DAC reconstructs the generated waveform in the analog domain at high speed. The AWG software is developed using the developer-friendly compute unified device architecture (CUDA) runtime application programming interface (API) from NVIDIA. With this architecture, we achieve a 586-fold increase in the speed of computing periodic radio-frequency (rf) arbitrary waveforms compared to a central processing unit (CPU). We also demonstrate two different pathways for dynamically controlling multi-tone rf waveforms, which we characterize by chirping individual single-frequency tones in the multi-tone waveforms. One pathway offers arbitrary simultaneous chirping of 1000 individual Nyquist-limited single-frequency tones at a sampling rate of 280 megasamples per second (MS/s) for a limited time duration of 35 ms. The other pathway offers simultaneous chirping of 340 individual Nyquist-limited single-frequency tones at 50 MS/s, or 55 individual tones at 280 MS/s for an arbitrary duration. Using the latter pathway, we demonstrate control over 5000-tone and 10,000-tone waveforms by chirping all of their constituent tones in groups of up to 100 tones. This AWG architecture is designed for creating large defect-free optical tweezer arrays of single neutral atoms or molecules for quantum simulation and quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Acceleration-induced transport of quantum vortices in joined atomtronic circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Persistent currents--inviscid quantized flow around an atomic circuit--are a crucial building block of atomtronic devices. We investigate how acceleration influences the transfer of persistent currents between two density-connected, ring-shaped atomic Bose-Einstein condensates, joined by a tunable weak link that controls system topology. We find that the acceleration of this system modifies both the density and phase dynamics between the rings, leading to a bias in the periodic vortex oscillations studied in T. Bland et al., Phys. Rev. Research 4, 043171 (2022). Accounting for dissipation suppressing such vortex oscillations, the acceleration facilitates a unilateral vortex transfer to the leading ring. We analyze how this transfer depends on the weak-link amplitude, the initial persistent current configuration, and the acceleration strength and direction. Characterization of the sensitivity to these parameters paves the way for a new platform for acceleration measurements, for which we outline a proof-of-concept ultracold double-ring accelerometer.</description>
