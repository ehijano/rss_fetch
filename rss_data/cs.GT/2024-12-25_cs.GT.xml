      <title>Steganography and Probabilistic Risk Analysis: A Game Theoretical Framework for Quantifying Adversary Advantage and Impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In high-risk environments where unlawful surveillance is prevalent, securing confidential communications is critical. This study introduces a novel steganographic game-theoretic model to analyze the strategic interactions between a defending company and an adversary. By framing the scenario as a non-cooperative game, there is systematic evaluation of optimal strategies for both parties, incorporating costs and benefits such as implementation expenses, potential data leaks, and operational advantages. The derived equilibrium probabilities enable the assessment of success rates, illustrating conditions under which the company benefits from hiding messages or faces increased risks when not implementing steganography. Sensitivity analysis explores how changes in key parameters impact these strategies, enhancing the understanding of decision-making in secure communications. Furthermore, the introduction of an adversary model that quantifies the adversary's advantage using conditional probabilities derived from success rates allows for a quantitative measure of the adversary's effectiveness based on the defender's strategies. By integrating the adversary's advantage into a novel risk analysis framework and employing Monte Carlo simulations, dynamic interactions are captured across advantage scenarios, considering factors like impact factor, steganography effectiveness, and equilibrium probabilities. This comprehensive framework offers practical insights into optimizing security strategies by quantifying potential risk reductions when the adversary is disadvantaged, providing a clear methodology for assessing and mitigating adversarial threats in complex security environments.</description>

      <title>From Competition to Centralization: The Oligopoly in Ethereum Block Building Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ethereum block production process has evolved with the introduction of an auction-based mechanism known as Proposer-Builder Separation (PBS), allowing validators to outsource block production to builders and reap Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) revenue from builder bids in a decentralized market. In this market, builders compete in MEV-Boost auctions to have their blocks selected and earn potential MEV rewards. This paper employs empirical game-theoretic analysis to explore builders' strategic bidding incentives in MEV-Boost auctions, focusing on how advantages in network latency and access to MEV opportunities affect builders' bidding behaviors and auction outcomes. Our findings confirm an oligopolistic dynamic, where a few dominant builders, leveraging their advantages in latency and MEV access, benefit from an economy of scale that reinforces their market power, leading to increased centralization and reduced auction efficiency. Our analysis highlights the importance of fair MEV distribution among builders and the ongoing challenge of enhancing decentralization in the Ethereum block building market.</description>

      <title>An Instrumental Value for Data Production and its Application to Data Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How much value does a dataset or a data production process have to an agent who wishes to use the data to assist decision-making? This is a fundamental question towards understanding the value of data as well as further pricing of data. This paper develops an approach for capturing the instrumental value of data production processes, which takes two key factors into account: (a) the context of the agent's decision-making problem; (b) prior data or information the agent already possesses. We ''micro-found'' our valuation concepts by showing how they connect to classic notions of information design and signals in information economics. When instantiated in the domain of Bayesian linear regression, our value naturally corresponds to information gain. Based on our designed data value, we then study a basic monopoly pricing setting with a buyer looking to purchase from a seller some labeled data of a certain feature direction in order to improve a Bayesian regression model. We show that when the seller has the ability to fully customize any data request, she can extract the first-best revenue (i.e., full surplus) from any population of buyers, i.e., achieving first-degree price discrimination. If the seller can only sell data that are derived from an existing data pool, this limits her ability to customize, and achieving first-best revenue becomes generally impossible. However, we design a mechanism that achieves seller revenue at most $\log (\kappa)$ less than the first-best revenue, where $\kappa$ is the condition number associated with the data matrix. A corollary of this result is that the seller can extract the first-best revenue in the multi-armed bandits special case.</description>

      <title>Learning to Play Against Unknown Opponents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of a learning agent who has to repeatedly play a general sum game against a strategic opponent who acts to maximize their own payoff by optimally responding against the learner's algorithm. The learning agent knows their own payoff function, but is uncertain about the payoff of their opponent (knowing only that it is drawn from some distribution $\mathcal{D}$). What learning algorithm should the agent run in order to maximize their own total utility?
  We demonstrate how to construct an $\varepsilon$-optimal learning algorithm (obtaining average utility within $\varepsilon$ of the optimal utility) for this problem in time polynomial in the size of the input and $1/\varepsilon$ when either the size of the game or the support of $\mathcal{D}$ is constant. When the learning algorithm is further constrained to be a no-regret algorithm, we demonstrate how to efficiently construct an optimal learning algorithm (asymptotically achieving the optimal utility) in polynomial time, independent of any other assumptions. Both results make use of recently developed machinery that converts the analysis of learning algorithms to the study of the class of corresponding geometric objects known as menus.</description>

      <title>Maximal number of mixed Nash equilibria in generic games where each player has two pure strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The number of Nash equilibria of the mixed extension of a generic finite game in normal form is finite and odd. This raises the question how large the number can be, depending on the number of players and the numbers of their pure strategies. Here we present a lower bound for the maximal possible number in the case of m-player games where each player has two pure strategies. It is surprisingly close to a known upper bound.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Intelligence in GameFi: Embodied AI Agents and the Convergence of DeFi and Virtual Ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of GameFi, a fusion of gaming and decentralized finance (DeFi), there exists a critical need to enhance player engagement and economic interaction within gaming ecosystems. Our GameFi ecosystem aims to fundamentally transform this landscape by integrating advanced embodied AI agents into GameFi platforms. These AI agents, developed using cutting-edge large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and Claude AI, are capable of proactive, adaptive, and contextually rich interactions with players. By going beyond traditional scripted responses, these agents become integral participants in the game's narrative and economic systems, directly influencing player strategies and in-game economies. We address the limitations of current GameFi platforms, which often lack immersive AI interactions and mechanisms for community engagement or creator monetization. Through the deep integration of AI agents with blockchain technology, we establish a consensus-driven, decentralized GameFi ecosystem. This ecosystem empowers creators to monetize their contributions and fosters democratic collaboration among players and creators. Furthermore, by embedding DeFi mechanisms into the gaming experience, we enhance economic participation and provide new opportunities for financial interactions within the game. Our approach enhances player immersion and retention and advances the GameFi ecosystem by bridging traditional gaming with Web3 technologies. By integrating sophisticated AI and DeFi elements, we contribute to the development of more engaging, economically robust, and community-centric gaming environments. This project represents a significant advancement in the state-of-the-art in GameFi, offering insights and methodologies that can be applied throughout the gaming industry.</description>

      <title>Equitable Core Imputations via a New Adaptation of The Primal-Dual Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11437v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classic paper of Shapley and Shubik \cite{Shapley1971assignment} characterized the core of the assignment game. We observe that a sub-coalition consisting of one player (or a set of players from the same side of the bipartition) can make zero profit, and therefore its profit under a core imputation can be an arbitrary amount. Hence an arbitrary core imputation makes {\em no fairness guarantee at the level of individual agents}. Can this deficiency be addressed by picking a ``good'' core imputation?
  To arrive at an appropriate solution concept, we give specific criteria for picking a special core imputation, and we undertake a detailed comparison of four solution concepts. Leximin and leximax core imputations come out as clear winners; we define these to be {\em equitable core imputations}. These imputations achieve ``fairness'' in different ways: whereas leximin tries to make poor agents more rich, leximax tries to make rich agents less rich.
  We give combinatorial strongly polynomial algorithms for computing these imputations via a novel adaptation of the classical primal-dual paradigm. The ``engine'' driving them involves insights into core imputations obtained via complementarity. It will not be surprising if our work leads to new uses of this powerful technique. Furthermore, we expect more work on computing the leximin and leximax core imputations of other natural games, in addition to the recent follow-up work \cite{Leximin-max}.</description>

      <title>Online Learning from Strategic Human Feedback in LLM Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16834v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has become an essential step in fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) to align them with human preferences. However, human labelers are selfish and have diverse preferences. They may strategically misreport their online feedback to influence the system's aggregation towards their own preferences. Current practice simply averages labelers' feedback per time and fails to identify the most accurate human labeler, leading to linear regret $\mathcal{O}(T)$ for $T$ time slots. To our best knowledge, we are the first to study online learning mechanisms against strategic human labelers in the LLM fine-tuning process. We formulate a new dynamic Bayesian game and dynamically adjust human labelers' weights in the preference aggregation, ensuring their truthful feedback and sublinear regret $\mathcal{O}(T^{1/2})$. Simulation results demonstrate our mechanism's great advantages over the existing benchmark schemes.</description>
