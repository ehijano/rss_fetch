      <title>Don't be Afraid of Cell Complexes! An Introduction from an Applied Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cell complexes (CCs) are a higher-order network model deeply rooted in algebraic topology that has gained interest in signal processing and network science recently. However, while the processing of signals supported on CCs can be described in terms of easily-accessible algebraic or combinatorial notions, the commonly presented definition of CCs is grounded in abstract concepts from topology and remains disconnected from the signal processing methods developed for CCs. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by providing a simplified definition of CCs that is accessible to a wider audience and can be used in practical applications. Specifically, we first introduce a simplified notion of abstract regular cell complexes (ARCCs). These ARCCs only rely on notions from algebra and can be shown to be equivalent to regular cell complexes for most practical applications. Second, using this new definition we provide an accessible introduction to (abstract) cell complexes from a perspective of network science and signal processing. Furthermore, as many practical applications work with CCs of dimension 2 and below, we provide an even simpler definition for this case that significantly simplifies understanding and working with CCs in practice.</description>

      <title>The persistent Laplacian of non-branching complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-branching matrices are real matrices with entries in $\{-1,0,1\}$, where each row contains at most two non-zero entries. Such matrices naturally arise in the study of Laplacians of pseudomanifolds and cubical complexes. We show that a basis for the kernel of a non-branching matrix can be computed in near-linear time. Especially, the basis has the special property that the supports of all the column vectors in it are disjoint with each other. Building on this result, we show that the up persistent Laplacian can be computed in near-linear time for a pair of such spaces and its eigenvalues can be more efficiently computed via computing singular values. In addition to that, we analyze the arithmetic operations of up persistent Laplacian with respect to a non-branching filtration. Furthermore, we show that the up persistent Laplacian of $q$-non-branching simplicial complexes can be represented as the Laplacian of an associated hypergraph, thus providing a higher-dimensional generalization of the Kron reduction, as well as a Cheeger-type inequality. Finally, we highlight the efficiency of our method on image data.</description>

      <title>A universal characterization of the curved homotopy Lie and associative operads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the category of nonsymmetric dg operads valued in strict graded-mixed complexes, equipped with a distinguished arity zero weight one element which generates the weight grading, and whose differential has weight one. We show that the initial object is the curved A-infinity operad, that the forgetful functor to the category of operads under it admits a right adjoint, and that the unit of the adjunction encodes the operation of twisting a curved A-infinity algebra by a Maurer-Cartan element.
  The corresponding notions for symmetric operads characterize the curved L-infinity operad and the corresponding twisting procedure.</description>

      <title>Poincar\'e duality for loop spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.13161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.13161v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that Rabinowitz Floer homology and cohomology carry the structure of a graded Frobenius algebra for both closed and open strings. We prove a Poincar\'e duality theorem between homology and cohomology that preserves this structure. This lifts to a duality theorem between graded open-closed TQFTs. We use in a systematic way the formalism of Tate vector spaces.
  Specializing to the case of cotangent bundles, we define Rabinowitz loop homology and cohomology and explain from a unified perspective pairs of dual results that have been observed over the years in the context of the search for closed geodesics. These concern critical levels, relations to the based loop space, manifolds all of whose geodesics are closed, Bott index iteration, and level-potency. Moreover, the graded Frobenius algebra structure gives meaning and proof to a relation conjectured by Sullivan between the loop product and coproduct.</description>

      <title>The path-missing and path-free complexes of a directed graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.07894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.07894v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study two simplicial complexes arising from a directed graph $G = (V, E)$ with two chosen vertices $s$ and $t$: the *path-free complex*, consisting of all subsets $F \subseteq E$ that contain no path from $s$ to $t$, and the *path-missing complex*, its Alexander dual. Using discrete Morse theory, we prove that both complexes have well-behaved homotopy types -- either contractible or homotopy-equivalent to spheres.</description>

      <title>On the unramified Eisenstein spectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.03486v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a split reductive group ${}^L G$ over a global field, we determine the spectrum of the spherical Hecke algebra coming from the unramified Eisenstein series for the minimal parabolic ${}^L B$. This is done using a certain decomposition of the Springer stack $T^*(B \backslash G/ B)$ for the Langlands dual group in the additive group of cobordisms of cohomologically proper derived quotient stacks.</description>

      <title>Derived Lie $\infty$-groupoids and algebroids in higher differential geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.05856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study various problems arising in higher differential geometry using {\it derived Lie $\infty$-groupoids and algebroids}.We first study Lie $\infty$-groupoids in various categories of derived geometric objects in differential geometry, including derived manifolds, derived analytic spaces, derived noncommutative spaces, and derived Banach manifolds. We construct category of fibrant objects (CFO) structures in the category of derived Lie $\infty$-groupoids. Then we study $L_{\infty}$-algebroids which are the infinitesimal counterpart of derived Lie $\infty$-groupoids. We then study the homotopical algebras for derived Lie $\infty$-groupoids and algebroids and study their homotopy-coherent representations, which we call $\infty$-representations. We relate $\infty$-representations of $L_{\infty}$-algebroids to (quasi-) cohesive modules developed by Block, and $\infty$-representations of Lie $\infty$-groupoids to $\infty$-local system introduced by Block-Smith. Then we apply these tools in studying singular foliations and their characteristic classes. We construct Atiyah classes for $L_{\infty}$-algebroids pairs. We study singular foliations and their holonomies. We construct $\L_{\infty}$-algebroids for holomorphic singular foliations, and then We study elliptic involutive structures and prove an dg-enhancement of $V$-analytic coherent sheaves. These examples inspire us to define {\it perfect singular foliations}, which is a subcategory of singular foliation but with better homological algebras. Next, we construct various Lie $\infty$-groupoids for singular foliations. Then we study foliations on stacks and higher groupoids. Finally, we prove an $A_{\infty}$ de Rham theorem for foliations, and Riemann-Hilbert correspondence for foliated $\infty$-local system foliated manifolds.</description>

      <title>Spencer-Riemann-Roch Theory: Mirror Symmetry of Hodge Decompositions and Characteristic Classes in Constrained Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of mirror symmetry in compatible pair Spencer complex theory brings new theoretical tools to the study of constrained geometry. Inspired by classical Spencer theory and modern Hodge theory, this paper establishes Spencer-Riemann-Roch theory in the context of constrained geometry, systematically studying the mirror symmetry of Spencer-Hodge decompositions and their manifestations in algebraic geometry. We utilize Serre's GAGA principle to algebraic geometrize Spencer complexes, establish coherent sheaf formulations, and reveal the topological essence of mirror symmetry through characteristic class theory. Main results include: Riemann-Roch type Euler characteristic computation formulas for Spencer complexes, equivalence theorems for mirror symmetry of Hodge decompositions at the characteristic class level, and verification of these theories in concrete geometric constructions. Research shows that algebraic geometric methods can not only reproduce deep results from differential geometry, but also reveal the intrinsic structure of mirror symmetry in constrained geometry through characteristic class analysis, opening new directions for applications of Spencer theory in constrained geometry.</description>
