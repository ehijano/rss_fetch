      <title>Exploring the Statistical Properties of Outputs from a Process Inspired by Geometrical Interpretation of Newton's Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the statistical properties of Newton s method algorithm output in a specific case have been studied. The relative frequency density of this sample converges to a well-defined function, prompting us to explore its distribution. Through rigorous mathematical proof, we demonstrate that the probability density function follows a Cauchy distribution. Additionally, a new method to generate a uniform distribution is proposed. To further confirm our findings, we employed statistical tests, including the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and Anderson-Darling test, which showed high p-values. Furthermore, we show that the distribution of the distance between two successive outputs can be obtained through a transformation method applied to the Cauchy distribution.</description>

      <title>Extracting self-similarity from data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The identification of self-similarity is an indispensable tool for understanding and modelling physical phenomena. Unfortunately, this is not always possible to perform formally in highly complex problems. We propose a methodology to extract the similarity variables of a self-similar physical process directly from data, without prior knowledge of the governing equations or boundary conditions, based on an optimization problem and symbolic regression. We analyze the accuracy and robustness of our method in four problems which have been influential in fluid mechanics research: a laminar boundary layer, Burger's equation, a turbulent wake, and a collapsing cavity. Our analysis considers datasets acquired via both numerical and wind-tunnel experiments.</description>

      <title>Growth of Science: How long will the United States uphold its position?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Policymakers often assess the growth of science in a country and compare it with that of other countries to set future planning for scientific research focusing on the sustainable development and economic growth of the country. Here, we study the growth of science for the period of 1996-2020 corresponding to the top fifty countries with the highest publications in 2020. It is found that the annual growth rates of scientific and technical journal publications exhibit Taylor's power law behavior indicating the dependence of the variance on the mean growth rate and the distributions of annual growth rates follow skew-symmetric distributions. Furthermore, we have computed the entropy based on annual publication numbers among the countries to assess the spatial disparity in the system. The entropy is found to increase mostly linear with time reducing the disparity among the countries. By performing the linear regression analysis, we predict that around the year 2046, all the countries excluding China may equally contribute towards the growth of science. We have also assessed the stability of the current USA ranking by computing the entropy between the USA and other countries. Based on the regression analysis, it is estimated that three potential countries such as Indonesia, India, and Iran may take the ranks ahead of the USA around the years 2024, 2029, and 2041 respectively.</description>

      <title>Detecting and Attributing Change in Climate and Complex Systems: Foundations, Green's Functions, and Nonlinear Fingerprints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.02628v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detection and attribution (D&amp;A) studies are cornerstones of climate science, providing crucial evidence for policy decisions. Their goal is to link observed climate change patterns to anthropogenic and natural drivers via the optimal fingerprinting method (OFM). We show that response theory for nonequilibrium systems offers the physical and dynamical basis for OFM, including the concept of causality used for attribution. Our framework clarifies the method's assumptions, advantages, and potential weaknesses. We use our theory to perform D&amp;A for prototypical climate change experiments performed on an energy balance model and on a low-resolution coupled climate model. We also explain the underpinnings of degenerate fingerprinting, which offers early warning indicators for tipping points. Finally, we extend the OFM to the nonlinear response regime. Our analysis shows that OFM has broad applicability across diverse stochastic systems influenced by time-dependent forcings, with potential relevance to ecosystems, quantitative social sciences, and finance, among others.</description>

      <title>Deep Generative Models for Detector Signature Simulation: A Taxonomic Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In modern collider experiments, the quest to explore fundamental interactions between elementary particles has reached unparalleled levels of precision. Signatures from particle physics detectors are low-level objects (such as energy depositions or tracks) encoding the physics of collisions (the final state particles of hard scattering interactions). The complete simulation of them in a detector is a computational and storage-intensive task. To address this computational bottleneck in particle physics, alternative approaches have been developed, introducing additional assumptions and trade off accuracy for speed.The field has seen a surge in interest in surrogate modeling the detector simulation, fueled by the advancements in deep generative models. These models aim to generate responses that are statistically identical to the observed data. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive and exhaustive taxonomic review of the existing literature on the simulation of detector signatures from both methodological and application-wise perspectives. Initially, we formulate the problem of detector signature simulation and discuss its different variations that can be unified. Next, we classify the state-of-the-art methods into five distinct categories based on their underlying model architectures, summarizing their respective generation strategies. Finally, we shed light on the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead in detector signature simulation, setting the stage for future research and development.</description>

      <title>Digital Signal Processing Techniques for Noise Characterization of Lasers and Optical Frequency Combs: A Tutorial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Performing noise characterizations of lasers and optical frequency combs on sampled data offers numerous advantages compared to analog measurement techniques. One of the main advantages is that the measurement setup is greatly simplified. Only a balanced detector followed by an analog-to-digital converter is needed, allowing all the complexity to be moved to the digital domain. Secondly, near-optimal phase estimators are efficiently implementable, providing accurate phase noise estimation in the presence of the measurement noise. Finally, joint processing of multiple comb lines is feasible, enabling computation of phase noise correlation matrix, which includes all information about the phase noise of the optical frequency comb. This tutorial introduces a framework based on digital signal processing for phase noise characterization of lasers and optical frequency combs. The framework is based on the extended Kalman filter (EKF) and automatic differentiation. The EKF is a near-optimal estimator of the optical phase in the presence of measurement noise, making it very suitable for phase noise measurements. Automatic differentiation is key to efficiently optimizing many parameters entering the EKF framework. More specifically, the combination of EKF and automatic differentiation enables the efficient optimization of phase noise measurement for optical frequency combs with arbitrarily complex noise dynamics that may include many free parameters. We show the framework's efficacy through simulations and experimental data, showcasing its application across various comb types and in dual-comb measurements, highlighting its accuracy and versatility. Finally, we discuss its capability for digital phase noise compensation, which is highly relevant to free-running dual-comb spectroscopy applications.</description>

      <title>Density Estimation via Binless Multidimensional Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Binless Multidimensional Thermodynamic Integration (BMTI) method for nonparametric, robust, and data-efficient density estimation. BMTI estimates the logarithm of the density by initially computing log-density differences between neighbouring data points. Subsequently, such differences are integrated, weighted by their associated uncertainties, using a maximum-likelihood formulation. This procedure can be seen as an extension to a multidimensional setting of the thermodynamic integration, a technique developed in statistical physics. The method leverages the manifold hypothesis, estimating quantities within the intrinsic data manifold without defining an explicit coordinate map. It does not rely on any binning or space partitioning, but rather on the construction of a neighbourhood graph based on an adaptive bandwidth selection procedure. BMTI mitigates the limitations commonly associated with traditional nonparametric density estimators, effectively reconstructing smooth profiles even in high-dimensional embedding spaces. The method is tested on a variety of complex synthetic high-dimensional datasets, where it is shown to outperform traditional estimators, and is benchmarked on realistic datasets from the chemical physics literature.</description>
