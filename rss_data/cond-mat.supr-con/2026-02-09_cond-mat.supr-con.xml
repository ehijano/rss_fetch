      <title>Magnon-Mediated Superconductivity in the Infinite-$U$ Triangular Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the infinite-$U$ triangular-lattice Hubbard model supports a superconducting state built from tightly bound Cooper pairs composed of two holes and one magnon ($2h1m$). Building on the seminal prediction of repulsively bound $2h1m$ states, we show that next-nearest-neighbor hopping $t_{2}$ coherently mixes symmetry-related configurations, stabilizing an $s$-wave bound state with substantial binding energy and a light effective mass. Large-scale DMRG calculations at finite doping identify a magnetization plateau corresponding to a gas of such bound states and quasi--long--range superconducting order with power-law $2h1m$ pair correlations. Our results establish a magnon-mediated superconducting mechanism driven by kinetic frustration, with immediate detectable signatures for moir\'e Hubbard materials and ultracold-atom simulators.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity of 30.4 K and its Reemergence under Pressure in Fe1.11Se Synthesized via Ion-exchange and De-intercalation Reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary stoichiometry FeSe (s-FeSe) is a well-known parent of high-temperature unconventional superconductors owing to its charge-neutral layer, highly tunable structure and electronic properties, and rich interplays among multiple electronic phases. Yet the s-FeSe synthesized via high-temperature equilibrium reactions bears the notorious interstitial Fe,where merely 3% of them is sufficient to kill the superconductivity. Here, we successfully synthesized a new non-stoichiometric Fe1.11Se single crystal with a superconducting onset temperature (Tconset) of 30.4 K through a hydrothermal ion-exchange and de-intercalation route. 11% interstitial Fe ions exceed the equilibrium phase diagram limit. Intriguingly, under physical pressure, the Tconset of exhibits a "V"-shaped evolution with a minimum at 2-2.6 GPa, and then upturning into a second superconducting region, reminiscent of the behaviors in FeSe intercalates. Furthermore, a pressure-induced possible magnetic order, previously only observed in pressurized s-FeSe, shows up. These results offer fresh insights into the role of interstitial Fe in governing superconducting and transport properties under non-equilibrium synthesis and tuning strategies.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in Isolated Single Copper Oxygen Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the central questions in cuprate superconductivity is if superconductivity can exist in an isolated single CuO$_2$ plane without any interlayer coupling. There have been numerous experimental efforts to answer this question, but it still has not been clearly resolved. Here we present a heterostructure system with an isolated half-unit-cell La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ which has a single CuO$_2$ plane. Using in-situ angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we measured the electronic and gap structures of a single CuO$_2$ plane. We observed a \textit{d}-wave-like gap which closes somewhat above the bulk T$_c$. Moreover, almost identical gap properties are seen for both single CuO$_2$ plane and bulk. These observations lead us to the conclusion that the d-wave superconductivity of cuprates also exists in a single CuO$_2$ plane. Our results demonstrate that cuprate superconductivity is essentially a two-dimensional phenomenon and provide a platform to study cuprate superconductivity in a purely two-dimensional system.</description>

      <title>Spin splitting, Kondo correlation and singlet-doublet quantum phase transition in a superconductor-coupled InSb nanosheet quantum dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We realize a superconductor-coupled quantum dot (QD) in an InSb nanosheet, a 2D platform promising for studies of topological superconductivity. The device consists of a superconductor-QD-superconductor junction, where a bottom bilayer gate defines the QD and allows tuning of its coupling to the superconducting leads. The QD exhibits large $g$-factors and strong spin-orbit coupling. Transport measurements reveal Coulomb diamond-shaped differential conductance features with even-odd alternating sizes and pronounced conductance lines associated with the superconducting gap, confirming a few-electron, superconductor-coupled regime. At an odd electron occupation, Kondo signatures emerge, including a zero-bias peak that splits with magnetic field and is logarithmically suppressed at elevated temperatures. We further observe a doublet-singlet quantum phase transition, manifested by a clear change of Andreev bound states from crossing to anticrossing as the coupling strength increases. These results underscore the rich physics of InSb nanosheet QDs and their promise for topological quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Quantum Error Correction Performance of Radiation-induced Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiation impacts are a current challenge with computing on superconducting-based quantum devices because they can lead to widespread correlated errors across the device. Such errors can be problematic for quantum error correction (QEC) codes, which are generally designed to correct independent errors. To address this, we have developed a computational model to simulate the effects of radiation impacts on QEC performance. This is achieved by building from recently developed models of quasiparticle density, mapping radiation-induced qubit error rates onto a quantum error channel and simulation of a simple surface code. We also provide a performance metric to quantify the resilience of a QEC code to radiation impacts. Additionally, we sweep various parameters of chip design to test mitigation strategies for improved QEC performance. Our model approach is holistic, allowing for modular performance testing of error mitigation strategies and chip and code designs.</description>

      <title>Physical properties of RhGe and CoGe single crystals synthesized under high pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral topological semimetals hosting multifold fermions and exotic surface states represent a frontier in topological materials research. Among them, noncentrosymmetric cubic B20 compounds-notably transition-metal silicides and germanides-offer a unique platform for realizing symmetry-protected topological phases and unconventional optoelectronic responses. Here, we report the physical properties of RhGe and CoGe single crystals with B20 structure in detail. Transport measurements reveal metallic behavior with characteristic Fermi-liquid scaling at low temperatures, while magnetization results confirm paramagnetism in both compounds. In addition, both of materials exhibit low carrier concentrations with small electronic specific heat coefficient, indicating their semimetal feature with weak electronic correlations. Such high-quality CoGe and RhGe single crystals provide a material platform to explore the evolution of multifold fermions and the instability of helicoid-arc surface states with spin-orbit coupling and surface environment in B20 material systems.</description>

      <title>Current precision in interacting hybrid Normal-Superconducting systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Andreev-mediated transport and current fluctuations in interacting normal-superconducting quantum-dot systems. Using a generalized master equation based on real-time diagrammatics and full counting statistics, we compute the steady-state current, zero-frequency noise, and rate of entropy production in the large superconducting-gap limit. We show how Coulomb interactions modify Andreev-mediated transport by renormalizing resonant conditions and suppressing superconducting coherence, leading to a pronounced reduction of current precision even when average currents are only weakly affected. These effects are particularly evident at high temperatures, where conventional Coulomb-blockade features are thermally smeared while fluctuation properties remain highly sensitive. By analyzing thermodynamic uncertainty relations, we demonstrate that violations of the quantum bound present in the noninteracting regime are progressively reduced and eventually suppressed as interactions increase, whereas the recently proposed hybrid bound remains satisfied. Our results clarify how Coulomb interactions, and nonequilibrium fluctuations jointly determine transport properties in hybrid superconducting devices, and establish current precision as a robust benchmark for interacting Andreev transport beyond the noninteracting limit.</description>
