      <title>Network and timing effects in social learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a group of agents who can each take an irreversible costly action whose payoff depends on an unknown state. Agents learn about the state from private signals, as well as from past actions of their social network neighbors, which creates an incentive to postpone taking the action. We show that outcomes depend on network structure: on networks with a linear structure patient agents do not converge to the first-best action, while on regular directed tree networks they do.</description>

      <title>Optimal sharing, equilibria, and welfare without risk aversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze Pareto optimality and competitive equilibria in a risk-exchange economy, where either all agents are risk seeking in an expected utility model, or they exhibit local risk-seeking behaviour in a rank-dependent utility model. A novel mathematical tool, the counter-monotonic improvement theorem, states that for any nonnegative allocation of the aggregate random payoff, there exists a counter-monotonic random vector, called a jackpot allocation, that is componentwise riskier than the original allocation, and thus preferred by risk-seeking agents. This result allows us to characterize Pareto optimality, the utility possibility frontier, and competitive equilibria with risk-seeking expected utility agents, and prove the first and second fundamental theorems of welfare economics in this setting. For rank-dependent utility agents that are neither risk averse or risk seeking, we show that jackpot allocations can be Pareto optimal for small-scale payoffs, but for large-scale payoffs they are dominated by proportional allocations, thus explaining the often-observed small-stake gambling behaviour in a risk sharing context. Such jackpot allocations are also equilibrium allocations for small-scale payoffs when there is no aggregate uncertainty.</description>
