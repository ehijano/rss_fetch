      <title>Identifying the Attractors of Gene Regulatory Networks from Expression Data under Uncertainty: An Interpretable Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In systems biology, attractor landscape analysis of gene regulatory networks is recognized as a powerful computational tool for studying various cellular states from proliferation and differentiation to senescence and apoptosis. Therefore, accurate identification of attractors plays a critical role in determination of the cell fates. On the other hand, in a real biological circuit, genetic/epigenetic alterations as well as varying environmental factors drastically take effect on the location, characteristics, and even the number of attractors. The central question is: Given a temporal gene expression profile of a real gene regulatory network, how can the attractors be robustly identified in the presence of huge amount of uncertainty? This paper addresses this question using a novel approach based on Zadeh Computing with Words. The proposed scheme could effectively identify the attractors from temporal gene expression data in terms of both fuzzy logic-based and linguistic descriptions which are simply interpretable by human experts. Therefore, this method can be considered as an effective step towards interpretable artificial intelligence. Without loss of generality, genetic toggle switch is considered as the case study. The nonlinear dynamics of this benchmark gene regulatory network is computationally modeled by the notion of uncertain stochastic differential equations. The results of in-silico study demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Enlightening the blind spot of the Michaelis-Menten rate law: The role of relaxation dynamics in molecular complex formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The century-long Michaelis-Menten rate law and its modifications in the modeling of biochemical rate processes stand on the assumption that the concentration of the complex of interacting molecules, at each moment, rapidly approaches an equilibrium (quasi-steady state) compared to the pace of molecular concentration changes. Yet, in the case of actively time-varying molecular concentrations with transient or oscillatory dynamics, the deviation of the complex profile from the quasi-steady state becomes relevant. A recent theoretical approach, known as the effective time-delay scheme (ETS), suggests that the delay by the relaxation time of molecular complex formation contributes to the substantial breakdown of the quasi-steady state assumption. Here, we systematically expand this ETS and inquire into the comprehensive roles of relaxation dynamics in complex formation. Through the modeling of rhythmic protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions and the mammalian circadian clock, our analysis reveals the effect of the relaxation dynamics beyond the time delay, which extends to the dampening of changes in the complex concentration with a reduction in the oscillation amplitude against the quasi-steady state. Interestingly, the combined effect of the time delay and amplitude reduction shapes both qualitative and quantitative oscillatory patterns such as the emergence and variability of the mammalian circadian rhythms. These findings highlight the drawback of the routine assumption of quasi-steady states and enhance the mechanistic understanding of rich time-varying biomolecular activities.</description>
