      <title>Data reduction strategy in the PandaX-4T experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The PandaX-4T experiment is designed for multiple purposes, including searches for solar neutrinos, weakly interacting massive particles, and rare double beta decays of xenon isotopes. The experiment produces a huge amount of raw data that needs to be stored for related physical analyses in a wide energy range. With the upgrading of the PandaX-4T experiment, the doubled sampling rate resulted in a larger data size, which challenges both the cost and the data processing speed. To address this issue, we propose a data reduction strategy by removing the noise tail of large signals and downsampling the remaining parts of them. This strategy reduces the requirement for storage by 65% while increasing data processing speed. The influences on physical analyses on different topics at different energy regions are negligible.</description>

      <title>Towards Universal Unfolding of Detector Effects in High-Energy Physics using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01507v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The unfolding of detector effects in experimental data is critical for enabling precision measurements in high-energy physics. However, traditional unfolding methods face challenges in scalability, flexibility, and dependence on simulations. We introduce a novel unfolding approach using conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (cDDPM). Our method utilizes the cDDPM for a non-iterative, flexible posterior sampling approach, which exhibits a strong inductive bias that allows it to generalize to unseen physics processes without explicitly assuming the underlying distribution. We test our approach by training a single cDDPM to perform multidimensional particle-wise unfolding for a variety of physics processes, including those not seen during training. Our results highlight the potential of this method as a step towards a "universal" unfolding tool that reduces dependence on truth-level assumptions.</description>

      <title>Detecting local perturbations of networks in a latent hyperbolic embedding space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13495v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph theoretical approaches have been proven to be effective in the characterization of connected systems, as well as in quantifying their dysfunction due to perturbation. In this paper, we show the advantage of a non-Euclidean (hyperbolic) representation of networks to identify local connectivity perturbations and to characterize the induced effects on a large scale. We propose two perturbation scores based on representations of the networks in a latent geometric space, obtained through an embedding onto the hyperbolic Poincar\'e disk. We numerically demonstrate that these methods are able to localize perturbations in networks with homogeneous or heterogeneous degree connectivity. We apply this framework to identify the most perturbed brain areas in epileptic patients following surgery. This study is conceived in the effort of developing more powerful tools to represent and analyze brain networks, and it is the first to apply geometric network embedding techniques to the case of epilepsy.</description>
