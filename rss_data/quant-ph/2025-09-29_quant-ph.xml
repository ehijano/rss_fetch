      <title>Quantum Simulation of Fermions in $AdS_2$ Black Hole: Chirality, Entanglement, and Spectral Crossovers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider free Dirac fermions on a discretized $AdS_2$ black hole background, and analyze how curved space redshift, horizons, and the spin connection induced chiral gravitational effect shape spectral, transport, and scrambling phenomena. The system is discretized via staggered fermions followed by the Jordan-Wigner transform to encode the model in qubit degrees of freedom, whose Hamiltonian carries site dependent warp factors and bond chirality terms encoding the redshift and spin connection effects. We calculate the ground state and first excited states energies, their local charge profiles, and their half-chain entanglement entropies, showing how redshift and chirality affect the transition from criticality to a gapped regime. Probing operator growth via out-of-time-order correlators, we find that horizons and the chiral coupling accelerate scrambling, yet remain within a non-chaotic regime. Finally, we map out an integrable to ergodic crossover via level-spacing statistics and Brody fits, and introduce on-site disorder to drive a many body localization transition.</description>

      <title>Thermal reconstruction of chaotic quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal states are thermal with respect to a fixed Hamiltonian. How much information about this Hamiltonian can we ``bootstrap'' from the subsystems of a thermal state? We attack the problem by positioning it as a subspecies of the quantum marginal problem. In states that obey the quantum Markov property, the Petz recovery map captures the knowledge of the larger system inherent in a subsystem. We use the conditional mutual information to check the goodness of Petz recovery, analytically in a random-matrix-theory-inspired hopping model and numerically in an Ising-like spin chain model. We observe different behavior in chaotic versus integrable phases of the model: in the chaotic phase, the reconstruction works well at both very low and very high temperatures, with some intermediate critical temperature at which reconstruction works worst, whereas in the integrable phase reconstruction breaks down at low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Entanglement sharing schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We ask how quantum correlations can be distributed among many subsystems. To address this, we define entanglement sharing schemes (ESS) where certain pairs of subsystems allow entanglement to be recovered via local operations, while other pairs must not. ESS schemes come in two variants, one where the partner system with which entanglement should be prepared is known, and one where it is not. In the case of known partners, we fully characterize the access structures realizable for ESS when using stabilizer states, and construct efficient schemes for threshold access structures, and give a conjecture for the access structures realizable with general states. In the unknown partner case, we again give a complete characterization in the stabilizer setting, additionally give a complete characterization of the case where there are no restrictions on unauthorized pairs, and we prove a set of necessary conditions on general schemes which we conjecture are also sufficient. Finally, we give an application of the theory of entanglement sharing to resolve an open problem related to the distribution of entanglement in response to time-sensitive requests in quantum networks.</description>

      <title>On the hardness of approximating minimum distances of quantum codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of computing distances of error-correcting codes is fundamental in both the classical and quantum settings. While hardness for the classical version of these problems has been known for some time (in both the exact and approximate settings), it was only recently that Kapshikar and Kundu showed these problems are also hard in the quantum setting. As our first main result, we reprove this using arguably simpler arguments based on hypergraph product codes. In particular, we get a direct reduction to CSS codes, the most commonly used type of quantum code, from the minimum distance problem for classical linear codes.
  Our second set of results considers the distance of a graph state, which is a key parameter for quantum codes obtained via the codeword stabilized formalism. We show that it is NP-hard to compute/approximate the distance of a graph state when the adjacency matrix of the graph is the input. In fact, we show this is true even if we only consider X-type errors of a graph state. Our techniques moreover imply an interesting classical consequence: the hardness of computing or approximating the distance of classical codes with rate equal to 1/2.
  One of the main motivations of the present work is a question raised by Kapshikar and Kundu concerning the NP-hardness of approximation when there is an additive error proportional to a quantum code's length. We show that no such hardness can hold for hypergraph product codes. These observations suggest the possibility of a new kind of square root barrier.</description>

      <title>Dynamics and Control of Two Coupled Quantum Oscillators: An Analytical Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze two coupled quantum oscillators in a common Lorentzian environment and control them by detuning (temporarily shifting) their frequencies. The reduced dynamics are solved exactly, without Born or Markov approximations, by propagating each detuning segment in closed form. We study two control schedules: regular detuning, with perfectly periodic on and off pulses of fixed period, width, and amplitude; and irregular detuning, with the same on/off structure but cycle-to-cycle jitter in period, width, and amplitude. Our main observable is the average excitation number (AEN) of each mode. Detuning moves the system away from the bath's spectral peak, suppressing decoherence and damping non-Markovian revivals; in effectively Markovian baths the benefit is small. We quantify performance with a simple time-domain suppression factor. Larger detuning amplitudes and higher duty cycles yield stronger protection. Irregular control is slightly weaker at low duty cycle but becomes comparable to regular control as the duty cycle approaches one. These results give practical design rules linking detuning, duty cycle, and bath width, and provide an exact benchmark for controlled non-Markovian dynamics.</description>

      <title>Quantum algorithms for solving a drift-diffusion equation: analysing circuit depths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare the circuit depths for five different gate sets to implement a quantum algorithm solving a drift-diffusion equation in two spatial dimensions. Our algorithm uses diagonalisation by the quantum Fourier transform. The gate sets are: An unconstrained gate set, the TK1 gate set from Quantinuum, the native gate sets of IBM Heron and IonQ, and Fujitsu's space-time efficient analog rotation (STAR) gate set. Our analysis covers a set of illustrative scenarios using up to 22 qubits. We find that while scaling with spatial resolution aligns with theoretical predictions in one dimension, scaling with spatial dimension is less efficient than theorised due to overhead from block encoding. Finally, using the STAR gate set, we find that even minimal problem instances exceed the operational limits of current quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>From VQE To SQD: Modern Quantum Algorithms For The Electronic Structure Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis investigates sampling-based quantum algorithms for electronic ground state energy estimation, focusing on Quantum-Selected Configuration Interaction (QSCI) and Sample-Based Quantum Diagonalization (SQD) as near-term alternatives to the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). Unlike VQE, which suffers from barren plateaus and high measurement costs, these methods avoid variational optimization by sampling Slater determinants from quantum hardware and performing diagonalization classically. The central contribution is the first analytical expression for the sampling bottleneck: the determinant-discovery step is mapped to the classical coupon-collector problem, yielding both an exact formula and a scalable lower-bound estimator for the number of measurements required to recover all determinants contributing to the ground state. Previous work only relied on numerical sampling and estimation. The analysis is validated through simulations, hardware-calibrated noisy studies, and execution on IBM's 127-qubit IBM Brisbane processor, demonstrating the dominant role of sampling efficiency in the near-term feasibility of QSCI and SQD.

      <title>A Markovian approach to $N$-photon correlations beyond the quantum regression theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-photon correlations from quantum emitters coupled to vibrational environments lie beyond the reach of standard tools such as the quantum regression theorem (QRT). Here, we introduce a Markovian framework for computing frequency-resolved $N$-photon correlation functions that overcomes this limitation. Applying our approach to a driven semiconductor quantum dot provides a tractable description of phonon effects on fluorescence beyond the single-photon spectrum. Our method accurately captures the emergence of the phonon sideband, missed by conventional QRT treatments, and reveals rich phonon-induced structure in the filtered two-photon spectrum. Strikingly, we find that photons emitted via the phonon sideband inherit second-order coherence properties of the Mollow triplet.</description>

      <title>Quantum lattice Boltzmann algorithm for heat transfer with phase change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heat transfer involving phase change is computationally intensive due to moving phase boundaries, nonlinear computations, and time step restrictions. This paper presents a quantum lattice Boltzmann method (QLBM) for simulating heat transfer with phase change. The approach leverages the statistical nature of the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) while addressing the challenges of nonlinear phase transitions in quantum computing. The method implements an interface-tracking strategy that partitions the problem into separate solid and liquid domains, enabling the algorithm to handle the discontinuity in the enthalpy-temperature relationship. We store phase change information in the quantum circuit to avoid frequent information exchange between classical and quantum hardware, a bottleneck in many quantum applications. Results from the implementation agree with both classical LBM and analytical solutions, demonstrating QLBM as an effective approach for analyzing thermal systems with phase transitions. Simulations using 17 lattice nodes with 51 qubits demonstrate root-mean-square (RMS) errors below 0.005 when compared against classical solutions. The method accurately tracks interface movement during phase transition.</description>

      <title>Tensors, entanglement, separability, and their complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most challenging problems in quantum physics is to quantify the entanglement of $d$-partite states and their separability. We show here that these problems are best addressed using tensors. The geometric measure of entanglement of a pure state is one of most natural ways to quantify the entanglement, which is simply related to the spectral norm of a tensor state. On the other hand, the logarithm of the nuclear norm of the state and density tensors can be considered as its ``energy''. We first show that the most geometric measure entangled $d$-partite state has the minimum spectral norm and maximum nuclear norm. Second, we introduce the notion of Hermitian and density tensors, and the subspace of bi-symmetric Hermitian tensors, which correspond to Bosons. We show that separable density tensors, and strongly separable bi-symmetric density tensors are characterized by the value (equal to one) of their corresponding nuclear norms. In general, these characterizations are NP-hard to verify. Third, we show that the above quantities are computed in polynomial time when we restrict our attentions to Bosons: symmetric $d$-qubits, or more generally to symmetric $d$-qunits in $C^n$, and the corresponding bi-symmetric Hermtian density tensors, for a fixed value of $n$.</description>

      <title>Fast mixing of operator-loop path-integral quantum Monte Carlo for stoquastic XY Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Monte Carlo method with operator-loop update is a powerful technique that has been extensively used with great success in condensed matter physics. It enables one to sample from thermal and ground states of local Hamiltonians of various spin, bosonic and fermionic systems as long as the Hamiltonian does not have a negative-sign problem. Despite the practical success of this method, theoretical understanding of the efficiency of the algorithm has been lacking. The operator-loop update is commonly used for path-integral formulation (Suzuki-Trotter/world-lines) of the partition function. In this work we consider this method applied to the stoquastic (sign-problem free) XY model and prove that the mixing time of the Markov chain is polynomial in the system size and the inverse temperature. Using the fast mixing Markov chain, we can estimate the partition functions of the Hamiltonians that we consider in a polynomial time, significantly improving upon the best known previous algorithm by Bravyi and Gosset [arXiv:1612.05602]. Our algorithm also allows for natural extensions to a wide class of empirically fast-mixing Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Optimizing the non-Clifford-count in unitary synthesis using Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An efficient implementation of unitary operators is important in order to practically realize the computational advantages claimed by quantum algorithms over their classical counterparts. In this paper we study the potential of using reinforcement learning (RL) in order to synthesize quantum circuits, while optimizing the T-count and CS-count, of unitaries that are exactly implementable by the Clifford+T and Clifford+CS gate sets, respectively. In general, the complexity of existing algorithms depend exponentially on the number of qubits and the non-Clifford-count of unitaries. We have designed our RL framework to work with channel representation of unitaries, that enables us to perform matrix operations efficiently, using integers only. We have also incorporated pruning heuristics and a canonicalization of operators, in order to reduce the search complexity. As a result, compared to previous works, we are able to implement significantly larger unitaries, in less time, with much better success rate and improvement factor. Our results for Clifford+T synthesis on two qubits achieve close-to-optimal decompositions for up to 100 T gates, 5 times more than previous RL algorithms and to the best of our knowledge, the largest instances achieved with any method to date. Our RL algorithm is able to recover previously-known optimal linear complexity algorithm for T-count-optimal decomposition of 1 qubit unitaries. For 2-qubit Clifford+CS unitaries, our algorithm achieves a linear complexity, something that could only be accomplished by a previous algorithm using $SO(6)$ representation.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for Quantum State Tomography: Robust Covariance Matrix Estimation for Squeezed Vacuum States with Thermal Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a supervised machine learning-based method using convolutional neural networks to estimate the covariance matrix of Gaussian quantum states in the presence of thermal noise. Unlike computationally intensive density matrix reconstructions, our machine learning-based method allows for the reconstruction of impure squeezed vacuum states using sparse measurements of quadrature sequences based on a model employing a two-component state mixed together from thermal and squeezed thermal states. The method achieves high fidelity and precision, notably also at high squeezing levels, while offering an effective characterization of physical quantities and accurately estimating the covariance matrix. We benchmark our machine against experimental data of single-mode squeezed vacuum states, demonstrating its accuracy and capability to quantify experimental degradation to squeezing and purity. We experimentally verify that our covariance matrix estimation exhibits robustness to state degradation induced by thermal state admixtures. We provide a method for lightweight, compact, and complete representation of lab-generated Gaussian states and lay the foundation for extending real-time quantum state tomography for thermal multi-component Gaussian states to multi-mode systems.</description>

      <title>Propagation Dynamics and Transient Amplification in Warm and Cold Atomic EIT Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the limitations on observing transient amplification in atomic systems exhibiting electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) and evaluate the limits of optical Bloch equation (OBE) models. Using propagation-based Maxwell-Bloch simulations, we show that single-atom, spatially uniform OBE treatments overestimate gain by neglecting propagation dynamics. In two-level systems, this yields incorrect transmission, while in three-level systems, it predicts unrealistically large amplification. Furthermore, we show that Doppler averaging in warm vapor suppresses oscillatory ringing and the maximum achievable gain. Our results explain discrepancies between OBE predictions and experimental observations, and establish practical limits on transient gain in cold and thermally broadened EIT media.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a variational quantum computing approach for reconstructing quantum states from measurement data. By mapping the reconstruction cost function onto an Ising model, the problem can be solved using a variational eigensolver on present-day quantum hardware. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the method on quantum structured light, in particular, entangled photons carrying orbital angular momentum and show that the reconstruction procedure can yield reliable performance even on noisy devices. Our results highlight the potential of variational algorithms for efficient quantum state tomography, particularly for high-dimensional structured light, where classical approaches can face bottlenecks.</description>

      <title>The 2T-quoctit: a two-mode bosonic qudit for high energy physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study a two-mode bosonic encoding of a quoctit inside a non-Abelian group-structured constellation of coherent states. This work is motivated by the importance of nonabelian symmetry in particle physics and the desire to have transversal nonabelian logical gates. We use the previously developed $2T$-constellation of states used to encode a so-called $2T$-qutrit. The fidelity of the $2T$-quoctit is benchmarked against other bosonic qudits for different noise models and find it compare favorably when power constraints are considered. This paves the way for the construction of higher-dimensional qudits (e.g. a quicosotetrit with $2T$ group structure) in bosonic systems with practical applications in quantum simulations of particle physics.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation approach to ultra-weak magnetic anisotropy in a frustrated spin-1/2 antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intrinsic equivalence between electron spin and qubit offers a natural foundation for quantum simulations of magnetic materials. However, incorporating magnetocrystalline anisotropy (MCA), a key feature of real magnets, remains a major challenge. Here, we develop a quantum simulation framework for MCA in CuSb2O6, a spin-1/2 antiferromagnet with alternating ferromagnetic chains arising from frustrated, anisotropic exchange interactions in a nearly square lattice. The $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$ spin network is modeled as a four-qubit square lattice, with four paired ancilla qubits introduced to encode angle-dependent MCA. This two-qubit representation per spin site resolves the limitation that squared Pauli operators yield only the identity, enabling MCA terms to be faithfully embedded into quantum circuits. Using the variational quantum eigensolver, we determine an exceptionally small easy-axis MCA constant, just 0.00022% of the nearest-neighbor exchange interaction, yet sufficient to drive a spin-flop transition with $90^{\circ}$ spin reorientation and strong angular variation in magnetic torque. Beyond this regime, the simulations uncover a half-saturated magnetic phase at ultra-high fields, stabilized by anisotropic next-nearest-neighbor interactions. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of resource-efficient quantum simulations of complex magnetic phenomena in real materials.</description>

      <title>Properties of computational entanglement measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement is a useful resource for implementing communication tasks. However, for the resource to be useful in practice, it needs to be accessible by parties with bounded computational resources. Computational entanglement measures quantify the usefulness of entanglement in the presence of limited computational resources. In this paper, we analyze systematically some basic properties of two recently introduced computational entanglement measures, the computational distillable entanglement and entanglement cost. To do so, we introduce lower bound and upper bound extensions of basic properties to address the case when entanglement measures are not defined by a scalar value but when only lower or upper function bounds are available. In particular, we investigate the lower bound convexity and upper bound concavity properties of such measures, and the upper and lower bound additivity with respect to the tensor product. We also observe that these measures are not invariant with local unitaries, although invariance is recovered for efficient unitaries. As a consequence, we obtain that these measures are only LOCC monotones under efficient families of LOCC channels. Our analysis covers both the one-shot scenario and the uniform setting, with properties established for the former naturally extending to the latter.</description>

      <title>Noise cross-correlations from single-shot measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel method that we call Single-Shot Cross-Spectroscopy (SSCS), for extracting the auto- and cross-power spectral densities of dephasing noise of a qubit pair. The method uses straightforward input, namely single-shot readouts from single-qubit Ramsey-type experiments, and is resilient against errors in state preparation and measurement. We apply it to experimental data from a semiconductor spin-qubit device and obtain noise spectra over five orders of magnitude in frequency (5 mHz--500 Hz). Compared to other techniques, SSCS enables access to noise correlations in the previously inaccessible intermediate-frequency range (1--500 Hz) for spin qubits, and can be further extended with faster readout. More broadly, the frequency range accessible with SSCS is limited only by the experiment repetition rate, and scales accordingly on other platforms.</description>

      <title>A Source of Deterministic Entanglement for Matter-Wave Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a deterministic and experimentally feasible protocol for generating entangled pairs of ultracold neutral atoms through controlled dissociation of diatomic Feshbach molecules. The dissociation process naturally produces nonlocal quantum correlations in spin, position-momentum, and path degrees of freedom, enabling the deterministic preparation of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pairs of massive particles and multiqubit states through hyperentangled encoding. Having each atom of the pair prepared in a matter waveguide, the scheme can be scaled to hundreds of parallel entanglement sources in an array connected to a matter wave optical network of beam splitters, phase shifters, interferometers, tunnel junctions and local detectors. The protocol builds on established techniques, including programmable optical potentials, high-fidelity single-particle control, single-molecule initialization, controlled molecular dissociation, and quantum gas microscopy with near-perfect detection, making it directly implementable with current technology. The proposed architecture naturally integrates with atomtronics circuits and chip-based matter-wave optics, offering a deterministic entanglement source for quantum nonlocality tests, precision metrology, and scalable neutral-atom quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Privacy in Distributed Quantum Sensing with Gaussian Quantum Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the privacy properties of distributed quantum sensing protocols in a Gaussian quantum network, where each node encodes a parameter via a local phase shift. For networks with more than two nodes, achieving perfect privacy is possible only asymptotically, in the limit of large photon numbers. However, we show that optimized fully symmetric Gaussian states enable rapidly approaching perfect privacy while maintaining near-optimal sensing performance. We show that local homodyne detection achieves a quadratic scaling of precision with the total number of photons. We further analyze the impact of thermal noise in the preparation stage on both privacy and estimation precision. Our results pave the way for the development of practical, private distributed quantum sensing protocols in continuous-variable quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Introduction of modelling radical pair quantum spin dynamics with tensor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radical pairs (also known as spin qubit pairs, electron-hole pairs) are transient reaction intermediates that are found and utilised in all areas of science. Radical pair spin dynamics simulations including all nuclear spins have been a computational barrier due to exponential scaling memory requirements. We address this issue with a tensor network method for accurately simulating the full open quantum dynamics of radical pair systems, explicitly accounting for hyperfine interactions with up to 30 nuclear spins with additional benchmarking including 60 nuclei. By employing the matrix product state (MPS) and matrix product density operator (MPDO) representations, we mitigate the exponential scaling of Hilbert and Liouville spaces typically encountered in full quantum non-Markovian treatments. We demonstrate the power of these methods with biologically relevant flavin-tryptophan radical pair systems, where we investigate electron hopping processes between multiple radical pairs using Lindblad jump operators. These simulations precisely capture anisotropic spin dynamics, clearly identifying orientational dependence of the magnetic field, which enhances or diminishes the spin-selective product yield. These directional sensitivities highlight the critical dependence of the nuclear environment and underscore the necessity of fully quantum treatments in spin biophysics, offering critical insights into avian magnetoreception mechanisms. This work provides a robust computational framework applicable to a broad range of scientific realms, which include spin chemistry, quantum biology, and spintronics.</description>

      <title>Multi-Qubit Gates by Dynamical Decoupling Implemented with IBMQ and 15NV Center in Diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a general protocol for realizing fast high-fidelity multi-qubit gates, through dynamical decoupling (DD) pulse sequences applied to a central qubit coupled to target qubits. This way, we are able to control the states of the target qubits by leveraging their intrinsic interaction with the central qubit, eliminating the need for slow error-prone direct control. The DD-gate protocol is developed and experimentally implemented within two distinct frameworks: a hardware-agnostic model with minimal assumptions, benchmarked within a general-purpose digital quantum simulator given by the IBMQ; and an experimentally realistic case with nitrogen-15 vacancy center ($^{15}$NV) in diamond. Likewise, we are able to thoroughly characterize the quantum mechanical dynamics behind the multi-qubit gates within IBMQ, without many of the experimental constraints faced by other quantum systems. While at the same time, we establish the protocol for the $^{15}$NV system, considering its specific properties. The DD-gates with $^{15}$NVs can represent a significant reduction in gate times and improved technological scalability, compared to current methods of target qubit control using dynamical decoupling. In addition, we propose a simple application of the method for high-efficiency polarization generation of the $^{15}$N nuclear spin. All experimental findings are supported by comprehensive open-source simulations in the two distinct frameworks. This work provides a robust hardware-agnostic strategy for quantum control, which can be implemented with arbitrary systems that fit the central-target qubits description. Thus, marking an essential step in technological scalability of future quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic equipartition property of subadditive multipartite entanglement measures on pure states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic equipartition property (AEP) in the context of multipartite entanglement measures on pure states. Specifically, we formulate AEP for subadditive entanglement measures that admit certain weak conditions. This is motivated by the uniqueness of the entanglement entropy in the asymptotic limit in the bipartite case. On the other hand, its operational relevance comes from the $\text{LOCC}_q$ scenario (asymptotic local operations and classical communication with a sublinear amount of quantum communication). Analogously to the classical AEP, we prove that the regularization of smooth weakly additive entanglement measures (subject to some weak extra conditions) yields weakly additive and asymptotically continuous entanglement measures. Then evaluate the mentioned regularization and smoothing on known R\'enyi type multipartite entanglement measures, showing that the resulting regularized entanglement measures reduce to convex combinations of bipartite entanglement entropies.</description>

      <title>Mpemba Effects in Quantum Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mpemba effect is the phenomenon whereby systems farther from equilibrium may relax faster. In this work, we show that this counterintuitive behavior appears in the very measures that define quantum complexity. Using the framework of quantum resource theories, we study the dynamics of coherence, imaginarity, non-Gaussianity, and magic state resources in random circuit models. Our results reveal that coherence and imaginarity display a quantum Mpemba effect when the system is initialized in resourceful product states, while non-Gaussianity and magic do not. Strikingly, all four resources exhibit the so-called Pontus-Mpemba effect: an initial "preheating" stage accelerates relaxation compared to direct "cooling" dynamics. Taken together, our findings show that Mpemba physics extends beyond thermodynamics and asymmetry, emerging broadly in the resource theories that capture aspects of quantum complexity.</description>

      <title>Extending coherence time beyond break-even point using only drives and dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) aims to mitigate the loss of quantum information to the environment, which is a critical requirement for practical quantum computing. Existing QEC implementations heavily rely on measurement-based feedback, however, constraints on readout fidelity, hardware latency, and system complexity often limit both performance and scalability. Autonomous QEC (AQEC) seeks to overcome these obstacles by stabilizing logical codewords using introduced drives that provide coherent control and engineered dissipation. Here, we propose an AQEC protocol, derived from quantum channel simulation, that is applicable to arbitrary error-correcting codes. As a demonstration, we implement the protocol using a binomial code encoded in a long-lived bosonic mode (lifetime &gt; 1ms), and extend the logical qubit coherence time to 1.04 times that of the best physical qubit in the system. This is the first experimental realization of an AQEC-protected bosonic logical qubit beyond the break-even point, proving that coherence time can indeed be extended by introducing only drives and dissipation. Our results highlight the performance and scalability potential of AQEC, marking an important step toward large-scale, universal quantum computing.</description>

      <title>A minimalist self-differencing gating scheme for dead-time-free single-photon avalanche diodes at high repetition rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gated quenched SPAD detectors are widely used in quantum communication and quantum computing setups employing high-repetition-rate lasers. Here, we present a novel scheme for high-repetition-rate (100 MHz) sine-wave gated SPADs, based on the self-differencing technique, which significantly simplifies previous designs while offering additional advantages. These include straightforward implementation, more precise control of the SPAD biasing, and an improved SNR. We implemented this approach using an InGaAs photodiode and characterized it experimentally with 100 MHz attenuated laser pulses, measuring quantum efficiency, dark count rate, and afterpulsing behavior. Importantly, we demonstrate that the detector recovers full quantum efficiency in less than one pulse-repetition period after a detection event, enabling continuous operation at 100 MHz, which, in principle, could reach the GHz regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In non-degenerate SU(1,1) interferometers, beam splitters are replaced by two-mode squeezers, enabling sub-shot-noise sensitivity without input squeezing and robustness to detection losses by quantum entanglement. We propose a hybrid implementation in optomechanics where one "arm" is a mechanical mode undergoing two consecutive, mode-matched interactions with a traveling optical field (constituting the other arm). Such engineered interactions allow for sub-shot-noise phase detection even in the presence of mechanical thermal noise and optical losses, advancing precision interferometry in hybrid systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attempts to treat time on an equivalent footing with space in quantum mechanics have been apparently dominated by `timeless' approaches, such as the one of Page and Wootters, which allow meaningful discussion of a `time operator'. However, there is an alternative, and significantly less studied approach, due to Bauer, which makes use of the `pseudospin' extension of the state space, effectively adding a backwards-time degree of freedom. This two-time approach allows definition of a `time operator' and moreover bears interesting relations with other time-symmetric formulations of quantum mechanics. We review and compare these approaches to quantum time, emphasizing that there is a subtle choice between the timeless framework and the two-time approach. Finally, we sketch a framework in which the timeless philosophy can be combined with two-time quantum mechanics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Verifiable One-Time Programs (Ver-OTPs) and use them to construct single-round Open Secure Computation (OSC), a novel primitive enabling applications like (1) single-round sealed-bid auctions, (2) single-round and honest-majority atomic proposes -- a building block of consensus protocols, and (3) single-round differentially private statistical aggregation without pre-registration. First, we construct Ver-OTPs from single-qubit states and classical cryptographic primitives. Then, assuming a multi-key homomorphic scheme (MHE) with certain properties, we use Ver-OTPs with MHE to construct OSC. The underlying quantum requirement is minimal: only single-qubit states are needed alongside a hardware assumption on the receiver's quantum resources. Our work therefore provides a new framework for quantum-assisted cryptography that may be implementable with near-term quantum technology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of emerging technologies in quantum optics demands accurate models that faithfully capture genuine quantum effects. Mature semiclassical approaches reach their limits when confronted with quantized electromagnetic fields, while full Hilbert space treatments are often computationally prohibitive. To address these challenges, we develop a framework based on coupled stochastic processes with a common cross-covariance structure that can be easily coupled to various types of Maxwell solvers. Our approach accounts for the non-commutativity in the quantum-to-classical transition in a natural way, and has the ability to capture quantum optical signatures while retaining compatibility with classical electromagnetics. For benchmarking, we compare our simulation results with experimental emission spectra of a strongly driven InGaAs quantum dot, finding excellent agreement. Our results highlight the potential of tailored stochastic processes for simulating non-classical light in complex photonic environments.</description>

      <title>Decoding quantum low density parity check codes with diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An efficient decoder is essential for quantum error correction, and data-driven neural decoders have emerged as promising, flexible solutions. Here, we introduce a diffusion model framework to infer logical errors from syndrome measurements in quantum low-density parity-check codes. Using the bivariate bicycle code with realistic circuit-level noise, we show that masked diffusion decoders are more accurate, often faster on average, and always faster in the worst case than other state-of-the-art decoders, including belief propagation with ordered statistics decoding (BP-OSD) and autoregressive neural decoders. We show that by using fewer diffusion steps during inference one can gain significant speed at minimal cost in accuracy. By examining the factored attention from our trained neural network we find that, despite being trained solely on paired samples of syndrome-logical errors, this diffusion decoder learns the structure of the quantum codes. We also compare both masked and continuous diffusion decoders on code-capacity noise models, finding that masked diffusion decoders scale better than continuous diffusion decoders.</description>

Abstract: Classification using variational quantum circuits is a promising frontier in quantum machine learning. Quantum supervised learning (QSL) applied to classical data using variational quantum circuits involves embedding the data into a quantum Hilbert space and optimizing the circuit parameters to train the measurement process. In this context, the efficacy of QSL is inherently influenced by the selection of quantum embedding. In this study, we introduce a classical-quantum hybrid approach for optimizing quantum embedding beyond the limitations of the standard circuit model of quantum computation (i.e., completely positive and trace-preserving maps) for general multi-channel data. We benchmark the performance of various models in our framework using the CIFAR-10 and Tiny ImageNet datasets and provide theoretical analyses that guide model design and optimization.</description>

Abstract: Estimating a classical parameter encoded in the Hamiltonian of a quantum probe is a fundamental and well-understood task in quantum metrology. A textbook example is the estimation of a classical field's amplitude using a two-level probe, as described by the semi-classical Rabi model. In this work, we explore the fully quantum analogue, where the amplitude of a coherent quantized field is estimated by letting it interact with a two-level atom. For both metrological scenarios, we focus on the quantum Fisher information (QFI) of the reduced state of the atomic probe. In the semi-classical Rabi model, the QFI is independent of the field amplitude and grows quadratically with the interaction time $\tau$. In contrast, when the atom interacts with a single coherent mode of the field, the QFI is bounded by 4, a constant dictated by the non-orthogonality of coherent states. We find that this bound can only be approached in the vacuum limit. In the limit of large amplitude $\alpha$, the QFI is found to attain its maximal value $1.47$ at $\tau =O(1)$ and $\tau =O(\alpha^2)$, and also shows periodic revivals at much later times. When the atom interacts with a sequence of coherent states, the QFI can increase with time but is bounded to scale linearly due to the production of entanglement between the atom and the radiation (back-action), except in the limit where the number of modes and their total energy diverge. Finally, in the continuous limit, where the atom interacts with many weak coherent states, this back-action can be simply interpreted as spontaneous emission, giving rise to the optimal interaction time and QFI rate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove three structural impossibility results demonstrating that fuzzy metric spaces cannot capture essential features of quantum state geometry. First, we show they cannot model destructive interference between concepts due to phase insensitivity. Second, we prove there is no distance-preserving embedding from quantum state space into any fuzzy metric space. Third, we establish that fuzzy logic cannot distinguish symmetric from antisymmetric concept combinations -- a fundamental limitation for modeling structured knowledge. These theorems collectively show that fuzzy frameworks are structurally incapable of representing intrinsic uncertainty, where quantum mechanics provides a superior, geometrically coherent alternative.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical systems appear in nearly every aspect of the physical world. As such, understanding the properties of dynamical systems is of great importance. Typically, a dynamical system is described by a system of ordinary differential equations (ODE). Most ODEs do not admit analytical solutions, which makes dynamical systems challenging to understand. In this work, we introduce a quantum framework for determining certain properties of dynamical systems. We combine many recent advances in quantum algorithms, particularly quantum ODE solver and quantum topological data analysis. Leveraging the prior results regarding the quantum ODE solvers, we use the output of these quantum algorithms as a means to build the graph associated with the trajectory of the dynamical system in the phase space. This graph information is then fed into existing quantum TDA algorithms, respectively, to obtain the (normalized) Betti numbers, which are the topological signatures. We then discuss how such signatures can be linked to the properties of a given ODE, and thus, they can reveal insight towards the original dynamical systems. As a by-product, our work provides an affirmative answer to the applicability of quantum ODE solvers, showing that the quantum state as output can be valuable for useful purposes.</description>

      <title>Photons do not see entanglement (Entanglement, nonlocality, and the collapse of the wavefunction)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The idea behind entanglement is counterintuitive to any classical viewpoint of physical realism. An entangled state is a nonlocal superposition of realities that belong to a physical system. The common test of such a state has been done through Bell measurements. In this work, we attempt to look at this notion from a different perspective. We study the evolution of the orbital angular momentum (OAM) entanglement in inertia reference frames under a Lorentz boost. We consider two specific motions for the observers of the entanglement. First, we consider observers with zero relative motion (Zero-RM). Second, we choose to have a non-zero relative motion (Non-Zero RM) for them. In the second case, we distinguish between observer's perspective of the amplitude probability from the perspective of rest (Non-Zero RM1) and moving (Non-Zero RM2) observers. As a result, the transition probability amplitudes are altered. We observe that entanglement undergoes significant changes and is not preserved maximally from the viewpoint of the stationary observers at the rest frame and asymptotically approaches a minimum close to the light cone (LC). However, from the viewpoint of moving observer in the Non-Zero RM2, entanglement will not survive, and the final state is separable. This is an extremely important observation since the concept of entanglement is supposed to be non-local, and therefore free from any spacetime transformation. Our results demonstrated through the entanglement metrics such as entanglement entropy and purity show that an entangled state is not non-local and hence the so-called collapse of the wavefunction in quantum mechanics does not occur spontaneously in spacetime. Ironically, even entanglement is influenced by motion. Finally, based on this study, one can predict that photons do not carry OAM fundamentally and this property is only emergent at the light-matter interaction limit.</description>

      <title>Feature- and process-based optimal control of quantum dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preparing desired quantum states and quantum operations (processes) is essential for numerous tasks in quantum computation. Several approaches have been developed for optimal control of quantum states, whereas optimal strategies for preparation of a given quantum process have remained fairly less explored. For some applications, rather than a specific desired state or process, it may suffice to obtain states or processes with specific desired features such as (high) coherence or purity. In such cases, fidelity-based measures alone are inadequate for evaluating the performance of a quantum control strategy, and hence proper feature-based figures of merit should be employed. Here we develop a feature-based optimal coherent control formalism for open quantum processes under Markovian evolutions which demonstrate high coherence and purity features. In particular, we observe that performance of the feature-based Krotov optimization algorithm can be improved by choosing educated initial guess fields. In addition, in a model for a qutrit Rydberg system, it is shown that the convex overlap-based fidelity outperforms other process-based as well as state-based fidelities. This analysis underscores the utility of feature-based optimal control strategies for quantum processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Harmonizing classical and quantum worlds is a major challenge for modern physics. A significant portion of the scientific community supports the notion that classical mechanics is an effective theory that arises from quantum mechanics. Recently, the present authors have argued that this should not be the case, as quantum mechanics is not trustworthy for describing the center of mass of systems with masses $m$ much larger than the Planck mass $M_\text{P}$. In this vein, a simple gravitational self-decoherence model was proposed, describing how the center of mass of quantum systems would classicalize for $m \sim M_\text{P}$. Here, we show that our model does not prevent macroscopic systems (with classical centers of mass) from harboring quantum internal vibrations (as has been observed in the laboratory).</description>

      <title>Two classes of quantum spin systems that are gapped on any bounded-degree graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study translation-invariant quantum spin Hamiltonians on general graphs with non-commuting interactions either given by (i) a random rank-$1$ projection or (ii) Haar projectors. For (i), we prove that the Hamiltonian is gapped on any bounded-degree graph with high probability at large local dimension. For (ii), we obtain a gap for sufficiently large local dimension. Our results provide examples where the folklore belief that typical translation-invariant Hamiltonians are gapped can be proved, which extends a result by Bravyi and Gosset from 1D qubit chains with rank-$1$ interactions to general bounded-degree graphs. We derive the gaps by analytically verifying generalized Knabe-type finite-size criteria that apply to any bounded-degree graph.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Algorithm for Nonlinear Electromagnetic Fluid Dynamics via Koopman-von Neumann Linearization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To simulate plasma phenomena, large-scale computational resources have been employed in developing high-precision and high-resolution plasma simulations. One of the main obstacles in plasma simulations is the requirement of computational resources that scale polynomially with the number of spatial grids, which poses a significant challenge for large-scale modeling. To address this issue, this study presents a quantum algorithm for simulating the nonlinear electromagnetic fluid dynamics that govern space plasmas. We map it, by applying Koopman-von Neumann linearization, to the Schr\"{o}dinger equation and evolve the system using Hamiltonian simulation via quantum singular value transformation. Our algorithm scales $O \left(s N_x \, \mathrm{polylog} \left( N_x \right) T \right)$ in time complexity with $s$, $N_x$, and $T$ being the spatial dimension, the number of spatial grid points per dimension, and the evolution time, respectively. Comparing the scaling $O \left( s N_x^s \left(T^{5/4}+T N_x\right) \right)$ for the classical method with the finite volume scheme, this algorithm achieves polynomial speedup in $N_x$. The space complexity of this algorithm is exponentially reduced from $O\left( s N_x^s \right)$ to $O\left( s \, \mathrm{polylog} \left( N_x \right) \right)$. Numerical experiments validate that accurate solutions are attainable with smaller $m$ than theoretically anticipated and with practical values of $m$ and $R$, underscoring the feasibility of the approach. As a practical demonstration, the method accurately reproduces the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, underscoring its capability to tackle more intricate nonlinear dynamics. These results suggest that quantum computing can offer a viable pathway to overcome the computational barriers of multiscale plasma modeling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the ever-growing field of quantum information processing, large-scale, efficient multi-port interferometers serving as photonic processors are required. In this context, the suitability of quantum walks as the interferometric base for universal computation has been theoretically proven. In this work, we bridge the gap between theoretical proposals and state-of-the-art experimental capabilities by providing the recipe for the implementation of a universal photonic processor in discrete-time quantum walks. Specifically, we present the protocol how to translate arbitrary linear transformations into the coin and step operator of a quantum walk and map these to the experimental parameters of the established time-multiplexed platform. We show that our interface is highly scalable and resource-efficient due to the hybrid encoding consisting of multiple degrees of freedom. Finally, we prove that our system is highly resilient against experimental imperfections and show that it compares favorably against existing architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on advances in topological photonics and computational optimization, we inversedesign a periodic dielectric structure surrounding a chain of interacting qubits, emulating an extended, dimerized Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) excitonic model. Our approach enables precise control over photon-mediated interactions, allowing us to explore the emergence of topological edge states in the qubit chain. By systematically tuning structural parameters to address both coherent evolution and dissipative effects, we demonstrate that edge states remain robust and isolated from the bulk, even in the presence of long-range coupling and disorder, and preserving key topological properties despite deviations from complete chiral symmetry preservation. This work highlights the potential of inverse design in stabilizing topological excitonic states, opening new possibilities for advanced quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>ConQuER: Modular Architectures for Control and Bias Mitigation in IQP Quantum Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum generative models based on instantaneous quantum polynomial (IQP) circuits show great promise in learning complex distributions while maintaining classical trainability. However, current implementations suffer from two key limitations: lack of controllability over generated outputs and severe generation bias towards certain expected patterns. We present a Controllable Quantum Generative Framework, ConQuER, which addresses both challenges through a modular circuit architecture. ConQuER embeds a lightweight controller circuit that can be directly combined with pre-trained IQP circuits to precisely control the output distribution without full retraining. Leveraging the advantages of IQP, our scheme enables precise control over properties such as the Hamming Weight distribution with minimal parameter and gate overhead. In addition, inspired by the controller design, we extend this modular approach through data-driven optimization to embed implicit control paths in the underlying IQP architecture, significantly reducing generation bias on structured datasets. ConQuER retains efficient classical training properties and high scalability. We experimentally validate ConQuER on multiple quantum state datasets, demonstrating its superior control accuracy and balanced generation performance, only with very low overhead cost over original IQP circuits. Our framework bridges the gap between the advantages of quantum computing and the practical needs of controllable generation modeling.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Quantum Simulation under Periodic and Dirichlet Boundary Conditions: A First-Quantised Framework for Near-Term Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new recipe for relativistic quantum simulation using the first quantisation approach, under periodic (PBC) and Dirichlet (DBC) boundary conditions. The wavefunction is discretised across a finite grid represented by system qubits, and the squared momentum operator is expressed using the finite-difference method based on quantum translation operations. The relativistic kinetic energy is approximated through a perturbative expansion of the total kinetic Hamiltonian, incorporating higher-order momentum terms. The approach would allow variational optimisation of appropriate ansatz states to estimate both non-relativistic and relativistic ground-state energies on a quantum computer. This work offers a practical route to simulating relativistic effects on near-term quantum devices, supporting future developments in quantum physics and chemistry.</description>

Abstract: We provide a systematic construction for local quantum circuits hosting free fermions in disguise, both with staircase and brickwork architectures. Similar to the original Hamiltonian model introduced by Fendley, these circuits are defined by the fact that the Floquet operator corresponding to a single time step can not be diagonalized by means of any Jordan-Wigner transformation, but still displays a free-fermionic spectrum. Our construction makes use of suitable non-local transfer matrices commuting with the Floquet operator, allowing us to establish the free fermionic spectrum. We also study the dynamics of these circuits after they are initialized in arbitrary product states, proving that the evolution of certain local observables can be simulated efficiently on classical computers. Our work proves recent conjectures in the literature and raises new questions on the classical simulability of free fermions in disguise.</description>

      <title>Solving Currency Arbitrage Problems using D-Wave Advantage2 Quantum Annealer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum annealing has emerged as a powerful tool for solving combinatorial optimization problems efficiently, making use of the principles of quantum mechanics. Companies are increasingly investing in the market of quantum computers, providing the users with the possibility to solve these optimization problems by resorting to quantum computers. This paper explores how Quantum Annealing can be applied to the Currency Arbitrage (CA) optimization problem and its comparative performance against classical methods. A key contribution of the work is an original formulation of the CA problem as a QUBO (Quadratic Unconstrained Boolean Optimization) problem. We test the speed of D-wave quantum annealer, using the recently released latest version (Advantage 2).</description>

      <title>Quantum Measurement Trees, I: Two Preliminary Examples of Induced Contextual Boolean Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum randomness evidently transcends the classical framework of random variables defined on a single comprehensive Kolmogorov probability space. One prominent example is the quantum double-slit experiment due to Feynman (1951, 1966). A related non-quantum example, inspired by Boole (1862) and Vorob$'$ev (1962), has three two-valued random variables $X$, $Y$ and $Z$, where the pairs $X, Y$ and $X, Z$ are perfectly correlated, yet $Y, Z$ are perfectly anti-correlated. Such examples can be accommodated using a ``multi-measurable'' space with several different $ \sigma $-algebras of measurable events. This concept due to Vorob$'$ev (1962) allows construction of: 1) a measurable meta\-space whose elements combine a point in the original sample space with a variable ``contextual'' Boolean algebra; 2) a parametric family of probability meta\-spaces, each of which is a Kolmogorov probability space that represents a two-stage stochastic process where a random choice from the original sample space is preceded by the random choice of a contextual Boolean algebra in the multi-measurable space. Subsequent work will explore how quantum experimental results can be described using a quantum measurement tree with one or more preparation nodes where an experimental configuration is determined that governs the probability distribution of relevant quantum observables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate open quantum Brownian motions as quantum analogues of classical diffusion processes under interaction with an external enviroment. Building upon the microscopic derivation by Sinayskiy and Petruccione [20], we revisit the associated master equation and study its formulation as a generalized parabolic system. Employing Fourier transform methods, we derive exact analytical solutions for one-dimensional evolutions of particles with two-level internal degree of freedom.</description>

      <title>Quantum Measurement Trees, II: Quantum Observables as Ortho-Measurable Functions and Density Matrices as Ortho-Probability Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a quantum state in the finite-dimensional Hilbert space $ \C^n $, the range of possible values of a quantum observable is usually identified with the discrete spectrum of eigenvalues of a corresponding Hermitian matrix. Here any such observable is identified with: (i) an ``ortho-measurable'' function defined on the Boolean ``ortho-algebra'' generated by the eigenspaces that form an orthogonal decomposition of $ \C^n $; (ii) a ``numerically identified'' orthogonal decomposition of $ \C^n $. The latter means that each subspace of the orthogonal decomposition can be uniquely identified by its own attached real number, just as each eigenspace of a Hermitian matrix can be uniquely identified by the corresponding eigenvalue. Furthermore, any density matrix on $ \C^n $ is identified with a Bayesian prior ``ortho-probability'' measure defined on the linear subspaces that make up the Boolean ortho-algebra induced by its eigenspaces. Then any pure quantum state is identified with a degenerate density matrix, and any mixed state with a probability measure on a set of orthogonal pure states. Finally, given any quantum observable, the relevant Bayesian posterior probabilities of measured outcomes can be found by the usual trace formula that extends Born's rule.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional quantum Schur transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum Schur transform has become a foundational quantum algorithm, yet even after two decades since the seminal 2005 paper by Bacon, Chuang, and Harrow (BCH), some aspects of the transform remain insufficiently understood. Moreover, an alternative approach proposed by Krovi in 2018 was recently found to contain a crucial error. In this paper, we present a corrected version of Krovi's algorithm along with a detailed treatment of the high-dimensional version of the BCH Schur transform. This high-dimensional focus makes the two versions of the transform practical for regimes where the number of qudits $n$ is smaller than the local dimension $d$, with Krovi's algorithm scaling as $\widetilde{O}(n^4)$ and BCH as $\widetilde{O}(\min(n^5,nd^4))$. Our work addresses a key gap in the literature, strengthening the algorithmic foundations of a wide range of results that rely on Schur--Weyl duality in quantum information theory and quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Dimer-driven multiple reentrant localization with composite potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21338v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have revealed reentrant localization transitions in quasi-periodic one-dimensional lattices, where the competition between dimerized hopping and staggered disorder plays a central role. Yet the extent to which such reentrant localization persists under more general conditions, such as additional periodic potentials, modified quasi-periodic modulations remains unclear. Here we investigate localization phenomena in a one-dimensional lattice subject to a periodic potential and an additional quasi-periodic modulation. Using both eigenstate-based indicators and experimentally accessible dynamical observables, we identify robust reentrant, or multiple, localization transitions. We show that these transitions are uniquely stabilized by the dimer structure of the unit cell, where the competition between the onsite periodic potential and the quasi-periodic modulation becomes most pronounced. By systematically varying the periodicity parameter $\alpha$ and the quasi-periodic frequency $\beta$, we find that the robust multiple reentrant localization behavior disappears for any deviation from the dimer configuration, confirming its essential role. Our results suggest that the interplay between these competing factors drives the multiple reentrant localization transitions.</description>

      <title>Transfer tensor analysis of localization in the Anderson and Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the transfer tensor method to analyze localization and transport in simple disordered systems, specifically the Anderson and Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper models. Emphasis is placed on the memory effects that emerge when ensemble-averaging over disorder, even when individual trajectories are strictly Markovian. We find that memory effects are necessary to remove fictitious terms that would correspond to redrawing static disorder at each time step, which would create a temporally uncorrelated dynamic disorder. Our results show that while eternal memory is a necessary condition for localization, it is not sufficient. We determine that signatures of localization and transport can be found within the transfer tensors themselves by defining a metric called "outgoing-pseudoflux". This work establishes connections between theoretical research on dynamical maps and Markovianity and localization phenomena in physically realizable model systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the coarse-graining of holographic quantum error correcting codes under a generalized notion of bulk renormalization-group flow. In particular, we study the renormalization under this flow of the $A/4G$ term in the Faulkner-Lewkowycz-Maldacena formula and in its R\'enyi generalization. This provides a general quantum code perspective on the arguments of Susskind and Uglum. Specifically, given a 'UV' code with two-sided recovery and appropriately flat entanglement spectrum together with a set of 'seed' states in the UV code, we explicitly construct an 'IR' code with corresponding properties which contains the given seed states and is of minimal size in a sense we describe.</description>

      <title>Critical dynamics and superconducting state preparation in the quenched Kitaev chain with pairing imbalance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamical balance of the pairing term plays a crucial role in the emergence of topological superconductivity in the p-wave spinless Kitaev chain, particularly in the non-Hermitian regime. In this work, we systematically investigate the effects of non-Hermitian pairing terms on both equilibrium and nonequilibrium phenomena in the Kitaev chain. Our analysis focuses on two representative forms of pairing imbalance: uniform and staggered. We demonstrate that a uniform imbalance induces only minor perturbations to the spectrum and dynamical properties, without significantly affecting its equilibrium phase or nonequilibrium steady behavior. In contrast, even a slight staggered imbalance leads to drastic changes. At the symmetry point, it enables the resonant generation of two distinct superconducting states through critical dynamics, with the realized state determined by the direction of the bias. Both states exhibit exact off-diagonal long-range order (ODLRO) in the thermodynamic limit. Our results emphasize the fragility of coherent dynamics in non-Hermitian topological systems and elucidate the interplay among non-Hermiticity, topology, and dynamical criticality in quench processes.</description>

      <title>Breaking $1/\epsilon$ Barrier in Quantum Zero-Sum Games: Generalizing Metric Subregularity for Spectraplexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long studied as a toy model, quantum zero-sum games have recently resurfaced as a canonical playground for modern areas such as non-local games, quantum interactive proofs, and quantum machine learning. In this simple yet fundamental setting, two competing quantum players send iteratively mixed quantum states to a referee, who performs a joint measurement to determine their payoffs. In 2025, Vasconcelos et al. [arXiv:2311.10859] connected quantum communication channels with a hierarchy of quantum optimization algorithms that generalize Matrix Multiplicative Weights Update ($\texttt{MMWU}$) through extra-gradient mechanisms, establishing an average-iterate convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon)$ iterations to $\epsilon$-Nash equilibria. While a long line of work has shown that bilinear games over polyhedral domains admit gradient methods with linear last-iterate convergence rates of $\mathcal{O}(\log(1/\epsilon))$, it has been conjectured that a fundamental performance gap must persist between quantum feasible sets (spectraplexes) and classical polyhedral sets (simplices). We resolve this conjecture in the negative. We prove that matrix variants of $\textit{Nesterov's iterative smoothing}$ ($\texttt{IterSmooth}$) and $\textit{Optimistic Gradient Descent-Ascent}$ ($\texttt{OGDA}$) achieve last-iterate convergence at a linear rate in quantum zero-sum games, thereby matching the classical polyhedral case. Our analysis relies on a new generalization of error bounds in semidefinite programming geometry, establishing that (SP-MS) holds for monotone operators over spectrahedra, despite their uncountably many extreme points. Finally, as a byproduct, we obtain an exponential speed-up over the classical Jain-Watrous [arXiv:0808.2775] method for parallel approximation of strictly positive semidefinite programs.</description>

      <title>Observation of resonant monopole-dipole energy transfer between Rydberg atoms and polar molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resonant energy transfer (RET), between equal parity 1s65s$^3\mathrm{S}_1$ and 1s66s$^3\mathrm{S}_1$ Rydberg levels in helium has been observed in low-temperature ($\sim80$ mK) collisions with ammonia molecules which undergo inversion transitions in their X$^1$A$_1$ ground electronic state. This hybrid Rydberg-atom polar-molecule RET represents a monopole-dipole energy exchange reaction that necessarily requires spatial overlap of the Rydberg-electron and molecular wavefunctions. Calculations, explicitly accounting for the charge-dipole interaction between the Rydberg electron and the molecular dipole, provide a quantitative explanation of the observations. Total parity is conserved in the reaction through the mixing of collisional angular momentum in the atom-molecule complex. This work opens opportunities to expand the toolbox of hybrid neutral-atom polar-molecule platforms for quantum science with charge-dipole mediated energy exchange.</description>

      <title>Smearing of dynamical quantum phase transitions in dissipative free-fermion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Lindblad dynamics of the reduced Loschmidt echo (RLE) in dissipative quadratic fermion systems. Focusing on the case of gain and loss dissipation, we derive general conditions for the persistence of nonanalyticities (so-called dynamical quantum phase transitions) in the time evolution of the RLE. We show that nonanalyticities that are present in the corresponding unitary dynamics can survive under purely gain or purely loss processes, but are completely smeared out as soon as both channels are active, even if one is infinitesimally small. These results hold for generic dissipative Gaussian evolutions, and are illustrated explicitly for the quench from the N\'eel state in the tight-binding chain, as well as for the quantum Ising chain. We also show that the subtle interplay between dissipative and unitary dynamics gives rise to a nested lightcone structure in the dynamics of the RLE, even in cases where this structure is not present in the corresponding unitary evolution, due to coherent cancellations in the phase structure of the wavefunction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relative entropy serves as a cornerstone concept in quantum information theory. In this work, we study relative entropy of random states from major generic state models of Hilbert-Schmidt and Bures-Hall ensembles. In particular, we derive exact yet explicit formulas of average relative entropy of two independent states of arbitrary dimensions from the same ensemble as well as from two different ensembles. One ingredient in obtaining the results is the observed factorization of ensemble averages after evaluating the required unitary integral. The derived exact formula in the case of Hilbert-Schmidt ensemble complements the work by Kudler-Flam (2021 Phys Rev Lett 126 171603), where the corresponding asymptotic formula for states of equal dimensions was obtained based on the replica method.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Hamiltonian for the massless Dirac field on a segment with an inhomogeneous background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the entanglement Hamiltonian of an interval for the massless Dirac field in an inhomogeneous background on a segment where the same boundary condition at both its endpoints is imposed, and in its ground state. We focus on a class of metrics that are Weyl equivalent to the flat metric through a Weyl factor that depends only on the spatial coordinate. The explicit form of the entanglement Hamiltonian is written as the sum of a local and a bilocal term. The weight function of the local term allows us to study a contour function for the entanglement entropies. For the model obtained from the continuum limit of the rainbow chain, the analytic expressions are compared with exact numerical results from the lattice, showing an excellent agreement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed study of the finite-size one-dimensional quantum XY chain in a transverse field in the presence of boundary fields coupled with the order-parameter spin operator. We consider fields located at the chain boundaries that have the same strength and that are oppositely aligned. We derive exact expressions for the gap $\Delta$ as a function of the model parameters for large values of the chain length $L$. These results allow us to characterize the nature of the ordered phases of the model. We find a magnetic (M) phase ($\Delta \sim e^{-aL}$), a magnetic-incommensurate (MI) phase ($\Delta \sim e^{-aL} f_{MI}(L)$), a kink (K) phase ($\Delta \sim L^{-2}$), and a kink-incommensurate (KI) phase ($\Delta \sim L^{-2} f_{KI}(L)$); $f_{MI}(L)$ and $f_{KI}(L)$ are bounded oscillating functions of $L$. We also analyze the behavior along the phase boundaries. In particular, we characterize the universal crossover behavior across the K-KI phase boundary. On this boundary, the dynamic critical exponent is $z=4$, i.e., $\Delta \sim L^{-4}$ for large values of $L$.</description>

      <title>Tunable optical lattices for the creation of matter-wave lattice solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present experimental techniques that employ an optical accordion lattice with dynamically tunable spacing to create and study bright matter-wave solitons in optical lattices. The system allows precise control of lattice parameters over a wide range of lattice spacings and depths. We detail calibration methods for the lattice parameters that are adjusted to the varying lattice spacing, and we demonstrate site-resolved atom number preparation via microwave addressing. Lattice solitons are generated through rapid quenches of the atomic interaction strength and the external trapping potential. We systematically optimize the quench parameters, such as duration and final scattering length, to maximize soliton stability. Our results provide insight into nonlinear matter-wave dynamics in discretized systems and establish a versatile platform for the controlled study of lattice solitons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the use of linear Paul traps as quantum sensors for detecting megahertz gravitational waves. Single-ion configurations exploit graviton-photon conversion in the presence of external magnetic fields, while two-ion systems use relative-motion excitations, which do not require magnets, to distinguish gravitational waves from axion dark matter. Furthermore, we show that entanglement of $N$ vibrational qubits enhances the signal probability by a factor of $N^2$, improving sensitivity beyond the standard quantum limit.</description>

      <title>Metric response of relative entropy: a universal indicator of quantum criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The information-geometric origin of fidelity susceptibility and its utility as a universal probe of quantum criticality in many-body settings have been widely discussed. Here we explore the metric response of quantum relative entropy (QRE), by tracing out all but $n$ adjacent sites from the ground state of spin chains of finite length $N$, as a parameter of the corresponding Hamiltonian is varied. The diagonal component of this metric defines a susceptibility of the QRE that diverges at quantum critical points (QCPs) in the thermodynamic limit. We study two spin-$1/2$ models as examples, namely the integrable transverse field Ising model (TFIM) and a non-integrable Ising chain with three-spin interactions. We demonstrate distinct scaling behaviors for the peak of the QRE susceptibility as a function of $N$: namely a square logarithmic divergence in TFIM and a power-law divergence in the non-integrable chain. This susceptibility encodes uncertainty of entanglement Hamiltonian gradients and is also directly connected to other information measures such as Petz-R\'enyi entropies. We further show that this susceptibility diverges even at finite $N$ if the subsystem size, $n$, exceeds a certain value when the Hamiltonian is tuned to its classical limits due to the rank of the RDMs being finite; unlike the divergence associated with the QCPs which require $N \rightarrow \infty$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a novel intuitionistic reconstruction of the foundations of physics has been primarily developed by Nicolas Gisin and Flavio Del Santo drawing on naturalism. Our goal in this paper is to examine and develop the philosophical background of their naturalistic intuitionism for physics in contrast with Brouwer's defense of his intuitionistic mathematics. To be exact, we propose a systematic rearticulation of Brouwer's so-called two acts of intuitionism to serve as the self-contained philosophical framework justifying naturalistic intuitionism in physics. This revision is accompanied by an investigation of the distinctive naturalistic treatment of some central intuitionistic topics, including logic, language, time, ontology, meaning, and truth.</description>

      <title>Quantum Chaos and Universal Trotterisation Behaviours in Digital Quantum Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2110.11113v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Digital quantum simulation (DQS) is one of the most promising paths for achieving first useful real-world applications for quantum processors. Yet even assuming rapid progress in device engineering and development of fault-tolerant quantum processors, algorithmic resource optimisation will long remain crucial to exploit their full power. Currently, Trotterisation provides state-of-the-art resource scaling. And recent theoretical studies of Trotterised Ising models suggest that even better performance than expected may be possible up to a distinct breakdown threshold in empirical performance. Here, we study multiple paradigmatic DQS models with experimentally realisable Trotterisations, and evidence the universality of a range of Trotterisation performance behaviours, including not only the threshold, but also new features in the pre-threshold regime that is most important for practical applications. In each model, we observe a distinct Trotterisation threshold shared across widely varying performance signatures; we further show that an onset of quantum chaotic dynamics causes the performance breakdown and is directly induced by digitisation errors. In the important pre-threshold regime, we are able to identify new distinct regimes displaying qualitatively different quasiperiodic performance behaviours, and show analytic behaviour for properly defined operational Trotter errors. Our results rely crucially on diverse new analytical tools, and provide a previously missing unified picture of Trotterisation behaviour across local observables, the global quantum state, and the full Trotterised unitary. This work provides new insights and tools for addressing important questions about the algorithm performance and underlying theoretical principles of sufficiently complex Trotterisation-based DQS, that will help in extracting maximum simulation power from future quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Estimating the entanglement of random multipartite quantum states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.11754v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Genuine multipartite entanglement of a given multipartite pure quantum state can be quantified through its geometric measure of entanglement, which, up to logarithms, is simply the maximum overlap of the corresponding unit tensor with product unit tensors, a quantity that is also known as the injective norm of the tensor. Our general goal in this work is to estimate this injective norm of randomly sampled tensors. To this end, we study and compare various algorithms, based either on the widely used alternating least squares method or on a novel normalized gradient descent approach, and suited to either symmetrized or non-symmetrized random tensors. We first benchmark their respective performances on the case of symmetrized real Gaussian tensors, whose asymptotic average injective norm is known analytically. Having established that our proposed normalized gradient descent algorithm generally performs best, we then use it to obtain numerical estimates for the average injective norm of complex Gaussian tensors (i.e., up to normalization, uniformly distributed multipartite pure quantum states), with or without permutation-invariance. We also estimate the average injective norm of random matrix product states constructed from Gaussian local tensors, with or without translation-invariance. All these results constitute the first numerical estimates on the amount of genuinely multipartite entanglement typically present in various models of random multipartite pure states. Finally, motivated by our numerical results, we posit two conjectures on the injective norms of random Gaussian tensors (real and complex) and Gaussian MPS in the asymptotic limit of the physical dimension.</description>

Abstract: We find that the m-separability and k-partite entanglement of a multipartite quantum system is correlated with quantum coherence of the same with respect to complete orthonormal bases, distinguishable under local operations and classical communication in certain partitions. In particular, we show that the geometric measure of m-inseparable entanglement of a multipartite quantum state is equal to the square of minimum fidelity-based quantum coherence of the state with respect to complete orthonormal bases, that are locally distinguishable in a partition into m-parties.</description>

Abstract: Continuous-time quantum walks (CTQWs) on dynamic graphs, referred to as dynamic CTQWs, are a recently introduced universal model of computation that offers a new paradigm in which to envision quantum algorithms. In this work we develop an algorithm that converts single-edge and self-loop dynamic CTQWs to the gate model of computation. We use this mapping to introduce an efficient sparse quantum state preparation framework based on dynamic CTQWs. Our approach utilizes combinatorics techniques such as minimal hitting sets, minimum spanning trees, and shortest Hamiltonian paths to reduce the number of controlled gates required to prepare sparse states. We show that our framework encompasses the current state of the art ancilla free sparse state preparation method by reformulating this method as a CTQW. This CTQW-based framework offers an alternative to the uniformly controlled rotation method used by Qiskit by requiring fewer CX gates when the target state has a polynomial number of non-zero amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Managing Classical Processing Requirements for Quantum Error Correction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17995v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-scale quantum computers promise transformative speedups, but their viability hinges on fast and reliable quantum error correction (QEC). At the center of QEC are decoders-classical algorithms running on hardware such as FPGAs, GPUs, or CPUs that must process error syndromes every microsecond to preserve fault-tolerance. Quantum processors, therefore, operate not in isolation, but as accelerators tightly coupled with power classical systems (conventional digital hardware like CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs that run alongside the quantum processor). A key challenge is that decoder demand fluctuates unpredictably: bursts of activity can require orders of magnitude more decoders than idle periods. Provisioning hardware for the worst case wastes resources, while provisioning for the average case risks catastrophic slowdowns. We show that this mismatch is a systems problem of capacity planning and scheduling, and propose a two-level framework that treats decoders as shared accelerators managed by the quantum operating system. Our approach reduces decoder requirements by 10-40% across fault-tolerant benchmarks, demonstrating that efficient decoder scheduling is essential to making FTQC practical.</description>

      <title>Generating quantum non-local entanglement with mechanical rotations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14276v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent experiments have searched for evidence of the impact of non-inertial motion on the entanglement of particles. The success of these endeavours has been hindered by the fact that such tests were performed within spatial scales that were only "local" when compared to the spatial scales over which the non-inertial motion was taking place. We propose a Sagnac-like interferometer that, by challenging such bottlenecks, is able to achieve entangled states through a mechanism induced by the mechanical rotation of a photonic interferometer. The resulting states violate the Bell-Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (Bell-CHSH) inequality all the way up to the Tsirelson bound, thus signalling strong quantum nonlocality. Furthermore, we show that the Bell-CHSH inequality remains violated even without using any form of post-selection up to the value $1+\sqrt{2}$. Our results demonstrate that mechanical rotation can be thought of as resource for controlling quantum non-locality with implications also for recent proposals for experiments that can probe the quantum nature of curved spacetimes and non-inertial motion.</description>

      <title>Solving Free Fermion Problems on a Quantum Computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04550v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulating noninteracting fermion systems is a common task in computational many-body physics. In absence of translational symmetries, modeling free fermions on $N$ modes usually requires poly$(N)$ computational resources. While often moderate, these costs can be prohibitive in practice when large systems are considered. We present several free-fermion problems that can be solved by a quantum algorithm with substantially reduced computational costs. The memory costs are exponentially improved, poly log$(N)$. The runtime improvement, compared to the best known classical algorithms, is either exponential or significantly polynomial, depending on the geometry of the problem. The simulation of free-fermion dynamics belongs to the BQP-hard complexity class. This implies (under standard assumptions) that our algorithm yields an exponential speedup for any classical algorithm at least for some geometries. The key technique in our algorithm is the block-encoding of objects such as correlation matrices and Green's functions into a unitary. We demonstrate how such unitaries can be efficiently realized as quantum circuits, in the context of dynamics and thermal states of tight-binding Hamiltonians. The special cases of disordered and inhomogeneous lattices, as well as large non-lattice graphs, are presented in detail. Finally, we show that our simulation algorithm generalizes to other promising targets, including free boson systems.</description>

      <title>Linear quantum systems: poles, zeros, invertibility and sensitivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The non-commutative nature of quantum mechanics imposes fundamental constraints on system dynamics, which, in the linear realm, are manifested through the physical realizability conditions on system matrices. These restrictions give system matrices a unique structure. This paper aims to study this structure by investigating the zeros and poles of linear quantum systems. Firstly, it is shown that $-s_0$ is a transmission zero if and only if $s_0$ is a pole of the transfer function, and $-s_0$ is an invariant zero if and only if $s_0$ is an eigenvalue of the $A$-matrix, of a linear quantum system. Moreover, $s_0$ is an output-decoupling zero if and only if $-s_0$ is an input-decoupling zero. Secondly, based on these pole-zero correspondences and inspired by a recent work on the stable inversion of classical linear systems \cite{DD2023}, we show that a linear quantum system must be Hurwitz unstable if it is strongly asymptotically left invertible. Two types of stable input observers are constructed for unstable linear quantum systems. Finally, the sensitivity of a coherent feedback network is investigated; in particular, the fundamental tradeoff between ideal squeezing and system robustness is studied on the basis of system sensitivity analysis.</description>

      <title>Gate-Based Initialization and Fidelity in Correlated Open Quantum Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06292v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a minimal and general framework for initializing open quantum systems via gate operations, treating system-bath correlations and control dynamics on equal footing. Our protocol simulates thermal equilibration followed by a gate pulse, modeled using a time-dependent Bloch-Redfield equation accurate to second order in coherence. After the gate, the system exhibits hybrid dynamics: populations evolve Markovianly, while coherences dephase as if the system were initially factorized. In fast, strongly dephasing regimes, initial system-bath correlations can revive coherence. Gate fidelities reveal spin-echo-like suppression of errors near $2\pi$ rotations, indicating an intrinsic mechanism for error cancellation. The approach is efficient and broadly applicable to both quantum devices and molecular complexes. Applications include fidelity optimization with respect to bath correlation times and coherence tracking in systems such as the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex. Our results show that long-lived excitonic coherences can arise from strongly non-Markovian dynamics triggered by ultrafast pulses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have analyzed the dynamics of entanglement in dissipative fermionic and bosonic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) models and found that, when the decoherence channel preserves the chiral symmetry, they exhibit a revival of entanglement in a wide range of parameters. This behavior only emerges in the topological phase, with the visibility of the revival dropping to zero at the phase boundary. Furthermore, the revival acquires a universal character once the system size exceeds the localization length of the edge modes. Our findings indicate that the universal entanglement revival has its origin in the topological properties of the SSH model. These dynamical properties may be experimentally accessible, for example, using photonic quantum computers.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00497v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a method that generates ground-state ansatzes for quantum many-body systems which are both analytically tractable and accurate over wide parameter regimes. Our approach leverages a custom symbolic language to construct tensor network states (TNS) via an evolutionary algorithm. This language provides operations that allow the generated TNS to automatically scale with system size. Consequently, we can evaluate ansatz fitness for small systems, which is computationally efficient, while favouring structures that continue to perform well with increasing system size. This ensures that the ansatz captures robust features of the ground state structure. Remarkably, we find analytically tractable ansatzes with a degree of universality, which encode correlations, capture finite-size effects, accurately predict ground-state energies, and offer a good description of critical phenomena. We demonstrate this method on the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model (LMG) and the quantum transverse-field Ising model (TFIM), where the same ansatz was independently generated for both. The simple structure of the ansatz allows us to obtain exact expressions for the expectation values of local observables as well as for correlation functions. In addition, it permits symmetries that are broken in the ansatz to be restored, which provides a systematic means of improving the accuracy of the ansatz.</description>

      <title>An rf-SQUID-based traveling-wave parametric amplifier with -84 dBm input saturation power across more than one octave bandwidth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traveling-wave parametric amplifiers (TWPAs) have become an essential tool for the readout of quantum circuits and the search for dark matter. We report on the implementation of an rf-SQUID-based Josephson TWPA with an average saturation power of -84 dBm, while providing an average power gain of 20 dB from 3.5 to 8.5 GHz. This wide bandwidth is enabled by reducing the curvature of the dispersion in the signal band while suppressing detrimental mixing processes. With 2393 rf-SQUIDs our device has a comparable number of nonlinear elements, but achieves ten times higher saturation power than previous works, showing that using rf-SQUIDs results in a more favorable trade-off between device length and saturation power. Harnessing wideband characterization techniques we determine the TWPA's excess noise above the quantum limit to be 0.8 to 1.5 photons. In addition, we validate signal-to-noise ratio improvement as a practical measure for tuning the TWPA to minimize the total system noise, and demonstrate that its optimum does not coincide with the highest gain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonlocal correlations created in networks with multiple independent sources enable surprising phenomena in quantum information and quantum foundations. The presence of independent sources, however, makes the analysis of network nonlocality challenging, and even in the simplest nontrivial scenarios a complete characterization is lacking. In this work we study one of the simplest of these scenarios, namely that of distributions invariant under permutations of parties in the minimal triangle network, which features no inputs and binary outcomes. We perform an exhaustive search for triangle-local models, and from it we infer analytic expressions for the boundaries of the set of distributions that admit such models, which we conjecture to be all the tight Bell inequalities for the scenario. Armed with them and with improved outer approximations of the set, we provide insights on the existence of a classical-quantum gap in the triangle network with binary outcomes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The motion of a quantum particle in a one-dimensional periodic potential can be described in terms of Bloch wave packets. Like free-particle wave packets, they can propagate without attenuation. Here, we examine this similarity more closely by investigating whether Bloch wave packets can maintain a definite -- or nearly definite -- momentum direction, a property inherent to free-particle wave packets. This question is particularly relevant to the feasibility of using solid-state-based systems in the search for the first experimental realization of quantum backflow, a quantum interference effect in which a particle's probability density flows in a direction opposite to its momentum.</description>

      <title>Improving variational counterdiabatic driving with weighted actions and computer algebra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational counterdiabatic (CD) driving is a disciplined and widely used method to robustly control quantum many-body systems by mimicking adiabatic processes with high fidelity and reduced duration. Central to this technique is a universal structure of the adiabatic gauge potential (AGP) over a parameterized Hamiltonian. Here, we reveal that introducing a new degree of freedom into the theory of the AGP can significantly improve variational CD driving. Specifically, we find that the algebraic characterization of the AGP is not unique, and we exploit this non-uniqueness to develop the weighted variational method for deriving a refined driving protocol. This approach extends the conventional method in two aspects: it assigns customized weights to matrix elements relevant to specific problems, and it effectively incorporates nonlocal information. We also develop an efficient numerical algorithm to compute the refined driving protocol using computer algebra. Our framework is broadly applicable, as it can replace almost all previous uses of variational CD driving. We demonstrate its practicality by applying it to adiabatic evolution along the ground state of a parameterized Hamiltonian. This proposal outperforms the conventional method in terms of fidelity, as confirmed by extensive numerical simulations on quantum Ising models.</description>

      <title>A universal constraint for relaxation rates for quantum Markov generators: complete positivity and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relaxation rates are key characteristics of quantum processes, as they determine how quickly a quantum system thermalizes, equilibrates, decoheres, and dissipates. While they play a crucial role in theoretical analyses, relaxation rates are also often directly accessible through experimental measurements. Recently, it was shown that for quantum processes governed by Markovian semigroups, the relaxation rates satisfy a universal constraint: the maximal rate is upper-bounded by the sum of all rates divided by the dimension of the Hilbert space. This bound, initially conjectured a few years ago, was only recently proven using classical Lyapunov theory. In this work, we present a new, purely algebraic proof of this constraint. Remarkably, our approach is not only more direct but also allows for a natural generalization beyond completely positive semigroups. We show that complete positivity can be relaxed to 2-positivity without affecting the validity of the constraint. This reveals that the bound is more subtle than previously understood: 2-positivity is necessary, but even when further relaxed to Schwarz maps, a slightly weaker -- yet still non-trivial -- universal constraint still holds. Finally, we explore the connection between these bounds and the number of steady states in quantum processes, uncovering a deeper structure underlying their behavior.</description>

      <title>Quantum Complexity and Chaos in Many-Qudit Doped Clifford Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02127v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of quantum complexity and chaos in doped Clifford circuits acting on qudits of odd prime dimension $d$. Using doped Clifford Weingarten calculus and a replica tensor network formalism, we derive exact results and perform large-scale simulations in regimes challenging for tensor network and Pauli-based methods. We begin by analyzing generalized stabilizer entropies, computable magic monotones in many-qudit systems, and identify a dynamical phase transition in the doping rate, marking the breakdown of classical simulability and the onset of Haar-random behavior. The critical behavior is governed by the qudit dimension and the magic content of the non-Clifford gate. Using the qudit $T$-gate as a benchmark, we show that higher-dimensional qudits converge faster to Haar-typical stabilizer entropies. For qutrits ($d=3$), analytical predictions match numerics on brickwork circuits, showing that locality plays a limited role in magic spreading. We also examine anticoncentration and entanglement growth, showing that $O(\log N)$ non-Clifford gates suffice for approximating Haar expectation values to precision $\varepsilon$, and relate antiflatness measures to stabilizer entropies in qutrit systems. Finally, we analyze out-of-time-order correlators and show that a finite density of non-Clifford gates is needed to induce chaos, with a sharp transition fixed by the local dimension, twice that of the magic transition. Altogether, these results establish a unified framework for diagnosing complexity in doped Clifford circuits and deepen our understanding of resource theories in multiqudit systems.</description>

      <title>Orbit dimensions in linear and Gaussian quantum optics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In sub-universal quantum platforms such as linear or Gaussian quantum optics, quantum states can behave as different resources, in regard to the extent of their accessible state space (called their orbit) under the action of the restricted unitary group. We propose to study the dimension of a quantum state's orbit (as a manifold in the Hilbert space), a simple yet nontrivial topological property that can quantify "how many" states it can reach. As natural invariants under the group, these structural properties of orbits alone can also reveal fundamental impossibilities of enacting certain unitary transformations deterministically. We showcase a general and straightforward way to compute orbit dimensions (for states of finite support in the Fock basis) by leveraging the group's Lie algebra, and we study their genericity and robustness properties. We also propose approaches to efficiently evaluate orbit dimensions experimentally, using homodyne or heterodyne measurements for pure states or photon counters for general states. Besides, we highlight that the orbit dimension under the Gaussian unitary group serves a non-Gaussianity witness, which we expect to be universal for multimode pure states. While proven in the discrete variable setting (i.e. passive linear optics with an energy cutoff), the validity of our work in the continuous variable setting does rest on a technical conjecture which we do not prove.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As quantum computing matures and moves toward broader accessibility through cloud-based platforms, ensuring the authenticity and integrity of quantum computations becomes an urgent concern. In this work, we propose a strategy to leverage the byproducts of quantum error correction (QEC) to verify hardware identity and authenticate quantum computations for "free", without introducing any additional quantum computations or measurements. By treating syndrome measurements as a source of metadata, we embed verification seamlessly into standard QEC protocols and eliminate the need for separate challenge-response pairs. We validate our approach using multiple error-correcting codes, quantum states, and circuit compilation strategies on several generations of IBM quantum computers. Our classifiers achieve 99% accuracy with only 500 shots in distinguishing among five backends. Overall, we re-purpose the intrinsic overhead of error correction to be a mechanism for securing quantum computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient verification of multipartite quantum states is crucial to many applications in quantum information processing. By virtue of Schmidt decomposition and mutually unbiased bases, here we propose a universal protocol to verify arbitrary multipartite pure quantum states using adaptive local projective measurements. Moreover, we establish a universal upper bound on the sample complexity that is independent of the local dimensions. Numerical calculations further indicate that Haar-random pure states can be verified with a constant sample cost, irrespective of the qudit number and local dimensions, even in the adversarial scenario in which the source cannot be trusted. As alternatives, we provide several simpler variants that can achieve similar high efficiencies. The simplest variant consists of only two distinct tests.</description>

In this paper, we propose a new QND measurement scheme of the optical field quadratures based on the non-degenerate optical parametric amplifier.

      <description>arXiv:2507.18351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exploring potential empirical manifestations of quantum gravity is a challenging pursuit. In this study, we utilise a lattice representation of a (2+1)D massive gravity toy model interacting with Dirac fermions that can support specific spacetime fluctuations. We focus on the evolution of the fermion's spin due to its coupling to spacetime fluctuations. To monitor their dynamics a minimal model is required that comprises two bosonic modes describing spacetime geometry fluctuations coupled with the spin of the fermion. A possible emulation of this system involves encoding spin degrees of freedom in the electronic states of an atom coupled with a bimodal optical cavity that provides the two bosonic modes. The spin exhibits a variety of dynamical behaviours due to its coupling with the fluctuating geometry, with decoherence emerging as a key signature of this interaction. Our proposal introduces a novel approach for modelling the effect of interactions between quantum gravity and matter that can be probed with current technology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As quantum devices progress towards a quantum advantage regime, they become harder to benchmark. A particularly relevant challenge is to assess the quality of the whole computation, beyond testing the performance of each single operation. Here we introduce a scheme for this task that combines the target computation with variants of it, which, when averaged, allow for classically solvable correlation functions. Importantly, the variants exactly preserve the circuit architecture and depth, without simplifying the gates into a classically-simulable set. The method is based on replacing each gate by an ensemble of similar gates, which when averaged together form space-time channels [P. Kos and G. Styliaris, Quantum 7, 1020 (2023)]. We introduce explicit constructions for ensembles producing such channels, all applicable to arbitrary brickwork circuits, and provide a general recipe to find new ones through semidefinite programming. The resulting average computation retains important information about the original circuit and is able to detect noise beyond a Clifford benchmarking regime. Moreover, we provide evidence that estimating average-computation expectation values requires running only a limited number of different circuit realizations.</description>

Abstract: Krylov quantum diagonalization methods have emerged as a promising use case for quantum computers. However, many existing implementations rely on controlled operations, which pose challenges to near-term quantum hardware. We introduce a novel protocol, termed Krylov Time Reversal (KTR), that circumvents these bottlenecks by leveraging time-reversal symmetry in Hamiltonian evolution. Using symmetric time dynamics, we show that it is possible to recover real-valued Krylov matrix elements, which significantly reduces the circuit depth and enhances compatibility with shallow quantum architectures. We validate our method through numerical simulations on paradigmatic Hamiltonians exhibiting time-reversal symmetry, including the transverse-field Ising model and a lattice gauge theory, demonstrating accurate spectral estimation and favourable circuit constructions.</description>

Abstract: For two non-communicating parties, quantum theory can give rise to probability distributions of outcomes that no local classical model can reproduce without communication. However, in the case of two-dimensional systems ($d=2$), it is known that allowing a finite amount of classical communication to shared classical resources makes it possible to simulate these quantum correlations. Whether such a simulation remains possible in higher dimensions is still an open question. In this work, we identify the key features of the exact classical protocol in $d=2$, and use them to construct robust approximate protocols in higher dimensions. We assess their performance through a randomized numerical study based on the Total Variation Distance. Our approach exactly reproduces the quantum probability distributions for $d=2$, and performs very well compared to existing protocols for higher dimensions, being the most robust protocol in all cases studied. These results offer new insights into the analytical structure of classical protocols in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Interpreting quantum reference frame transformations through a simple example</title>

Abstract: Quantum reference frame transformations have been proposed to provide a means by which to translate descriptions of quantum systems relative to each other. At present, there are several differing frameworks for describing quantum reference frames, with concomitantly different transformation rules. Here, we investigate a simple example of three qubit systems with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry in order to analyze physical and conceptual distinctions between three contemporary approaches to quantum reference frames -- dubbed perspective-neutral, extra particle and operational. By constructing two three-qubit states that are indistinguishable by observables relative to one frame but are distinguishable by observables relative to another, we show that each of the three approaches provides a distinct transformation rule, which may be understood to reflect differing attitudes towards the global state and the information that can be accessed by each frame. This helps us to shed light on the operational meaning of each approach and the contexts in which they may be most naturally applied.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Exponential Mixed Frequency Growth through Frequency Selection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning research has expanded rapidly due to potential computational advantages over classical methods. Angle encoding has emerged as a popular choice as feature map (FM) for embedding classical data into quantum models due to its simplicity and natural generation of truncated Fourier series, providing universal function approximation capabilities. Efficient FMs within quantum circuits can exploit exponential scaling of Fourier frequencies, with multi-dimensional inputs introducing additional exponential growth through mixed-frequency terms. Despite this promising expressive capability, practical implementation faces significant challenges. Through controlled experiments with white-box target functions, we demonstrate that training failures can occur even when all relevant frequencies are theoretically accessible. We illustrate how two primary known causes lead to unsuccessful optimization: insufficient trainable parameters relative to the model's frequency content, and limitations imposed by the ansatz's dynamic lie algebra dimension, but also uncover an additional parameter burden: the necessity of controlling non-unique frequencies within the model. To address this, we propose near-zero weight initialization to suppress unnecessary duplicate frequencies. For target functions with a priori frequency knowledge, we introduce frequency selection as a practical solution that reduces parameter requirements and mitigates the exponential growth that would otherwise render problems intractable due to parameter insufficiency. Our frequency selection approach achieved near-optimal performance (median $R^2 \approx 0.95$) with 78\% of the parameters needed by the best standard approach in 10 randomly chosen target functions.</description>

      <title>Random Unitaries in Constant (Quantum) Time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11487v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Random unitaries are a central object of study in quantum information, with applications to quantum computation, quantum many-body physics, and quantum cryptography. Recent work has constructed unitary designs and pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) using $\Theta(\log \log n)$-depth unitary circuits with two-qubit gates.
  In this work, we show that unitary designs and PRUs can be efficiently constructed in several well-studied models of $\textit{constant-time}$ quantum computation (i.e., the time complexity on the quantum computer is independent of the system size). These models are constant-depth circuits augmented with certain nonlocal operations, such as (a) many-qubit TOFFOLI gates, (b) many-qubit FANOUT gates, or (c) mid-circuit measurements with classical feedforward control. Recent advances in quantum computing hardware suggest experimental feasibility of these models in the near future.
  Our results demonstrate that unitary designs and PRUs can be constructed in much weaker circuit models than previously thought. Furthermore, our construction of PRUs in constant-depth with many-qubit TOFFOLI gates shows that, under cryptographic assumptions, there is no polynomial-time learning algorithm for the circuit class $\mathsf{QAC}^0$. Finally, our results suggest a new approach towards proving that PARITY is not computable in $\mathsf{QAC}^0$, a long-standing question in quantum complexity theory.</description>

      <title>Fractional Orbital Angular Momentum as a Quantitative Measure of Wave-Particle Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In an earlier letter [Ducharme \textit{et al.} Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{126}, 134803 (2021)], a solution to the Dirac equation for a relativistic Gaussian electron beam showed that for a diverging beam the spin of each electron is the sum of fractional contributions from both the spin matrix and orbital angular momentum operators. It will be argued here that fractional orbital angular momentum (FOAM) is a measure of the wavelike character of a system such that fractional spin angular momentum (FSAM) as the complement of FOAM quantifies the system's particlelike character. Thus, diffraction splits the spin of a single particle into FOAM and FSAM as the double-slit experiment probabilistically splits it between distinguishable paths. Beyond diffraction it is shown Dirac equations for quantum bound systems have two alternate solutions - one wavelike and the other particlelike. The observable properties of the two solutions are identical except for the amount of FOAM in them. It is further shown that the quantity of FOAM is velocity dependent, indicating FOAM and FSAM are interrelated through Lorentz transformations. Overall, the implication being that the Dirac formalism has an intrinsic sense of the dualistic wave-particle nature of matter built into it.</description>

Abstract: We explore the analogy between following the motion of a reflected wave packet, and a quantum measurement of the spatial delay imposed on the particle by the scattering potential. It is shown that converting such delays into temporal durations can lead to "negative times", and best be avoided. It is also demonstrated that a "soft" potential can be replaced by superposition of hard walls. This representation is used for calculating the Goos-H\"anchen shift of a Gaussian beam incident on a potential step or a barrier at an oblique angle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of a lasing system that is driven by a current of bosonic (quasi-) particles via a dissipative three-mode mixing process. A semi-classical analysis of this system predicts distinct dynamical regimes, where both the cavity mode and the gain medium can undergo lasing transitions. Of particular interest is an intermediate self-pulsing phase that exhibits the characteristics of an excitable system and converts random input signals into separated, quasi-periodic pulses at the output. By performing exact Monte-Carlo simulations, we extend this analysis into the quantum regime and show that despite being dominated by huge bosonic particle number fluctuations, this effect of coherence resonance survives even for rather low average photon numbers. Our system thus represents a intriguing model for an excitable quantum many-body system with practical relevance for quantum detectors or autonomous quantum machines. As an illustration, we discuss the realization of this system with superconducting quantum circuits and its application as a number-resolved avalanche detector for microwave photons.</description>

      <title>How to simulate magic state cultivation with around $8$ Clifford terms on average</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08658v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building upon [arXiv:2509.01224], we present a sketch on how to simulate the non-Clifford $d=5$ magic state cultivation circuits [arXiv:2409.17595] with a sum of $\approx 8$ Clifford ZX-diagrams on average, at $0.1\%$ noise. Compared to a magic cat state stabiliser decomposition of all $53$ non-Clifford spiders ($6{,}377{,}292$ terms required), this is more than $7 \times 10^{5}$ times reduction in the number of terms. Our stabiliser decomposition has the advantage of representing the final non-Clifford state (in light of circuit errors) as a sum of Clifford ZX-diagrams. This will be useful in simulating the escape stage of magic state cultivation, where one needs to port the resultant state of cultivation into a larger Clifford circuit with many more qubits. Still, it's necessary to only track $\approx 8$ Clifford terms. Our result sheds light on the simulability of operationally relevant, high $T$-count quantum circuits with some internal structure.</description>

      <title>Optimal scheme for distributed quantum metrology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimal strategies for local quantum metrology -- including the preparation of optimal probe states, implementation of optimal control and measurement strategies, are well established. However, for distributed quantum metrology, where the goal is to estimate global properties of multiple spatially distributed parameters, the optimal scheme -- particularly the role of optimal control -- remains poorly understood. In this work, we address this challenge by developing optimal schemes for distributed quantum metrology that characterize the ultimate precision limits in distributed systems. We derive the optimal probe state, optimal control protocols, and measurement strategies in estimating a linear combination of $N$ independent unknown parameters coupled to $d$ networked sensors. Crucially, we prove that the optimal control operations can be implemented locally on each sensor, eliminating the need for non-local control operations across distant nodes. This result significantly reduces the complexity of implementing optimal strategies in distributed quantum metrology. To demonstrate the power of our framework, we apply it to several key scenarios.</description>

      <title>Classical and quantum chaotic synchronization in coupled dissipative time crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20922v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of two coherently coupled dissipative time crystals. In the classical mean-field limit of infinite spin length, we identify a regime of chaotic synchronization, marked by a positive largest Lyapunov exponent and a Pearson correlation coefficient close to one. At the boundary of this regime, the Pearson coefficient varies abruptly, marking a crossover between staggered and uniform $z$-magnetization. To address finite-size quantum dynamics, we employ a quantum-trajectory approach and study the trajectory-resolved expectations of subsystem $z$-magnetizations. Their histograms over time and trajectory realizations exhibit maxima that undergo a staggered-to-uniform crossover analogous to the classical one. In analogy with the classical case, we interpret this behavior as quantum chaotic synchronization, with dissipative quantum chaos evidenced by the steady-state density matrix exhibiting Gaussian Unitary Ensemble statistics. The locations of the classical and quantum crossover are consistent with each other, reflecting quantum-classical correspondence despite the noncommutativity of the infinite-spin and infinite-time limits and the impact of entanglement, quantified via the entanglement entropy between subsystems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00605v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum teleportation can be used to define a notion of parallel transport which characterizes the entanglement structure of a quantum state \cite{Czech:2018kvg}. This suggests one can formulate a gauge theory of entanglement. In \cite{Wong:2022mnv}, it was explained that measurement based quantum computation in one dimension can be understood in term of such a gauge theory (MBQC). In this work, we give an alternative formulation of this "entanglement gauge theory" as an extended topological field theory. This formulation gives a alternative perspective on the relation between the circuit model and MBQC. In addition, it provides an interpretation of MBQC in terms of the extended Hilbert space construction in gauge theories, in which the entanglement edge modes play the role of the logical qubit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose two distinct crosscap states for the two-dimensional (2D) Ising field theory. These two crosscap states, identifying Ising spins or dual spins (domain walls) at antipodal points, are shown to be related via the Kramers-Wannier duality transformation. We derive their Majorana free field representations and extend bosonization techniques to calculate correlation functions of the 2D Ising conformal field theory (CFT) with different crosscap boundaries. Away from criticality, we develop a conformal perturbation theory to calculate the Klein bottle entropy (norm-square of the crosscap overlap) as a universal scaling function [Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 151602 (2023)]. For the Ising field theory, our analytical results support the conjectured monotonicity of the Klein bottle entropy under relevant perturbations. The formalism provides a general framework for studying perturbed 2D CFTs on non-orientable manifolds.</description>

      <title>Two-dopant origin of competing stripe and pair formation in Hubbard and $t$-$J$ models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the physics of the two-dimensional Hubbard model is widely believed to be a key step in achieving a full understanding of high-$T_\mathrm{c}$ cuprate superconductors. In recent years, progress has been made by large-scale numerical simulations at finite doping and, on the other hand, by microscopic theories able to capture the physics of individual charge carriers. In this work, we study single pairs of dopants in a cylindrical system using the density-matrix renormalization group algorithm. We identify two coexisting charge configurations that couple to the spin environment in different ways: A tightly bound configuration featuring (next-)nearest-neighbor pairs and a stripe-like configuration of dopants on opposite sides of the cylinder, accompanied by a spin domain wall. Thus, we establish that the interplay between stripe order and uniform pairing, central to the models' phases at finite doping, has its origin at the single-pair level. By interpolating between the Hubbard and the related $t$-$J$ model, we are able to quantitatively understand discrepancies in the pairing properties of the two models through the three-site hopping term usually omitted from the $t$-$J$ Hamiltonian. This term is closely related to a next-nearest-neighbor tunneling $t'$, which we observe to upset the balance between the competing stripe and pair states on the two-dopant level.</description>

Abstract: We present a new computational framework combining coarse-graining techniques with bootstrap methods to study quantum many-body systems. The method efficiently computes rigorous upper and lower bounds on both zero- and finite-temperature expectation values of any local observables of infinite quantum spin chains. This is achieved by using tensor networks to coarse-grain bootstrap constraints, including positivity, translation invariance, equations of motion, and energy-entropy balance inequalities. Coarse-graining allows access to constraints from significantly larger subsystems than previously possible, yielding substantially tighter bounds compared to earlier methods.</description>

Abstract: We show that a spinor traveling along a one-dimensional helical path develops a spin-orbit coupling as a result of the curvature of the path. We estimate the magnitude of the associated spin polarization and obtain values typical of many helical molecular structures that showcase the Chirality-induced Spin Selectivity (CISS) effect. We find that this chirality-induced spin-orbit coupling ($\chi$-SOC), in conjunction with broken time-reversal symmetry, may be an important ingredient for the microscopic underpinning of the CISS phenomenon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20328v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the transition rate of an Unruh-DeWitt detector coupled to a non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) of a free massless scalar field on four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. Bringing two semi-infinite heat baths at different temperatures into thermal contact along a surface, the NESS arises at asymptotically late times as a stationary state that has modewise thermal properties and features a heat flow between the reservoirs. The detector couples linearly to the field by a monopole interaction, and it moves inertially along the axis of the NESS heat flow. We contrast the transition rate with the case of a detector that is coupled to an inertial thermal equilibrium state. The results illustrate that the monopole does not couple to the heat flow, causing the detector to only register kinematical effects. Hence dynamical features of the NESS are hidden from this detector model.</description>

      <title>Hole spin splitting in a Ge quantum dot with finite barriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the low-energy spectrum of a single hole confined in a planar Ge quantum dot (QD) within the effective-mass formalism. The QD is sandwiched between two GeSi barriers of finite potential height grown along the [001] direction. To treat this finite barrier problem, we adopt an independent-band approach in dealing with boundary conditions. The effects of different system parameters are investigated, including the width of the out-of-plane confining well, the size of the dot, and silicon concentration in the confining layers. The more accurate finite-barrier model results in the non-negligible dependence of the anisotropic $g$-factor on the choice of boundary conditions and on the silicon concentration in the barrier. Furthermore, while the ideal model of a planar dot with a square-well heterostructure already has an intrinsic spin-orbit coupling, realistic effects arising from the experimental setup may give rise to additional contributions. We investigate the impact from the top-gate electric field and the residual tensile strain on the qubit states. The results indicate that these effects are important contributions to the total spin-orbit coupling which enables fast electric control.</description>

      <title>Constrained Search in Imaginary Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05332v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an imaginary-time evolution method to evaluate the pure-state constrained-search functional from density-functional theory formulated on finite lattices. Simultaneously, it yields a potential that produces a prescribed density of an eigenstate. Besides being a computational scheme, this allows one to gain theoretical insights into the density-potential mapping. The method can be generalized to the optimization of the expectation value of a general self-adjoint operator on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space under a finite number of expectation-value constraints for commuting self-adjoint operators.</description>

      <title>Correlators in phase-ordering from Schr\"odinger-invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Systems undergoing phase-ordering kinetics after a quench into the ordered phase with $0&lt;T&lt;T_c$ from a fully disordered initial state and with a non-conserved order-parameter have the dynamical exponent ${z}=2$. The long-time behaviour of their single-time and two-time correlators, determined by the noisy initial conditions, is derived from Schr\"odinger-invariance and we show that the generic ageing scaling forms of the correlators follow from the Schr\"odinger covariance of the four-point response functions. The autocorrelation exponent $\lambda$ is related to the passage exponent $\zeta_p$ which describes the time-scale for the cross-over into the ageing regime. Both Porod's law and the bounds $d/2 \leq \lambda \leq d$ are reproduced in a simple way. The dynamical scaling in fully finite systems and of global correlators is found and the low-temperature generalisation $\lambda= d-2\Theta$ of the Janssen-Schaub-Schmittmann scaling relation is derived.</description>

      <title>Emergent Inductance from Chiral Orbital Currents in a Bulk Ferrimagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05492v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a new form of inductance in the bulk ferrimagnet Mn3Si2Te6, which features strong spin-orbit coupling, large magnetic anisotropy, and pronounced magnetoelastic interactions. Below its Curie temperature, Mn3Si2Te6 hosts chiral orbital currents (COC) that circulate within the crystal lattice and give rise to collective electronic behavior [1]. By applying a magnetic field along the hard c axis and driving the system with low-frequency currents, we uncover a giant inductive response up to millihenry scale, originating from first-order reconfigurations of COC domains. These domains act as coherent mesoscopic inductive elements that resist reversal upon current reduction, producing a large electromotive force and sharply increasing voltage. This emergent inductance defies classical models, occurs without superconductivity or engineered nanostructures, and opens a new frontier in orbital-based quantum functionality and device concepts.</description>

      <title>On the Quantization of the Electromagnetic Field with Magnetic Monopoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17284v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a covariant framework for the quantization of the electromagnetic field in the presence of magnetic monopoles. Building on the two-potential formalism of Cabibbo and Ferrari, which treats electric and magnetic sources on equal footing and reveals a $U(1) \times U(1)$ gauge symmetry, we extend the theory into the quantum domain. Using the Gupta-Bleuler procedure in the Feynman-'t Hooft gauge, we construct the physical Hilbert space and eliminate negative-norm states. The resulting theory predicts, in addition to conventional photons, the existence of dual photons associated with magnetic charges. We discuss the role of these dual excitations and their possible relevance in the broader context of electromagnetic duality and gauge theories.</description>

      <title>A Verified Compiler for Quantum Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18583v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hamiltonian simulation is a central application of quantum computing, with significant potential in modeling physical systems and solving complex optimization problems. Existing compilers for such simulations typically focus on low-level representations based on Pauli operators, limiting programmability and offering no formal guarantees of correctness across the compilation pipeline. We introduce QBlue, a high-level, formally verified framework for compiling Hamiltonian simulations. QBlue is based on the formalism of second quantization, which provides a natural and expressive way to describe quantum particle systems using creation and annihilation operators. To ensure safety and correctness, QBlue includes a type system that tracks particle types and enforces Hermitian structure. The framework supports compilation to both digital and analog quantum circuits and captures multiple layers of semantics, from static constraints to dynamic evolution. All components of QBlue, including its language design, type system, and compilation correctness, are fully mechanized in the Rocq proof framework, making it the first end-to-end verified compiler for second-quantized Hamiltonian simulation.</description>
