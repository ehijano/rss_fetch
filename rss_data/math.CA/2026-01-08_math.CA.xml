      <title>On Constructions of full-dimensional absolutely normal sets of uniqueness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a class of homogeneous Cantor-Moran measures with all contraction ratios being reciprocal of integers, and prove that they are pointwise absolutely normal. Our approach relies on methods developed by Davenport, Erd{\H{o}}s, and LeVeque \cite{DEL1963} and properties of the order of integers in the multiplicative groups. The construction of these measures differs from the class of pointwise absolutely normal self-similar measures introduced by Hochman and Shmerkin \cite{Hochman2015}, in which dynamical approaches were used.
  As an application, for all gauge functions $\varphi(r)$ with $r/\varphi(r)\to 0$ as $r\to 0$, we obtain a set of uniqueness $K$ with ${\mathcal H}^{\varphi}(K)&gt;0$. Moreover, we show that there exists a pointwise absolutely normal measure $ \mu $ of dimension one fully supported on $K$. The result demonstrates that having a lot of absolutely normal numbers in a Cantor set, even with dimension one, cannot guarantee that it supports a measure with Fourier decay. It also shows that the ${\mathsf{DEL}}$ criterion being satisfied for all integers does not guarantee any Fourier decay nor the supporting set is a set of multiplicity.</description>

      <title>$H^1$ to $L^q$-boundedness of fractional integral operators having a flag kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a family of fractional integral operators whose kernels satisfying an non-isotropic dilation have singularity on a coordinate subspace. A characterization is given for these operators bounded from the classical, atom decomposable $H^1$-Hardy space to $L^q$-spaces.</description>

      <title>An SU(2n)-valued nonlinear Fourier transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a nonlinear Fourier transform which maps sequences of contractive $n \times n$ matrices to $SU(2n)$-valued functions on the circle $\mathbb{T}$. We characterize the image of finitely supported sequences and square-summable sequences on the half-line, and construct an inverse for $SU(2n)$-valued functions whose diagonal $n \times n$ blocks are outer matrix functions. As an application, we relate this nonlinear Fourier transform with quantum signal processing over $U(2n)$ and multivariate quantum signal processing.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Polynomial Wiener-Wintner Theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove quantitative polynomial Wiener-Wintner theorems in a very general setup, including measure-preserving actions of nilpotent Lie groups. Our results apply both to ergodic averages and to averages with singular integral weights. The proof relies on the generalized polynomial Carleson theorem developed in the companion paper by van Doorn, Srivastava, and the authors.</description>

      <title>Transmutation operators for Schr\"odinger equations with distributional potentials and the associated impedance equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the construction of an integral transmutation operator for the Schr\"odinger equation
  \[
  -y'' + q(x)y = \lambda y, \quad x \in J, \ \lambda \in \mathbb{C},
  \]
  in the case where $q$ is the distributional derivative of an $L^2$ function on a bounded interval $J \subset \mathbb{R}$. Such a transmutation operator transforms solutions of $ v'' + \lambda v = 0 $ into solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation. The construction of the integral transmutation operator relies on a new regularization of the distributional Schr\"odinger equation based on the Polya factorization in terms of a solution $f$ that does not vanish on the closure of $J$. The existence of such a function $f$ is established, together with a constructive method for its computation.
  As a consequence of the Polya factorization, we obtain an integro-differential transmutation operator for the associated Sturm--Liouville operator in impedance form related to $f$, along with smoothness conditions for the transmutation kernel. Furthermore, we introduce the Darboux transform for both the Schr\"odinger and impedance operators and describe their relationships with the corresponding transmutation operators. Finally, we develop several series representations for the solutions, including the spectral parameter power series and the Neumann series of spherical Bessel functions.</description>

      <title>From Complex-Analytic Models to Sparse Domination: A Dyadic Approach of Hypersingular Operators via Bourgain's Interpolation Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the work of Cheng--Fang--Wang--Yu on the hypersingular Bergman projection, we develop a real-variable and dyadic framework for hypersingular operators in regimes where strong-type estimates fail at the critical line. The main new input is a hypersingular sparse domination principle combined with Bourgain's interpolation method, which provides a flexible mechanism to establish critical-line (and endpoint) estimates.
  In the unit disc setting with $1&lt;t&lt;3/2$, we obtain a full characterization of the $(p,q)$ mapping theory for the dyadic hypersingular maximal operator $\mathcal M_t^{\mathcal D}$, in particular including estimates on the critical line $1/q-1/p=2t-2$ and a weighted endpoint criterion in the radial setting. We also prove endpoint estimates for the hypersingular Bergman projection \[ K_{2t}f(z)=\int_{\mathbb D}\frac{f(w)}{(1-z\overline w)^{2t}}\,dA(w), \] including a restricted weak-type bound at $(p,q)=\bigl(\tfrac{1}{3-2t},1\bigr)$. Finally, we introduce a class of hypersingular cousin of sparse operators in $\mathbb R^n$ associated with \emph{graded} sparse families, quantified by the sparseness $\eta$ and a new structural parameter (the \emph{degree}) $K_{\mathcal S}$, and we characterize the corresponding strong/weak/restricted weak-type regimes in terms of $(n,t,\eta,K_{\mathcal S})$.
  Our real-variable perspective addresses to an inquiry raised by Cheng--Fang--Wang--Yu on developing effective real-analytic tools in the hypersingular regime for $K_{2t}$, and it also provides a new route toward the critical-line analysis of Forelli--Rudin type operators and related hypersingular operators in both real and complex settings.</description>
