      <title>On the decay properties of the neutron-deficient isotope 242Es</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The radioactive decay properties of $^{242}$Es were studied with significantly improved statistics compared to available literature data. This isotope was produced in the 3n evaporation channel of the fusion reaction of $^{48}$Ca+$^{197}$Au. A half-life of 16.9(8)~s was deduced from 662 $\alpha$ decays of $^{242}$Es, resulting in an $\alpha$-decay branching of 41(3)\%. Twenty-six fission events with a half-life of 18.2$^{+4.5}_{-3.0}$~s were assigned to originate from the electron-capture delayed fission of $^{242}$Es. The probability for the electron-capture delayed fission was measured to be 0.015(4), which improves and resolves ambiguities in available experimental data. We discuss all known cases for electron-capture delayed fission in Es, Bk, and Am isotopes and compare experimental data with predictions from a recent semi-empirical model. A cross section of 27(3)~nb was measured for the production of $^{242}$Es.</description>

      <title>Search for Pauli Exclusion Principle Violations with Gator at LNGS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Pauli Exclusion Principle (PEP) appears from fundamental symmetries in quantum field theories, but its physical origin is still to be understood. High-precision experimental searches for small PEP violations permit testing key assumptions of the Standard Model with high sensitivity. We report on a dedicated measurement with Gator, a low-background, high-purity germanium detector operated at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso, aimed at testing PEP-violating atomic transitions in lead. The experimental technique, relying on forming a new symmetry state by introducing electrons into the pre-existing electron system through a direct current, satisfies the conditions of the Messiah-Greenberg superselection rule. No PEP violation has been observed, and an upper limit on the PEP violation probability of $\beta^2/2 &lt; 4.8 \cdot 10^{-29}$ (90% CL) is set. This improves the previous constraint from a comparable measurement by more than one order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Restricting Sterile Neutrinos by Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The bounds on parameters of the eV and higher scale sterile neutrinos from the $0\nu \beta \beta$ decay have been refined and updated. We present a simple and compact analytic expression for the bound in the $\Delta m^2_{41} - \sin^2 2\theta_{14}$ plane, which includes all relevant parameters. Dependencies of the bound on unknown CP-phases and the type of mass spectrum of light neutrinos (mass ordering and level of degeneracy) are studied in detail. We have computed the bounds using the latest and most stringent data from KamLAND-Zen. The projected constraints from future experiments are estimated. The obtained bounds are confronted with positive indications of the presence of sterile neutrinos as well as with the other existing bounds. The $0\nu \beta \beta$ decay results exclude the regions of parameters implied by BEST and Neutrino-4, and the regions indicated by LSND and MiniBooNE are in conflict with $0\nu \beta \beta$ results combined with $\nu_\mu-$ disappearance bounds.</description>

      <title>Ternary fission with the emission of long-range $\alpha$ particles in fission of the heaviest nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The most probable outcome of the ternary fission is the emission of two heavy fragments and one light-charged particle. In about 90\%, these are $\alpha$ particles, which often referred to as the long-range alpha (LRA). Such decay has been extensively studied over decades in various heavy fissioning systems. The probability of such a process has been found to be about (2-4)$\times 10^{-3}$ relative to binary fission. The experimental data showed an increasing trend in the probability of such a process with an increase in fissility parameter within the range of 35 - 39. In the last decades, a region of the heaviest nuclei has been substantially expanded in both proton and neutron numbers. This includes neutron-deficient heavy and superheavy nuclei with fissility parameters, which are significantly exceeding the aforementioned range. In the present work, the currently available experimental data on the probability of the LRA emission, which is a representative of ternary fission, are discussed. The probabilities of LRA emission were calculated within the various empirical approaches, including the presently suggested semi-empirical expression. The latter one was derived on the basis of the $\alpha$-decay property of the fissioning nucleus. The results of all approaches discussed show that the probabilities of LRA emission are substantial (up to a percentage) in the fission of neutron-deficient heavy and superheavy nuclei.</description>

      <title>The $p\Lambda$ and $pp\Lambda$ correlation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we present the study of $p\Lambda$ and $pp\Lambda$ scattering processes using femtoscopic correlation functions. This observable has been recently used to access the low-energy interaction of hadrons emitted in the final state of high-energy collisions, delivering unprecedented precision information of the interaction among strange hadrons. The formalism for particle pairs is well established and it relates the measured correlation functions with the scattering wave function and the emission source. In the present work we analyze the $NN\Lambda$ scattering in free space and relate the corresponding wave function to the $pp\Lambda$ correlation measurement performed by the ALICE collaboration. The three-body problem is solved using the hyperspherical adiabatic basis. Regarding the $p\Lambda$ and $pp\Lambda$ interactions, different models are used and their impact on the correlation function is studied. The three body force considered in this work is anchored to describe the binding energy of the hypertriton and to give a good description of the two four-body hypernuclei. As a main result we have observed a huge, low-energy peak in the $pp\Lambda$ correlation function, mainly produced by the $J^\pi=1/2^+$ three-body state. The study of this peak from an experimental as well as a theoretical point of view will provide important constraints to the two- and three-body interactions.</description>

      <title>Correlation of neutrinoless double-beta decay nuclear matrix elements with nucleon-nucleon phase shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an ab initio study of the correlation between nuclear matrix elements of neutrinoless double-beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay and nucleon-nucleon scattering phase shifts in the $^1S_0$ channel. Starting from thirty-four statistically weighted interactions derived from chiral effective field theory, we apply the valence-space in-medium similarity renormalization group to calculate nuclear matrix elements in four key experimental isotopes. Comparing with the $^1S_0$-channel phase shifts given from each interaction, in all cases we observe a strong correlation for scattering energies above 75 MeV. Furthermore, a global sensitivity analysis, enabled by newly developed machine-learning emulators, confirms that the nuclear matrix elements of the decay depend primarily on the $C_{1S0}$ low-energy constant, which is associated with the phase shifts in that partial wave. These results provide the first clear correlation between $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay nuclear matrix elements and a measured observable and will therefore serve as a crucial component in ongoing and future refinements of ab initio uncertainty estimates.</description>

Abstract: This is a resource paper concerning enhancement of observable time-reversal breaking effects by nuclear structure, aimed at AMO experimentalists. It's intended to support a white paper by providing some orientation on what can be said about some particular isotopes. Any conclusions are qualitative, and the reader should consult and cite the primary references and reviews rather than this arXiv alone.</description>

      <title>Electroproduction of the Lambda/Sigma^0 hyperons at Q^2~0.5 (GeV/c)^2 at forward angles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01173v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2018, the E12-17-003 experiment was conducted at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab) to explore the possible existence of an nnLambda state in the reconstructed missing mass distribution from a tritium gas target [K. N. Suzuki et al., Prog. Theor. Exp. Phys. 2022, 013D01 (2022), B. Pandey et al., Phys. Rev. C 105, L051001 (2022)]. As part of this investigation, data was also collected using a gaseous hydrogen target, not only for a precise absolute mass scale calibration but also for the study of Lambda/Sigma^0 electroproduction. This dataset was acquired at Q^2~0.5 (GeV/c)^2, W=2.14 GeV, and theta_{gamma K}^{c.m.}~8 deg. It covers forward angles where photoproduction data is scarce and a low-Q^2 region that is of interest for hypernuclear experiments. On the other hand, this kinematic region is at a slightly higher Q^2 than previous hypernuclear experiments, thus providing crucial information for understanding the Q^2 dependence of the differential cross sections for Lambda/Sigma^0 hyperon electroproduction. This paper reports on the Q^2 dependence of the differential cross section for the e + p -&gt; e' + K^+ + Lambda/Sigma^0 reaction in the 0.2-0.8 (GeV/c)^2, and provides comparisons with the currently available theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Charge radii of $^{11-16}$C, $^{13-17}$N and $^{15-18}$O determined from their charge-changing cross-sections and the mirror-difference charge radii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Charge-changing cross-sections of $^{11-16}$C, $^{13-17}$N and $^{15-18}$O on a carbon target have been determined at energies around 300 MeV/nucleon. A nucleon separation energy dependent correction factor has been introduced to the Glauber model calculation for extracting the nuclear charge radii from the experimental CCCSs. The charge radii of $^{11}$C, $^{13,16}$N and $^{15}$O thus were determined for the first time. With the new radii, we studied the experimental mirror-difference charge radii ($\Delta R_{\text {ch}}^{\text {mirror}}$) of $^{11}$B-$^{11}$C, $^{13}$C-$^{13}$N, $^{15}$N-$^{15}$O, $^{17}$N-$^{17}$Ne pairs for the first time. We find that the $\Delta R_{\text {ch}}^{\text {mirror}}$, including both bound and weakly bound proton-rich mirror partners, are reproduced by the empirical relation to the isospin asymmetry predicted by the $ab$ $initio$ calculations.</description>

      <title>On interpretation of fluctuations of conserved charges at high T</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04194v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fluctuations of conserved charges calculated on the lattice which can be measured experimentally, are well reproduced by a hadron resonanse gas model at temperatures below T_{ch} ~ 155 MeV and radically deviate from the hadron resonance gas predictions above the chiral restoration crossover. This behavior is typically interpreted as an indication of deconfinement in the quark-gluon plasma regime. We present an argument that this interpretation may be too simple. The argument is based on the scaling of quantities with the number of colors: demonstration of deconfinement and QGP requires observable that is sensitive to N_c^2 gluons while the conserved charges are sensitive only to quarks and above T_{ch} scale as N_c^1. The latter scaling is consistent with the existence of an intermediate regime characterized by restored chiral symmetry and by approximate chiral spin symmetry which is a symmetry of confining interaction. In this regime the energy density, pressure and entropy density scale as N_c^1. In the large N_c limit this regime might become a distinct phase separated from the hadron gas and from QGP by phase transitions. A natural observable that associates with deconfinement and is directly sensitive to deconfined N_c^2-1 gluons is the Polyakov loop; in the N_c=3 world it remains very close to 0 at temperatures well above chiral crossover, reaches the value 0.5 around 3T_{ch} and the value close to 1 at temperatures ~1 GeV.</description>

      <title>The Pixel Charging-up effect in Gas Micro-Pixel Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15077v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the charging-up effect on the Topmetal-II- chip in Gas Micro-Pixel Detectors(GMPD). It is found that this effect differs from the charging-up typically observed in gas detector multiplier devices and increases the relative gain of the detector. The research indicates that this effect originates from the accumulation of charges on the insulating layer of the chip's pixel surface. Iterative simulations using COMSOL and GARFIELD++ are employed to model the variation of detector relative gain with the charging-up effect, and a simple yet effective model is proposed, which aligns well with experimental data. The feasibility of validating the deposition of resistive materials and adjusting the local voltage distribution on the chip to suppress charging-up effects and enhance the relative gain is also verified.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study multi-particle azimuthal correlations in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. We use initial conditions obtained from a Monte-Carlo Glauber model and evolve them within a viscous relativistic hydrodynamics framework that eventually gives way to a transport model in the late hadronic stage of the evolution. We compute the multi-particle symmetric and asymmetric cumulants and present the results for their sensitivity to the shear and bulk viscosities during the hydrodynamic evolution. We also check their sensitivity to resonance decay and hadronic interactions. We show that these observables are more sensitive to the transport properties than the traditional flow observables.</description>

      <title>Compact Ion Beam System for Fusion Demonstration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04197v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a compact ion beam device capable of accelerating H$^+$ and D$^+$ ions up to 75keV energy, on to a solid target, with sufficient beam current to study fusion reactions. The ion beam system uses a microwave driven plasma source to generate ions that are accelerated to high energy with a direct current (DC) acceleration structure. The plasma source is driven by pulsed microwaves from a solid-state radiofrequency (RF) amplifier, which is impedance matched to the plasma source chamber at the ISM band frequency (2.4-2.5GHz). The plasma chamber is held at high positive DC potential and is isolated from the impedance matching structure (at ground potential) by a dielectric-filled gap. To facilitate the use of high-energy-particle detectors near the target, the plasma chamber is biased to a high positive voltage, while the target remains grounded. A target loaded with deuterium is used to study D-D fusion and a B$_4$C or LaB$_6$ target is used to study p-$^{11}$B fusion. Detectors include solid-state charged particle detector and a scintillation fast neutron detector. The complete ion beam system can fit on a laboratory table and is a useful tool for teaching undergraduate and graduate students about the physics of fusion.</description>

Abstract: Plastic scintillator strips are considered as one of the promising solutions for the cost-effective construction of total-body positron emission tomography, (PET) system. The purpose of the performed measurements is to compare the transparency of long plastic scintillators with dimensions 6 mm x 24 mm x 1000 mm and with all surfaces polished. Six different types of commercial, general purpose, blue-emitting plastic scintillators with low attenuation of visible light were tested, namely: polyvinyl toluene-based BC-408, EJ-200, RP-408, and polystyrene-based Epic, SP32 and UPS-923A. For determination of the best type of plastic scintillator for totalbody Jagiellonian positron emission tomograph (TB-J-PET) construction, emission and transmission spectra, and technical attenuation length (TAL) of blue light-emitting by the scintillators were measured and compared. The TAL values were determined with the use of UV lamp as excitation source, and photodiode as light detector. Emission spectra of investigated scintillators have maxima in the range from 420 nm to 429 nm. The BC-408 and EJ-200 have the highest transmittance values of about 90% at the maximum emission wavelength measured through a 6 mm thick scintillator strip and the highest technical attenuation length reaching about 2000 mm, allowing assembly of long detection modules for time-of-flight (TOF) J-PET scanners. Influence of the 6 mm x 6 mm, 12 mm x 6 mm, 24 mm x 6 mm cross-sections of the 1000 mm long EJ-200 plastic scintillator on the TAL and signal intensity was measured. The highest TAL value was determined for samples with 24 mm x 6 mm cross-section.</description>
