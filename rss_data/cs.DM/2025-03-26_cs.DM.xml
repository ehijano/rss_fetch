      <title>On the number of asynchronous attractors in AND-NOT Boolean networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boolean Networks (BNs) describe the time evolution of binary states using logic functions on the nodes of a network. They are fundamental models for complex discrete dynamical systems, with applications in various areas of science and engineering, and especially in systems biology. A key aspect of the dynamical behavior of BNs is the number of attractors, which determines the diversity of long-term system trajectories. Due to the noisy nature and incomplete characterization of biological systems, a stochastic asynchronous update scheme is often more appropriate than the deterministic synchronous one. AND-NOT BNs, whose logic functions are the conjunction of literals, are an important subclass of BNs because of their structural simplicity and their usefulness in analyzing biological systems for which the only information available is a collection of interactions among components. In this paper, we establish new theoretical results regarding asynchronous attractors in AND-NOT BNs. We derive two new upper bounds for the number of asynchronous attractors in an AND-NOT BN based on structural properties (strong even cycles and dominating sets, respectively) of the AND-NOT BN. These findings contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of asynchronous dynamics in AND-NOT BNs, with implications for attractor enumeration and counting, as well as for network design and control.</description>

      <title>LogicLearner: A Tool for the Guided Practice of Propositional Logic Proofs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of propositional logic -- fundamental to the theory of computing -- is a cornerstone of the undergraduate computer science curriculum. Learning to solve logical proofs requires repeated guided practice, but undergraduate students often lack access to on-demand tutoring in a judgment-free environment. In this work, we highlight the need for guided practice tools in undergraduate mathematics education and outline the desiderata of an effective practice tool. We accordingly develop LogicLearner, a web application for guided logic proof practice. LogicLearner consists of an interface to attempt logic proofs step-by-step and an automated proof solver to generate solutions on the fly, allowing users to request guidance as needed. We pilot LogicLearner as a practice tool in two semesters of an undergraduate discrete mathematics course and receive strongly positive feedback for usability and pedagogical value in student surveys. To the best of our knowledge, LogicLearner is the only learning tool that provides an end-to-end practice environment for logic proofs with immediate, judgment-free feedback.</description>

      <title>The $g$-good-neighbor diagnosability of product networks under the PMC model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of neighbor connectivity originated from the assessment of the subversion of espionage networks caused by underground resistance movements, and it has now been applied to measure the disruption of networks caused by cascading failures through neighbors. In this paper, we give two necessary and sufficient conditions of the existance of $g$-good-neighbor diagnosability. We introduce a new concept called $g$-good neighbor cut-component number (gc number for short), which has close relation with $g$-good-neighbor diagnosability. Sharp lower and upper bounds of the gc number of general graphs in terms of the $g$-good neighbor connectivity is given, which provides a formula to compute the $g$-good-neighbor diagnosability for general graphs (therefore for Cartesian product graphs). As their applications, we get the exact values or bounds for the gc numbers and $g$-good-neighbor diagnosability of grid, torus networks and generalized cubes.</description>

      <title>When Distances Lie: Euclidean Embeddings in the Presence of Outliers and Distance Violations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distance geometry explores the properties of distance spaces that can be exactly represented as the pairwise Euclidean distances between points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ ($d \geq 1$), or equivalently, distance spaces that can be isometrically embedded in $\mathbb{R}^d$. In this work, we investigate whether a distance space can be isometrically embedded in $\mathbb{R}^d$ after applying a limited number of modifications. Specifically, we focus on two types of modifications: outlier deletion (removing points) and distance modification (adjusting distances between points). The central problem, Euclidean Embedding Editing (EEE), asks whether an input distance space on $n$ points can be transformed, using at most $k$ modifications, into a space that is isometrically embeddable in $\mathbb{R}^d$.
  We present several fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) and approximation algorithms for this problem. Our first result is an algorithm that solves EEE in time $(dk)^{\mathcal{O}(d+k)} + n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$. The core subroutine of this algorithm, which is of independent interest, is a polynomial-time method for compressing the input distance space into an equivalent instance of EEE with $\mathcal{O}((dk)^2)$ points.
  For the special but important case of EEE where only outlier deletions are allowed, we improve the parameter dependence of the FPT algorithm and obtain a running time of $\min\{(d+3)^k, 2^{d+k}\} \cdot n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$. Additionally, we provide an FPT-approximation algorithm for this problem, which outputs a set of at most $2 \cdot {\rm OPT}$ outliers in time $2^d \cdot n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$. This 2-approximation algorithm improves upon the previous $(3+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm by Sidiropoulos, Wang, and Wang [SODA '17]. Furthermore, we complement our algorithms with hardness results motivating our choice of parameterizations.</description>

      <title>A Tight Meta-theorem for LOCAL Certification of MSO$_2$ Properties within Bounded Treewidth Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distributed networks are prone to errors so verifying their output is critical. Hence, we develop LOCAL certification protocols for graph properties in which nodes are given certificates that allow them to check whether their network as a whole satisfies some fixed property while only communicating with their local network. Most known LOCAL certification protocols are specifically tailored to the problem they work on and cannot be translated more generally. Thus we target general protocols that can certify any property expressible within a certain logical framework. We consider Monadic Second Order Logic (MSO$_2$), a powerful framework that can express properties such as non-$k$-colorability, Hamiltonicity, and $H$-minor-freeness. Unfortunately, in general, there are MSO$_2$-expressible properties that cannot be certified without huge certificates. For instance, non-3-colorability requires certificates of size $\Omega(n^2/\log n)$ on general $n$-vertex graphs (G\"o\"os, Suomela 2016). Hence, we impose additional structural restrictions on the graph.
  We provide a LOCAL certification protocol for certifying any MSO$_2$-expressible property on graphs of bounded treewidth and, consequently, a LOCAL certification protocol for certifying bounded treewidth. That is for each integer $k$ and each MSO$_2$-expressible property $\Pi$ we give a LOCAL Certification protocol to certify that a graph satisfies $\Pi$ and has treewidth at most $k$ using certificates of size $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ (which is asymptotically optimal). Our LOCAL certification protocol requires only one round of distributed communication, hence it is also proof-labeling scheme.
  Our result improves upon work by Fraigniaud, Montealegre, Rapaport, and Todinca (Algorithmica 2024), Bousquet, Feuilloley, Pierron (PODC 2022), and the very recent work of Baterisna and Chang.</description>

      <title>Complexity of chess domination problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.05651v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study different domination problems of attacking and non-attacking rooks and queens on polyominoes and polycubes of all dimensions. Our main result proves that maximum independent domination is NP-complete for non-attacking queens and for non-attacking rooks on polycubes of dimension three and higher. We also analyze these problems for polyominoes and convex polyominoes, conjecture the complexity classes, and provide a computer tool for investigation. We have also computed new values for classical queen domination problems on chessboards (square polyominoes). For our computations, we have translated the problem into an integer linear programming instance. Finally, using this computational implementation and the game engine Godot, we have developed a video game of minimum domination of queens and rooks on randomly generated polyominoes.</description>

      <title>Planar Cycle-Extendable Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15416v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For most problems pertaining to perfect matchings, one may restrict attention to matching covered graphs -- that is, connected nontrivial graphs with the property that each edge belongs to some perfect matching. There is extensive literature on these graphs that are also known as $1$-extendable graphs (since each edge extends to a perfect matching) including an ear decomposition theorem due to Lovasz and Plummer.
  A cycle $C$ of a graph $G$ is conformal if $G-V(C)$ has a perfect matching; such cycles play an important role in the study of perfect matchings, especially when investigating the Pfaffian orientation problem. A matching covered graph $G$ is cycle-extendable if -- for each even cycle $C$ -- the cycle $C$ is conformal, or equivalently, each perfect matching of $C$ extends to a perfect matching of $G$, or equivalently, $C$ is the symmetric difference of two perfect matchings of $G$, or equivalently, $C$ extends to an ear decomposition of $G$. In the literature, these are also known as cycle-nice or as $1$-cycle resonant graphs.
  Zhang, Wang, Yuan, Ng and Cheng [Discrete Mathematics, 345:7 (2022), 112876] provided a characterization of claw-free cycle-extendable graphs. Guo and Zhang [Discrete Mathematics, 275:1-3 (2004), 151-164] and independently Zhang and Li [Discrete Applied Mathematics, 160:13-14 (2012), 2069-2074], provided characterizations of bipartite planar cycle-extendable graphs. In this paper, we establish a characterization of all planar cycle-extendable graphs -- in terms of $K_2$ and four infinite families.</description>
