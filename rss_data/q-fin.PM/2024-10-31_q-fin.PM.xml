      <title>Clustering Digital Assets Using Path Signatures: Application to Portfolio Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new way of building portfolios of cryptocurrencies that provide good diversification properties to investors. First, we seek to filter these digital assets by creating some clusters based on their path signature. The goal is to identify similar patterns in the behavior of these highly volatile assets. Once such clusters have been built, we propose "optimal" portfolios by comparing the performances of such portfolios to a universe of unfiltered digital assets. Our intuition is that clustering based on path signatures will make it easier to capture the main trends and features of a group of cryptocurrencies, and allow parsimonious portfolios that reduce excessive transaction fees. Empirically, our assumptions seem to be satisfied.</description>

      <title>On Cost-Sensitive Distributionally Robust Log-Optimal Portfolio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses a novel \emph{cost-sensitive} distributionally robust log-optimal portfolio problem, where the investor faces \emph{ambiguous} return distributions, and a general convex transaction cost model is incorporated. The uncertainty in the return distribution is quantified using the \emph{Wasserstein} metric, which captures distributional ambiguity. We establish conditions that ensure robustly survivable trades for all distributions in the Wasserstein ball under convex transaction costs. By leveraging duality theory, we approximate the infinite-dimensional distributionally robust optimization problem with a finite convex program, enabling computational tractability for mid-sized portfolios. Empirical studies using S\&amp;P 500 data validate our theoretical framework: without transaction costs, the optimal portfolio converges to an equal-weighted allocation, while with transaction costs, the portfolio shifts slightly towards the risk-free asset, reflecting the trade-off between cost considerations and optimal allocation.</description>

      <title>On optimal tracking portfolio in incomplete markets: The reinforcement learning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies an infinite horizon optimal tracking portfolio problem using capital injection in incomplete market models. The benchmark process is modelled by a geometric Brownian motion with zero drift driven by some unhedgeable risk. The relaxed tracking formulation is adopted where the fund account compensated by the injected capital needs to outperform the benchmark process at any time, and the goal is to minimize the cost of the discounted total capital injection. When model parameters are known, we formulate the equivalent auxiliary control problem with reflected state dynamics, for which the classical solution of the HJB equation with Neumann boundary condition is obtained explicitly. When model parameters are unknown, we introduce the exploratory formulation for the auxiliary control problem with entropy regularization and develop the continuous-time q-learning algorithm in models of reflected diffusion processes. In some illustrative numerical example, we show the satisfactory performance of the q-learning algorithm.</description>

      <title>Risk Budgeting Allocation for Dynamic Risk Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11319v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define and develop an approach for risk budgeting allocation - a risk diversification portfolio strategy - where risk is measured using a dynamic time-consistent risk measure. For this, we introduce a notion of dynamic risk contributions that generalise the classical Euler contributions and which allow us to obtain dynamic risk contributions in a recursive manner. We prove that, for the class of coherent dynamic distortion risk measures, the risk allocation problem may be recast as a sequence of strictly convex optimisation problems. Moreover, we show that self-financing dynamic risk budgeting strategies with initial wealth of 1 are scaled versions of the solution of the sequence of convex optimisation problems. Furthermore, we develop an actor-critic approach, leveraging the elicitability of dynamic risk measures, to solve for risk budgeting strategies using deep learning.</description>

      <title>State-Dependent Linear Utility Functions for Monetary Returns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a theory of expected utility with state-dependent linear utility function for monetary returns, that includes results on first order stochastic dominance, mean-preserving spread, increasing-concave linear utility profiles and risk aversion. As an application of the expected utility theory developed here, we analyze the contract that a monopolist would offer in an insurance market that allowed for partial coverage of loss. We also define a utility function for monetary returns that in a certain sense reconciles state-dependent constant average utility of money with loss aversion and the Friedman-Savage hypothesis. As an immediate consequence of such a utility function, we obtain a profile of state-dependent linear utility functions for monetary returns, where states of nature correspond to mutually disjoint intervals in which monetary gains and losses may occur.</description>
