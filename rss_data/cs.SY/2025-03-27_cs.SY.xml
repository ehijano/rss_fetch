      <title>Control Barrier Functions for Shared Control and Vehicle Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This manuscript presents a control barrier function based approach to shared control for preventing a vehicle from entering the part of the state space where it is unrecoverable. The maximal phase recoverable ellipse is presented as a safe set in the sideslip angle--yaw rate phase plane where the vehicle's state can be maintained. An exponential control barrier function is then defined on the maximal phase recoverable ellipse to promote safety. Simulations demonstrate that this approach enables safe drifting, that is, driving at the handling limit without spinning out. Results are then validated for shared control drifting with an experimental vehicle in a closed course. The results show the ability of this shared control formulation to maintain the vehicle's state within a safe domain in a computationally efficient manner, even in extreme drifting maneuvers.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Multi-Task Electric Energy System Intelligence: Data Scaling Laws and Performance with Limited Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data scaling has revolutionized research fields like natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics control, providing foundation models with remarkable multi-task and generalization capabilities. In this paper, we investigate whether similar data scaling laws exist in developing foundation models for power systems, and whether appropriate data scaling can yield multi-task, cross-timescales capabilities that can be deployed in \textit{unseen} operational scenarios. To this end, we conducted a comprehensive empirical study on data scaling by fine-tuning open-source foundation models using labeled data collected from diverse operational tasks and scenarios. We study how a foundation model's scenario generalization performance evolves with the number of training tasks, scenarios, and demonstrations. Our study involved collecting more than 450k demonstrations and implementing independent tests under a rigorous evaluation framework. Our findings reveal several key insights: First, the generalization performance of a fine-tuned foundation model follows an approximate power-law relationship with the number of demonstrations and scenarios. Second, the fine-tuned model also demonstrates impressive multi-task capabilities, where multi-task training shares similar performance improvements with single-task training as the number of demonstrations increases, without interference among tasks. Lastly, models with small parameter sizes could have strong performance as well. Model performance does not scale significantly with parameter size. These findings underscore the feasibility of developing multi-task foundation models tailored for power systems, demonstrating that while larger datasets and models generally improve performance, extreme scaling is unnecessary to achieve satisfactory outcomes.</description>

      <title>Small-Signal Stability Condition of Inverter-Integrated Power Systems: Closed-Form Expression by Stationary Power Flow Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper shows that a necessary and sufficient condition for the small-signal stability of an inverter-integrated power system can be expressed in terms of semidefinite matrix inequalities determined only by the synchronous reactance of the components, the susceptance matrix of the transmission network, and the stationary values of the power flow distribution. To derive the stability condition, we consider a class of grid-forming inverters corresponding to a singular perturbation of the synchronous generator. The resulting matrix inequality condition, which has twice as many dimensions as the number of buses and is independent of the dynamics of the connected components, is expressed in terms of each component compensating in a decentralized manner for the loss of frequency synchronization caused by the reactive power consumption in the transmission network. A simple numerical example using a 3-bus power system model shows that a grid-forming inverter load improves power system synchronization, while a grid-following inverter load disrupts it.</description>

      <title>Merits of Serving UAVs via Terrestrial Networks: A Vertical Antenna Radiation Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly used in a plethora of applications such as shipping, surveillance, and search-and-rescue. For UAVs to operate safely, reliable cellular connectivity is essential. Utilizing the terrestrial networks for aerial connectivity has been proposed, but the 3D radiation pattern of base station antennas significantly affects the performance of aerial links.. To address this, we evaluate the coverage probability of cellular-connected UAVs, considering vertical antenna gain, by leveraging tools from stochastic geometry. We also analyze how the UAV hovering height, tilt angle and 3D antenna beamwidth influence the reliability of the communication link. Our results show that a down-tiled antenna does not only improve the connectivity of terrestrial users but also its cellularconnected UAVs counterpart. Moreover, the coverage probability of the UAV-UE becomes saturated at large down-tilt angles at the TBSs due to the antenna sidelobe gain at the serving and interfering TBSs. We also found that the significant increase of the vertical antenna beamwidth improves the UAV user coverage probability especially at relatively low hovering altitudes thanks to the increase of the desired signal strength compared to the interference power.</description>

      <title>Structure Identification of NDS with Descriptor Subsystems under Asynchronous, Non-Uniform, and Slow-Rate Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Networked dynamic systems (NDS) exhibit collective behavior shaped by subsystem dynamics and complex interconnections, yet identifying these interconnections remains challenging due to irregularities in sampled data, including asynchronous, non-uniform, and low-rate sampling. This paper proposes a novel two-stage structure identification algorithm that leverages system zero-order moments, a concept traditionally used in model order reduction, to bridge system identification and model reduction. First, zero-order moments are estimated from steady-state time-domain outputs; second, subsystem interconnections are explicitly reconstructed from these moments. The method generalizes existing approaches by handling asynchronous, non-uniform, and slow sampling simultaneously, eliminating constraints on input signal periodicity and extending applicability to multi-input multi-output NDS with arbitrary interconnections. Unlike black-box identification techniques, our approach explicitly recovers subsystem interconnection structures. Validation on the IEEE 14-bus system demonstrates the algorithm's effectiveness in recovering subsystem interconnections from irregular sampling data.</description>

      <title>The Crucial Role of Problem Formulation in Real-World Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers promising solutions for control tasks in industrial cyber-physical systems (ICPSs), yet its real-world adoption remains limited. This paper demonstrates how seemingly small but well-designed modifications to the RL problem formulation can substantially improve performance, stability, and sample efficiency. We identify and investigate key elements of RL problem formulation and show that these enhance both learning speed and final policy quality. Our experiments use a one-degree-of-freedom (1-DoF) helicopter testbed, the Quanser Aero~2, which features non-linear dynamics representative of many industrial settings. In simulation, the proposed problem design principles yield more reliable and efficient training, and we further validate these results by training the agent directly on physical hardware. The encouraging real-world outcomes highlight the potential of RL for ICPS, especially when careful attention is paid to the design principles of problem formulation. Overall, our study underscores the crucial role of thoughtful problem formulation in bridging the gap between RL research and the demands of real-world industrial systems.</description>

      <title>Model Predictive Control for Tracking Bounded References With Arbitrary Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, a model predictive control (MPC) method is proposed for constrained linear systems to track bounded references with arbitrary dynamics. Besides control inputs to be determined, artificial reference is introduced as additional decision variable, which serves as an intermediate target to cope with sudden changes of reference and enlarges domain of attraction. Cost function penalizes both artificial state error and reference error, while terminal constraint is imposed on artificial state error and artificial reference. We specify the requirements for terminal constraint and cost function to guarantee recursive feasibility of the proposed method and asymptotic stability of tracking error. Then, periodic and non-periodic references are considered and the method to determine required cost function and terminal constraint is proposed. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed MPC controller is demonstrated with simulation examples.</description>

      <title>Automated and Risk-Aware Engine Control Calibration Using Constrained Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decarbonization of the transport sector sets increasingly strict demands to maximize thermal efficiency and minimize greenhouse gas emissions of Internal Combustion Engines. This has led to complex engines with a surge in the number of corresponding tunable parameters in actuator set points and control settings. Automated calibration is therefore essential to keep development time and costs at acceptable levels. In this work, an innovative self-learning calibration method is presented based on in-cylinder pressure curve shaping. This method combines Principal Component Decomposition with constrained Bayesian Optimization. To realize maximal thermal engine efficiency, the optimization problem aims at minimizing the difference between the actual in-cylinder pressure curve and an Idealized Thermodynamic Cycle. By continuously updating a Gaussian Process Regression model of the pressure's Principal Components weights using measurements of the actual operating conditions, the mean in-cylinder pressure curve as well as its uncertainty bounds are learned. This information drives the optimization of calibration parameters, which are automatically adapted while dealing with the risks and uncertainties associated with operational safety and combustion stability. This data-driven method does not require prior knowledge of the system. The proposed method is successfully demonstrated in simulation using a Reactivity Controlled Compression Ignition engine model. The difference between the Gross Indicated Efficiency of the optimal solution found and the true optimum is 0.017%. For this complex engine, the optimal solution was found after 64.4s, which is relatively fast compared to conventional calibration methods.</description>

      <title>Problem-Structure-Informed Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm for Large-Scale Unit Commitment with Limited Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As power systems expand, solving the Unit Commitment Problem (UCP) becomes increasingly challenging due to the dimensional catastrophe, and traditional methods often struggle to balance computational efficiency and solution quality. To tackle this issue, we propose a problem-structure-informed Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) framework that fully exploits the quantum advantage under extremely limited quantum resources. Specifically, we leverage the inherent topological structure of power systems to decompose large-scale UCP instances into smaller subproblems, each solvable in parallel by limited number of qubits. This decomposition not only circumvents the current hardware limitations of quantum computing but also achieves higher performance as the graph structure of the power system becomes more sparse. Consequently, our approach can be readily extended to future power systems that are larger and more complex.</description>

      <title>Agent-Based Analysis of the Impact of Near Real-Time Data and Smart Balancing on the Frequency Stability of Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single imbalance pricing provides an incentive to balance responsible parties (BRPs) to intentionally introduce power schedule deviations in order to reduce the control area imbalance and receive a remuneration through the imbalance settlement mechanism. This is called smart balancing or passive balancing and is actively encouraged in, e.g., the Netherlands and Belgium through the publication of near real-time (NRT) data on the control area imbalance by the transmission system operator. It is known that under certain conditions, smart balancing can deteriorate the frequency stability of the power system. This paper examines how the publication of different types of NRT data affects smart balancing and the frequency stability. A Monte-Carlo simulation of a dynamic multi-agent model is performed to analyse the effects of smart balancing with different parameters for the agents and the environment, using historical time series of the power imbalance of the German control block as a basis. It is found that smart balancing can significantly reduce the amount and cost of frequency restoration reserve activation, but leads to a general increase of the frequency variability. Depending on the type of NRT data and agent parameters, the frequency stability margins are also reduced. The negative effects on the frequency stability are stronger when NRT data is published using large bins and with long delays.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Distributionally Robust Control Based on Sinkhorn Ambiguity Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the complexity of modern control systems increases, it becomes challenging to derive an accurate model of the uncertainty that affects their dynamics. Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) provides a powerful framework for decision-making under distributional uncertainty only using noise samples. However, while the resulting policies inherit strong probabilistic guarantees when the number of samples is sufficiently high, their performance may significantly degrade when only a few data are available. Inspired by recent results from the machine learning community, we introduce an entropic regularization to penalize deviations from a given reference distribution and study data-driven DR control over Sinkhorn ambiguity sets. We show that for finite-horizon control problems, the optimal DR linear policy can be computed via convex programming. By analyzing the relation between the ambiguity set defined in terms of Wasserstein and Sinkhorn discrepancies, we reveal that, as the regularization parameter increases, this optimal policy interpolates between the solution of the Wasserstein DR problem and that of the stochastic problem under the reference distribution. We validate our theoretical findings and the effectiveness of our approach when only scarce data are available on a numerical example.</description>

      <title>Model-free Vehicle Rollover Prevention: A Data-driven Predictive Control Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vehicle rollovers pose a significant safety risk and account for a disproportionately high number of fatalities in road accidents. This paper addresses the challenge of rollover prevention using Data-EnablEd Predictive Control (DeePC), a data-driven control strategy that directly leverages raw input-output data to maintain vehicle stability without requiring explicit system modeling. To enhance computational efficiency, we employ a reduced-dimension DeePC that utilizes singular value decomposition-based dimension reduction to significantly lower computation complexity without compromising control performance. This optimization enables real-time application in scenarios with high-dimensional data, making the approach more practical for deployment in real-world vehicles. The proposed approach is validated through high-fidelity CarSim simulations in both sedan and utility truck scenarios, demonstrating its versatility and ability to maintain vehicle stability under challenging driving conditions. Comparative results with Linear Model Predictive Control (LMPC) highlight the superior performance of DeePC in preventing rollovers while preserving maneuverability. The findings suggest that DeePC offers a robust and adaptable solution for rollover prevention, capable of handling varying road and vehicle conditions.</description>

      <title>Insights from Game Theory into the Impact of Smart Balancing on Power System Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smart balancing, also called passive balancing, is the intentional introduction of active power schedule deviations by balance responsible parties (BRPs) to receive a remuneration through the imbalance settlement mechanism. From a system perspective, smart balancing is meant to reduce the need for, and costs of, frequency restoration reserves (FRR), but it can also cause large oscillations in the FRR and jeopardize the system stability. Using a dynamic control area model, this work defines a 2x2 game in which two BRPs can choose to perform smart balancing. We study the impact of time delay, ramp rates, and pricing mechanisms on Nash equilibria and Experience-weighted Attraction (EWA) learning. It is found that, even in an idealized setting, a significant fraction of games in a learned equilibrium results in an overreaction relative to the baseline disturbance, creating an imbalance in the opposite direction. This suggests that the system stability risks are inherent to smart balancing and not a question of implementation. Recommendations are given for implementation choices that can reduce (but not eliminate) the risk of overreactions.</description>

      <title>Convergence Theory of Flexible ALADIN for Distributed Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Augmented Lagrangian Alternating Direction Inexact Newton (ALADIN) method is a cutting-edge distributed optimization algorithm known for its superior numerical performance. It relies on each agent transmitting information to a central coordinator for data exchange. However, in practical network optimization and federated learning, unreliable information transmission often leads to packet loss, posing challenges for the convergence analysis of ALADIN. To address this issue, this paper proposes Flexible ALADIN, a random polling variant of ALADIN, and presents a rigorous convergence analysis, including global convergence for convex problems and local convergence for non-convex problems.</description>

      <title>DRPA-MPPI: Dynamic Repulsive Potential Augmented MPPI for Reactive Navigation in Unstructured Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reactive mobile robot navigation in unstructured environments is challenging when robots encounter unexpected obstacles that invalidate previously planned trajectories. Model predictive path integral control (MPPI) enables reactive planning, but still suffers from limited prediction horizons that lead to local minima traps near obstacles. Current solutions rely on heuristic cost design or scenario-specific pre-training, which often limits their adaptability to new environments. We introduce dynamic repulsive potential augmented MPPI (DRPA-MPPI), which dynamically detects potential entrapments on the predicted trajectories. Upon detecting local minima, DRPA-MPPI automatically switches between standard goal-oriented optimization and a modified cost function that generates repulsive forces away from local minima. Comprehensive testing in simulated obstacle-rich environments confirms DRPA-MPPI's superior navigation performance and safety compared to conventional methods with less computational burden.</description>

      <title>Two-Player Dynamic Potential LQ Games with Sequentially Revealed Costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a novel finite-horizon linear-quadratic (LQ) feedback dynamic potential game with a priori unknown cost matrices played between two players. The cost matrices are revealed to the players sequentially, with the potential for future values to be previewed over a short time window. We propose an algorithm that enables the players to predict and track a feedback Nash equilibrium trajectory, and we measure the quality of their resulting decisions by introducing the concept of \emph{price of uncertainty}. We show that under the proposed algorithm, the price of uncertainty is bounded by horizon-invariant constants. The constants are the sum of three terms; the first and second terms decay exponentially as the preview window grows, and another depends on the magnitude of the differences between the cost matrices for each player. Through simulations, we illustrate that the resulting price of uncertainty initially decays at an exponential rate as the preview window lengthens, then remains constant for large time horizons.</description>

      <title>A Virtual Fencing Framework for Safe and Efficient Collaborative Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collaborative robots (cobots) increasingly operate alongside humans, demanding robust real-time safeguarding. Current safety standards (e.g., ISO 10218, ANSI/RIA 15.06, ISO/TS 15066) require risk assessments but offer limited guidance for real-time responses. We propose a virtual fencing approach that detects and predicts human motion, ensuring safe cobot operation. Safety and performance tradeoffs are modeled as an optimization problem and solved via sequential quadratic programming. Experimental validation shows that our method minimizes operational pauses while maintaining safety, providing a modular solution for human-robot collaboration.</description>

      <title>Turning Circle-based Control Barrier Function for Efficient Collision Avoidance of Nonholonomic Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new control barrier function (CBF) designed to improve the efficiency of collision avoidance for nonholonomic vehicles. Traditional CBFs typically rely on the shortest Euclidean distance to obstacles, overlooking the limited heading change ability of nonholonomic vehicles. This often leads to abrupt maneuvers and excessive speed reductions, which is not desirable and reduces the efficiency of collision avoidance. Our approach addresses these limitations by incorporating the distance to the turning circle, considering the vehicle's limited maneuverability imposed by its nonholonomic constraints. The proposed CBF is integrated with model predictive control (MPC) to generate more efficient trajectories compared to existing methods that rely solely on Euclidean distance-based CBFs. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through numerical simulations on unicycle vehicles and experiments with underactuated surface vehicles.</description>

      <title>State-Aware Perturbation Optimization for Robust Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a promising approach for robotic control. However, the deployment of DRL in real-world robots is hindered by its sensitivity to environmental perturbations. While existing whitebox adversarial attacks rely on local gradient information and apply uniform perturbations across all states to evaluate DRL robustness, they fail to account for temporal dynamics and state-specific vulnerabilities. To combat the above challenge, we first conduct a theoretical analysis of white-box attacks in DRL by establishing the adversarial victim-dynamics Markov decision process (AVD-MDP), to derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for a successful attack. Based on this, we propose a selective state-aware reinforcement adversarial attack method, named STAR, to optimize perturbation stealthiness and state visitation dispersion. STAR first employs a soft mask-based state-targeting mechanism to minimize redundant perturbations, enhancing stealthiness and attack effectiveness. Then, it incorporates an information-theoretic optimization objective to maximize mutual information between perturbations, environmental states, and victim actions, ensuring a dispersed state-visitation distribution that steers the victim agent into vulnerable states for maximum return reduction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STAR outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Immersive and Wearable Thermal Rendering for Augmented Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In augmented reality (AR), where digital content is overlaid onto the real world, realistic thermal feedback has been shown to enhance immersion. Yet current thermal feedback devices, heavily influenced by the needs of virtual reality, often hinder physical interactions and are ineffective for immersion in AR. To bridge this gap, we have identified three design considerations relevant for AR thermal feedback: indirect feedback to maintain dexterity, thermal passthrough to preserve real-world temperature perception, and spatiotemporal rendering for dynamic sensations. We then created a unique and innovative thermal feedback device that satisfies these criteria. Human subject experiments assessing perceptual sensitivity, object temperature matching, spatial pattern recognition, and moving thermal stimuli demonstrated the impact of our design, enabling realistic temperature discrimination, virtual object perception, and enhanced immersion. These findings demonstrate that carefully designed thermal feedback systems can bridge the sensory gap between physical and virtual interactions, enhancing AR realism and usability.</description>

      <title>Decoherence time maximization and partial isolation for open quantum harmonic oscillator memory networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers a network of open quantum harmonic oscillators which interact with their neighbours through direct energy and field-mediated couplings and also with external quantum fields. The position-momentum dynamic variables of the network are governed by linear quantum stochastic differential equations associated with the nodes of a graph whose edges specify the interconnection of the component oscillators. Such systems can be employed as Heisenberg picture quantum memories with an engineered ability to approximately retain initial conditions over a bounded time interval. We use the quantum memory decoherence time defined previously in terms of a fidelity threshold on a weighted mean-square deviation for a subset (or linear combinations) of network variables from their initial values. This approach is applied to maximizing a high-fidelity asymptotic approximation of the decoherence time over the direct energy coupling parameters of the network. The resulting optimality condition is a set of linear equations for blocks of a sparse matrix associated with the edges of the direct energy coupling graph of the network. We also discuss a setting where the quantum network has a subset of dynamic variables which are affected by the external fields only indirectly, through a complementary ``shielding'' system. This holds under a rank condition on the network-field coupling matrix and can be achieved through an appropriate field-mediated coupling between the component oscillators. The partially isolated subnetwork has a longer decoherence time in the high-fidelity limit, thus providing a particularly relevant candidate for a quantum memory.</description>

      <title>Welfare and Cost Aggregation for Multi-Agent Control: When to Choose Which Social Cost Function, and Why?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many multi-agent socio-technical systems rely on aggregating heterogeneous agents' costs into a social cost function (SCF) to coordinate resource allocation in domains like energy grids, water allocation, or traffic management. The choice of SCF often entails implicit assumptions and may lead to undesirable outcomes if not rigorously justified. In this paper, we demonstrate that what determines which SCF ought to be used is the degree to which individual costs can be compared across agents and which axioms the aggregation shall fulfill. Drawing on the results from social choice theory, we provide guidance on how this process can be used in control applications. We demonstrate which assumptions about interpersonal utility comparability -- ranging from ordinal level comparability to full cardinal comparability -- together with a choice of desirable axioms, inform the selection of a correct SCF, be it the classical utilitarian sum, the Nash SCF, or maximin. We then demonstrate how the proposed framework can be applied for principled allocations of water and transportation resources.</description>

      <title>Validation of Neural Network Controllers for Uncertain Systems Through Keep-Close Approach: Robustness Analysis and Safety Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.06532v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Among the major challenges in neural control system technology is the validation and certification of the safety and robustness of neural network (NN) controllers against various uncertainties including unmodelled dynamics, nonlinearities, and time delays. One way in providing such validation guarantees is to maintain the closed-loop system output with a NN controller when its input changes within a bounded set, close to the output of a robustly performing closed-loop reference model. This paper presents a novel approach to analysing the performance and robustness of uncertain feedback systems with NN controllers. Due to the complexity of analysing such systems, the problem is reformulated as the problem of dynamical tracking errors between the closed-loop system with a neural controller and an ideal closed-loop reference model. Then, the approximation of the controller error is characterised by adopting the differential mean value theorem (DMV) and the Integral Quadratic Constraints (IQCs) technique. Moreover, the Relative Integral Square Error (RISE) and the Supreme Square Error (SSE) bounded set are derived for the output of the error dynamical system. The analysis is then performed by integrating Lyapunov theory with the IQCs-based technique. The resulting worst-case analysis provides the user a prior knowledge about the worst case of RISE and SSE between the reference closed-loop model and the uncertain system controlled by the neural controller.</description>

      <title>Learning Soft Constrained MPC Value Functions: Efficient MPC Design and Implementation providing Stability and Safety Guarantees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07780v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) can be applied to safety-critical control problems, providing closed-loop safety and performance guarantees. Implementation of MPC controllers requires solving an optimization problem at every sampling instant, which is challenging to execute on embedded hardware. To address this challenge, we propose a framework that combines a tightened soft constrained MPC formulation with supervised learning to approximate the MPC value function. This combination enables us to obtain a corresponding optimal control law, which can be implemented efficiently on embedded platforms. The framework ensures stability and constraint satisfaction for various nonlinear systems. While the design effort is similar to that of nominal MPC, the proposed formulation provides input-to-state stability (ISS) with respect to the approximation error of the value function. Furthermore, we prove that the value function corresponding to the soft constrained MPC problem is Lipschitz continuous for Lipschitz continuous systems, even if the optimal control law may be discontinuous. This serves two purposes: First, it allows to relate approximation errors to a sufficiently large constraint tightening to obtain constraint satisfaction guarantees. Second, it paves the way for an efficient supervised learning procedure to obtain a continuous value function approximation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method using a nonlinear numerical example.</description>

      <title>Exploring Adversarial Threat Models in Cyber Physical Battery Systems</title>

Abstract: Technological advancements like the Internet of Things (IoT) have facilitated data exchange across various platforms. This data exchange across various platforms has transformed the traditional battery system into a cyber physical system. Such connectivity makes modern cyber physical battery systems vulnerable to cyber threats where a cyber attacker can manipulate sensing and actuation signals to bring the battery system into an unsafe operating condition. Hence, it is essential to build resilience in modern cyber physical battery systems (CPBS) under cyber attacks. The first step of building such resilience is to analyze potential adversarial behavior, that is, how the adversaries can inject attacks into the battery systems. However, it has been found that in this under-explored area of battery cyber physical security, such an adversarial threat model has not been studied in a systematic manner. In this study, we address this gap and explore adversarial attack generation policies based on optimal control framework. The framework is developed by performing theoretical analysis, which is subsequently supported by evaluation with experimental data generated from a commercial battery cell.</description>

      <title>A PAC-Bayesian Framework for Optimal Control with Stability Guarantees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17790v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic Nonlinear Optimal Control (SNOC) involves minimizing a cost function that averages out the random uncertainties affecting the dynamics of nonlinear systems. For tractability reasons, this problem is typically addressed by minimizing an empirical cost, which represents the average cost across a finite dataset of sampled disturbances. However, this approach raises the challenge of quantifying the control performance against out-of-sample uncertainties. Particularly, in scenarios where the training dataset is small, SNOC policies are prone to overfitting, resulting in significant discrepancies between the empirical cost and the true cost, i.e., the average SNOC cost incurred during control deployment. Therefore, establishing generalization bounds on the true cost is crucial for ensuring reliability in real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that leverages PAC-Bayes theory to provide rigorous generalization bounds for SNOC. Based on these bounds, we propose a new method for designing optimal controllers, offering a principled way to incorporate prior knowledge into the synthesis process, which aids in improving the control policy and mitigating overfitting. Furthermore, by leveraging recent parametrizations of stabilizing controllers for nonlinear systems, our framework inherently ensures closed-loop stability. The effectiveness of our proposed method in incorporating prior knowledge and combating overfitting is shown by designing neural network controllers for tasks in cooperative robotics.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Modeling of Linearizable Power Flow for Large-scale Grid Topology Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective power flow (PF) modeling critically affects the solution accuracy and computational complexity of large-scale grid optimization problems. Especially for grid optimization involving flexible topology to enhance resilience, obtaining a tractable yet accurate approximation of nonlinear AC-PF is essential. This work puts forth a data-driven approach to obtain piecewise linear (PWL) PF approximation using an innovative neural network (NN) architecture, effectively aligning with the inherent generative structure of AC-PF equations. Accordingly, our proposed generative NN (GenNN) method directly incorporates binary topology variables, efficiently enabling a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) formulation for grid optimization tasks like optimal transmission switching (OTS) and restoration ordering problems (ROP). To attain model scalability for large-scale applications, we develop an area-partitioning-based sparsification approach by using fixed-size areas to attain a linear growth rate of model parameters, as opposed to the quadratic one of existing work. Numerical tests on the IEEE 118-bus and 6716-bus synthetic Texas grid demonstrate that our sparse GenNN achieves superior accuracy and computational efficiency, substantially outperforming existing approaches in large-scale PF modeling and topology optimization.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based Model Predictive Control for Piecewise Affine Systems with Feasibility Guarantees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Online model predictive control (MPC) for piecewise affine (PWA) systems requires the online solution to an optimization problem that implicitly optimizes over the switching sequence of PWA regions, for which the computational burden can be prohibitive. Alternatively, the computation can be moved offline using explicit MPC; however, the online memory requirements and the offline computation can then become excessive. In this work we propose a solution in between online and explicit MPC, addressing the above issues by partially dividing the computation between online and offline. To solve the underlying MPC problem, a policy, learned offline, specifies the sequence of PWA regions that the dynamics must follow, thus reducing the complexity of the remaining optimization problem that solves over only the continuous states and control inputs. We provide a condition, verifiable during learning, that guarantees feasibility of the learned policy's output, such that an optimal continuous control input can always be found online. Furthermore, a method for iteratively generating training data offline allows the feasible policy to be learned efficiently, reducing the offline computational burden. A numerical experiment demonstrates the effectiveness of the method compared to both online and explicit MPC.</description>

      <title>Betting vs. Trading: Learning a Linear Decision Policy for Selling Wind Power and Hydrogen</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a bidding strategy for a hybrid power plant combining co-located wind turbines and an electrolyzer, constructing a price-quantity bidding curve for the day-ahead electricity market while optimally scheduling hydrogen production. Without risk management, single imbalance pricing leads to an all-or-nothing trading strategy, which we term 'betting'. To address this, we propose a data-driven, pragmatic approach that leverages contextual information to train linear decision policies for both power bidding and hydrogen scheduling. By introducing explicit risk constraints to limit imbalances, we move from the all-or-nothing approach to a 'trading" strategy', where the plant diversifies its power trading decisions. We evaluate the model under three scenarios: when the plant is either conditionally allowed, always allowed, or not allowed to buy power from the grid, which impacts the green certification of the hydrogen produced. Comparing our data-driven strategy with an oracle model that has perfect foresight, we show that the risk-constrained, data-driven approach delivers satisfactory performance.</description>

Abstract: Remote driving of vehicles is gaining in importance in the transportation sector, especially when Automated Driving Systems (ADSs) reach the limits of their system boundaries. This study investigates the challenges faced by human Remote Drivers (RDs) during remote driving, particularly focusing on the identification and classification of human performance-related challenges through a comprehensive analysis of real-world remote driving data Las Vegas. For this purpose, a total of 183 RD performance-related Safety Driver (SD) interventions were analyzed and classified using an introduced severity classification. As it is essential to prevent the need for SD interventions, this study identified and analyzed harsh driving events to detect an increased likelihood of interventions by the SD. In addition, the results of the subjective RD questionnaire are used to evaluate whether the objective metrics from SD interventions and harsh driving events can also be confirmed by the RDs and whether additional challenges can be uncovered. The analysis reveals learning curves, showing a significant decrease in SD interventions as RD experience increases. Early phases of remote driving experience, especially below 200 km of experience, showed the highest frequency of safety-related events, including braking late for traffic signs and responding impatiently to other traffic participants. Over time, RDs follow defined rules for improving their control, with experience leading to less harsh braking, acceleration, and steering maneuvers. The study contributes to understanding the requirements of RDS, emphasizing the importance of targeted training to address human performance limitations. It further highlights the need for system improvements to address challenges like latency and the limited haptic feedback replaced by visual feedback, which affect the RDs' perception and vehicle control.</description>

      <title>On the Reachability of 3-Dimensional Paths with a Prescribed Curvature Bound</title>

Abstract: This paper presents the reachability analysis of curves in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with a prescribed curvature bound. Based on Pontryagin Maximum Principle, we leverage the existing knowledge on the structure of solutions to minimum-time problems, or Markov-Dubins problem, to reachability considerations. Based on this development, two types of reachability are discussed. First, we prove that any boundary point of the reachability set, with the directional component taken into account as well as geometric coordinates, can be reached via curves of H, CSC, CCC, or their respective subsegments, where H denotes a helicoidal arc, C a circular arc with maximum curvature, and S a straight segment. Second, we show that the reachability set when directional component is not considered\textemdash{}the position reachability set\textemdash{}is simply a solid of revolution of its two-dimensional counterpart, the Dubins car. These findings extend the developments presented in literature on Dubins car into spatial curves in $\mathbb{R}^3$.</description>

      <title>Polytope Volume Monitoring Problem: Formulation and Solution via Parametric Linear Program Based Control Barrier Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the latest research on feasible space monitoring of multiple control barrier functions (CBFs) as well as polytopic collision avoidance, this paper studies the Polytope Volume Monitoring (PVM) problem, whose goal is to design a control law for inputs of nonlinear systems to prevent the volume of some state-dependent polytope from decreasing to zero. Recent studies have explored the idea of applying Chebyshev ball method in optimization theory to solve the case study of PVM; however, the underlying difficulties caused by nonsmoothness have not been addressed. This paper continues the study on this topic, where our main contribution is to establish the relationship between nonsmooth CBF and parametric optimization theory through directional derivatives for the first time, so as to solve PVM problems more conveniently. In detail, inspired by Chebyshev ball approach, a parametric linear program (PLP) based nonsmooth barrier function candidate is established for PVM, and then, sufficient conditions for it to be a nonsmooth CBF are proposed, based on which a quadratic program (QP) based safety filter with guaranteed feasibility is proposed to address PVM problems. Finally, a numerical simulation example is given to show the efficiency of the proposed safety filter.</description>
