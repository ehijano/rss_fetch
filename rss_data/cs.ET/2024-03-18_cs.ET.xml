Abstract: In the last few years, a very original concept of holographic communication has gained a lot of interest among scientists from all over the world. The specificity of this approach, on the one hand, is very different from the known and currently used solutions, on the other hand, it creates great development opportunities in the field of wireless communication. The article provides an overview of two technological solutions that gave rise to the idea of holographic communication. First, the possibility of using the so-called metamaterials for the purposes of wireless data transmission, and the second, the use of reconfigurable antenna surfaces. The last part presents the assumptions of the idea of holographic communication, in which the principles of creating images known from optical holography have been transferred to the radio band, and to some extend, generalized.</description>

      <title>Forging the Industrial Metaverse - Where Industry 5.0, Augmented and Mixed Reality, IIoT, Opportunistic Edge Computing and Digital Twins Meet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Metaverse is a concept that proposes to immerse users into real-time rendered 3D content virtual worlds delivered through Extended Reality (XR) devices like Augmented and Mixed Reality (AR/MR) smart glasses and Virtual Reality (VR) headsets. When the Metaverse concept is applied to industrial environments, it is called Industrial Metaverse, a hybrid world where industrial operators work by using some of the latest technologies. Currently, such technologies are related to the ones fostered by Industry 4.0, which is evolving towards Industry 5.0, a paradigm that enhances Industry 4.0 by creating a sustainable and resilient world of industrial human-centric applications. The Industrial Metaverse can benefit from Industry 5.0, since it implies making use of dynamic and up-to-date content, as well as fast human-to-machine interactions. To enable such enhancements, this article proposes the concept of Meta-Operator: an Industry 5.0 worker that interacts with Industrial Metaverse applications and with his/her surroundings through advanced XR devices. This article provides a description of the technologies that support Meta-Operators: the main components of the Industrial Metaverse, the latest XR technologies and the use of Opportunistic Edge Computing communications (to interact with surrounding IoT/IioT devices). Moreover, this paper analyzes how to create the next generation of Industrial Metaverse applications based on Industry 5.0, including the integration of AR/MR devices with IoT/IIoT solutions, the development of advanced communications or the creation of shared experiences. Finally, this article provides a list of potential Industry 5.0 applications for the Industrial Metaverse and analyzes the main challenges and research lines. Thus, this article provides useful guidelines for the researchers that will create the next generation of applications for the Industrial Metaverse.</description>

      <title>FedQNN: Federated Learning using Quantum Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the innovative domain of Quantum Federated Learning (QFL) as a framework for training Quantum Machine Learning (QML) models via distributed networks. Conventional machine learning models frequently grapple with issues about data privacy and the exposure of sensitive information. Our proposed Federated Quantum Neural Network (FedQNN) framework emerges as a cutting-edge solution, integrating the singular characteristics of QML with the principles of classical federated learning. This work thoroughly investigates QFL, underscoring its capability to secure data handling in a distributed environment and facilitate cooperative learning without direct data sharing. Our research corroborates the concept through experiments across varied datasets, including genomics and healthcare, thereby validating the versatility and efficacy of our FedQNN framework. The results consistently exceed 86% accuracy across three distinct datasets, proving its suitability for conducting various QML tasks. Our research not only identifies the limitations of classical paradigms but also presents a novel framework to propel the field of QML into a new era of secure and collaborative innovation.</description>

      <title>Multi-controlled Phase Gate Synthesis with ZX-calculus applied to Neutral Atom Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum circuit synthesis describes the process of converting arbitrary unitary operations into a gate sequence of a fixed universal gate set, usually defined by the operations native to a given hardware platform. Most current synthesis algorithms are designed to synthesize towards a set of single qubit rotations and an additional entangling two qubit gate, such as CX, CZ, or the Molmer Sorensen gate. However, with the emergence of neutral atom based hardware and their native support for gates with more than two qubits, synthesis approaches tailored to these new gate sets become necessary. In this work, we present an approach to synthesize multi controlled phase gates using ZX calculus. By representing quantum circuits as graph like ZX diagrams, one can utilize the distinct graph structure of diagonal gates to identify multi controlled phase gates inherently present in some quantum circuits even if none were explicitly defined in the original circuit. We evaluate the approach on a wide range of benchmark circuits and compare them to the standard Qiskit synthesis regarding its circuit execution time for neutral atom based hardware with native support of multi controlled gates. Our results show possible advantages for current state of the art hardware and represent the first exact synthesis algorithm supporting arbitrary sized multi controlled phase gates.</description>

      <title>Regulating Chatbot Output via Inter-Informational Competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of ChatGPT has sparked over a year of regulatory frenzy. However, few existing studies have rigorously questioned the assumption that, if left unregulated, AI chatbot's output would inflict tangible, severe real harm on human affairs. Most researchers have overlooked the critical possibility that the information market itself can effectively mitigate these risks and, as a result, they tend to use regulatory tools to address the issue directly. This Article develops a yardstick for reevaluating both AI-related content risks and corresponding regulatory proposals by focusing on inter-informational competition among various outlets. The decades-long history of regulating information and communications technologies indicates that regulators tend to err too much on the side of caution and to put forward excessive regulatory measures when encountering the uncertainties brought about by new technologies. In fact, a trove of empirical evidence has demonstrated that market competition among information outlets can effectively mitigate most risks and that overreliance on regulation is not only unnecessary but detrimental, as well. This Article argues that sufficient competition among chatbots and other information outlets in the information marketplace can sufficiently mitigate and even resolve most content risks posed by generative AI technologies. This renders certain loudly advocated regulatory strategies, like mandatory prohibitions, licensure, curation of datasets, and notice-and-response regimes, truly unnecessary and even toxic to desirable competition and innovation throughout the AI industry. Ultimately, the ideas that I advance in this Article should pour some much-needed cold water on the regulatory frenzy over generative AI and steer the issue back to a rational track.</description>

      <title>Interference Cancellation for OTFS-Based Over-the-Air Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates over-the-air computation (AirComp) in the context of multiple-access time-varying multipath channels. We focus on a scenario where devices with high mobility transmit their sensing data to a fusion center (FC) for averaging. To combat the time-varying channel and Doppler effect, each device adopts orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation. After signals are received by the FC, the aggregated data undergoes demodulation and estimation within the delay-Doppler domain. We leverage the mean squared error (MSE) as a metric for the computational error of OTFS-based AirComp. We then derive the optimal transmit power at each device and signal scaling factor at FC for minimizing MSE. Notably, the performance of OTFS-based AirComp is not only affected by the noise but also by the inter-symbol interference and inter-link interference arising from the multipath channel. To counteract the interference-induced computational errors, we incorporate zero-padding (ZP)-assisted OTFS into AirComp and propose algorithms for interference cancellation. Numerical results underscore the enhanced performance of ZP-assisted OTFS-based AirComp over naive OTFS-based AirComp.</description>

      <title>Reasoning Abilities of Large Language Models: In-Depth Analysis on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existing methods for evaluating the inference abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have been results-centric, making it difficult to assess the inference process. We introduce a new approach using the Abstract and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) dataset to evaluate the inference and contextual understanding abilities of large language models in a process-centric manner. ARC demands rigorous logical structures for problem-solving, making it a benchmark that facilitates the comparison of model inference abilities with humans. Experimental results confirm that while large language models possess weak inference abilities, they still lag in terms of logical coherence, compositionality, and productivity. Our experiments highlight the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, proposing development paths for achieving human-level reasoning.</description>

      <title>FEDORA: Flying Event Dataset fOr Reactive behAvior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.14392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability of resource-constrained biological systems such as fruitflies to perform complex and high-speed maneuvers in cluttered environments has been one of the prime sources of inspiration for developing vision-based autonomous systems. To emulate this capability, the perception pipeline of such systems must integrate information cues from tasks including optical flow and depth estimation, object detection and tracking, and segmentation, among others. However, the conventional approach of employing slow, synchronous inputs from standard frame-based cameras constrains these perception capabilities, particularly during high-speed maneuvers. Recently, event-based sensors have emerged as low latency and low energy alternatives to standard frame-based cameras for capturing high-speed motion, effectively speeding up perception and hence navigation. For coherence, all the perception tasks must be trained on the same input data. However, present-day datasets are curated mainly for a single or a handful of tasks and are limited in the rate of the provided ground truths. To address these limitations, we present Flying Event Dataset fOr Reactive behAviour (FEDORA) - a fully synthetic dataset for perception tasks, with raw data from frame-based cameras, event-based cameras, and Inertial Measurement Units (IMU), along with ground truths for depth, pose, and optical flow at a rate much higher than existing datasets.</description>

      <title>Spike-based Neuromorphic Computing for Next-Generation Computer Vision</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neuromorphic Computing promises orders of magnitude improvement in energy efficiency compared to traditional von Neumann computing paradigm. The goal is to develop an adaptive, fault-tolerant, low-footprint, fast, low-energy intelligent system by learning and emulating brain functionality which can be realized through innovation in different abstraction layers including material, device, circuit, architecture and algorithm. As the energy consumption in complex vision tasks keep increasing exponentially due to larger data set and resource-constrained edge devices become increasingly ubiquitous, spike-based neuromorphic computing approaches can be viable alternative to deep convolutional neural network that is dominating the vision field today. In this book chapter, we introduce neuromorphic computing, outline a few representative examples from different layers of the design stack (devices, circuits and algorithms) and conclude with a few exciting applications and future research directions that seem promising for computer vision in the near future.</description>

      <title>QAOA with random and subgraph phase operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a promising quantum algorithm that can be used to approximately solve combinatorial optimization problems. The usual QAOA ansatz consists of an alternating application of the cost and mixer Hamiltonians. In this work, we study how using Hamiltonians other than the usual cost Hamiltonian, dubbed custom phase operators, can affect the performance of QAOA. We derive an expected value formula for QAOA with custom phase operators at p = 1 and show numerically that some of these custom phase operators can achieve higher approximation ratio than the original algorithm implementation. Out of all the graphs tested, 0.036\% of the random custom phase operators, 75.9\% of the subgraph custom phase operators, 95.1\% of the triangle-removed custom phase operators, and 93.9\% of the maximal degree edge-removed custom phase operators have a higher approximation ratio than the original QAOA implementation. This finding opens up the question of whether better phase operators can be designed to further improve the performance of QAOA.</description>
