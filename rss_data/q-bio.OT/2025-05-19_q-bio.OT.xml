      <title>British Automobiles, Aging Theory, and the Death of Complex Machines</title>

Abstract: Machines provide a longstanding model for how organisms accumulate damage, age, and die. However, the large-scale observation and analysis of complex machine populations under real-world conditions is routinely missing from this framework. Here, we analyze survival and repair patterns in sixty-five million complex machines to reveal fundamental challenges to our theories of biomechanical aging. We measure the reliability, survival, and mechanical failure rates of every privately registered used vehicle in Britain from 2005-2021, using comprehensive samples from 397 million mandatory annual inspections and billions of accompanying repair records. These data reveal that vehicle survival patterns are not a fixed outcome of mechanical reliability or accumulated physical 'wear-and-tear' but display non-aging and anti-aging patterns of survival. These patterns are robust to multiple reanalyses and remain after correcting for diverse external and mechanical predictors of mortality rate using survival forests. These findings challenge the perception of aging as an inevitable and cumulative physical phenomenon, complicate our longstanding comparison of organisms to machines, and highlight exciting new pathways to study the evolution of death in complex systems.</description>

      <title>In-host modeling challenges using population approach methods</title>

Abstract: Non-linear mixed effects models are widely used to estimate parameter estimates in the field of pharmacometrics across pharmaceutical industry, US regulatory agencies and academia. The preciseness of the parameter estimate is evaluated using relative standard error (RSE) with a threshold of &lt;50% considered as 'precisely estimated'. Here we investigate the use of this metric alone in Monolix to calibrate a recently published in-host mathematical model for hepatitis D virus (HDV) with our own longitudinal data obtained from patients treated with HDV-entry inhibitor bulevirtide (BLV) monotherapy for up to 96 weeks. We identified substantial discordance between Monolix calibration output, measured longitudinal data and the HDV model despite the fact that Monolix parameters had a RSE &lt;50%, suggesting that model parameters were estimated with precision. Surprisingly, while Monolix suggested precise parameter estimates based on RSE&lt;50%, the correlation matrix in Monolix indicated a strong inverse correlation between BLV efficacy and the loss rate of HDV-infected cells raising identifiability issues. Furthermore, the fits failed to reproduce HDV kinetics accurately in the majority of patients (i.e., poor goodness of fit). Lastly, the estimated pretreatment serum HDV level varied significantly from measured observations. In summary, we demonstrate that even when RSE was &lt;50%, other outputs such as the correlation matrix, confidence intervals and goodness of fit at both the individual and population level need to be checked for accuracy to accept or refine a proposed model.</description>
