      <title>Thermodynamic bounds on generalized transport: From single-molecule to bulk observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the transport of any scalar observable in $d$-dimensional non-equilibrium systems is bounded from above by the total entropy production scaled by the amount the observation "stretches" microscopic coordinates. The result -- a time-integrated generalized speed limit -- reflects the thermodynamic cost of transport of observables, and places underdamped and overdamped stochastic dynamics on equal footing with deterministic motion. Our work allows for stochastic thermodynamics to make contact with bulk experiments, and fills an important gap in thermodynamic inference, since microscopic dynamics is, at least for short times, underdamped. Requiring only averages but not sample-to-sample fluctuations, the proven transport bound is practical and applicable not only to single-molecule but also bulk experiments where only averages are observed, which we demonstrate by examples. Our results may facilitate thermodynamic inference on molecular machines without an obvious directionality from bulk observations of transients probed, e.g. in time-resolved X-ray scattering.</description>

      <title>Revisiting log-periodic oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is inspired by a recent study of a two-dimensional stochastic fragmentation model. We show that the configurational entropy of this model exhibits log-periodic oscillations as a function of the sample size, by exploiting an exact recursion relation for the numbers of its jammed configurations. This is seemingly the first statistical-mechanical model where log-periodic oscillations affect the size dependence of an extensive quantity. We then propose and investigate in great depth a one-dimensional analogue of the fragmentation model. This one-dimensional model possesses a critical point, separating a strong-coupling phase where the free energy is super-extensive from a weak-coupling one where the free energy is extensive and exhibits log-periodic oscillations. This model is generalized to a family of one-dimensional models with two integer parameters, which exhibit essentially the same phenomenology.</description>

      <title>The first law of thermodynamics in hydrodynamic steady and unsteady flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We studied planar compressible flows of ideal gas as models of a non-equilibrium thermodynamic system. We demonstrate that internal energy $U(S^{*},V,N)$ of such systems in stationary and non-stationary states is the function of only three parameters of state, i.e. non-equilibrium entropy $S^{*}$, volume $V$ and number of particles $N$ in the system. Upon transition between different states, the system obeys the first thermodynamic law, i.e. $dU=T^{*}dS^{*}-p^{*}dV+{\mu}^{*}dN$, where $U=3/2 NRT^{*}$ and $p^{*}V=NRT^{*}$. Placing a cylinder inside the channel, we find that U depends on the location of the cylinder $y_{c}$ only via the parameters of state, i.e. $U(S^{*}(y_{c}),V,N(y_{c}))$ at V=const. Moreover, when the flow around the cylinder becomes unstable, and velocity, pressure, and density start to oscillate as a function of time, t, U depends on t only via the parameters of state, i.e. $U(S^{*}(t),V,N(t))$ for V=const. These examples show that such a form of internal energy is robust and does not depend on the particular boundary conditions even in the unsteady flow.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control of Underdamped Systems: An Analytic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal control theory deals with finding protocols to steer a system between assigned initial and final states, such that a trajectory-dependent cost function is minimized. The application of optimal control to stochastic systems is an open and challenging research frontier, with a spectrum of applications ranging from stochastic thermodynamics, to biophysics and data science. Among these, the design of nanoscale electronic components motivates the study of underdamped dynamics, leading to practical and conceptual difficulties.
  In this work, we develop analytic techniques to determine protocols steering finite time transitions at minimum dissipation for stochastic underdamped dynamics. For transitions between Gaussian states, we prove that optimal protocols satisfy a Lyapunov equation, a central tool in stability analysis of dynamical systems. For transitions between states described by general Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions, we introduce an infinite-dimensional version of the Poincar\'e-Linstedt multiscale perturbation theory around the overdamped limit. This technique fundamentally improves the standard multiscale expansion. Indeed, it enables the explicit computation of momentum cumulants, whose variation in time is a distinctive trait of underdamped dynamics and is directly accessible to experimental observation. Our results allow us to numerically study cost asymmetries in expansion and compression processes and make predictions for inertial corrections to optimal protocols in the Landauer erasure problem at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Simulations of Classical Three-Body Thermalization in One Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One-dimensional systems, such as nanowires or electrons moving along strong magnetic field lines, have peculiar thermalization physics. The binary collision of point-like particles, typically the dominant process for reaching thermal equilibrium in higher dimensional systems, cannot thermalize a 1D system. We study how dilute classical 1D gases thermalize through three-body collisions. We consider a system of identical classical point particles with pairwise repulsive inverse power-law potential $V_{ij} \propto 1/|x_i-x_j|^n$ or the pairwise Lennard-Jones potential. Using Monte Carlo methods, we compute a collision kernel and use it in the Boltzmann equation to evolve a perturbed thermal state with temperature $T$ toward equilibrium. We explain the shape of the kernel and its dependence on the system parameters. Additionally, we implement molecular dynamics simulations of a many-body gas and show agreement with the Boltzmann evolution in the low density limit. For the inverse power-law potential, the rate of thermalization is proportional to $\rho^2 T^{\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{n}}$ where $\rho$ is the number density. The corresponding proportionality constant decreases with increasing $n$.</description>

      <title>Enabling large-depth simulation of noisy quantum circuits with positive tensor networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matrix product density operators (MPDOs) are tensor network representations of locally purified density matrices where each physical degree of freedom is associated to an environment degree of freedom. MPDOs have interesting properties for mixed state representations: guaranteed positivity by construction, efficient conservation of the trace and computation of local observables. However, they have been challenging to use for noisy quantum circuit simulation, as the application of noise increases the dimension of the environment Hilbert space, leading to an exponential growth of bond dimensions. MPDOs also lack a unique canonical form, due to the freedom in the choice of basis for the environment Hilbert space, which leads to a vast variation of bond dimensions.
  In this work, we present a systematic way to reduce the bond dimensions of MPDOs by disentangling the purified state. We optimize the basis for the environment Hilbert space by performing density matrix renormalization group (DMRG)-like sweeps of local 2-qubit basis optimization. Interestingly, we find that targeting only the disentanglement of the purified state leads to a reduction of the environment dimension. In other words, a compact MPDO representation requires a low-entanglement purified state.
  We apply our compression method to the emulation of noisy random quantum circuits. Our technique allows us to keep bounded bond dimensions, and thus bounded memory, contrary to previous works on MPDOs, while keeping reasonable truncation fidelities.</description>

      <title>The evolution of pluralistic ignorance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pluralistic ignorance is a social-psychological phenomenon characterized by individuals privately maintaining beliefs or opinions that diverge from what they perceive to be the prevailing norm within a group or society. Typical models are based on opinion dynamics involving both private and public states, where agents' binary states undergo changes influenced by social pressure. However, these models overlook a crucial aspect of pluralistic ignorance: if the absence of behavioral expression matches the normative status of the behavior, social pressure exerted by the initial group configuration is enough to induce pluralistic ignorance. Here, we show that pluralistic ignorance is maintained if imitation of others is not too frequent and the social influence of the initial minority is high. Interestingly, the individuals are able to overcome the pluralistic ignorance by the end of interactions, yet it resurfaces at the outset of each subsequent group interaction. However, if the likelihood of individuals imitating others becomes excessively high, pluralistic ignorance completely dissipates in an undesirable manner: individuals internalize the dysfunctional behavior. We also show that, if memory is added to the internalization process, pluralistic ignorance reaches high levels only for intermediate imitation rates.</description>

      <title>Unifying Collisional Models and the Monte Carlo Metropolis Method: Algorithms for Dynamics of Open Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical systems placed in contact with a thermal bath will inevitably equilibrate to a thermal state at the bath temperature. The same is not generally true for open quantum systems, which place additional conditions on the structure of the bath and system-bath interaction if thermalization is to occur. Collisional models, or repeated interaction schemes, are a category of microscopic open quantum system models that have seen growing use in studying quantum thermalization, in which the bath is modeled as a large ensemble of identical ancilla systems that sequentially interact with the system. We demonstrate that, when each bath ancilla is prepared in a thermal state with a discrete spectrum that matches the energy eigenstate transitions of the system, the system dynamics generated by the collisional model framework are identical to those generated under the Metropolis algorithm. This equivalence holds not just in the steady state regime, but also in the transient regime. As the Metropolis scheme does not require explicitly modeling the system-bath interaction, this allows it to be used as a computationally efficient alternative for simulating collisional model dynamics.</description>

      <title>Geometry-free renormalization of directed networks: scale-invariance and reciprocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent research has tried to extend the concept of renormalization, which is naturally defined for geometric objects, to more general networks with arbitrary topology. The current attempts do not naturally apply to directed networks, for instance because they are based on the identification of (necessarily symmetric) inter-node distances arising from geometric embeddings or on the definition of Hermitian Laplacian operators requiring symmetric adjacency matrices in spectral approaches. Here we show that the Scale-Invariant Model, recently proposed as an approach to consistently model undirected networks at arbitrary (and possibly multi-scale) resolution levels, can be extended coherently to directed networks without the requirement of an embedding geometry or Laplacian structure. Moreover, it can account for nontrivial reciprocity, i.e. the empirically well-documented tendency of links to occur in mutual pairs more or less often than predicted by chance. After deriving the renormalization rules for networks with arbitrary reciprocity, we consider various examples. In particular we propose the first multiscale model of the international trade network with nontrivial reciprocity and an annealed model where positive reciprocity emerges spontaneously from coarse-graining. In the latter case, the renormalization process defines a group, not only a semigroup, and therefore allows to fine-grain networks to arbitrarily small scales. These results strengthen the notion that network renormalization can be defined in a much more general way than required by geometric or spectral approaches, because it needs only node-specific (metric-free) features and can coexist with the asymmetry of directed networks.</description>

      <title>Transforming Design Spaces Using Pareto-Laplace Filters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimization is a critical tool for addressing a broad range of human and technical problems. However, the paradox of advanced optimization techniques is that they have maximum utility for problems in which the relationship between the structure of the problem and the ultimate solution is the most obscure. The existence of solution with limited insight contrasts with techniques that have been developed for a broad range of engineering problems where integral transform techniques yield solutions and insight in tandem. Here, we present a ``Pareto-Laplace'' integral transform framework that can be applied to problems typically studied via optimization. We show that the framework admits related geometric, statistical, and physical representations that provide new forms of insight into relationships between objectives and outcomes. We argue that some known approaches are special cases of this framework, and point to a broad range of problems for further application.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we introduce a generalization of the Landauer bound for erasure processes that stems from absolutely irreversible dynamics. Assuming that the erasure process is carried out in an absolutely irreversible way so that the probability of observing some trajectories is zero in the forward process but finite in the reverse process, we derive a generalized form of the bound for the average erasure work, which is valid also for imperfect erasure and asymmetric bits. The generalized bound obtained is tighter or, at worst, as tight as existing ones. Our theoretical predictions are supported by numerical experiments and the comparison with data from previous works.</description>

      <title>Effective interaction between guest charges immersed in 2D jellium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The model under study is an infinite 2D jellium of pointlike particles with elementary charge $e$, interacting via the logarithmic potential and in thermal equilibrium at the inverse temperature $\beta$. Two cases of the coupling constant $\Gamma\equiv \beta e^2$ are considered: the Debye-H\"uckel limit $\Gamma\to 0$ and the free-fermion point $\Gamma=2$. In the most general formulation, two guest particles, the one with charge $q e$ (the valence $q$ being an arbitrary integer) and the hard core of radius $\sigma&gt;0$ and the pointlike one with elementary charge $e$, are immersed in the bulk of the jellium at distance $d\ge \sigma$. Two problems are of interest: the asymptotic large-distance behavior of the excess charge density induced in the jellium and the effective interaction between the guest particles. Technically, the induced charge density and the effective interaction are expressed in terms of multi-particle correlations of the pure (translationally invariant) jellium system. It is shown that the separation form of the induced charge density onto its radial and angle parts, observed previously in the limit $\Gamma\to 0$, is not reproduced at the coupling $\Gamma=2$. Based on an exact expression for the effective interaction between guest particles at $\Gamma=2$, oppositely ($q=0,-1,-2,\ldots$) charged guest particles always attract one another while likely ($q=1,2,\ldots$) charged guest particles repeal one another up to a certain distance $d$ between them and then the mutual attraction takes place up to asymptotically large (finite) distances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.02644v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Confining in space the equilibrium fluctuations of statistical systems with long-range correlations is known to result into effective forces on the boundaries. Here we demonstrate the occurrence of Casimir-like forces in the non-equilibrium context provided by flocking active matter. In particular, we consider a system of aligning self-propelled particles in two spatial dimensions, which are transversally confined by reflecting or partially reflecting walls. We show that in the ordered flocking phase this confined active vectorial fluid is characterized by extensive boundary layers, as opposed to the finite ones usually observed in confined scalar active matter. Moreover, a finite-size,fluctuation-induced contribution to the pressure on the wall emerges, which decays slowly and algebraically upon increasing the distance between the walls. We explain our findings, which display a certain degree of universality, within a hydrodynamic description of the density and velocity fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.08914v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study five-point correlation functions of scalar operators in d-dimensional conformal field theories. We develop a new approach to computing the five-point conformal blocks for exchanged primary operators of arbitrary spin by introducing a generalization of radial coordinates, using an appropriate ansatz, and perturbatively solving two quadratic Casimir differential equations. We then study five-point correlators $\langle \sigma \sigma \epsilon \sigma \sigma \rangle$ in the critical 3d Ising model. We truncate the operator product expansions (OPEs) in the correlator by including a finite number of primary operators with conformal dimension below a cutoff $\Delta \leqslant \Delta_{\rm cutoff}$. We then compute several OPE coefficients involving $\epsilon$ and two spinning operators by demanding that the truncated correlator approximately satisfies the crossing relation.</description>

Abstract: Quantum information scrambling is the dynamical process where initially localized quantum information spreads over diverse degrees of freedom. Out-of-time-order correlators and tripartite mutual information have been utilized as key metrics to investigate scrambling, with a specific emphasis on the long-time asymptotic behavior and the early-time spreading. An open question is the comprehensive clarification of the dynamics of scrambling, covering the intermediate-time regime. Here, by extending the idea of quantum reservoir computing, we propose quantum reservoir probing (QRP) to diagnose scrambling in a unified manner for arbitrary degrees of freedom at arbitrary times, through information estimation performance. As a paradigmatic example, we investigate a one-dimensional quantum Ising chain. We show that the QRP successfully distinguishes between quasiparticle-mediated information propagation in a free fermion system and correlation-mediated scrambling in a quantum chaotic system. Furthermore, by systematically scanning the read-out operators, we can identify the system-specific information propagation channels, a distinct advantage over the conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Quantum many-body thermal machines enabled by atom-atom correlations</title>

Abstract: Particle-particle correlations, characterized by the second-order Glauber correlation function, play an important role in the understanding of various phenomena in radio and optical astronomy, quantum and atom optics, particle physics, condensed matter physics, and quantum many-body theory. However, the relevance of such correlations to quantum thermodynamics has so far remained illusive. Here, we propose and investigate a class of quantum many-body thermal machines whose operation is directly enabled by second-order atom-atom correlations in an ultracold atomic gas. More specifically, we study quantum thermal machines that operate in a sudden interaction-quench Otto cycle and utilize a one-dimensional Lieb-Liniger gas of repulsively interacting bosons as the working fluid. The atom-atom correlations in such a gas are different to those of a classical ideal gas, and are a result of the interplay between interparticle interactions, quantum statistics, and thermal fluctuations. We show that operating these thermal machines in the intended regimes, such as a heat engine, refrigerator, thermal accelerator, or heater, would be impossible without such atom-atom correlations. Our results constitute a step forward in the design of conceptually new quantum thermodynamic devices which take advantage of uniquely quantum resources such as quantum coherence, correlations, and entanglement.</description>

      <title>Surface Phase Diagrams from Nested Sampling</title>

Abstract: Studies in atomic-scale modeling of surface phase equilibria often focus on temperatures near zero Kelvin due to the challenges in calculating the free energy of surfaces at finite temperatures. The Bayesian-inference-based nested sampling (NS) algorithm allows for modeling phase equilibria at arbitrary temperatures by directly and efficiently calculating the partition function, whose relationship with free energy is well known. This work extends NS to calculate adsorbate phase diagrams, incorporating all relevant configurational contributions to the free energy. We apply NS to the adsorption of Lennard-Jones (LJ) gas particles on low-index and vicinal LJ solid surfaces and construct the canonical partition function from these recorded energies to calculate ensemble averages of thermodynamic properties, such as the constant-volume heat capacity and order parameters that characterize the structure of adsorbate phases. Key results include determining the nature of phase transitions of adsorbed LJ particles on flat and stepped LJ surfaces, which typically feature an enthalpy-driven condensation at higher temperatures and an entropy-driven reordering process at lower temperatures, and the effect of surface geometry on the presence of triple points in the phase diagrams. Overall, we demonstrate the ability and potential of NS for surface modeling.</description>

      <title>Probing Hilbert space fragmentation and the block inverse participation ratio</title>

Abstract: We consider a family of quantum many-body Hamiltonians that show exact Hilbert space fragmentation in certain limits. The question arises whether fragmentation has implications for Hamiltonians in the vicinity of the subset defined by these exactly fragmented models, in particular in the thermodynamic limit. We attempt to illuminate this issue by considering distinguishable classes of transitional behavior between fragmented and nonfragmented regimes and employing a set of numerical observables that indicate this transition. As one of these observables we present a modified inverse participation ratio (IPR) that is designed to capture the emergence of fragmented block structures. We compare this block IPR to other definitions of inverse participation ratios, as well as to the more traditional measures of level-spacing statistics and entanglement entropy. In order to resolve subtleties that arise in the numerics, we use perturbation theory around the fragmented limit as a basis for defining an effective block structure. We find that our block IPR predicts a boundary between fragmented and nonfragmented regimes that is compatible with results based on level statistics and bipartite entanglement. A scaling analysis indicates that a finite region around the exactly fragmented limit is dominated by effects of approximate fragmentation, even in the thermodynamic limit, and suggests that fragmentation constitutes a phase. We provide evidence for the universality of our approach by applying it to a different family of Hamiltonians, that features a fragmented limit due to emergent dipole conservation.</description>

      <title>Asymmetry in Polymer-Solvent Interactions Yields Complex Thermoresponsive Behavior</title>

Abstract: Thermoresponsive polymers hold both fundamental and technological importance, but the essential physics driving their intriguing behavior is not wholly understood. We introduce a lattice framework that incorporates elements of Flory-Huggins solution theory and the $q$-state Potts model to study the phase behavior of polymer solutions and single-chain conformational characteristics. Importantly, the framework does not employ any temperature- or composition-dependent parameters. With this minimal Flory-Huggins-Potts framework, we show that orientation-dependent interactions, specifically between monomer segments and solvent particles, are alone sufficient to observe upper critical solution temperatures, miscibility loops, and hourglass-shaped spinodal curves. Signatures of emergent phase behavior are found in single-chain Monte Carlo simulations, which display heating- and cooling-induced coil-globule transitions linked to energy fluctuations. The model also capably describes a range of experimental systems. This work provides new insights regarding the microscopic physics that underpin complex thermoresponsive behavior in polymers.</description>

      <title>Improving the five-point bootstrap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new algorithm for the numerical evaluation of five-point conformal blocks in $d$-dimensions, greatly improving the efficiency of their computation. To do this we use an appropriate ansatz for the blocks as a series expansion in radial coordinates, derive a set of recursion relations for the unknown coefficients in the ansatz, and evaluate the series using a Pad\'e approximant to accelerate its convergence. We then study the $\langle\sigma\sigma\epsilon\sigma\sigma\rangle$ correlator in the 3d critical Ising model by truncating the operator product expansion (OPE) and only including operators with conformal dimension below a cutoff $\Delta\leqslant \Delta_{\rm cutoff}$. We approximate the contributions of the operators above the cutoff by the corresponding contributions in a suitable disconnected five-point correlator. Using this approach, we compute a number of OPE coefficients with greater accuracy than previous methods.</description>
