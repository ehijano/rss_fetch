      <title>Quantifying HiPSC-CM Structural Organization at Scale with Deep Learning-Enhanced SarcGraph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In cardiac cells, structural organization is an important indicator of cell maturity and healthy function. Healthy cardiomyocytes exhibit well-aligned morphology with densely packed and organized sarcomeres. Immature or diseased cardiomyocytes typically lack this organized structure. Critically, human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) offer a valuable model for studying human cardiac cells in a controlled environment. However, these cells often exhibit a disorganized structure. In this work, we extend the SarcGraph computational framework -- designed to assess the structural and functional behavior of hiPSC-CMs -- to better accommodate the structural features of immature cells. There are two key enhancements: (1) incorporating a deep learning-based z-disc classifier, and (2) introducing a novel ensemble graph-scoring approach. These modification significantly reduced false positive sarcomere detections in immature cells, and resulted in the detection of longer myofibrils in mature samples. With this enhanced framework, we analyze an open-source dataset published by the Allen Institute for Cell Science, where, for the first time, we are able to extract key structural features from these data using information from each individually detected sarcomere. Not only are we able to use these structural features to predict expert scores, but we are also able to use these structural features to identify bias in expert scoring and offer an alternative unsupervised learning approach based on explainable clustering. These results demonstrate the efficacy of our modified SarcGraph in extracting biologically meaningful features, enabling a deeper understanding of hiPSC-CM structural integrity. By making our code and tools open-source, we aim to empower the broader cardiac research community and foster further development of computational tools for cardiac tissue analysis.</description>

      <title>Single cell resolution 3D imaging and segmentation within intact live tissues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Epithelial cells form diverse structures from squamous spherical organoids to densely packed pseudostratified tissues. Quantification of cellular properties in these contexts requires high-resolution deep imaging and computational techniques to achieve truthful three-dimensional (3D) structural features. Here, we describe a detailed step-by-step protocol for sample preparation, imaging and deep-learning-assisted cell segmentation to achieve accurate quantification of fluorescently labelled individual cells in 3D within live tissues. We share the lessons learned through troubleshooting 3D imaging of Drosophila wing discs, including considerations on the choice of microscopy modality and settings (objective, sample mounting) and available segmentation methods. In addition, we include a computational pipeline alongside custom code to assist replication of the protocol. While we focus on the segmentation of cell outlines from membrane labelling, this protocol applies to a wide variety of samples, and we believe it be valuable for studying other tissues that demand complex analysis in 3D.</description>

      <title>The role of oscillations in grid cells' toroidal topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Persistent homology applied to the activity of grid cells in the Medial Entorhinal Cortex suggests that this activity lies on a toroidal manifold. By analyzing real data and a simple model, we show that neural oscillations play a key role in the appearance of this toroidal topology. To quantitatively monitor how changes in spike trains influence the topology of the data, we first define a robust measure for the degree of toroidality of a dataset. Using this measure, we find that small perturbations ($\sim$ 100 ms) of spike times have little influence on both the toroidality and the hexagonality of the ratemaps. Jittering spikes by $\sim$ 100-500 ms, however, destroys the toroidal topology, while still having little impact on grid scores. These critical jittering time scales fall in the range of the periods of oscillations between the theta and eta bands. We thus hypothesized that these oscillatory modulations of neuronal spiking play a key role in the appearance and robustness of toroidal topology and the hexagonal spatial selectivity is not sufficient. We confirmed this hypothesis using a simple model for the activity of grid cells, consisting of an ensemble of independent rate-modulated Poisson processes. When these rates were modulated by oscillations, the network behaved similarly to the real data in exhibiting toroidal topology, even when the position of the fields were perturbed. In the absence of oscillations, this similarity was substantially lower. Furthermore, we find that the experimentally recorded spike trains indeed exhibit temporal modulations at the eta and theta bands, and that the ratio of the power in the eta band to that of the theta band, $A_{\eta}/A_{\theta}$, correlates with the critical jittering time at which the toroidal topology disappears.</description>

      <title>A Simple Voltage-Modulated Markov Chain Model for the Piezo1 Ion Channel to Investigate Electromechanical Pacing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Piezo1 ion channels are stretch-activated ion channels involved in a variety of important physiological and pathophysiological processes, as for example cardiovascular development and homeostasis. Since its discovery, it is known that this type of ion channel desensitize when exposed to stretch. However, recent experiments on Piezo1 ion channels have uncovered that their stretch response is qualitatively different when exposed to positive electrochemical driving forces, where the desensitization is reset. In this work, we propose a novel voltage-modulated mathematical model of Piezo1 based on a continuous-time Markov chain. We show that our Piezo1 model is able to quantitatively reproduce a wide range of experimental observations. Furthermore, we integrate our new ion channel model into the Mahajan-Shiferaw ventricular cardiomyocyte model to study the effect of electromechanical pacing at the cellular scale. This integrated cell model is able to qualitatively reproduce some aspects of the experimental observations regarding the rate-dependence of electromechanical pacing protocols. Our studies suggest that the Piezo1 ion channel is an important component that significantly contributes to the electromechanical coupled response of cardiomyocytes.</description>

      <title>A simple multistage theory for multimorbidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is shown how observational data of disease incidence can be used to determine whether two diseases can have a ``shared stage'' or ``step'', before either disease can occur, and how the unobserved rate of this step can be determined. The approach is in principle quite general, and illustrated with specific examples using simplified multistage models of disease. It offers a simple approach for studying multiple diseases in an individual, and for identifying the underlying causes of multiple conditions. This includes studies for two or more cancer types. The fundamental mathematical model is analysed to compare key statistical properties such as the expectation and variance with those of independent diseases, and its properties are illustrated with specific examples. Despite the complex nature of models that study multiple conditions, the most important general results do not need an understanding of the underlying mathematics and can be appreciated by a non-expert.</description>

      <title>Multilayer Networks in Neuroimaging</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in network science, applied to \textit{in vivo} brain recordings, have paved the way for better understanding of the structure and function of the brain. However, despite its obvious usefulness in neuroscience, traditional network science lacks tools for -- so important -- simultaneous investigation of the inter-relationship between the two domains. In this chapter, I explore the increasing role of multilayer networks in building brain generative models and abilities of such models to uncover the full information about the brain complex spatiotemporal interactions that span across multiple scales and modalities. First, I begin with the theoretical foundation of brain networks accompanied by a brief overview of traditional networks and their role in constructing multilayer network models. Then, I delve into the applications of multilayer networks in neuroscience, particularly in deciphering structure-function relationship, modelling diseases, and integrating multi-scale and multi-modal data. Finally, I demonstrate how incorporating the multilayer framework into network neuroscience has brought to light previously hidden features of brain networks and, how multilayer networks can provide new insights and a description of the structure and function of the brain.</description>

      <title>A network-driven framework for enhancing gene-disease association studies in coronary artery disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the last decade, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified numerous genetic variants associated with complex diseases. These associations have the potential to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying complex diseases and lead to the identification of novel drug targets. Despite these advancements, the biological pathways and mechanisms linking genetic variants to complex diseases are still not fully understood. Most trait-associated variants reside in non-coding regions and are presumed to influence phenotypes through regulatory effects on gene expression. Yet, it is often unclear which genes they regulate and in which cell types this regulation occurs. Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) aim to bridge this gap by detecting trait-associated tissue gene expression regulated by GWAS variants. However, traditional TWAS approaches frequently overlook the critical contributions of trans-regulatory effects and fail to integrate comprehensive regulatory networks. Here, we present a novel framework that leverages tissue-specific gene regulatory networks (GRNs) to integrate cis- and trans-genetic regulatory effects into the TWAS framework for complex diseases. We validate our approach using coronary artery disease (CAD), utilizing data from the STARNET project, which provides multi-tissue gene expression and genetic data from around 600 living patients with cardiovascular disease. Preliminary results demonstrate the potential of our GRN-driven framework to uncover more genes and pathways that may underlie CAD. This framework extends traditional TWAS methodologies by utilizing tissue-specific regulatory insights and advancing the understanding of complex disease genetic architecture.</description>

      <title>Quantifying energy landscape of high-dimensional oscillatory systems by diffusion decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06959v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-dimensional networks producing oscillatory dynamics are ubiquitous in biological systems. Unravelling the mechanism of oscillatory dynamics in biological networks with stochastic perturbations becomes paramountly significant. Although the classical energy landscape theory provides a tool to study this problem in multistable systems and explain cellular functions, it remains challenging to quantify the landscape for high-dimensional oscillatory systems accurately. Here we propose an approach called the diffusion decomposition of Gaussian approximation (DDGA). We demonstrate the efficacy of the DDGA in quantifying the energy landscape of oscillatory systems and corresponding stochastic dynamics, in comparison with existing approaches. By further applying the DDGA to high-dimensional biological networks, we are able to uncover more intricate biological mechanisms efficiently, which deepens our understanding of cellular functions.</description>

Abstract: Spatial omics assays allow for the molecular characterisation of cells in their spatial context. Notably, the two main technological streams, imaging-based and high-throughput sequencing-based, can give rise to very different data modalities. The characteristics of the two data types are well known in adjacent fields such as spatial statistics as point patterns and lattice data, and there is a wide range of tools available. This paper discusses the application of spatial statistics to spatially-resolved omics data and in particular, discusses various advantages, challenges, and nuances. This work is accompanied by a vignette, pasta, that showcases the usefulness of spatial statistics in biology using several R packages.</description>

      <title>Fast Directed $q$-Analysis for Brain Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent innovations in reconstructing large scale, full-precision, neuron-synapse-scale connectomes demand subsequent improvements to graph analysis methods to keep up with the growing complexity and size of the data. One such tool is the recently introduced directed $q$-analysis. We present numerous improvements, theoretical and applied, to this technique: on the theoretical side, we introduce modified definitions for key elements of directed $q$-analysis, which remedy a well-hidden and previously undetected bias. This also leads to new, beneficial perspectives to the associated computational challenges. Most importantly, we present a high-speed, publicly available, low-level implementation that provides speed-ups of several orders of magnitude on C. Elegans. Furthermore, the speed gains grow with the size of the considered graph. This is made possible due to the mathematical and algorithmic improvements as well as a carefully crafted implementation. These speed-ups enable, for the first time, the analysis of full-sized connectomes such as those obtained by recent reconstructive methods. Additionally, the speed-ups allow comparative analysis to corresponding null models, appropriately designed randomly structured artificial graphs that do not correspond to actual brains. This, in turn, allows for assessing the efficacy and usefulness of directed $q$-analysis for studying the brain. We report on the results in this paper.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Cell Tracking with a Time-Symmetric Deep Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03887v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accurate tracking of live cells using video microscopy recordings remains a challenging task for popular state-of-the-art image processing based object tracking methods. In recent years, several existing and new applications have attempted to integrate deep-learning based frameworks for this task, but most of them still heavily rely on consecutive frame based tracking embedded in their architecture or other premises that hinder generalized learning. To address this issue, we aimed to develop a new deep-learning based tracking method that relies solely on the assumption that cells can be tracked based on their spatio-temporal neighborhood, without restricting it to consecutive frames. The proposed method has the additional benefit that the motion patterns of the cells can be learned completely by the predictor without any prior assumptions, and it has the potential to handle a large number of video frames with heavy artifacts. The efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated through biologically motivated validation strategies and compared against multiple state-of-the-art cell tracking methods.</description>

      <title>Comparative prospects of imaging methods for whole-brain mammalian connectomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10488v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mammalian whole-brain connectomes are a foundational ingredient for holistic understanding of brains. Indeed, imaging connectomes at sufficient resolution to densely reconstruct cellular morphology and synapses represents a longstanding goal in neuroscience. Mouse connectomes could soon come within reach while human connectomes remain a more distant yet still worthy goal. Though the technologies needed to reconstruct whole-brain connectomes have not yet reached full maturity, they are advancing rapidly. Close examination of these technologies may help plan connectomics projects. Here, we quantitatively compare imaging technologies that have potential to enable whole-brain mammalian connectomics. We perform calculations on electron microscopy (EM) techniques and expansion light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (ExLSFM) methods. We consider techniques that have sufficient resolution to identify all synapses and sufficient speed to be relevant for whole mammalian brains. We offer this analysis as a resource for those considering how to organize efforts towards imaging whole-brain mammalian connectomes.</description>
