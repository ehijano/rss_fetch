      <title>Binarity at Low Metallicity (BLOeM) -- Multiplicity properties of Oe and Be stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapidly rotating classical OBe stars have been proposed as the products of binary interactions, and the fraction of Be stars with compact companions implies that at least some are. However, to constrain the interaction physics spinning up the OBe stars, a large sample of homogeneously analysed OBe stars with well-determined binary characteristics and orbital parameters are required. We investigate the multiplicity properties of a sample of 18 Oe, 62 Be, and two Of?p stars observed within the BLOeM survey in the Small Magellanic Cloud. We analyse the first nine epochs of spectroscopic observations obtained over approximately three months in 2023. Radial velocities (RVs) of all stars are measured. Applying commonly-used binarity criteria we classify objects as binaries, binary candidates, and apparently single (RV stable) objects. We further inspect the spectra for double-lined spectroscopic binaries and cross-match with catalogues of X-ray sources and photometric binaries. We classify 14 OBe stars as binaries, and an additional 11 as binary candidates. The two Of?p stars are apparently single. Two more objects are most likely currently interacting binaries. Without those, the observed binary fraction for the OBe sample (78 stars) is f_OBe_obs=0.18+/-0.04 (f_obs_cand=0.32+/-0.05 including candidates). This fraction is less than half of that measured for OB stars in BLOeM. Combined with the lower fraction of SB2s, this suggests that OBe stars have indeed fundamentally different binary properties than OB stars. We find no evidence for OBe binaries with massive compact companions, in contrast to expectations from binary population synthesis. Our results support the binary scenario as an important formation channel for OBe stars, as post-interaction binaries may have been disrupted or the stripped companions of OBe stars are harder to detect.</description>

      <title>Binarity at LOw Metallicity (BLOeM): The multiplicity properties and evolution of BAF-type supergiants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the uncertain evolutionary status of blue supergiant stars, their multiplicity properties hold vital clues to better understand their origin and evolution. As part of The Binarity at LOw Metallicity (BLOeM) campaign in the Small Magellanic Cloud we present a multi-epoch spectroscopic survey of 128 supergiant stars of spectral type B5--F5, which roughly correspond to initial masses in the range 6 to 30 solar masses. The observed binary fraction for the B5-9 supergiants is 25+/-6 % (10+/-4 %) and 5+/-2 % (0 %) for the A-F stars, using a radial velocity (RV) variability threshold of 5 kms (10 kms) as a criterion for binarity. Accounting for observational biases we find an intrinsic multiplicity fraction of less than 18% for the B5-9 stars and 8$^{+9}_{-7}$% for the AF stars, for the orbital periods up to 10$^{3.5}$day and mass-ratios (q) in the range 0.1 &lt; q &lt; 1. The large stellar radii of these supergiant stars prevent short orbital periods but we demonstrate that this effect alone cannot explain our results. We assess the spectra and RV time series of the detected binary systems and find that only a small fraction display convincing solutions. We conclude that the multiplicity fractions are compromised by intrinsic stellar variability such that the true multiplicity fraction may be significantly smaller. Our main conclusions from comparing the multiplicity properties of the B5-9 and AF supergiants to that of their less evolved counterparts is that such stars cannot be explained by a direct evolution from the main sequence. Furthermore, by comparing their multiplicity properties to red supergiant stars we conclude that the AF supergiant stars are neither progenitors nor descendants of red supergiants.</description>

      <title>New stellar bow shocks and bubbles found around runaway stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Runaway stars with peculiar high velocities can generate stellar bow shocks. Only a few bow shocks show clear radio emission. Our goal is to identify and characterize new stellar bow shocks around O and Be runaway stars in the infrared (IR), and to study their possible radio emission and nature. Our input data is a catalog of O and Be runaways compiled using Gaia DR3. We used WISE IR images to search for bow shocks around these runaways, Gaia DR3 data to determine the actual motion of the runaway stars corrected for interstellar medium (ISM) motion caused by Galactic rotation, and archival radio data to search for emission signatures. We finally explored the radio detectability of these sources under thermal and nonthermal scenarios. We found 9 new stellar bow shock candidates, 3 new bubble candidates, and 1 intermediate structure candidate. One of them is an in situ bow shock candidate. We also found 17 already known bow shocks in our sample, though we discarded one, and 62 miscellaneous sources showing some IR emission around the runaways. We geometrically characterized the sources in IR using the WISE-4 band and estimated the ISM density at the bow shock positions, obtaining median values of ~6 and ~4 cm$^{-3}$ using 2D and 3D peculiar velocities. Most of the new discovered bow shocks come from new runaway discoveries. Within our samples we found that ~24% of the O-type runaway stars show bow shocks, while this decreases to ~3% for Be-type runaway stars. Two bow shocks present radio emission but not as clear counterparts, and two others show hints of radio emission. The physical scenarios indicate that two sources could still be compatible with nonthermal radio emission. The new sample of O and Be runaway stars allowed us to discover both new stellar bow shocks and bubbles. Their geometrical characterization can be used to assess the physical scenario of the radio emission. (Abridged)</description>

      <title>Intersecting frontiers for ground and space-based solar missions: symbiotic coordination between DKIST, PSP, and Solar Orbiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three uniquely powerful solar and heliospheric facilities are now operational at the same time. The US National Science Foundation's Daniel K Inouye Solar Telescope, NASA's Parker Solar Probe, and ESA's Solar Orbiter each represent frontiers in space science, and each pursue richly tailored science missions. At the intersection of these missions, though, lie unparalleled opportunities for multi-vantage point science. This symbiotic relationship is especially pronounced during PSP's perihelia and Solar Orbiter remote science windows. As the most advanced solar polarimeter ever built, DKIST strengthens many of the multi-facility use cases by opening new diagnostic windows into solar magnetism -- spanning the photosphere, chromosphere, and corona -- at unprecedented spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution. In this article, we report recent efforts to maximize the scientific potential of coordinated DKIST, PSP, and Solar Orbiter observations. Existing DKIST data from coordinated observations with Solar Orbiter and PSP are highlighted alongside some first investigations of these data.</description>

      <title>Small-scale inhomogeneity effects on coherent solar radio emission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02832v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent radio emission mechanism of solar radio bursts is one of the most complicated and controversial topics in solar physics. To clarify the mechanism(s) of different types of solar radio bursts, (radio) wave excitation by energetic electrons in homogeneous plasmas has been widely studied via particle-in-cell (PIC) code numerical simulations. The solar corona is, however, inhomogeneous over almost all spatial scales. Inhomogeneities of the plasma could influence the emission properties of solar radio bursts. In this paper, we, hence, investigate effects of inhomogeneity (in the magnetic field, plasma density and temperature) of plasmas in the solar corona on radio wave emission by ring-beam distributed energetic electrons utilizing 2.5-dimensional PIC simulations. Both the beam and electron cyclotron maser (ECM) instabilities could be triggered with the presence of the energetic ring-beam electrons. The resultant spectrum of the excited electromagnetic waves presents a zebra-stripe pattern in the frequency space. The inhomogeneous density or temperature in plasmas influences the frequency bandwidth and location of these excited waves. Our results can, hence, help to diagnose the plasma properties at the emission sites of solar radio bursts. Applications of our results to the solar radio bursts with zebra-stripe pattern are discussed.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional simulations of accretion disks in pre-CE systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Before a binary system enters into a common envelope (CE) phase, accretion from the primary star onto the companion star through Roche Lobe overflow (RLOF) will lead to the formation of an accretion disk, which may generate jets. Accretion before and during the CE may alter the outcome of the interaction. Previous studies have considered different aspects of this physical mechanism. Here we study the properties of an accretion disk formed via 3D hydrodynamic simulations of the RLOF mass transfer between a 7 M$_\odot$, red supergiant star and a 1.4 M$_\odot$, neutron star companion. We simulate only the volume around the companion for improved resolution. We use a 1D implicit MESA simulation of the evolution of the system during 30,000 years between the on-set of the RLOF and the CE to guide the binary parameters and the mass-transfer rate, while we simulate only 21 years of the last part of the RLOF in 3D using an ideal gas isothermal equation of state. We expect that a pre-CE disk under these parameters will have a mass of $\sim 5\times 10^{-3}$ M$_\odot$ and a radius of $\sim$40 R$_\odot$ with a scale height of $\sim$5 R$_\odot$. The temperature profile of the disk is shallower than that predicted by the formalism of Shakura and Sunyaev, but more reasonable cooling physics would need to be included. We stress test these results with respect to a number of physical and numerical parameters, as well as simulation choices, and we expect them to be reasonable within a factor of a few for the mass and 15% for the radius. We also contextualize our results within those presented in the literature, in particular with respect to the dimensionality of simulations and the adiabatic index. We consider what properties of magnetic fields and jets may be supported by our disk and discuss prospects for future work.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Diagnosis of a B-Class Flare and an Associated Filament Eruption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The flare ribbon and an associated filament eruption are diagnosed using O iv 1401.16 A, Si iv 1402.77 A, and Mg ii k 2796.35 A spectral lines provided by IRIS. The flare ribbons have downflow (redshifts) in all these lines, and this redshift decreases from the transition region to the chromosphere. While the overlapping region (flare-ribbon+filament rise/eruption is dominated by upflows(blueshifts) in all three spectral lines. We found an extremely blueshifted Si iv profile (i.e., blueshift around -180 km/s) in the overlapping region. The mean non-thermal velocity (v_nt) in the flare ribbons is higher in O iv than Si iv. While, in the overlapping region, O iv have lower v_nt than Si iv. Note that very high v_nt around 80 km/s (in Si iv) exists in this weak B-class flare. The Mg ii k line widths are almost the same in the flare ribbon and overlapping region but, they are extremely broad than previously reported. We found double peak profiles of Si iv and O iv in the overlapping region. Most probably, one peak is due to downflow (flare ribbon) and another due to upflow (filament rise/eruption). We report a high redshift of more than 150 km/s in the weak B-class flare. In some cases, both peaks show upflows which might be the result of the superposition of two different sources, i.e., overlapping of two different velocity distributions in the line of sight.</description>

      <title>A JWST Project on 47 Tucanae: Kinematics, energy equipartition and anisotropy of multiple populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work with JWST has demonstrated its capability to identify and chemically characterize multiple populations in globular clusters down to the H-burning limit. In this study, we explore the kinematics of multiple populations in the globular cluster 47 Tucanae by combining data from JWST, HST, and Gaia. We analyzed velocity dispersion and anisotropy profiles from the cluster center out to $\sim$10$R_h$. Our findings indicate that while 1G stars are isotropic, 2G stars are significantly radially anisotropic. These results align with the predictions of simulations of the dynamical evolution of clusters where 2G stars are initially more centrally concentrated than 1G stars. Furthermore, we subdivided the 2G population into two subpopulations: $2G_A$ and $2G_B$, with the latter being more chemically extreme. We compared their dynamical profiles and found no significant differences. For the first time, we measured the degree of energy equipartition among the multiple populations of 47 Tucanae. Overall, within the analyzed radial range ($\sim$2-4$R_h$), both populations exhibit a low degree of energy equipartition. The most significant differences between 1G and 2G stars are observed in the tangential velocity component, where 2G stars are characterized by a stronger degree of energy equipartition than 1G stars. In the radial component, the behavior of 1G and 2G stars is more variable, with differences largely dependent on radius. Finally, our analysis reveals that the ratio of rotational velocity to velocity dispersion is larger for the 2G population, while 1G stars exhibit higher skewness in their tangential proper motions, providing further evidence of differences in the kinematic properties of the 1G and 2G populations.</description>

      <title>PhotoD with LSST: Stellar Photometric Distances Out to the Edge of the Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As demonstrated with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), Pan-STARRS, and most recently with Gaia data, broadband near-UV to near-IR stellar photometry can be used to estimate distance, metallicity, and interstellar dust extinction along the line of sight for stars in the Galaxy. Anticipating photometric catalogs with tens of billions of stars from Rubin's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), we present a Bayesian model and pipeline that build on previous work and can handle LSST-sized datasets. Likelihood computations utilize MIST/Dartmouth isochrones and priors are derived from TRILEGAL-based simulated LSST catalogs from P. Dal Tio et al. The computation speed is about 10 ms per star on a single core for both optimized grid search and Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods; we show in a companion paper by K. Mrakov\v{c}i\'c et al. how to utilize neural networks to accelerate this performance by up to an order of magnitude. We validate our pipeline, named PhotoD (in analogy with photo-z, photometric redshifts of galaxies) using both simulated catalogs and SDSS, DECam, and Gaia photometry. We intend to make LSST-based value-added PhotoD catalogs publicly available via the Rubin Science Platform with every LSST data release.</description>

      <title>Unification theory of instabilities of visco-diffusive swirling flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01706v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A universal theory of linear instabilities in swirling flows, occurring in both natural settings and industrial applications, is formulated. The theory encompasses a wide range of open and confined flows, including spiral isothermal flows and baroclinic flows driven by radial temperature gradients and natural gravity in rotating fluids. By employing short-wavelength local analysis, the theory generalizes previous findings from numerical simulations and linear stability analyses of specific swirling flows, such as spiral Couette flow, spiral Poiseuille flow, and baroclinic Couette flow. A general criterion, extending and unifying existing criteria for instability to both centrifugal and shear-driven perturbations in swirling flows is derived, taking into account viscosity and thermal diffusion, and guiding experimental and numerical investigations in the otherwise inaccessible parameter regimes.</description>

      <title>Classical 1/3 Nusselt number scaling in highly turbulent compressible convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planetary and stellar convection, which are compressible and turbulent, remain poorly understood. In this paper, we report numerical results on the scaling of Nusselt number ($\mathrm{Nu}$) and Reynolds number ($\mathrm{Re}$) for extreme convection. Using computationally-efficient MacCormack-TVD finite difference method, we simulate compressible turbulent convection in a two-dimensional Cartesian box up to $\mathrm{Ra} = 10^{16}$, the highest $\mathrm{Ra}$ achieved so far, and in a three-dimensional box up to $\mathrm{Ra} = 10^{11}$. We show adiabatic temperature drop in the bulk flow, leading to the Reynolds number scaling $\mathrm{Ra}^{1/2}$. More significantly, we show classical $1/3$ Nusselt number scaling: $\mathrm{Nu} \propto \mathrm{Ra}^{0.32}$ in 2D, and $\mathrm{Nu} \propto \mathrm{Ra}^{0.31}$ in 3D up to the highest $\mathrm{Ra}$.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Imprints of Colliding-wind Dust Formation from WR140</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carbon-rich Wolf-Rayet binaries are a prominent source of carbonaceous dust that contribute to the dust budget of galaxies. The "textbook" example of an episodic dust producing WR binary, WR140 (HD193793), provides us with an ideal laboratory for investigating the dust physics and kinematics in an extreme environment. This study is among the first to utilize two separate JWST observations, from Cycle 1 ERS (July 2022) and Cycle 2 (Sept. 2023), to measure WR140's dust kinematics and confirm its morphology. To measure the proper motions and projected velocities of the dust shells, we performed a novel PSF subtraction to reduce the effects of the bright diffraction spikes and carefully aligned the Cycle 2 to the Cycle 1 images. At 7.7 $\mu$m, through the bright feature common to 16 dust shells (C1), we find an average dust shell proper motion of $390\pm29$ mas yr$^{-1}$, which equates to a projected velocity of $2714\pm188$ km s$^{-1}$ at a distance of 1.64 kpc. Our measured speeds are constant across all visible shells and consistent with previously reported dust expansion velocities. Our observations not only prove that these dusty shells are astrophysical (i.e., not associated with any PSF artifact) and originate from WR140, but also confirm the "clumpy" morphology of the dust shells, in which identifiable substructures within certain shells persist for at least 14 months from one cycle to the next. These results support the hypothesis that clumping in the wind collision region is required for dust production in WR binaries.</description>

      <title>Resolved Gas Temperatures and 12C/13C ratios in SVS13A from ALMA Observations of CH3CN and CH3-13-CN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Multiple systems are common in field stars, and the frequency is found to be higher in early evolutionary stages. Thus, the study of young multiple systems during the embedded stages is key to have a comprehensive understanding of star formation. In particular, how material accretes from the large-scale envelope into the inner region and how this flow interacts with the system physically and chemically has not yet been well characterized observationally. Aims. We aim to provide a snapshot of the forming protobinary system SVS13A, consisting of VLA4A and VLA4B. This includes clear pictures of its kinematic structures, physical conditions, and chemical properties. Methods. We conducted ALMA observations toward SVS13A targeting CH3CN and CH3-13CN J=12-11 K-ladder line emission with a high spatial resolution of ~30 au at a spectral resolution of ~0.08 km s-1 Results. We perform LTE radiative transfer models to fit the spectral features of the line emission. We find the two-layer LTE radiative model including dust absorption is essential to interpret the CH3CN and CH3-13-CN line emission. We identify two major and four small kinematic components, and derive their physical and chemical properties. Conclusions. We find a possible infalling signature toward the bursting secondary source VLA4A, which may be fed by an infalling streamer from the large-scale envelope. The mechanical heating in the binary system, as well as the infalling shocked gas, likely play a role in the thermal structure of the protobinary system. By accumulating mass from the streamer, the system might have experienced a gravitationally unstable phase before the accretion outburst. Finally, the derived CH3CN/CH3-13-CN ratio is lower than the canonical ratio in the ISM and is different between VLA4A and VLA4B.</description>

      <title>Turbulent transport in a non-Markovian velocity field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The commonly used quasilinear approximation allows one to calculate the turbulent transport coefficients for the mean of a passive scalar or a magnetic field in a given velocity field. Formally, the quasilinear approximation is exact when the correlation time of the velocity field is zero. We calculate the lowest-order corrections to the transport coefficients due to the correlation time being nonzero. For this, we use the Furutsu-Novikov theorem, which allows one to express the turbulent transport coefficients in a Gaussian random velocity field as a series in the correlation time. We find that the turbulent diffusivities of both the mean passive scalar and the mean magnetic field are suppressed. Nevertheless, contradicting a previous study, we show that the turbulent diffusivity of the mean magnetic field is smaller than that of the mean passive scalar. We also find corrections to the $\alpha$ effect.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Stellar Disk-like Nature in the Kinematics of SiO Maser Stars around Sagittarius A*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of the kinematics of SiO maser stars around the center of the Milky Way, Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*). We used the archive data in the SiO v=1, J=2-1 emission line obtained by the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) in 2017 and 2021 (#2016.1.00940.S, PI Darling, J. and #2019.1.00292.S, PI Paine, J.). We detected 37 SiO maser stars in the channel maps and derived their angular offsets relative to Sgr A* and LSR radial velocities. We derived the proper motions of 35 stars by comparing their angular offsets in the two epochs. The proper motions of Wolf-Rayet and O star in the Nuclear Star Cluster (NSC) are reported to be rather random, except for the co-moving clusters IRS13E and IRS13N (Tsuboi et al. 2022). However, the derived proper motions of SiO maser stars do not look completely random. The proper motions of the SiO maser stars show a tendency to lie along the Galactic plane. The proper motion amplitudes of SiO maser stars are larger than the LSR velocity amplitudes. We estimated the 3D motions from the proper motions and LSR velocities. Many 3D velocities are near to or larger than the upper limit velocities for Kepler orbits around Sgr A*, whose mass is assumed to be 4x10^6 Msun. These indicate that the SiO maser stars around Sgr A* are members of the Nuclear Stellar Disk rather than the NSC.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive study of the gas-phase formation network of HC$_5$N: theory, experiments, observations and models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cyanopolyynes are among the largest and most commonly observed interstellar Complex Organic Molecules in star-forming regions. They are believed to form primarily in the gas-phase, but their formation routes are not well understood. We present a comprehensive study of the gas-phase formation network of cyanobutadiyne, HC$_5$N, based on new theoretical calculations, kinetics experiments, astronomical observations, and astrochemical modeling. We performed new quantum mechanics calculations for six neutral-neutral reactions in order to derive reliable rate coefficients and product branching fractions. We also present new CRESU data on the rate coefficients of three of these reactions (C$_3$N + C$_2$H$_2$, C$_2$H + HC$_3$N, CN + C$_4$H$_2$) obtained at temperatures as low as 24 K. In practice, six out of nine reactions currently used in astrochemical models have been updated in our reviewed network. We also report the tentative detection of the $^{13}$C isotopologues of HC$_5$N in the L1544 prestellar core. We derived a lower limit of $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C &gt; 75 for the HC$_5$N isotopologues, which does not allow to bring new constraints to the HC$_5$N chemistry. Finally, we verified the impact of the revised reactions by running the GRETOBAPE astrochemical model. We found good agreement between the HC$_5$N predicted and observed abundances in cold ($\sim$10 K) objects, demonstrating that HC$_5$N is mainly formed by neutral-neutral reactions in these environments. In warm molecular shocks, instead, the predicted abundances are a factor of ten lower with respect to observed ones. In this environment possessing an higher gas ionization fraction, we speculate that the contribution of ion-neutral reactions could be significant.</description>

      <title>A Case Study of Interstellar Material Delivery: {\alpha} Centauri</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interstellar material has been discovered in our Solar System, yet its origins and details of its transport are unknown. Here we present $\alpha$ Centauri as a case study of the delivery of interstellar material to our Solar System. $\alpha$ Centauri is a mature triple star system that likely harbours planets and is moving towards us with the point of closest approach approximately 28,000 years in the future. Assuming a current ejection model for the system, we find that such material can reach our Solar System and may currently be present here. The material that does reach us is mostly a product of low ($&lt;2$ km/s) ejection velocities, and the rate at which it enters our Solar System is expected to peak around the time of $\alpha$ Centauri 's closest approach. If $\alpha$ Centauri ejects material at a rate comparable to our own Solar System, we estimate the current number of $\alpha$ Centauri particles larger than 100 m in diameter within our Oort Cloud to be $10^{6}$, and during $\alpha$ Centauri 's closest approach, this will increase by an order of magnitude. However, the observable fraction of such objects remains low as there is only a probability of $10^{-6}$ that one of them is within 10 au of the Sun. A small number ($\sim 10$) meteors greater than 100 micrometers from $\alpha$ Centauri may currently be entering Earth's atmosphere every year: this number is very sensitive to the assumed ejected mass distribution, but the flux is expected to increase as $\alpha$ Centauri approaches.</description>

      <title>Coronal hole picoflare jets are progenitors of both fast and Alfv\'enic slow solar wind</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solar wind, classified by its bulk speed and the Alfv\'enic nature of its fluctuations, generates the heliosphere. The elusive physical processes responsible for the generation of the different types of this wind are a topic of active debate. Recent observations reveal intermittent jets, with kinetic energy in the picoflare range, emerging from dark areas of a polar coronal hole threaded by open magnetic field lines. These could substantially contribute to solar wind. However, their ubiquity and direct links to solar wind have not been established. Here, we report a unique set of remote-sensing and in situ observations from the Solar Orbiter spacecraft that establish a unified picture of fast and Alfv\'{e}nic slow wind, connected to the similar widespread picoflare jet activity in two coronal holes. Radial expansion of coronal holes ultimately regulates the speed of the emerging wind.</description>

      <title>Identification of 30,000 White Dwarf-Main Sequence binaries candidates from Gaia DR3 BP/RP(XP) low-resolution spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: White dwarf-main sequence (WDMS) binary systems are essential probes for understanding binary stellar evolution and play a pivotal role in constraining theoretical models of various transient phenomena. In this study, we construct a catalog of WDMS binaries using Gaia DR3's low-resolution BP/RP (XP) spectra. Our approach integrates a model-independent neural network for spectral modelling with Gaussian Process Classification to accurately identify WDMS binaries among over 10 million stars within 1 kpc. This study identify approximately 30,000 WDMS binary candidates, including ~1,700 high-confidence systems confirmed through spectral fitting. Our technique is shown to be effective at detecting systems where the main-sequence star dominates the spectrum - cases that have historically challenged conventional methods. Validation using GALEX photometry reinforces the reliability of our classifications: 70\% of candidates with an absolute magnitude $M_{G} &gt; 7$ exhibit UV excess, a characteristic signature of white dwarf companions. Our all-sky catalog of WDMS binaries expands the available dataset for studying binary evolution and white dwarf physics and sheds light on the formation of WDMS.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Rapidly Rotating Stars with Chemically Homogeneous Evolution in the First Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02002v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed an unexpectedly high abundance of UV luminous galaxies at redshifts $z\gtrsim 10$, challenging `standard' galaxy formation models. This study investigates the role of rapidly rotating (massive) stars undergoing chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE) in reconciling this potential tension. These stars are more compact, hotter, and exhibit enhanced UV emission. We find that the rest-frame UV luminosity of star-forming galaxies can be significantly enhanced by a factor of $\sim 3-6$ when CHE stars above a minimum initial mass of $m_{\star,\min}^{\rm CHE}\sim 2-10\ \rm M_\odot$ account for more than half of the total stellar mass following a Salpeter initial mass function. As a result, the UV luminosity functions observed at $z\sim 12-16$ can be reproduced with less extreme values of star formation efficiency and UV luminosity stochastic variability. Our results highlight the potential of CHE in explaining the UV-bright galaxy populations detected by JWST and call for future work to explore the broader astrophysical implications of CHE and its associated phenomena in the early universe, such as gamma-ray bursts, compact object binaries, and metal enrichment.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field Amplification in a Rotating Astrophysical Plasma Sphere: $\alpha$ and $\beta$ Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigated the generation of the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ effects in a rotating spherical plasma system with oppositely polarized kinetic helicity in the northern and southern hemispheres and examined their contributions to the induction of magnetic fields. We found that the $\alpha$ effect is relatively small, and its sign depends on the polarization of kinetic helicity. In contrast, the $\beta$ effect remains negative regardless of the sign of kinetic helicity. Despite its small magnitude, the $\alpha$ effect plays a crucial role in determining the polarity of helical magnetic structures, while a negative $\beta$ indicates energy diffusion from turbulent regions into the large-scale magnetic field. We derived the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ effects with oppositely polarized kinetic helicity using different approaches, incorporating large-scale magnetic data and turbulent kinetic data. These were used to reproduce the large-scale magnetic field and compare it with DNS results. In the kinematic regime, where the magnetic field strength is weak, our results align well; however, in regions with strong nonlinear magnetic effects, the magnetic field reproduced using turbulent kinetic data diverges. This divergence is attributed to insufficient quenching of the $\beta$ effect, suggesting that including the second-moment terms of velocity in the magnetic field effect would improve the accuracy of the $\beta$ coefficient. In this study, we considered the case of a rotating plasma sphere with $Pr_M = 1$ and low Reynolds numbers. However, in reality, Reynolds numbers are much higher, and $Pr_M$ is much less than 1, which necessitates further studies on this topic. We plan to address this in future research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present MauveSim, the instrument simulator software for Mauve, the latest mission from Blue Skies Space dedicated to time-domain stellar astronomy. The tool is designed to generate simulated stellar spectra, enabling the assessment of various scientific objectives, as well as determining limiting magnitudes and conducting signal-to-noise (S/N) analyses. MauveSim functions as an end-to-end simulator that takes an input stellar spectrum-either observed or synthetic-and produces a simulated observation based on the instrument's performance and characteristics. The results of MauveSim have been validated against instrument performance data from extensive ground testing campaigns, ensuring that the software reflects the most up-to-date understanding of the payload performance. Accessible to all scientists involved in the mission, MauveSim serves as a crucial tool for target selection and observation planning.</description>
