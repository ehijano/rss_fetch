      <title>Improving Multislice Electron Ptychography with a Generative Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multislice electron ptychography (MEP) is an inverse imaging technique that computationally reconstructs the highest-resolution images of atomic crystal structures from diffraction patterns. Available algorithms often solve this inverse problem iteratively but are both time consuming and produce suboptimal solutions due to their ill-posed nature. We develop MEP-Diffusion, a diffusion model trained on a large database of crystal structures specifically for MEP to augment existing iterative solvers. MEP-Diffusion is easily integrated as a generative prior into existing reconstruction methods via Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS). We find that this hybrid approach greatly enhances the quality of the reconstructed 3D volumes, achieving a 90.50% improvement in SSIM over existing methods.</description>

      <title>Towards Robust Foundation Models for Digital Pathology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biomedical Foundation Models (FMs) are rapidly transforming AI-enabled healthcare research and entering clinical validation. However, their susceptibility to learning non-biological technical features -- including variations in surgical/endoscopic techniques, laboratory procedures, and scanner hardware -- poses risks for clinical deployment. We present the first systematic investigation of pathology FM robustness to non-biological features. Our work (i) introduces measures to quantify FM robustness, (ii) demonstrates the consequences of limited robustness, and (iii) proposes a framework for FM robustification to mitigate these issues. Specifically, we developed PathoROB, a robustness benchmark with three novel metrics, including the robustness index, and four datasets covering 28 biological classes from 34 medical centers. Our experiments reveal robustness deficits across all 20 evaluated FMs, and substantial robustness differences between them. We found that non-robust FM representations can cause major diagnostic downstream errors and clinical blunders that prevent safe clinical adoption. Using more robust FMs and post-hoc robustification considerably reduced (but did not yet eliminate) the risk of such errors. This work establishes that robustness evaluation is essential for validating pathology FMs before clinical adoption and demonstrates that future FM development must integrate robustness as a core design principle. PathoROB provides a blueprint for assessing robustness across biomedical domains, guiding FM improvement efforts towards more robust, representative, and clinically deployable AI systems that prioritize biological information over technical artifacts.</description>

      <title>Integrating Feature Selection and Machine Learning for Nitrogen Assessment in Grapevine Leaves using In-Field Hyperspectral Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nitrogen (N) is one of the most crucial nutrients in vineyards, affecting plant growth and subsequent products such as wine and juice. Because soil N has high spatial and temporal variability, it is desirable to accurately estimate the N concentration of grapevine leaves and manage fertilization at the individual plant level to optimally meet plant needs. In this study, we used in-field hyperspectral images with wavelengths ranging from $400 to 1000nm of four different grapevine cultivars collected from distinct vineyards and over two growth stages during two growing seasons to develop models for predicting N concentration at the leaf-level and canopy-level. After image processing, two feature selection methods were employed to identify the optimal set of spectral bands that were responsive to leaf N concentrations. The selected spectral bands were used to train and test two different Machine Learning (ML) models, Gradient Boosting and XGBoost, for predicting nitrogen concentrations. The comparison of selected bands for both leaf-level and canopy-level datasets showed that most of the spectral regions identified by the feature selection methods were across both methods and the dataset types (leaf- and canopy-level datasets), particularly in the key regions, 500-525nm, 650-690nm, 750-800nm, and 900-950nm. These findings indicated the robustness of these spectral regions for predicting nitrogen content. The results for N prediction demonstrated that the ML model achieved an R square of 0.49 for canopy-level data and an R square of 0.57 for leaf-level data, despite using different sets of selected spectral bands for each analysis level. The study demonstrated the potential of using in-field hyperspectral imaging and the use of spectral data in integrated feature selection and ML techniques to monitor N status in vineyards.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Diffusion Framework for Pseudo-Healthy Brain MRI Inpainting with Enhanced 3D Consistency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pseudo-healthy image inpainting is an essential preprocessing step for analyzing pathological brain MRI scans. Most current inpainting methods favor slice-wise 2D models for their high in-plane fidelity, but their independence across slices produces discontinuities in the volume. Fully 3D models alleviate this issue, but their high model capacity demands extensive training data for reliable, high-fidelity synthesis -- often impractical in medical settings. We address these limitations with a hierarchical diffusion framework by replacing direct 3D modeling with two perpendicular coarse-to-fine 2D stages. An axial diffusion model first yields a coarse, globally consistent inpainting; a coronal diffusion model then refines anatomical details. By combining perpendicular spatial views with adaptive resampling, our method balances data efficiency and volumetric consistency. Our experiments show our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both realism and volumetric consistency, making it a promising solution for pseudo-healthy image inpainting. Code is available at https://github.com/dou0000/3dMRI-Consistent-Inpaint.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking of Deep Learning Methods for Generic MRI Multi-OrganAbdominal Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to robust automated tools for segmentation of abdominal computed tomography (CT). Meanwhile, segmentation of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is substantially more challenging due to the inherent signal variability and the increased effort required for annotating training datasets. Hence, existing approaches are trained on limited sets of MRI sequences, which might limit their generalizability. To characterize the landscape of MRI abdominal segmentation tools, we present here a comprehensive benchmarking of the three state-of-the-art and open-source models: MRSegmentator, MRISegmentator-Abdomen, and TotalSegmentator MRI. Since these models are trained using labor-intensive manual annotation cycles, we also introduce and evaluate ABDSynth, a SynthSeg-based model purely trained on widely available CT segmentations (no real images). More generally, we assess accuracy and generalizability by leveraging three public datasets (not seen by any of the evaluated methods during their training), which span all major manufacturers, five MRI sequences, as well as a variety of subject conditions, voxel resolutions, and fields-of-view. Our results reveal that MRSegmentator achieves the best performance and is most generalizable. In contrast, ABDSynth yields slightly less accurate results, but its relaxed requirements in training data make it an alternative when the annotation budget is limited. The evaluation code and datasets are given for future benchmarking at https://github.com/deepakri201/AbdoBench, along with inference code and weights for ABDSynth.</description>

      <title>Direct Dual-Energy CT Material Decomposition using Model-based Denoising Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dual-energy X-ray Computed Tomography (DECT) constitutes an advanced technology which enables automatic decomposition of materials in clinical images without manual segmentation using the dependency of the X-ray linear attenuation with energy. However, most methods perform material decomposition in the image domain as a post-processing step after reconstruction but this procedure does not account for the beam-hardening effect and it results in sub-optimal results. In this work, we propose a deep learning procedure called Dual-Energy Decomposition Model-based Diffusion (DEcomp-MoD) for quantitative material decomposition which directly converts the DECT projection data into material images. The algorithm is based on incorporating the knowledge of the spectral DECT model into the deep learning training loss and combining a score-based denoising diffusion learned prior in the material image domain. Importantly the inference optimization loss takes as inputs directly the sinogram and converts to material images through a model-based conditional diffusion model which guarantees consistency of the results. We evaluate the performance with both quantitative and qualitative estimation of the proposed DEcomp-MoD method on synthetic DECT sinograms from the low-dose AAPM dataset. Finally, we show that DEcomp-MoD outperform state-of-the-art unsupervised score-based model and supervised deep learning networks, with the potential to be deployed for clinical diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of 3D DDPM for MRI Image Generation Using Tensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the challenge of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) for three-dimensional (3D) U-Net-based denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) image generation. Despite its practical significance, research on parameter-efficient representations of 3D convolution operations remains limited. To bridge this gap, we propose Tensor Volumetric Operator (TenVOO), a novel PEFT method specifically designed for fine-tuning DDPMs with 3D convolutional backbones. Leveraging tensor network modeling, TenVOO represents 3D convolution kernels with lower-dimensional tensors, effectively capturing complex spatial dependencies during fine-tuning with few parameters. We evaluate TenVOO on three downstream brain MRI datasets-ADNI, PPMI, and BraTS2021-by fine-tuning a DDPM pretrained on 59,830 T1-weighted brain MRI scans from the UK Biobank. Our results demonstrate that TenVOO achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-scale structural similarity index measure (MS-SSIM), outperforming existing approaches in capturing spatial dependencies while requiring only 0.3% of the trainable parameters of the original model.

      <title>U-Net Based Healthy 3D Brain Tissue Inpainting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to synthesize healthy 3D brain tissue from masked input images, specifically focusing on the task of 'ASNR-MICCAI BraTS Local Synthesis of Tissue via Inpainting'. Our proposed method employs a U-Net-based architecture, which is designed to effectively reconstruct the missing or corrupted regions of brain MRI scans. To enhance our model's generalization capabilities and robustness, we implement a comprehensive data augmentation strategy that involves randomly masking healthy images during training. Our model is trained on the BraTS-Local-Inpainting dataset and demonstrates the exceptional performance in recovering healthy brain tissue. The evaluation metrics employed, including Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), and Mean Squared Error (MSE), consistently yields impressive results. On the BraTS-Local-Inpainting validation set, our model achieved an SSIM score of 0.841, a PSNR score of 23.257, and an MSE score of 0.007. Notably, these evaluation metrics exhibit relatively low standard deviations, i.e., 0.103 for SSIM score, 4.213 for PSNR score and 0.007 for MSE score, which indicates that our model's reliability and consistency across various input scenarios. Our method also secured first place in the challenge.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Glioblastoma Morpho-pathological Features Identification: A BraTS-Pathology Challenge Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Glioblastoma, a highly aggressive brain tumor with diverse molecular and pathological features, poses a diagnostic challenge due to its heterogeneity. Accurate diagnosis and assessment of this heterogeneity are essential for choosing the right treatment and improving patient outcomes. Traditional methods rely on identifying specific features in tissue samples, but deep learning offers a promising approach for improved glioblastoma diagnosis. In this paper, we present our approach to the BraTS-Path Challenge 2024. We leverage a pre-trained model and fine-tune it on the BraTS-Path training dataset. Our model demonstrates poor performance on the challenging BraTS-Path validation set, as rigorously assessed by the Synapse online platform. The model achieves an accuracy of 0.392229, a recall of 0.392229, and a F1-score of 0.392229, indicating a consistent ability to correctly identify instances under the target condition. Notably, our model exhibits perfect specificity of 0.898704, showing an exceptional capacity to correctly classify negative cases. Moreover, a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.255267 is calculated, to signify a limited positive correlation between predicted and actual values and highlight our model's overall predictive power. Our solution also achieves the second place during the testing phase.</description>

      <title>TCM-Tongue: A Standardized Tongue Image Dataset with Pathological Annotations for AI-Assisted TCM Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) tongue diagnosis, while clinically valuable, faces standardization challenges due to subjective interpretation and inconsistent imaging protocols, compounded by the lack of large-scale, annotated datasets for AI development. To address this gap, we present the first specialized dataset for AI-driven TCM tongue diagnosis, comprising 6,719 high-quality images captured under standardized conditions and annotated with 20 pathological symptom categories (averaging 2.54 clinically validated labels per image, all verified by licensed TCM practitioners). The dataset supports multiple annotation formats (COCO, TXT, XML) for broad usability and has been benchmarked using nine deep learning models (YOLOv5/v7/v8 variants, SSD, and MobileNetV2) to demonstrate its utility for AI development. This resource provides a critical foundation for advancing reliable computational tools in TCM, bridging the data shortage that has hindered progress in the field, and facilitating the integration of AI into both research and clinical practice through standardized, high-quality diagnostic data.</description>

      <title>UniSegDiff: Boosting Unified Lesion Segmentation via a Staged Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DPM) has demonstrated remarkable performance across a variety of generative tasks. The inherent randomness in diffusion models helps address issues such as blurring at the edges of medical images and labels, positioning Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) as a promising approach for lesion segmentation. However, we find that the current training and inference strategies of diffusion models result in an uneven distribution of attention across different timesteps, leading to longer training times and suboptimal solutions. To this end, we propose UniSegDiff, a novel diffusion model framework designed to address lesion segmentation in a unified manner across multiple modalities and organs. This framework introduces a staged training and inference approach, dynamically adjusting the prediction targets at different stages, forcing the model to maintain high attention across all timesteps, and achieves unified lesion segmentation through pre-training the feature extraction network for segmentation. We evaluate performance on six different organs across various imaging modalities. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that UniSegDiff significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches.

      <title>DiagR1: A Vision-Language Model Trained via Reinforcement Learning for Digestive Pathology Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal large models have shown great potential in automating pathology image analysis. However, current multimodal models for gastrointestinal pathology are constrained by both data quality and reasoning transparency: pervasive noise and incomplete annotations in public datasets predispose vision language models to factual hallucinations when generating diagnostic text, while the absence of explicit intermediate reasoning chains renders the outputs difficult to audit and thus less trustworthy in clinical practice. To address these issues, we construct a large scale gastrointestinal pathology dataset containing both microscopic descriptions and diagnostic conclusions, and propose a prompt argumentation strategy that incorporates lesion classification and anatomical site information. This design guides the model to better capture image specific features and maintain semantic consistency in generation. Furthermore, we employ a post training pipeline that combines supervised fine tuning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve reasoning quality and output structure. Experimental results on real world pathology report generation tasks demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state of the art open source and proprietary baselines in terms of generation quality, structural completeness, and clinical relevance. Our solution outperforms state of the art models with 18.7% higher clinical relevance, 32.4% improved structural completeness, and 41.2% fewer diagnostic errors, demonstrating superior accuracy and clinical utility compared to existing solutions.</description>

      <title>Flexible Vector Integration in Embedded RISC-V SoCs for End to End CNN Inference Acceleration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of heterogeneity and domain-specific architectures targeting deep learning inference show great potential for enabling the deployment of modern CNNs on resource-constrained embedded platforms. A significant development is the diversification of custom hardware solely targeting the most expensive parts of CNNs. DLAs (deep learning accelerators) and NPUs (neural processing units), among others, can overcome the approaching limits of traditional silicon scaling and provide a solution to the power/performance tradeoff within embedded SoCs. Efficient DSA utilization requires proper system integration and a compilation/execution model for balanced execution in these heterogeneous architectures. There is a critical need for proper system integration and an efficient compilation/execution model for balanced execution in these heterogeneous architectures. This work highlights the hardware integration challenges for efficiently placing these units within the memory hierarchy and correct proximity to other execution blocks. We experimentally verify performance bottlenecks in CNN execution and pre/post-processing at runtime, where previous attention has generally been given to accelerator speedup alone. This work takes advantage of the ratification of the RISC-V Vector 1.0 extension and demonstrates its potential as a flexible target within a well-suited cache hierarchy scheme to reduce pre-processing bottlenecks and CPU fallback processes. Our results show up to a 9x speedup of image pre-processing and YOLOv3 fallback layer execution by up to 3x compared to CPU. We demonstrate RVV-1.0 in exposing a flexible programming model that can enable a balanced computation and memory footprint on accelerator-rich embedded SoCs supporting modern deep-learning dataflows while consuming less power than traditional parallel execution platforms.</description>

      <title>Sliding Window Informative Canonical Correlation Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is a technique for finding correlated sets of features between two datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel extension of CCA to the online, streaming data setting: Sliding Window Informative Canonical Correlation Analysis (SWICCA). Our method uses a streaming principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm as a backend and uses these outputs combined with a small sliding window of samples to estimate the CCA components in real time. We motivate and describe our algorithm, provide numerical simulations to characterize its performance, and provide a theoretical performance guarantee. The SWICCA method is applicable and scalable to extremely high dimensions, and we provide a real-data example that demonstrates this capability.</description>

      <title>Degradation-Consistent Learning via Bidirectional Diffusion for Low-Light Image Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-light image enhancement aims to improve the visibility of degraded images to better align with human visual perception. While diffusion-based methods have shown promising performance due to their strong generative capabilities. However, their unidirectional modelling of degradation often struggles to capture the complexity of real-world degradation patterns, leading to structural inconsistencies and pixel misalignments. To address these challenges, we propose a bidirectional diffusion optimization mechanism that jointly models the degradation processes of both low-light and normal-light images, enabling more precise degradation parameter matching and enhancing generation quality. Specifically, we perform bidirectional diffusion-from low-to-normal light and from normal-to-low light during training and introduce an adaptive feature interaction block (AFI) to refine feature representation. By leveraging the complementarity between these two paths, our approach imposes an implicit symmetry constraint on illumination attenuation and noise distribution, facilitating consistent degradation learning and improving the models ability to perceive illumination and detail degradation. Additionally, we design a reflection-aware correction module (RACM) to guide color restoration post-denoising and suppress overexposed regions, ensuring content consistency and generating high-quality images that align with human visual perception. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations while generalizing effectively to diverse degradation scenarios.

      <title>Synthetic Data Augmentation for Enhanced Chicken Carcass Instance Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The poultry industry has been driven by broiler chicken production and has grown into the world's largest animal protein sector. Automated detection of chicken carcasses on processing lines is vital for quality control, food safety, and operational efficiency in slaughterhouses and poultry processing plants. However, developing robust deep learning models for tasks like instance segmentation in these fast-paced industrial environments is often hampered by the need for laborious acquisition and annotation of large-scale real-world image datasets. We present the first pipeline generating photo-realistic, automatically labeled synthetic images of chicken carcasses. We also introduce a new benchmark dataset containing 300 annotated real-world images, curated specifically for poultry segmentation research. Using these datasets, this study investigates the efficacy of synthetic data and automatic data annotation to enhance the instance segmentation of chicken carcasses, particularly when real annotated data from the processing line is scarce. A small real dataset with varying proportions of synthetic images was evaluated in prominent instance segmentation models. Results show that synthetic data significantly boosts segmentation performance for chicken carcasses across all models. This research underscores the value of synthetic data augmentation as a viable and effective strategy to mitigate data scarcity, reduce manual annotation efforts, and advance the development of robust AI-driven automated detection systems for chicken carcasses in the poultry processing industry.</description>

      <title>X-ray2CTPA: Leveraging Diffusion Models to Enhance Pulmonary Embolism Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16109v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chest X-rays or chest radiography (CXR), commonly used for medical diagnostics, typically enables limited imaging compared to computed tomography (CT) scans, which offer more detailed and accurate three-dimensional data, particularly contrast-enhanced scans like CT Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA). However, CT scans entail higher costs, greater radiation exposure, and are less accessible than CXRs. In this work we explore cross-modal translation from a 2D low contrast-resolution X-ray input to a 3D high contrast and spatial-resolution CTPA scan. Driven by recent advances in generative AI, we introduce a novel diffusion-based approach to this task. We evaluate the models performance using both quantitative metrics and qualitative feedback from radiologists, ensuring diagnostic relevance of the generated images. Furthermore, we employ the synthesized 3D images in a classification framework and show improved AUC in a PE categorization task, using the initial CXR input. The proposed method is generalizable and capable of performing additional cross-modality translations in medical imaging. It may pave the way for more accessible and cost-effective advanced diagnostic tools. The code for this project is available: https://github.com/NoaCahan/X-ray2CTPA .</description>

Abstract: Timely disease diagnosis is challenging due to increasing disease burdens and limited clinician availability. AI shows promise in diagnosis accuracy but faces real-world application issues due to insufficient validation in clinical workflows and diverse populations. This study addresses gaps in medical AI downstream accountability through a case study on age-related macular degeneration (AMD) diagnosis and severity classification. We designed and implemented an AI-assisted diagnostic workflow for AMD, comparing diagnostic performance with and without AI assistance among 24 clinicians from 12 institutions with real patient data sampled from the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS). Additionally, we demonstrated continual enhancement of an existing AI model by incorporating approximately 40,000 additional medical images (named AREDS2 dataset). The improved model was then systematically evaluated using both AREDS and AREDS2 test sets, as well as an external test set from Singapore. AI assistance markedly enhanced diagnostic accuracy and classification for 23 out of 24 clinicians, with the average F1-score increasing by 20% from 37.71 (Manual) to 45.52 (Manual + AI) (P-value &lt; 0.0001), achieving an improvement of over 50% in some cases. In terms of efficiency, AI assistance reduced diagnostic times for 17 out of the 19 clinicians tracked, with time savings of up to 40%. Furthermore, a model equipped with continual learning showed robust performance across three independent datasets, recording a 29% increase in accuracy, and elevating the F1-score from 42 to 54 in the Singapore population.</description>

      <title>ECVC: Exploiting Non-Local Correlations in Multiple Frames for Contextual Video Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09706v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Learned Video Compression (LVC), improving inter prediction, such as enhancing temporal context mining and mitigating accumulated errors, is crucial for boosting rate-distortion performance. Existing LVCs mainly focus on mining the temporal movements while neglecting non-local correlations among frames. Additionally, current contextual video compression models use a single reference frame, which is insufficient for handling complex movements. To address these issues, we propose leveraging non-local correlations across multiple frames to enhance temporal priors, significantly boosting rate-distortion performance. To mitigate error accumulation, we introduce a partial cascaded fine-tuning strategy that supports fine-tuning on full-length sequences with constrained computational resources. This method reduces the train-test mismatch in sequence lengths and significantly decreases accumulated errors. Based on the proposed techniques, we present a video compression scheme ECVC. Experiments demonstrate that our ECVC achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing 10.5% and 11.5% more bit-rates than previous SOTA method DCVC-FM over VTM-13.2 low delay B (LDB) under the intra period (IP) of 32 and -1, respectively.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Implicit Neural Representations for Joint B0 Estimation and Echo Planar Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00230v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Echo Planar Imaging (EPI) is widely used for its rapid acquisition but suffers from severe geometric distortions due to B0 inhomogeneities, particularly along the phase encoding direction. Existing methods follow a two-step process: reconstructing blip-up/down EPI images, then estimating B0, which can introduce error accumulation and reduce correction accuracy. This is especially problematic in high B0 regions, where distortions align along the same axis, making them harder to disentangle. In this work, we propose a novel approach that integrates Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) with a physics-informed correction model to jointly estimate B0 inhomogeneities and reconstruct distortion-free images from rotated-view EPI acquisitions. INRs offer a flexible, continuous representation that inherently captures complex spatial variations without requiring predefined grid-based field maps. By leveraging this property, our method dynamically adapts to subject-specific B0 variations and improves robustness across different imaging conditions. Experimental results on 180 slices of brain images from three subjects demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional methods in terms of reconstruction quality and field estimation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Tackling Hallucination from Conditional Models for Medical Image Reconstruction with DynamicDPS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hallucinations are spurious structures not present in the ground truth, posing a critical challenge in medical image reconstruction, especially for data-driven conditional models. We hypothesize that combining an unconditional diffusion model with data consistency, trained on a diverse dataset, can reduce these hallucinations. Based on this, we propose DynamicDPS, a diffusion-based framework that integrates conditional and unconditional diffusion models to enhance low-quality medical images while systematically reducing hallucinations. Our approach first generates an initial reconstruction using a conditional model, then refines it with an adaptive diffusion-based inverse problem solver. DynamicDPS skips early stage in the reverse process by selecting an optimal starting time point per sample and applies Wolfe's line search for adaptive step sizes, improving both efficiency and image fidelity. Using diffusion priors and data consistency, our method effectively reduces hallucinations from any conditional model output. We validate its effectiveness in Image Quality Transfer for low-field MRI enhancement. Extensive evaluations on synthetic and real MR scans, including a downstream task for tissue volume estimation, show that DynamicDPS reduces hallucinations, improving relative volume estimation by over 15% for critical tissues while using only 5% of the sampling steps required by baseline diffusion models. As a model-agnostic and fine-tuning-free approach, DynamicDPS offers a robust solution for hallucination reduction in medical imaging. The code will be made publicly available upon publication.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05245v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate analysis of prenatal ultrasound (US) is essential for early detection of developmental anomalies. However, operator dependency and technical limitations (e.g. intrinsic artefacts and effects, setting errors) can complicate image interpretation and the assessment of diagnostic uncertainty. We present L-FUSION (Laplacian Fetal US Segmentation with Integrated FoundatiON models), a framework that integrates uncertainty quantification through unsupervised, normative learning and large-scale foundation models for robust segmentation of fetal structures in normal and pathological scans. We propose to utilise the aleatoric logit distributions of Stochastic Segmentation Networks and Laplace approximations with fast Hessian estimations to estimate epistemic uncertainty only from the segmentation head. This enables us to achieve reliable abnormality quantification for instant diagnostic feedback. Combined with an integrated Dropout component, L-FUSION enables reliable differentiation of lesions from normal fetal anatomy with enhanced uncertainty maps and segmentation counterfactuals in US imaging. It improves epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty interpretation and removes the need for manual disease-labelling. Evaluations across multiple datasets show that L-FUSION achieves superior segmentation accuracy and consistent uncertainty quantification, supporting on-site decision-making and offering a scalable solution for advancing fetal ultrasound analysis in clinical settings.</description>

      <title>Modality-Agnostic Brain Lesion Segmentation with Privacy-aware Continual Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20326v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional brain lesion segmentation models for multi-modal MRI are typically tailored to specific pathologies, relying on datasets with predefined modalities. Adapting to new MRI modalities or pathologies often requires training separate models, which contrasts with how medical professionals incrementally expand their expertise by learning from diverse datasets over time. Inspired by this human learning process, we propose a unified segmentation model capable of sequentially learning from multiple datasets with varying modalities and pathologies. Our approach leverages a privacy-aware continual learning framework that integrates a mixture-of-experts mechanism and dual knowledge distillation to mitigate catastrophic forgetting while not compromising performance on newly encountered datasets. Extensive experiments across five diverse brain MRI datasets and four dataset sequences demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in maintaining a single adaptable model, capable of handling varying hospital protocols, imaging modalities, and disease types. Compared to widely used privacy-aware continual learning methods such as LwF, SI, EWC, MiB, and TED, our method achieves an average Dice score improvement of approximately 14%. Our framework represents a significant step toward more versatile and practical brain lesion segmentation models, with implementation available on \href{https://github.com/xmindflow/BrainCL}{GitHub}.</description>

      <title>SR-NeRV: Improving Embedding Efficiency of Neural Video Representation via Super-Resolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have garnered significant attention for their ability to model complex signals in various domains. Recently, INR-based frameworks have shown promise in neural video compression by embedding video content into compact neural networks. However, these methods often struggle to reconstruct high-frequency details under stringent constraints on model size, which are critical in practical compression scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose an INR-based video representation framework that integrates a general-purpose super-resolution (SR) network. This design is motivated by the observation that high-frequency components tend to exhibit low temporal redundancy across frames. By offloading the reconstruction of fine details to a dedicated SR network pre-trained on natural images, the proposed method improves visual fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms conventional INR-based baselines in reconstruction quality, while maintaining a comparable model size.</description>

      <title>BiECVC: Gated Diversification of Bidirectional Contexts for Learned Video Compression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09193v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent forward prediction-based learned video compression (LVC) methods have achieved impressive results, even surpassing VVC reference software VTM under the Low Delay B (LDB) configuration. In contrast, learned bidirectional video compression (BVC) remains underexplored and still lags behind its forward-only counterparts. This performance gap is mainly due to the limited ability to extract diverse and accurate contexts: most existing BVCs primarily exploit temporal motion while neglecting non-local correlations across frames. Moreover, they lack the adaptability to dynamically suppress harmful contexts arising from fast motion or occlusion. To tackle these challenges, we propose BiECVC, a BVC framework that incorporates diversified local and non-local context modeling along with adaptive context gating. For local context enhancement, BiECVC reuses high-quality features from lower layers and aligns them using decoded motion vectors without introducing extra motion overhead. To model non-local dependencies efficiently, we adopt a linear attention mechanism that balances performance and complexity. To further mitigate the impact of inaccurate context prediction, we introduce Bidirectional Context Gating, inspired by data-dependent decay in recent autoregressive language models, to dynamically filter contextual information based on conditional coding results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BiECVC achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing the bit-rate by 13.4% and 15.7% compared to VTM 13.2 under the Random Access (RA) configuration with intra periods of 32 and 64, respectively. To our knowledge, BiECVC is the first learned video codec to surpass VTM 13.2 RA across all standard test datasets.</description>

      <title>Rate-Accuracy Bounds in Visual Coding for Machines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14980v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Increasingly, visual signals such as images, videos and point clouds are being captured solely for the purpose of automated analysis by computer vision models. Applications include traffic monitoring, robotics, autonomous driving, smart home, and many others. This trend has led to the need to develop compression strategies for these signals for the purpose of analysis rather than reconstruction, an area often referred to as "coding for machines." By drawing parallels with lossy coding of a discrete memoryless source, in this paper we derive rate-accuracy bounds on several popular problems in visual coding for machines, and compare these with state-of-the-art results from the literature. The comparison shows that the current results are at least an order of magnitude -- and in some cases two or three orders of magnitude -- away from the theoretical bounds in terms of the bitrate needed to achieve a certain level of accuracy. This, in turn, means that there is much room for improvement in the current methods for visual coding for machines.</description>

Abstract: Accurate remote sensing geographic mapping requires timely and representative samples. However, rapid land surface changes often render static samples obsolete within months, making manual sample updates labor-intensive and unsustainable. To address this challenge, we propose TasGen, a two-stage Temporal spectral-aware Automatic Sample Generation method for generating dynamic training samples from single-date static labels without human intervention. Land surface dynamics often manifest as anomalies in temporal-spectral sequences. %These anomalies are multivariate yet unified: temporal, spectral, or joint anomalies stem from different mechanisms and cannot be naively coupled, as this may obscure the nature of changes. Yet, any land surface state corresponds to a coherent temporal-spectral signature, which would be lost if the two dimensions are modeled separately. To effectively capture these dynamics, TasGen first disentangles temporal and spectral features to isolate their individual contributions, and then couples them to model their synergistic interactions. In the first stage, we introduce a hierarchical temporal-spectral variational autoencoder (HTS-VAE) with a dual-dimension embedding to learn low-dimensional latent patterns of normal samples by first disentangling and then jointly embedding temporal and spectral information. This temporal-spectral embedding enables robust anomaly detection by identifying deviations from learned joint patterns. In the second stage, a classifier trained on stable samples relabels change points across time to generate dynamic samples. To not only detect but also explain surface dynamics, we further propose an anomaly interpretation method based on Gibbs sampling, which attributes changes to specific spectral-temporal dimensions.</description>

      <title>crossMoDA Challenge: Evolution of Cross-Modality Domain Adaptation Techniques for Vestibular Schwannoma and Cochlea Segmentation from 2021 to 2023</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12006v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cross-Modality Domain Adaptation (crossMoDA) challenge series, initiated in 2021 in conjunction with the International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI), focuses on unsupervised cross-modality segmentation, learning from contrast-enhanced T1 (ceT1) and transferring to T2 MRI. The task is an extreme example of domain shift chosen to serve as a meaningful and illustrative benchmark. From a clinical application perspective, it aims to automate Vestibular Schwannoma (VS) and cochlea segmentation on T2 scans for more cost-effective VS management. Over time, the challenge objectives have evolved to enhance its clinical relevance. The challenge evolved from using single-institutional data and basic segmentation in 2021 to incorporating multi-institutional data and Koos grading in 2022, and by 2023, it included heterogeneous routine data and sub-segmentation of intra- and extra-meatal tumour components. In this work, we report the findings of the 2022 and 2023 editions and perform a retrospective analysis of the challenge progression over the years. The observations from the successive challenge contributions indicate that the number of outliers decreases with an expanding dataset. This is notable since the diversity of scanning protocols of the datasets concurrently increased. The winning approach of the 2023 edition reduced the number of outliers on the 2021 and 2022 testing data, demonstrating how increased data heterogeneity can enhance segmentation performance even on homogeneous data. However, the cochlea Dice score declined in 2023, likely due to the added complexity from tumour sub-annotations affecting overall segmentation performance. While progress is still needed for clinically acceptable VS segmentation, the plateauing performance suggests that a more challenging cross-modal task may better serve future benchmarking.</description>

      <title>EndoControlMag: Robust Endoscopic Vascular Motion Magnification with Periodic Reference Resetting and Hierarchical Tissue-aware Dual-Mask Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15292v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visualizing subtle vascular motions in endoscopic surgery is crucial for surgical precision and decision-making, yet remains challenging due to the complex and dynamic nature of surgical scenes. To address this, we introduce EndoControlMag, a training-free, Lagrangian-based framework with mask-conditioned vascular motion magnification tailored to endoscopic environments. Our approach features two key modules: a Periodic Reference Resetting (PRR) scheme that divides videos into short overlapping clips with dynamically updated reference frames to prevent error accumulation while maintaining temporal coherence, and a Hierarchical Tissue-aware Magnification (HTM) framework with dual-mode mask dilation. HTM first tracks vessel cores using a pretrained visual tracking model to maintain accurate localization despite occlusions and view changes. It then applies one of two adaptive softening strategies to surrounding tissues: motion-based softening that modulates magnification strength proportional to observed tissue displacement, or distance-based exponential decay that simulates biomechanical force attenuation. This dual-mode approach accommodates diverse surgical scenarios-motion-based softening excels with complex tissue deformations while distance-based softening provides stability during unreliable optical flow conditions. We evaluate EndoControlMag on our EndoVMM24 dataset spanning four different surgery types and various challenging scenarios, including occlusions, instrument disturbance, view changes, and vessel deformations. Quantitative metrics, visual assessments, and expert surgeon evaluations demonstrate that EndoControlMag significantly outperforms existing methods in both magnification accuracy and visual quality while maintaining robustness across challenging surgical conditions. The code, dataset, and video results are available at https://szupc.github.io/EndoControlMag/.</description>

      <title>MLRU++: Multiscale Lightweight Residual UNETR++ with Attention for Efficient 3D Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient medical image segmentation is crucial but challenging due to anatomical variability and high computational demands on volumetric data. Recent hybrid CNN-Transformer architectures achieve state-of-the-art results but add significant complexity. In this paper, we propose MLRU++, a Multiscale Lightweight Residual UNETR++ architecture designed to balance segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency. It introduces two key innovations: a Lightweight Channel and Bottleneck Attention Module (LCBAM) that enhances contextual feature encoding with minimal overhead, and a Multiscale Bottleneck Block (M2B) in the decoder that captures fine-grained details via multi-resolution feature aggregation. Experiments on four publicly available benchmark datasets (Synapse, BTCV, ACDC, and Decathlon Lung) demonstrate that MLRU++ achieves state-of-the-art performance, with average Dice scores of 87.57% (Synapse), 93.00% (ACDC), and 81.12% (Lung). Compared to existing leading models, MLRU++ improves Dice scores by 5.38% and 2.12% on Synapse and ACDC, respectively, while significantly reducing parameter count and computational cost. Ablation studies evaluating LCBAM and M2B further confirm the effectiveness of the proposed architectural components. Results suggest that MLRU++ offers a practical and high-performing solution for 3D medical image segmentation tasks. Source code is available at: https://github.com/1027865/MLRUPP</description>

      <title>Cloud gap-filling with deep learning for improved grassland monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09554v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Uninterrupted optical image time series are crucial for the timely monitoring of agricultural land changes, particularly in grasslands. However, the continuity of such time series is often disrupted by clouds. In response to this challenge, we propose an innovative deep learning method that integrates cloud-free optical (Sentinel-2) observations and weather-independent (Sentinel-1) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. Our approach employs a hybrid architecture combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to generate continuous Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series, highlighting the role of NDVI in the synergy between SAR and optical data. We demonstrate the significance of observation continuity by assessing the impact of the generated NDVI time series on the downstream task of grassland mowing event detection. We conducted our study in Lithuania, a country characterized by extensive cloud coverage, and compared our approach with alternative interpolation techniques (i.e., linear, Akima, quadratic). Our method outperformed these techniques, achieving an average Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.024 and a coefficient of determination R^2 of 0.92. Additionally, our analysis revealed improvement in the performance of the mowing event detection, with F1-score up to 84% using two widely applied mowing detection methodologies. Our method also effectively mitigated sudden shifts and noise originating from cloudy observations, which are often missed by conventional cloud masks and adversely affect mowing detection precision.</description>

      <title>Provably Convergent Plug-and-play Proximal Block Coordinate Descent Method for Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14824v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hyperspectral anomaly detection refers to identifying pixels in the hyperspectral images that have spectral characteristics significantly different from the background. In this paper, we introduce a novel model that represents the background information using a low-rank representation. We integrate an implicit proximal denoiser prior, associated with a deep learning based denoiser, within a plug-and-play (PnP) framework to effectively remove noise from the eigenimages linked to the low-rank representation. Anomalies are characterized using a generalized group sparsity measure, denoted as $\|\cdot\|_{2,\psi}$. To solve the resulting orthogonal constrained nonconvex nonsmooth optimization problem, we develop a PnP-proximal block coordinate descent (PnP-PBCD) method, where the eigenimages are updated using a proximal denoiser within the PnP framework. We prove that any accumulation point of the sequence generated by the PnP-PBCD method is a stationary point. We evaluate the effectiveness of the PnP-PBCD method on hyperspectral anomaly detection in scenarios with and without Gaussian noise contamination. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively detect anomalous objects, outperforming the competing methods that may mistakenly identify noise as anomalies or misidentify the anomalous objects due to noise interference.</description>

      <title>MAD-AD: Masked Diffusion for Unsupervised Brain Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16943v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection in brain images is crucial for identifying injuries and pathologies without access to labels. However, the accurate localization of anomalies in medical images remains challenging due to the inherent complexity and variability of brain structures and the scarcity of annotated abnormal data. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that incorporates masking within diffusion models, leveraging their generative capabilities to learn robust representations of normal brain anatomy. During training, our model processes only normal brain MRI scans and performs a forward diffusion process in the latent space that adds noise to the features of randomly-selected patches. Following a dual objective, the model learns to identify which patches are noisy and recover their original features. This strategy ensures that the model captures intricate patterns of normal brain structures while isolating potential anomalies as noise in the latent space. At inference, the model identifies noisy patches corresponding to anomalies and generates a normal counterpart for these patches by applying a reverse diffusion process. Our method surpasses existing unsupervised anomaly detection techniques, demonstrating superior performance in generating accurate normal counterparts and localizing anomalies. The code is available at hhttps://github.com/farzad-bz/MAD-AD.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first three-dimensional theoretical model of microparticle-assisted super-resolution imaging, enabling accurate simulation of virtual image formation. The model reveals that accounting for partial spatial coherence of illumination is a fundamental prerequisite for achieving super-resolution. We also propose a novel illumination strategy based on suppressing the normal component of incident light, which enhances image contrast and resolution. The results establish a consistent wave-optical framework that reproduces experimentally observed subwavelength imaging and clarifies the underlying physical mechanisms.</description>

      <title>DAA*: Deep Angular A Star for Image-based Path Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09305v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Path smoothness is often overlooked in path imitation learning from expert demonstrations. In this paper, we introduce a novel learning method, termed deep angular A* (DAA*), by incorporating the proposed path angular freedom (PAF) into A* to improve path similarity through adaptive path smoothness. The PAF aims to explore the effect of move angles on path node expansion by finding the trade-off between their minimum and maximum values, allowing for high adaptiveness for imitation learning. DAA* improves path optimality by closely aligning with the reference path through joint optimization of path shortening and smoothing, which correspond to heuristic distance and PAF, respectively. Throughout comprehensive evaluations on 7 datasets, including 4 maze datasets, 2 video-game datasets, and a real-world drone-view dataset containing 2 scenarios, we demonstrate remarkable improvements of our DAA* over neural A* in path similarity between the predicted and reference paths with a shorter path length when the shortest path is plausible, improving by 9.0% SPR, 6.9% ASIM, and 3.9% PSIM. Furthermore, when jointly learning pathfinding with both path loss and path probability map loss, DAA* significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art TransPath by 6.3% SPR, 6.0% PSIM, and 3.7% ASIM. We also discuss the minor trade-off between path optimality and search efficiency where applicable. Our code and model weights are available at https://github.com/zwxu064/DAAStar.git.</description>
