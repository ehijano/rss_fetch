      <title>Potential of Ka-band Range Rate Post-fit Residuals for High-frequency Mass Change Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first extensive analysis of K/Ka-band ranging post-fit residuals of an official Level-2 product, characterised as Line-of-Sight Gravity Differences (LGD), which exhibit and showcase interesting sub-monthly geophysical signals. These residuals, provided by CSR, were derived from the difference between spherical harmonic coefficient least-squares fits and reduced Level-1B range-rate observations. We classified the geophysical signals into four distinct categories: oceanic, meteorological, hydrological, and solid Earth, focusing primarily on the first three categories in this study. In our examination of oceanic processes, we identified notable mass anomalies in the Argentine basin, specifically within the Zapiola Rise, where persistent remnants of the rotating dipole-like modes are evident in the LGD post-fit residuals. Our analysis extended to the Gulf of Carpentaria and Australia during the 2013 Oswald cyclone, revealing significant LGD residual anomalies that correlate with cyclone tracking and precipitation data. Additionally, we investigated the monsoon seasons in Bangladesh, particularly from June to September 2007, where we observed peaks in sub-monthly variability. These findings were further validated by demonstrating high spatial and temporal correlations between gridded LGD residuals and ITSG-Grace2018 daily solutions. Given that these anomalies are associated with significant mass change phenomena, it is essential to integrate the post-fit residuals into a high-frequency mass change framework, with the purpose of providing enhanced spatial resolution compared to conventional Kalman-filtered methods.</description>

      <title>Non-parametric kernel density estimation of magnitude distribution for the analysis of seismic hazard posed by anthropogenic seismicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequent significant deviations of the observed magnitude distribution of anthropogenic seismicity from the Gutenberg-Richter relation require alternative estimation methods for probabilistic seismic hazard assessments. We evaluate five nonparametric kernel density estimation (KDE) methods on simulated samples drawn from four magnitude distribution models: the exponential, concave and convex bi-exponential, and exponential-Gaussian distributions. The latter three represent deviations from the Gutenberg-Richter relation due to the finite thickness of the seismogenic crust and the effect of characteristic earthquakes. The assumed deviations from exponentiality are never more than those met in practice. The studied KDE methods include Silverman's and Scott's rules with Abramson's bandwidth adaptation, two diffusion-based methods (ISJ and diffKDE), and adaptiveKDE, which formulates the bandwidth estimation as an optimization problem. We assess their performance for magnitudes from 2 to 6 with sample sizes of 400 to 5000, using the mean integrated square error (MISE) over 100,000 simulations. Their suitability in hazard assessments is illustrated by the mean of the mean return period (MRP) for a sample size of 1000. Among the tested methods, diffKDE provides the most accurate cumulative distribution function estimates for larger magnitudes. Even when the data is drawn from an exponential distribution, diffKDE performs comparably to maximum likelihood estimation when the sample size is at least 1000. Given that anthropogenic seismicity often deviates from the exponential model, we recommend using diffKDE for probabilistic seismic hazard assessments whenever a sufficient sample size is available.</description>

      <title>A multi-phase thermo-mechanical model for rock-ice avalanche</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06130v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel physically-based multi-phase thermo-mechanical model for rock-ice avalanche. It considers rock, ice and fluid; includes the mechanism of ice-melting and a rigorously derived dynamically changing general temperature equation for avalanching mass. It explains advection-diffusion of heat including the heat exchange across the rock-ice avalanche, basal heat conduction, production and loss of heat due to frictional shearing and changing temperature, enhancement of temperature due to basal entrainment and a general formulation of the ice melting rate. The temperature equation couples the rate of change of thermal conductivity and temperature. Ice melt intensity determines these rates as mixture conductivity evolves, characterizing distinctive thermo-mechanical processes. Lateral heat productions play an important role in temperature evolution. Fast moving avalanches produce higher amount of heat. Fast ice melting results in substantial change in temperature. We formally derive the melting efficiency dependent general fluid production rate. The model includes internal mass and momentum exchanges between the phases and mass and momentum productions due to entrainment. The latter significantly changes the state of temperature; yet, the former exclusively characterizes the rock-ice avalanche. Temperature changes are rapid when the heat entrainment across the avalanche boundary is substantial. It also applies to basal heat conduction. A strong coupling exists between phase mass and momentum balances and the temperature equation. The new model offers the first-ever complete dynamical solution for simulating rock-ice avalanche with changing temperature. We also develop a simple thermo-mechanical advection-diffusion-decay-source model and its exact-analytical solutions providing fundamentally novel understanding of the temperature evolution in the rock-ice avalanche.</description>

      <title>Seismic Traveltime Inversion with Quantum Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06611v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study demonstrates the application of quantum computing based quantum annealing to seismic traveltime inversion, a critical approach for inverting highly accurate velocity models. The seismic inversion problem is first converted into a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization problem, which the quantum annealer is specifically designed to solve. We then solve the problem via quantum annealing method. The inversion is applied on a synthetic velocity model, presenting a carbon storage scenario at depths of 1000-1300 meters. As an application example, we also show the capacity of quantum computing to handle complex, noisy data environments. This work highlights the emerging potential of quantum computing in geophysical applications, providing a foundation for future developments in high-precision seismic imaging.</description>
