      <title>Warped Dimensions at the Cosmological Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extra dimensions are present in many beyond the Standard Model scenarios, most notably in string theory. However, direct signatures of extra dimensions are difficult to observe in many cases. This is the situation, for example, if the energy scales associated with extra dimensions are close to the string or Grand Unification scale. The energetic early universe provides an exciting opportunity to overcome this challenge, since the heavy states associated with high-scale extra dimensions, such as scalar moduli and Kaluza-Klein (KK) gravitons, could have been produced on-shell at early epochs. In this work, we illustrate this by focusing on how such states can be produced during inflation and leave signatures in primordial non-Gaussianity (NG). Specifically, we consider a 5D spacetime with a warped extra dimension that remains stabilized as inflation proceeds in the four non-compact dimensions. By discussing an explicit stabilization mechanism, we compute the masses and couplings of the radion modulus and the KK graviton modes. Being gravitational degrees of freedom, these unavoidably couple to the field(s) generating curvature perturbation, and can lead to observable NG with a distinctive oscillatory shape and characteristic angular dependence. We give example benchmarks which can already be probed by the Planck data and identify targets for the future. Our study shows that cosmological surveys have the potential to observe on-shell imprints of extra dimensions in the coming years.</description>

      <title>Generative Unfolding of Jets and Their Substructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unfolding, for example of distortions imparted by detectors, provides suitable and publishable representations of LHC data. Many methods for unbinned and high-dimensional unfolding using machine learning have been proposed, but no generative method scales to the several hundred dimensions necessary to fully characterize LHC collisions. This paper proposes a 3-stage generative unfolding framework that is capable of unfolding several hundred dimensions. It is effective to unfold the jet-level kinematics as well as the full substructure of light-flavor jets and of top jets, and is the first generative unfolding study to achieve high precision on high-dimensional jet substructure.</description>

      <title>Beyond Qubits: Multilevel Quantum Sensing for Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum sensing with qubits has advanced fundamental physics searches, but higher dimensional systems offer untapped potential. We present a universal qutrit framework that yields a sequence-independent fourfold increase in quantum Fisher information and a twofold gain in sensitivity. In ultralight dark matter searches, spin-1 NV-center qutrits can enhance the axion-electron coupling reach by an order of magnitude beyond qubits. This principle applies broadly to multilevel quantum systems including superconducting, neutral atom and trapped-ion qutrits, establishing higher dimensional sensing as a powerful tool for probing new physics.</description>

      <title>Probing the vacuum as a chiral medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the circular birefringence experienced by linearly polarised photons colliding with a circularly polarised background creating a vacuum of definite chirality (handedness). For this scenario the standard Heisenberg-Euler approach fails and must be supplemented by derivative corrections which we match to known Hilbert series. Choosing a plane wave background, we find equivalence between three approaches: (i) adding derivative corrections to the Heisenberg-Euler Lagrangian; (ii) improving the locally constant field approximation to the one-loop polarisation tensor; (iii) performing a low-energy expansion of the direct $2\to 2$ QED photon-photon scattering amplitude. Going beyond plane-wave backgrounds, we analyse an example of a circularly polarised standing wave sensitive to derivative corrections. We find a parameter regime where these corrections could be probed in experiments.</description>

      <title>Constructive Heavy Particle Effective Theory with Nonlinear Poincar\'{e} Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a constructive heavy particle effective theory (HPET) through the nonlinear realization of the spontaneously broken Poincar\'{e} symmetry $R^{3,1} \rtimes SO(3,1) \rightarrow R^{3,1} \rtimes SO(3)$. Starting from the heavy one-particle state, we find the nonlinear boost transformation indicates the shift symmetry in the coset construction, corresponding to the reparameterization invariance. Using the little group Wigner rotation, we obtain the nonlinear boost transformation for corresponding heavy field, recovering the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation. At the operator level, since interaction terms would modify the nonlinear transformation, we propose a most general parametrization on the boost transformation only based on symmetry. The nonlinear boost transformation relates different Wilson coefficients of the HPET operators, providing a bottom-up approach of constructing the independent HPET operators, and generalizing the top-down HPET operators beyond the tree-level integrating out. Utilizing the HPET as example, we obtain additional constraints for the boost transformation as well as the additional variation $\delta \mathcal{L}$ at the $1/m^3$.</description>

      <title>A simple model for PDFs and nPDFs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the main results of our recent papers, where we derived an analytical solution of the QCD evolution equations for parton distribution functions. The valence and non-singlet quark components satisfy the Gross-Llewellyn-Smith and Gottfried sum rules, respectively, while momentum conservation is maintained for the singlet quark and gluon densities. Several phenomenological parameters were extracted from a combined fit to precision data on the proton structure function $F_2(x,Q^2)$ collected by the BCDMS, H1, and ZEUS Collaborations, comprising a total of 933 points from 5 datasets. We proposed a model for nuclear medium modifications of parton densities. The approach is based on a global analysis of available deep inelastic scattering data for different nuclear targets within the rescaling model, incorporating Fermi motion effects. By fitting the rescaling parameters to experimental data on the ratio $F_2^A(x,Q^2)/F_2^{D}(x,Q^2)$ for several nuclear targets $A$, we obtained predictions for nuclear parton distribution functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This brief review presents the key components of light-front holographic quantum chromodynamics (HLFQCD). Particular attention is given to the introduction of the QCD color confinement scale within the context of a graded superconformal algebra. A concise overview of applications is provided, including spectroscopy, form factors, parton distributions of hadrons, and the relationship between entanglement entropy and high-energy scattering. While many other recent applications of HLFQCD exist in the literature, they are not included in this short overview of our latest work.</description>

      <title>Eigen-microstate Signatures of Criticality in Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel eigen-microstate approach to expose critical patterns in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We explicitly construct the original microstate, defined as the final-state particle fluctuations of a single event. By examining ensembles of such microstates with controlled critical signals, we demonstrate that the approach is highly effective in detecting and quantifying critical patterns, with the largest eigenvalue serving as a robust order parameter. This framework is directly applicable to RHIC Beam Energy Scan data, offering a powerful new direction in the search for the QCD critical point.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Regression and Differentiable Fits in Beyond the Standard Model Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the efficacy of symbolic regression (SR) to probe models of particle physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM), by considering the so-called Constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (CMSSM). Like many incarnations of BSM physics this model has a number (four) of arbitrary parameters, which determine the experimental signals, and cosmological observables such as the dark matter relic density. We show that analysis of the phenomenology can be greatly accelerated by using symbolic expressions derived for the observables in terms of the input parameters. Here we focus on the Higgs mass, the cold dark matter relic density, and the contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. We find that SR can produce remarkably accurate expressions. Using them we make global fits to derive the posterior probability densities of the CMSSM input parameters which are in good agreement with those performed using conventional methods. Moreover, we demonstrate a major advantage of SR which is the ability to make fits using differentiable methods rather than sampling methods. We also compare the method with neural network (NN) regression. SR produces more globally robust results, while NNs require data that is focussed on the promising regions in order to be equally performant.</description>

      <title>GUT-Scale Smooth Hybrid Inflation with a Stabilized Modulus in Light of ACT and SPT Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a generalized framework of smooth F-term hybrid inflation (smFHI) consistent with gauge coupling unification within the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). The embedding of the model in two specific Supergravity settings addresses at the same time the $\eta$ problem and the compatibility with the recent ACT or SPT data. The one relies on the choice of a shift-symmetric K\"ahler potential for the inflaton which revitalizes the SUSY predictions of smFHI, whereas the other employs a K\"ahler potential associated with an hyperbolic K\"ahler manifold. An essential role in both our constructions is played by a decoupled superheavy field without superpotential and Kaehler potential inspired by string- and D-brane--based models. Our proposal can be realized for a variety of representations for the Higgs fields involved in smFHI and assures monotonic inflationary potential.</description>

      <title>NNLO QCD predictions for jet observables in ZH production at electron-positron colliders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present precise predictions for a variety of jet observables in $ZH$ production at electron-positron colliders, with the $Z$ boson decaying leptonically and the Higgs boson decaying into two hadronic jets, up to NNLO in perturbative QCD. We consider a Higgs boson decaying into bottom (charm) quark pairs via Yukawa interaction and into gluons via an effective vertex in the limit of infinite top quark mass. We present results for the two decay modes separately, highlighting relevant differences in the differential distributions, and for the sum of all decay channels, including a comparison between different choices of the Durham (or $k_T$) jet resolution parameter.</description>

      <title>QCD corrections to the electroweak sphaleron rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electroweak sphaleron rate in the high temperature phase of the Standard Model is inversely proportional to the weak-isospin conductivity. So far, only electroweak interactions were included in its computation. Here we take into account quark scattering through strong interactions at leading-log order. These reduce the quark contribution to the conductivity by up to 15 %, and the total conductivity by up to 6 %.</description>

      <title>Proposal to use accelerated electrons to probe the axion-electron coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The axion is a hypothetical particle associated with a possible solution to the strong CP problem and is a leading candidate for dark matter. In this paper we investigate the emission of axions by accelerated electrons. We find the emission probability and energy within the WKB approximation for an electron accelerated by an electromagnetic field. As an application, we estimate the number of axions produced by electrons accelerated using two counter-propagating high-intensity lasers and discuss how they would be converted to photons to be detected. We find that, under realistic experimental conditions, competitive model-independent bounds on the coupling between the axion and the electron could be achieved in such an experiment.</description>

      <title>An Axial-Vector Leptophilic Fifth Force Sourced by Solar Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate long-range, purely leptophilic axial-vector interactions mediated by a light gauge boson $A'$ that couples to charged leptons and, by weak symmetry, to left-handed neutrinos. We analyze two realizations, a minimal effective model with muon-only couplings and an anomaly-free axial $U(1)'$ with inter-generation cancellations. In both cases, the solar neutrino flux acts as an extended current that sources a macroscopic $A'$ field at Earth, with spatial components aligned along the Sun-Earth direction. This field produces a distinctive signature in storage-ring measurements of the muon anomalous magnetic moment, $(g-2)_\mu$, namely a diurnal, sign-changing contribution that is positive during daytime and negative at night, superimposed on a time-independent positive offset. We obtain bounds $g' \lesssim {O}(10^{-19})$ in both model frameworks for a light, effectively massless mediator. For completeness, we map the solar-neutrino-sourced potential to electron spin-sensor experiments and find $g' \lesssim {O}(10^{-22})$ in the electron channel.</description>

      <title>Shear viscosity of a binary mixture for a relativistic fluid at high temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The determination of the shear viscosity is a central topic in various areas of modern physics. In particular, it is often necessary to evaluate the shear viscosity $\eta$ of fluids made up of more than one species, all interacting with different cross sections. Since it may be difficult to extract information on the interaction among different species, various combinations of the viscosities of the individual components are often used. We work in the Chapman-Enskog framework and investigate on binary mixtures, by comparing such single component combinations with a full 2-component formalism: we find that, in most cases, the full viscosity is well approximated by a weighted linear average of the single component viscosities, although this result is far from being general. Moreover, we validate our 2-component Chapman-Enskog results for $\eta$ by comparing them with an independent numerical simulation of the Boltzmann equation, which estimates the shear viscosity via a Green-Kubo formula, in the case of a quasi-particle system that reproduces lattice QCD thermodynamics. We see that the temperature dependence of $\eta/s$ of such system of quarks and gluons is not well described by combinations of the individual components, highlighting the importance of inter-species scattering.</description>

Abstract: Mergers of white dwarf binaries are a possible progenitor channel for Type Ia supernovae. While white dwarfs are abundant in the universe and relatively well understood, their gravitational wave signals have not yet been directly observed. In order to detect gravitational waves from merging white dwarf binaries, a detector in the mid-band between LVK and LISA appears necessary. In this paper, we compute and discuss the gravitational waves emitted by inspiraling and merging white dwarf binaries, and assess their detectability with proposed space-based atom-interferometer detectors such as MAGIS Space and AEDGE. Gravitational waves from massive white dwarf binaries can be observed for many years before merger, offering a unique early warning of their final explosion. Our projections suggest that MAGIS Space could detect signals from Type Ia supernova progenitors at least once every four years, while AEDGE could observe at least a few hundred such events annually. The prolonged gravitational wave emission captured by atom-interferometers provides precise sky localisation and can allow observation of the final explosion with electromagnetic telescopes. The combined observation with electromagnetic radiation from the white dwarf binary coalescence could open a new pathway for multi-messenger astronomy involving some of the brightest transient events in the universe.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Swift Memory Burden Effect with GW250114-like Events</title>

Abstract: Black hole spectroscopy allows to infer the properties of the remnant of a binary black hole coalescence. Motivated by the recent proposal that a black hole's information load can alter its classical response to small perturbations, an effect known as the swift memory burden, we develop a minimal phenomenological framework to analyze the ringdown of a binary black hole merger and confront it with the data from the GW250114 event. We perform a Bayesian analysis combining the frequencies of the (220) and (440) quasi-normal modes and obtain a lower bound $\log_{10}p \gtrsim 2$, where $p$ controls how the gaps reopen when the black hole's master mode occupation departs from the critical value. Moreover, using a Fisher information matrix (high signal-to-noise ratio) approximation, we forecast the lower bound $\log_{10}p \gtrsim 5$ for a GW250114-like event observed with Cosmic Explorer. Our results disfavour rapid gap reopening, shedding light on how the swift memory burden effect can be probed with current and next-generation detectors.</description>

      <title>Dephasing in binary black hole mergers surrounded by scalar wave dark matter clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scalar fields of masses between $10^{-21}\rm{eV}/c^2$ and $10^{-11} \rm{eV}/c^2$ can exhibit enhanced gravitational interactions with black holes, and form scalar clouds around them. Such a cloud modifies the dynamics of a coalescing black-hole binary, and the resulting gravitational waves may provide a new channel to detect light scalar fields, such as axion-like particles or wave-like dark matter candidates. In this work we simulate a series of black-hole mergers with mass ratios $q=1$ and $q=1/2$, immersed in an scalar field overdensity with masses in the range $M\mu_{\rm{S}} \in[0,1.0]$. To do so, we implemented a constraint-satisfying initial data solver based on the puncture method, we improved the accuracy of our open-source software Canuda to eighth order finite differences, and we reduced the initial orbital eccentricity. We investigate the impact of the scalar mass on the gravitational and scalar radiation. We find that binaries can undergo a delayed or an accelerated merger with respect to the vacuum. Our study highlights the challenge and importance of accurately modeling black-hole binaries in dark matter environments.</description>

      <title>Two-loop QCD Amplitudes from the Chiral Algebra Bootstrap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the chiral algebra bootstrap, which computes form factors of twistorial theories, can help determine two-loop amplitudes in massless QCD. We give an $n$-gluon result for a previously unknown partial amplitude of the two-loop all-plus-helicity QCD amplitude by utilizing supersymmetry Ward identities and known chiral algebra bootstrap results. We then show that the full-color two-loop $n$-gluon amplitude of QCD with $n_f$ quark flavors can be obtained from certain two-loop form factors of twistorial theories and one-loop and tree-level amplitudes. Chiral algebra bootstrap results exist for these form factors when all gluons have positive helicities. Hence, the bootstrap simplifies the computation of these two-loop amplitudes by one loop level.</description>

      <title>Gauss-Bonnet entropy and thermal dynamics of RN-AdS black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the thermodynamics of a novel solution for the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m-Anti-de Sitter (AdS) black hole, uniquely incorporating the Gauss-Bonnet term. Unlike previous studies that primarily focused on standard General Relativity or other modifications, this inclusion allows for a modified entropy formulation, facilitating the computation of key thermodynamic quantities such as Gibbs free energy, the first law of thermodynamics, the equation of state, and Hawking temperature. We identify critical points and graphically represent the relationship between temperature and Gibbs free energy as a function of the horizon radius. Ultimately, we assess the thermal stability of the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m-AdS black hole within the framework of Gauss-Bonnet gravity, emphasizing the influence of the Gauss-Bonnet term unlike previous studies that primarily focused on standard General Relativity or other modifications. As a result, it is found that the Gauss-Bonnet coupling significantly alters the thermodynamic behavior and stability structure of the black hole, revealing richer phase transition phenomena.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping Six-Gluon QCD Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a symbol-level bootstrap construction of the planar, two-loop six-gluon scattering amplitude for the --++++ helicity configuration in QCD, focusing on the maximal weight pieces-the "most complicated terms" in the sense of Lipatov et al. Building on recent advances in the understanding of the relevant function space, we incorporate as a crucial new ingredient the complete set of leading singularities, obtained from an explicit analysis of on-shell diagrams. The resulting expressions are manifestly conformally invariant and clarify the structure of previous five-particle results. Combining this with the symbol bootstrap, we show that constraints from physical limits are sufficient to uniquely determine the answer. We thus obtain the first concrete characterization of two-loop six-gluon amplitudes at the symbol level and at highest weight. Remarkably, we find that the effective function space involves only 137 symbol letters, significantly fewer than the full set of 167 possible letters, suggesting a yet-unexplained underlying structure akin to that seen in maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. From the novel amplitude results we extract previously unknown symbol-level results describing two-loop triple collinear and double soft limits.</description>

Abstract: Substantial contribution of the tensor current in semileptonic decays is regarded as a clear signal for new physics. In this work, we propose a model-independent approach to unambiguously test contribution of the tensor current in semileptonic five-body decays $\bar{D}_{(s)}/\bar{B}_{(s)}\to V\ell\bar{\nu}_{\ell}\,(\ell=e,\mu,\tau)$ with $V\to \pi^0\pi^+\pi^-$, where $V$ denotes vector particles. We derive three parameters associated with the angular asymmetry, which are always equal to one in the Standard Model regardless the data of form factor but will deviate if contribution of the tensor current doesn't vanish. The outcomes have potential applications in precisely testing the Standard Model and searching for new physics. Relevant measurements can be performed using data collected by BESIII, Belle~II, and LHCb.</description>

      <title>Probing the QCD $\bar \theta$ term with paramagnetic molecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The experimental search for CP violation in paramagnetic atomic and molecular systems has made impressive progress in recent years. This has led to strong upper limits on the electron electric dipole moment. The same measurements can also be used to constrain hadronic sources of CP violation through CP-violating interactions between the electrons and the nucleus. We employ heavy-baryon chiral perturbation theory to compute such CP-violating semileptonic electron-nucleus interactions arising from the QCD theta term. We sharpen earlier results by determining the relevant short-distance effects and by an explicit two-loop calculation of meson-photon diagrams. We derive a bound of $|\bar{\theta}| &lt; 1.5 \cdot 10^{-8}$ at $90\%$ confidence, based on HfF$^+$ experiments at JILA. A further experimental improvement of one to two orders of magnitude would make paramagnetic molecular electric dipole moment experiments competitive with the neutron and diamagnetic atom program in constraining strong CP violation and higher-dimensional CP-odd quark-gluon operators.</description>

      <title>Using neutron stars to probe dark matter charged under a $L_\mu-L_\tau$ symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kinetic heating of old cold neutron stars, via the scattering of dark matter with matter in the star, provides a promising way to probe the nature of dark matter interactions. We consider a dark matter candidate that is a Standard Model singlet Dirac fermion, charged under a $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ symmetry. Such dark matter interacts with quarks and electrons only via loop-induced couplings, and hence is weakly constrained by direct-detection experiments and cosmic-microwave background observations. However, tree-level interactions with muons enable the dark matter to interact efficiently with the relativistic muon component of a neutron star, heating the star substantially. Using a fully relativistic approach for dark matter capture in the star, we show that observations of old cold neutron stars can probe a substantial, yet unexplored, region of parameter space for dark matter masses in the range 100 MeV - 100 GeV.</description>

Abstract: We simulate the real-time evolution of the $SU(3)$-glasma generated in the early stages of high-energy proton-nucleus collisions, employing classical lattice gauge theory techniques. Our setup incorporates a realistic modeling of the proton's internal structure and includes longitudinal fluctuations in the initial state, enabling the study of genuinely non-boost-invariant collision dynamics. Focusing on the momentum and angular momentum anisotropies of heavy quarks in the infinite mass limit, we find that the system retains significant anisotropy well beyond the characteristic timescale $\tau = 1/Q_s$. This persistence of anisotropy is further confirmed in the more realistic, non-boost-invariant scenario, across a range of fluctuation amplitudes. These findings pave the way for future investigations involving dynamical heavy quarks and more quantitative initializations of the glasma.</description>

Abstract: A deep understanding of neutrino-nucleus interaction is crucial for the precise measurement of neutrino oscillation parameters and cross section measurements. Various nuclear effects, such as initial state effects (IS) and Final state interactions (FSI), make neutrino interactions more complicated. To probe the impacts of the nuclear effects, a separate study of FSI and IS is required. A set of variables known as Centre-of-momentum (c.m.) variables ($\theta_{c.m.}$ and $E_{c.m.}$) provides a unique approach to isolate the FSI effect with minimal sensitivity to IS. This work presents the importance of c.m. variables in neutrino-induced eta ($\eta$) meson production in the DUNE near detector. $\theta_{c.m.}$ is an important parameter to improve the FSI modeling, while $E_{c.m.}$ helps in isolating high-purity neutrino-Hydrogen events. The study of $\eta$ production in neutrino interactions helps in understanding the theoretical descriptions of higher resonance states.</description>

Abstract: We present state-of-the-art hadron-level predictions for the deep-inelastic scat- tering process at next-to-leading-order precision for several multiplicities, con- sistently merged in one sample. For the first time at this level of accuracy, we consider both neutral and charged current deep-inelastic scattering at the Electron-Ion Collider, and present the first application of consistent next-to- leading-order merging to charged current deep-inelastic scattering in general. We critically examine inclusive predictions using multileg merging techniques, contrasting perturbative and nonperturbative uncertainties. Further, we study typical kinematic deep-inelastic scattering observables as well as jet measure- ments and 1-jettiness with realistic cuts implied by expected and past detector resolution. On the perturbative side, we see large corrections toward small vir- tualities and Bjorken-x, which can be captured by higher-multiplicity matrix elements and the merging procedure. Nonperturbative effects, while negligible in most jet observables, can reach similar size as the perturbative uncertainties around the peak of the 1-jettiness distributions especially at low values of $Q^2$ .</description>

      <title>Theory Uncertainties in the Extraction of $\alpha_s$ from Drell-Yan at Small Transverse Momentum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a detailed pseudodata study to estimate the expected theory uncertainty in the extraction of the strong coupling constant, $\alpha_s(m_Z)$, from a fit to the measured Drell-Yan transverse momentum ($q_T$) spectrum at small $q_T \ll m_Z$. We consider two approaches to estimate the dominant perturbative uncertainties. We first discuss that the traditional approach based on varying unphysical scales is insufficient here because it cannot correctly account for bin-by-bin theory correlations in the $q_T$ spectrum, which are critically important in this case. We then use this case as a nontrivial application of a new approach based on theory nuisance parameters (TNPs), which encodes the correct theory correlations by construction. Moreover, the TNPs can be profiled in the fit thereby allowing the data to constrain the theory uncertainties in a consistent manner. We furthermore discuss the interplay with nonperturbative effects in the peak region $q_T \lesssim 10$ GeV, from where most of the $\alpha_s$ sensitivity originates. The associated nonperturbative uncertainties on $\alpha_s$ when fitting only the $q_T$ spectrum are large. They can in principle be reduced by including additional constraints on the nonperturbative Collins-Soper kernel from lattice QCD calculations. We find that these improvements in the treatment of perturbative and nonperturbative uncertainties and their correlations will enable a competitive $\alpha_s$ extraction from Drell-Yan data at small $q_T$. We also discuss the implications of our findings, calling into question a recent $\alpha_s$ extraction from the $Z$ $q_T$ spectrum by the ATLAS experiment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rates for particle interaction processes and decays will be modified in a Lorentz-violating quantum field theory, because of changes to the particle kinematics$-$particularly through the modified dispersion relations affecting the outgoing particle phase space. We outline here these changes to the rates for three-particle decays. Considering a process with a constant scattering amplitude (not directly modified by the Lorentz violation), we calculate leading order corrections to the kinematics for a decay into three identical spinless particles whose propagation is affected by a $c_{\mu\nu}$-type symmetric tensor background. We examine the angular distribution of the daughter particles and describe the shape of the corresponding Dalitz plot outlining the kinematically allowed region, according to two toy models for the $c_{\mu\nu}$ textures. Precision measurements of the boundaries of this region could be used to constrain Lorentz violation coefficients for the particles involved in processes such as $\eta\rightarrow 3\pi^{0}$.</description>

Abstract: We formulate confinement in QCD as an entropic surface phenomenon: quark and gluon quantum information localizes on a transverse entangling two-sphere of radius $R_{EE}$, where the QCD vacuum -- partitioned by a hadron into interior and exterior regions -- reaches maximal entanglement. Lattice-QCD determinations of the scalar (trace) gravitational form factors fix both $R_{EE}$ and the transverse trace-anomaly density $\rho_h(R_{EE})$, yielding a parameter-free slope $c_h = 8\pi^2 R_{EE}^2 \rho_h(R_{EE})$ and a mechanical entropy $S_{EE}(y) = c_h\,y$ that grows linearly with rapidity $y$. The entropy gradient $\partial_{R}S_{EE}$ changes sign at $R_{EE}$, pushing colored fields outward for $r &lt; R_{EE}$ and pulling them inward for $r &gt; R_{EE}$, thereby localizing them on the codimension-2 two-sphere $\Sigma_\perp = S^{2}_{R_{EE}}$ (which projects onto the transverse plane in the infinite-momentum frame). This furnishes a high-energy (large-$y$) diagnostic that complements -- rather than replaces -- the Wilson-loop area-law criterion in the infrared. Imposing unitarity on an entropic eikonal ansatz gives $\sigma(s) \propto y^{\delta}$: world data favor $\delta = 2$ for elastic $pp$ and heavy-quark photoproduction, while $\phi$ photoproduction prefers $\delta = 0.387$. All extracted cross sections remain well below the Froissart-Martin bound. Altogether, the framework quantifies a confinement criterion directly from nonperturbative QCD inputs, linking the trace anomaly, entanglement entropy, and high-energy scattering within a single quantitative picture.</description>

Abstract: Axions that couple to electromagnetism are produced in the early Universe by, among other channels, freeze-in via the Primakoff process. For sufficiently large axion masses, the same coupling causes the axions to decay into two photons, which subsequently ionize the intergalactic medium. If this decay occurs in the redshift range $20 \lesssim z \lesssim 1100$, then the contribution to the cosmic microwave background optical depth $\tau_{\rm reio}$ can lead to a conflict with observations, excluding models with sufficiently strongly coupled, heavy axions and high reheating temperatures, $T_{\rm reh}$. Using large ensembles of explicit type IIB string theory models with up to $h^{1,1} = 100$ axions, we compute the full cosmic reionization history caused by the decays of multiple axions. We compare this to the posterior on the high-$z$ component of $\tau_{\rm reio}$ derived from model-independent constraints on the ionization state of the Universe, obtained in a full \textit{Planck} analysis presented in a companion paper. For $h^{1,1} = 20, 50, 100$, we find that approximately 15\%, 15\%, and 10\% of the models in the ensemble prefer $T_{\rm reh} \lesssim 10^{10}\,\text{GeV}$ at 95\% CL. We provide a publicly available code at:~\href{https://github.com/ZiwenYin/Reionization-with-multi-axions-decay}{github.com/ZiwenYin/Reionization-with-multi-axions-decay}, which computes the reionization history for arbitrary ensembles of decaying axions. Our analysis opens the door for future large-scale work studying the preference for low-temperature reheating in models with multiple axions.</description>

      <title>Is the $3S$-$2D$ mixing strong for the charmonia $\psi(4040)$ and $\psi(4160)$?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18536v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we revisit the $3S$-$2D$ mixing scheme for the charmonia $\psi(4040)$ and $\psi(4160)$. We introduce a coupled-channel mechanism-distinct from the tensor-force contribution in potential models, which alone is insufficient to induce significant mixing-to describe the mixing between these states. Our analysis yields mixing angles of $\theta_1=7^\circ$ and $\theta_2=10^\circ$, inconsistent with the larger angle inferred from experimental data, such as the dilectronic widths of the $\psi(4040)$ and $\psi(4160)$. We discuss possible origins of this discrepancy and emphasize the need for future experiments to resolve it. Precise measurements of the resonance parameters and dilectronic decay widths, via both inclusive and exclusive processes, will be crucial in clarifying this issue.</description>

      <title>$\text{Dark}_{CP}$ Mesogenesis and New Implications for Collider Searches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce $\text{Dark}_{CP}$ Mesogenesis in which Standard Model mesons, either $B_{s,d}^0$, $B^\pm$ or $B_c^\pm$, undergo out-of-equilibrium dark CP violating decays to Standard Model and dark sector baryons. With order one CP violation in the dark sector, the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe can then be generated with branching fractions as small as $2.7 \times 10^{-8}$ for the exotic decay of $B$-mesons into baryons and missing energy. This sets a lower limit on the branching fraction below which Mesogenesis becomes disfavored. This work therefore strongly encourages collider searches to target sensitivities one to three orders of magnitude below planned limits. For completeness, we further introduce a variant on $\text{Dark}_{CP}$ Mesogenesis involving dark lepton states. We conclude by laying out a roadmap for the complete exclusion (or discovery) of the Mesogenesis framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conceivable explanations of Belle-II measurements of a (surprising) excess of missing-energy decays of the $B$ meson to the $K$ meson not covered by standard-model neutrino-antineutrino pairs might be offered by additional contributions of dark-matter fermion-antifermion pairs. Assuming the excessive missing-energy events to be mediated by a (generic) scalar or vector boson, a simultaneous inspection of both of the missing-energy $B$ decays into a pseudoscalar $K$ meson or a vector $K^*$ meson allows to gain information on the nature of bosons relating standard-model and dark-matter sectors, irrespective of any (unknown) dark-sector details. Upon availability of indispensable experimental data, most prominent among such insights might be the identification of the mediator spin from the differential $B$-meson decay widths.</description>

      <title>Direct Collapse Black Hole Candidates from Decaying Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Injecting 1-13.6 eV photons into the early universe can suppress the molecular hydrogen abundance and alter the star formation history dramatically enough to produce direct collapse black holes. These, in turn, could explain the recently observed population of puzzling high-redshift supermassive black holes that appear to require super-Eddington accretion. We show that axion dark matter decay in the intergalactic medium can account for this energy injection. We use a single zone model of the gas core and semi-analytically evolve its chemo-thermal properties to track the conditions for which the system becomes an atomic cooling halo-a necessary precursor for the production of heavy black hole seeds to explain the high-redshift black hole population. Windows of axions masses between 24.5-26.5 eV with photon couplings as low as $4\times 10^{-12}$/GeV may realize this atomic cooling halo condition. We highlight the significance of the band structure of molecular hydrogen on the effectiveness of this process and discuss estimates of the heavy seed population and prospects for testing this model.</description>

Abstract: Changes in magnetic helicity are often discussed across a variety of fields, from condensed matter physics to early universe cosmology. It is frequently stated that the helicity change is given by the integral of the gauge field strength tensor and its dual over spacetime, $\int F \wedge F$. However, this is incorrect when magnetic monopoles once exist in the spacetime. In this paper, we show the correct formula of the helicity change in such a case for the Maxwell theory with the magnetic monopoles. We also discuss what happens when we embed the Maxwell theory with magnetic monopoles into non-Abelian gauge theories. We show that a similar formula holds for the 't Hooft--Polyakov monopole. In particular, we find the winding numbers and the zeroes of the Higgs field in the non-Abelian gauge theory play a crucial role in the helicity change. The same discussion is also applicable to the electroweak theory, and we discuss the implication of our findings to the baryon number change via the chiral anomaly in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Broader view of bimetric MOND</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.10882v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: All existing treatments of bimetric MOND (BIMOND) -- a class of relativistic versions of MOND -- have dealt with a rather restricted sub-class: The Lagrangian of the interaction between the gravitational degrees of freedom -- the two metrics -- is a function of a certain {\it single} scalar argument built from the difference in connections of the two metrics. I show that the scope of BIMOND is much richer: The two metrics can couple through several scalars to give theories that all have a "good" nonrelativistic (NR) limit -- one that accounts correctly, a-la MOND, for the dynamics of galactic systems, {\it including gravitational lensing}. This extended-BIMOND framework exhibits a qualitative departure from the way we think of MOND at present, as encapsulated, in all its aspects, by one "interpolating function" of one acceleration variable. After deriving the general field equations, I pinpoint the subclass of theories that satisfy the pivotal requirement of a good NR limit. These involve three independent, quadratic scalar variables. In the NR limit these scalars all reduce to the same acceleration scalar, and the NR theory then does hinge on one function of a {\it a single} acceleration variable -- representing the NR MOND "interpolating function", whose form is largely dictated by the observed NR galactic dynamics. However, these scalars behave differently, in different relativistic contexts. So, the full richness of the multi-variable Lagrangian, as it enters cosmology, for example, is hardly informed by what we learn from observations of galactic dynamics. In this paper, I present the formalism, with some generic examples. I also consider some cosmological solutions where the two metrics are small departures from one Friedman-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker metric. This may offer a framework for describing cosmology within the extended BIMOND.</description>

      <title>Unitarity, Causality, and Solar System Bounds May Significantly Limit the Use of Gravitational Waves to Test General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12118v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The prospect of detecting/constraining deviations from general relativity by studying gravitational waves (GWs) from merging black holes has been one of the primary motivations of GW interferometers like LIGO/Virgo. Within pure gravity, the only possible way deviations can arise is from the existence of higher order derivative corrections, namely higher powers of the Riemann curvature tensor, in the effective action. Any observational bounds imply constraints on the corresponding Wilson coefficients. At the level of the action, one can imagine the coefficients are sufficiently large so as to be in principle detectable. However, from the point of view of some fundamental principles, namely causality and unitarity, this is much less clear, as we examine here. We begin by reviewing certain known bounds on these coefficients, which together imply a low cut off on the effective theory. We then consider a possible mechanism to generate such terms, namely in the form of many scalars, minimally coupled to only gravity, that can be integrated out to give these higher order operators. We show that a by product of this is the generation of quantum corrections to Newton's potential, whose observable consequences are already ruled out by solar system tests. We point out that over 7 orders of magnitude of improvement in interferometer sensitivity would be required to avoid such solar system constraints. We also mention further constraints from Hawking radiation from black holes.</description>

      <title>Azimuthal Anisotropy Scaling for Identified Mesons and Baryons: Insights into Medium Transport Properties, Equation of State and Hadronic Re-scattering</title>

Abstract: Scaling functions for the centrality and transverse momentum dependence of \(v_2(p_T,\text{cent})\) and \(v_3(p_T,\text{cent})\) are constructed for identified mesons and baryons in Pb+Pb (\(\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76,\ 5.02\)~TeV), Xe+Xe (5.44~TeV), and Au+Au (0.2~TeV) collisions. These species-resolved functions capture the interplay of initial geometry, viscous attenuation, radial flow, partonic energy loss, and hadronic re-scattering across both flow- and quenching-dominated regimes. The systematic growth of the radial-flow parameter \(\zeta_{\rm rf}\) with multiplicity and beam energy provides direct empirical constraints on the equation of state (EOS) of hot QCD matter. The extracted parameters also yield differential constraints on the specific shear viscosity \(\eta/s\), the jet-quenching parameter \(\hat{q}\), and late-stage hadronic dynamics. LHC systems exhibit low \(\eta/s\), strong radial flow, and negligible re-scattering at high energy density, whereas Au+Au at RHIC energy shows even lower \(\eta/s\), weaker radial flow, finite re-scattering, and reduced energy density. The coexistence of strong radial flow at low \(p_T\) and significant jet suppression at high \(p_T\) emerges as a defining hallmark of QGP formation, establishing the framework as a quantitative probe of QGP transport properties and EOS stiffness.</description>

Abstract: In confined hadronic matter, the spontaneous breaking and restoration of chiral symmetry can be described by considering nucleons, $N_{+}(939)$, and excited states of opposite parity, $N_{-}(1535)$. In a cold, dense hadronic phase where chiral symmetry remains spontaneously broken, direct Urca decay processes involving the $N_{-}$ are possible, e.g. $N_- \rightarrow N_+ + e^- + \bar{\nu}_e$. We show that at low temperature and moderate densities, because the $N_-$ is much heavier than the $N_+$, such cooling dominates over standard $N_+$ direct Urca processes. This provides a strong astrophysical signature of the pattern of chiral symmetry restoration in neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Imaging nuclear shape through anisotropic and radial flow in high-energy heavy-ion collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most atomic nuclei exhibit ellipsoidal shapes characterized by quadrupole deformation $\beta_2$ and triaxiality $\gamma$, and sometimes even a pear-like octupole deformation $\beta_3$. The STAR experiment introduced a new "imaging-by-smashing" technique [arXiv:2401.06625, arXiv:2501.16071] to image the nuclear global shape by colliding nuclei at ultra-relativistic speeds and analyzing outgoing debris. Features of nuclear shape manifest in collective observables like anisotropic flow $v_n$ and radial flow via mean transverse momentum $[p_{\mathrm{T}}]$. We present new measurements of the variances of $v_n$ ($n=2$, 3, and 4) and $[p_{\mathrm{T}}]$, and the covariance of $v_n^2$ with $[p_{\mathrm{T}}]$, in collisions of highly deformed $^{238}$U and nearly spherical $^{197}$Au. Ratios of these observables between the two systems effectively suppress common final-state effects, isolating the strong impact of uranium's deformation. By comparing results with state-of-the-art hydrodynamic model calculations, we extract $\beta_{2\mathrm{U}}$ and $\gamma_{\mathrm{U}}$ values consistent with those deduced from low-energy nuclear structure measurements. Measurements of $v_3$ and its correlation with $[p_{\mathrm{T}}]$ also provide the first experimental suggestion of a possible octupole deformation for $^{238}$U. These findings provide significant support for using high-energy collisions to explore nuclear shapes on femtosecond timescales, with implications for both nuclear structure and quark-gluon plasma studies.</description>

      <title>Constraining exotic high-$z$ reionization histories with Gaussian processes and the Cosmic Microwave Background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The large-angle polarization anisotropies in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) arise from Thomson scattering of CMB photons off free electrons in the post-recombination Universe. In the standard $\Lambda$ cold dark matter cosmological model, the free electron density increases at redshifts $z \lesssim 10$ as the first stars form, reionizing the intergalactic medium. We use \emph{Gaussian processes} to perform a model-independent reconstruction of the cosmic reionization history constrained by \textit{Planck} CMB data. Our approach recovers the standard reionization at $z \lesssim 10$ and places stringent limits on any additional high-$z$ reionization. From this reconstruction, we define a new derived parameter, the high-redshift contribution to the CMB optical depth, $\tau_{\mathrm{highz}}$, whose posterior distribution provides robust constraints on exotic energy injection scenarios. We demonstrate this for decaying dark matter with particle masses in the range $\mathcal{O}(1\,\text{MeV})$. A companion paper applies this framework to multi-axion models.

Abstract: Magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) exhibits remarkable electronic properties under external magnetic fields, notably the emergence of flat Landau levels. In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of MATBG's operational phase diagram under three distinct quantum thermodynamic cycles, i.e., Quantum Otto Cycle (QOC), Quantum Carnot Cycle (QCC), and Quantum Stirling Cycle (QSC). Employing the continuum eight-band model, we evaluate the thermodynamic performance of MATBG across multiple operational modes: heat engine, refrigerator, cold pump, and Joule pump, and benchmark it against other graphene systems such as monolayer graphene, AB-Bernal stacked bilayer graphene, and non-magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene. Our findings reveal that MATBG demonstrates superior heat engine performance in QSC, while achieving high efficiency albeit with reduced work output in QOC. Even though the performance of MATBG as a cold pump or refrigerator is modest in QOC and QSC, it shows notable improvement as a refrigerator in QCC. Additionally, we identify a highly reversible Joule pump mode in both QSC and QOC under strict adiabaticity, underscoring the unique thermodynamic behavior of MATBG.</description>

      <title>Mass-deformed Super Yang-Mills theory on $\mathbb T^4$: sum over twisted sectors, $\mathbf{\theta}$-angle, and CP violation</title>

Abstract: We study $SU(N)$ super Yang-Mills theory with a small gaugino mass $m$ and vacuum angle $\theta$ on the four-torus $\mathbb{T}^4$ with 't Hooft twisted boundary conditions. Introducing a detuning parameter $\Delta$, which measures the deviation from an exactly self-dual $\mathbb{T}^4$, and working in the limits $mLN \ll \Lambda LN \ll 1$ and $ \frac{(N-1) m^2 L^2}{4 \pi} \ll \Delta \ll 1$, where $L$ is the torus size and $\Lambda$ the strong-coupling scale, we compute the scalar and pseudo-scalar condensates to leading order in $m^2L^2/\Delta$. The twists generate fractional-charge instantons, and we show that summing over all such contributions is crucial for reproducing the correct physical observables in the decompactified strong-coupling regime. From a Hamiltonian perspective, the sum over twisted sectors, already at small torus size, projects in the $m=0$ limit onto a definite superselection sector of the $\mathbb{R}^4$ theory. In the massless limit, we recover the exact value of the gaugino condensate $|\langle \lambda \lambda \rangle| = 16\pi^2 \Lambda^3$, and demonstrate how a spurious $U(1)$ symmetry eliminates all $CP$-violating effects. Our results are directly testable in lattice simulations, and our method extends naturally to non-supersymmetric gauge theories.</description>

      <title>On Pre-Inflationary non Gaussianities</title>

Abstract: We explore the three-point amplitude of curvature perturbations in scenarios suggested by high-scale supersymmetry breaking in String Theory, where the inflaton is forced to climb a steep exponential potential. We can do it at the price of some simplifications, and more importantly with some assumptions on the softening effects of String Theory. These suggest a scenario proposed long ago by Gasperini and Veneziano, where the initial singularity is replaced by a bounce, and the resulting analysis rests on a scale $\Delta$ that leaves some signs in the angular power spectrum of the CMB. The amplitude comprises two types of contribution: the first oscillates around the original result of Maldacena and gives no further prospects to detect a non-Gaussian signal, but the second, which is subtly tied to the turning point at the end of the climbing phase, within the window 62&lt;N&lt;66 for the inflationary e-folds could be compatible with Planck constraints and potentially observable. The amplitudes involving the tensor modes contain only the first type of contribution.</description>
