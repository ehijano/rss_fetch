      <title>Macroscopic Tunneling Probe of Moir\'e Spin Textures in Twisted CrI$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various noncollinear spin textures and magnetic phases have been predicted in twisted two-dimensional CrI$_3$ due to competing ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) interlayer exchange from moir\'e stacking - with potential spintronic applications even when the underlying material possesses a negligible Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya or dipole-dipole interaction. Recent measurements have shown evidence of coexisting FM and AFM layer order in small-twist-angle CrI$_3$ bilayers and double bilayers. Yet, the nature of the magnetic textures remains unresolved and possibilities for their manipulation and electrical readout are unexplored. Here, we use tunneling magnetoresistance to investigate the collective spin states of twisted double-bilayer CrI$_3$ under both out-of-plane and in-plane magnetic fields together with detailed micromagnetic simulations of domain dynamics based on magnetic circular dichroism. Our results capture hysteretic and anisotropic field evolutions of the magnetic states and we further uncover two distinct non-volatile spin textures (out-of-plane and in-plane domains) at $\approx$ 1{\deg} twist angle, with a different global tunneling resistance that can be switched by magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Field-sensitive dislocation bound states in two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnet is grown on a substrate, the interplay of momentum-dependent spin splittings arising from altermagnetism and Rashba spin-orbit coupling gives rise to a nodal band structure with band degeneracies enforced by a $C_{4z}\mathcal{T}$ symmetry. If we break the $C_{4z}\mathcal{T}$ symmetry by an exchange field, the band degeneracies are found to be immediately lifted, leading to a topological band structure characterized by nontrivial strong and weak topological indices. Remarkably, both the strong topological index and the $Z_{2}$-valued weak topological indices depend sensitively on the direction of the exchange field. As a consequence of the bulk-defect correspondence, we find that the unique dependence of weak topological indices on the exchange field in this system dictates that the presence or absence of topological bound states at lattice dislocations also depends sensitively on the direction of the exchange field. When the substrate is an $s$-wave superconductor, we find that a similar dependence of band topology on the exchange field gives rise to field-sensitive dislocation Majorana zero modes. As topological dislocation bound states are easily detectable by scanning tunneling microscopy, our findings unveil a promising experimental diagnosis of altermagnetic materials among an ever growing list of candidates.</description>

      <title>Quantitative determination of twist angle and strain in Van der Waals moir\'e superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scanning probe techniques are popular, non-destructive ways to visualize the real space structure of Van der Waals moir\'es. The high lateral spatial resolution provided by these techniques enables extracting the moir\'e lattice vectors from a scanning probe image. We have found that the extracted values, while precise, are not necessarily accurate. Scan-to-scan variations in the behavior of the piezos which drive the scanning probe, and thermally-driven slow relative drift between probe and sample, produce systematic errors in the extraction of lattice vectors. In this Letter, we identify the errors and provide a protocol to correct for them. Applying this protocol to an ensemble of ten successive scans of near-magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene, we are able to reduce our errors in extracting lattice vectors to less than 1%. This translates to extracting twist angles with a statistical uncertainty less than 0.001{\deg} and uniaxial heterostrain with uncertainty on the order of 0.002%.</description>

      <title>FIP-GNN: Graph neural networks for scalable prediction of grain-level fatigue indicator parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-cycle fatigue is a critical performance metric of structural alloys for many applications. The high cost, time, and labor involved in experimental fatigue testing call for efficient and accurate computer models of fatigue life. We present graph neural networks for polycrystals that, for the first time, can (i) predict fatigue indicator parameters -- grain-level responses to cyclic loading well beyond monotonic elastic and inelastic regimes reported in literature; and (ii) generalize these predictions to large microstructure volume elements with grain populations well beyond those used in training. These advances can make significant contributions to statistically rigorous and computationally efficient modeling of high-cycle fatigue -- a long-standing challenge in the field.</description>

      <title>Thermoresponsive PNIPAM/FeRh smart composite activated by magnetic field for doxorubicin release</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to control by physical properties of the thermoresponsive polymer of PNIPAM by magnetocaloric effect was demonstrated by in-situ experiments on PNIPAM/FeRh smart composite. The concept of drug release loaded in smart composite by applying of 3 T magnetic field was demonstrated using an example of doxorubicin. Released results of the magnetic field applying the drug were detected using IV-VIS and Raman spectroscopy. In vitro, studies have demonstrated a high degree of PNIPAM/FeRh scaffold biocompatibility for primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (PMEF) cell culture. PMEFs effectively ad-hered to the PNIPAM/FeRh scaffold surface and showed high metabolic and proliferative activity for 72 h after seeding.</description>

      <title>Observation of Extraordinary Vibration Scatterings Induced by Strong Anharmonicity in Lead-Free Halide Double Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lead-free halide double perovskites provide a promising solution for the long-standing issues of lead-containing halide perovskites, i.e., the toxicity of Pb and the low stability under ambient conditions and high-intensity illumination. Their light-to-electricity or thermal-to-electricity conversion is strongly determined by the dynamics of the corresponding lattice vibrations. Here, we present the measurement of lattice dynamics in a prototypical lead-free halide double perovskite, i.e., Cs2NaInCl6. Our quantitative measurements and first-principles calculations show that the scatterings among lattice vibrations at room temperature are at the timescale of ~ 1 ps, which stems from the extraordinarily strong anharmonicity in Cs2NaInCl6. We further quantitatively characterize the degree of anharmonicity of all the ions in the single Cs2NaInCl6 crystal, and demonstrate that this strong anharmonicity is synergistically contributed by the bond hierarchy, the tilting of the NaCl6 and InCl6 octahedral units, and the rattling of Cs+ ions. Consequently, the crystalline Cs2NaInCl6 possesses an ultralow thermal conductivity of ~0.43 W/mK at room temperature, and a weak temperature dependence of T-0.41. Our findings here uncovered the underlying mechanisms behind the dynamics of lattice vibrations in double perovskites, which could largely benefit the design of optoelectronics and thermoelectrics based on halide double perovskites.</description>

      <title>Incorporating static intersite correlation effects in vanadium dioxide through DFT$+V$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the effects on the structural and electronic properties of vanadium dioxide (VO$_2$) of adding an empirical inter-atomic potential within the density-functional theory$+V$ (DFT$+V$) framework. We use the DFT$+V$ machinery founded on the extended Hubbard model to apply an empirical self-energy correction between nearest-neighbor vanadium atoms in both rutile and monoclinic phases, and for a set of structures interpolating between these two cases. We observe that imposing an explicit intersite interaction $V$ along the vanadium-vanadium chains enhances the characteristic bonding-antibonding splitting of the relevant bands in the monoclinic phase, thus favoring electronic dimerization and the formation of a band gap. We then explore the effect of $V$ on the structural properties and the relative energies of the two phases, finding an insulating global energy minimum for the monoclinic phase, consistent with experimental observations. With increasing $V$, this minimum becomes deeper relative to the rutile structure, and the transition from the metallic to the insulating state becomes sharper. We also analyze the effect of applying the $+V$ correction either to all or only to selected vanadium-vanadium pairs, and both in the monoclinic as well as in the metallic rutile phase. Our results suggest that DFT$+V$ can indeed serve as a computationally inexpensive unbiased way of modeling VO$_2$ which is well suited for studies that, e.g., require large system sizes.</description>

      <title>Effective removal of global tilt from topography images of vicinal surfaces with narrow terraces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main feature of vicinal surfaces of crystals characterized by the Miller indices $(h\,h\,m)$, is rather small width (less than 10 nm) and substantially large length (more than 200 nm) of atomically-flat terraces on sample surface. This makes difficult to apply standard methods of image processing and correct visualization of crystalline lattice at the terraces and multiatomic steps. Here we consider two procedures allowing us to minimize effects of both small-scale noise and global tilt of sample: (i) analysis of the difference of two Gaussian blurred images, and (ii) subtraction of the plane, whose parameters are determined by optimization of the histogram of the visible heights, from raw topography image. It is shown that both methods provide non-distorted images demonstrating atomic structures on vicinal ${\rm Si}(5\,5\,6)$ and ${\rm Si}(5\,5\,7)$ surfaces.</description>

      <title>Electric-field-modulated topological phase transition in AlSb/InSe heterobilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Searching for controllable topological phase by means of external stimuli in two-dimensional (2D) material-based van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures is currently an active field for both the underlying physics and practical applications. Here, using first-principles calculations, we investigate electric-field-modulated topological phase transition in a vdW heterobilayer formed by vertically stacking 2D AlSb and InSe monolayers. The AlSb/InSe heterobilayer studied possesses both dynamical and thermal stabilities, which is a direct bandgap semiconductor and forms a Z-scheme heterojunction. With inclusion of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and applying external electric field, the bandgap decreases at first and then increase, and a trivial insulator to topological insulator phase transition is observed. For the topological insulator phase, band inversion is ascribed to the strong SOC of p orbitals of Sb. Our work paves the way for the design and application of multifunctional nanoscale devices such as topological field effect transistor.</description>

      <title>Finite-temperature properties of antiferroelectric perovskite $\rm PbZrO_3$ from deep learning interatomic potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prototypical antiferroelectric perovskite $\rm PbZrO_3$ (PZO) has garnered considerable attentions in recent years due to its significance in technological applications and fundamental research. Many unresolved issues in PZO are associated with large spatial and time scales, as well as finite temperatures, presenting significant challenges for first-principles density functional theory studies. Here, we introduce a deep learning interatomic potential of PZO, enabling investigation of finite-temperature properties through large-scale atomistic simulations. Trained using an elaborately designed dataset, the model successfully reproduces a large number of phases, in particular, the recently discovered 80-atom antiferroelectric $Pnam$ phase and ferrielectric $Ima2$ phase, providing precise predictions for their structural and dynamical properties. Using this model, we investigated phase transitions of multiple phases, including $Pbam$/$Pnam$, $Ima2$ and $R3c$, which show high similarity to the experimental observation. Our simulation results also highlight the crucial role of free-energy in determining the low-temperature phase of PZO, reconciling the apparent contradiction: $Pbam$ is the most commonly observed phase in experiments, while theoretical calculations predict other phases exhibiting even lower energy. Furthermore, in the temperature range where the $Pbam$ phase is thermodynamically stable, typical double polarization hysteresis loops for antiferroelectrics were obtained, along with a detailed elucidation of the dynamical evolution upon electric-field induced transitions between the non-polar $Pbam$ and polar $R3c$ phases.</description>

      <title>Si1-x-yGeySnx alloy formation by Sn ion implantation and flash lamp annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For many years, Si1-yGey alloys have been applied in the semiconductor industry due to the ability to adjust the performance of Si-based nanoelectronic devices. Following this alloying approach of group-IV semiconductors, adding tin (Sn) into the alloy appears as the obvious next step, which leads to additional possibilities for tailoring the material properties. Adding Sn enables effective band gap and strain engineering and can improve the carrier mobilities, which makes Si1-x-yGeySnx alloys promising candidates for future opto- and nanoelectronics applications. The bottom-up approach for epitaxial growth of Si1-x-yGeySnx, e.g., by chemical vapor deposition and molecular beam epitaxy, allows tuning the material properties in the growth direction only; the realization of local material modifications to generate lateral heterostructures with such a bottom-up approach is extremely elaborate, since it would require the use of lithography, etching, and either selective epitaxy or epitaxy and chemical-mechanical polishing giving rise to interface issues, non-planar substrates, etc. This article shows the possibility of fabricating Si1-x-yGeySnx alloys by Sn ion beam implantation into Si1-yGey layers followed by millisecond-range flash lamp annealing (FLA). The materials are investigated by Rutherford backscattering spectrometry, micro Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and transmission electron microscopy. The fabrication approach was adapted to ultra-thin Si1-yGey layers on silicon-on-insulator substrates. The results show the fabrication of single-crystalline Si1-x-yGeySnx with up to 2.3 at.% incorporated Sn without any indication of Sn segregation after recrystallization via FLA. Finally, we exhibit the possibility of implanting Sn locally in ultra-thin Si1-yGey films by masking unstructured regions on the chip.</description>

      <title>Controlling the Magnetic Properties of the van der Waals Multiferroic Crystals Co$_{1-x}$Ni$_{x}$I$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structurally related compounds NiI$_2$ and CoI$_2$ are multiferroic van der Waals materials, in which helimagnetic orders exist simultaneously with electric polarization. Here, we report on the evolution of the crystal structure and of the magnetic properties across the solid solution Co$_{1-x}$Ni$_{x}$I$_2$. We have successfully grown crystals of the whole range of the solid solution, i.e. $x = 0-1$, by employing the self-selecting vapor growth (SSVG) technique and by carefully tuning the synthesis conditions according to the chemical composition. Our structural investigations show that the crystal symmetry changes from $P\bar{3}m1$ to $R\bar{3}m$ when Ni substitutes for Co beyond $x = 0.2$. Both the lattice parameters and magnetic properties evolve continuously and smoothly from one end member to the other, showing that they can be finely tuned by the chemical composition. We also observe that the Ni substitution degree in the solid solution affects the metamagnetic transition typical for CoI$_2$ at high magnetic fields. In particular, we find the existence of the metamagnetic transition similar to that for CoI$_2$ in the NiI$_2$ structure. Based on magnetic measurements we construct the phase diagram of the Co$_{1-x}$Ni$_{x}$I$_2$ system. Controlling the magnetic properties by the chemical composition may open new pathways for the fabrication of electronic devices made of two-dimensional (2D) flakes of multiferroic van der Waals materials.</description>

      <title>Structural changes in Ge1-xSnx and Si1-x-yGeySnx thin films on SOI substrates treated by pulse laser annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ge1-xSnx and Si1-x-yGeySnx alloys are promising materials for future opto- and nanoelectronics applications. These alloys enable effective band-gap engineering, broad adjustability of their lattice parameter, exhibit much higher carrier mobility than pure Si, and are compatible with the CMOS technology. Unfortunately, the equilibrium solid solubility of Sn in Si1-xGex is less than 1% and the pseudomorphic growth of Si1-x-yGeySnx on Ge or Si can cause in-plane compressive strain in the grown layer, degrading the superior properties of these alloys. Therefore, post-growth strain engineering by ultrafast non-equilibrium thermal treatments like pulse laser annealing (PLA) is needed to improve the layer quality. In this article, Ge0.94Sn0.06 and Si0.14Ge0.8Sn0.06 thin films grown on silicon-on-insulator substrates by molecular beam epitaxy were post growth thermally treated by PLA. The material is analyzed before and after the thermal treatments by transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Rutherford backscattering spectrometry, secondary ion mass spectrometry, and Hall effect measurements. It is shown that after annealing, the material is single-crystalline with improved crystallinity than the as-grown layer. This is reflected in a significantly increased XRD reflection intensity, well-ordered atomic pillars, and increased active carrier concentrations up to 4x1019 cm-3.</description>

      <title>Generative Inverse Design of Crystal Structures via Diffusion Models with Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have enabled the generation of realistic data by training generative models on large datasets of text, images, and audio. While these models have demonstrated exceptional performance in generating novel and plausible data, it remains an open question whether they can effectively accelerate scientific discovery through the data generation and drive significant advancements across various scientific fields. In particular, the discovery of new inorganic materials with promising properties poses a critical challenge, both scientifically and for industrial applications. However, unlike textual or image data, materials, or more specifically crystal structures, consist of multiple types of variables - including lattice vectors, atom positions, and atomic species. This complexity in data give rise to a variety of approaches for representing and generating such data. Consequently, the design choices of generative models for crystal structures remain an open question. In this study, we explore a new type of diffusion model for the generative inverse design of crystal structures, with a backbone based on a Transformer architecture. We demonstrate our models are superior to previous methods in their versatility for generating crystal structures with desired properties. Furthermore, our empirical results suggest that the optimal conditioning methods vary depending on the dataset.</description>

      <title>Upper bounds on the highest phonon frequency and superconducting temperature from fundamental physical constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fundamental physical constants govern key effects in high-energy particle physics and astrophysics, including the stability of particles, nuclear reactions, formation and evolution of stars, synthesis of heavy nuclei and emergence of stable molecular structures. Here, we show that fundamental constants also set an upper bound for the frequency of phonons in condensed matter phases, or how rapidly an atom can vibrate. This bound is in agreement with \textit{ab initio} simulations of atomic hydrogen and high-temperature hydride superconductors, and implies an upper limit to the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ in condensed matter. Fundamental constants set this limit to the order of 10$^2-10^3$ K. This range is consistent with our calculations of $T_c$ from optimal Eliashberg functions. As a corollary, we observe that the very existence of high-temperature superconductivity research is due to the observed values of fundamental constants. We finally discuss how fundamental constants affect the observability of other condensed matter phenomena including phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Meandering conduction channels and the tunable nature of quantized charge transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of the quantum Hall effect founded the field of topological condensed matter physics. Its amazingly accurate quantisation of the Hall conductance, now enshrined in quantum metrology, is topologically protected: it is stable against any reasonable perturbation. Conversely, topological protection thus implies a form of censorship, as it completely hides any local information from the observer. The spatial distribution of the current in the sample is such a piece of information, which however has now become accessible thanks to spectacular experimental advances. It is an old question whether an original, and intuitively compelling, picture of the current flowing in a narrow channel along the sample edge is the physically correct one. Motivated by recent experiments $\textit{locally}$ imaging the quantized current flow in a Chern insulating (Bi, Sb)$_2$Te$_3$ heterostructure, [Rosen et al., PRL 129, 246602 (2022); Ferguson et.al, Nat. Mater. 22, 1100-1105 (2023)], we theoretically demonstrate the possibility of a broad `edge state' meandering away from the sample boundary deep into the sample bulk. Further, we show that varying experimental parameters permits continuously tuning between narrow edge states and meandering channels all the way to incompressible bulk transport. This accounts for various features observed in, and differing between, experiments. Overall, this underscores the robustness of topological condensed matter physics, but it also unveils a phenomenological richness hidden by topological censorship -- much of which we believe remains to be discovered.</description>

      <title>Investigating meV-scale Equilibrium Atomic Dynamics with X-Rays: focus on disordered materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper reviews non-resonant meV-resolved inelastic x-ray scattering (IXS) as a complementary method to inelastic neutron scattering (INS). Two aspects of IXS that are notable in this context are (1) that IXS allows straightforward measurements of phonons in small (sub-mm, and even $\sim 0.01$ mm) samples with $\sim 1$ meV resolution and excellent Q resolution and (2) that IXS avoids the kinematic constraints of INS. The first allows both new geometries (thin films, diamond anvil cells) and easy access to new materials, while the second allows high quality data on disordered materials, such as scans with sub-meV resolution to arbitrarily high energy transfer become possible , even at momentum transfers as small as 1/nm. The review briefly discusses the spectrometers and compares the practical forms for the dynamic structure factor for crystals, glasses and liquids. This is followed by a longer review of work on liquids and then shorter discussion of work on glasses, crystals, and discussion of specific geometries. This paper complements the longer introduction/review of IXS at arxiv:1504.01098 .</description>

      <title>Revealing hidden medium-range order in silicate glass-formers using many-body correlation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The medium range order (MRO) in amorphous systems has been linked to complex features such as the dynamic heterogeneity of supercooled liquids or the plastic deformation of glasses. However, the nature of the MRO in these materials has remained elusive, primarily due to the lack of methods capable of characterizing this order. Here, we leverage standard two-body structural correlators and advanced many-body correlation functions to probe numerically the MRO in prototypical network glassformers, i.e., silica and sodium silicates, systems that are of importance in natural as well as industrial settings. With increasing Na concentration, one finds that the local environment of Na becomes more structured and the spatial distribution of Na on intermediate length scales changes from blob-like to channel-like, indicating a growing inhomogeneity in the spatial Na arrangement. In parallel, we find that the Si-O network becomes increasingly depolymerized, resulting in a ring size distribution that broadens. The radius of gyration of the rings is well described by a power-law with an exponent around 0.75, indicating that the rings are progressively more crumbled with increasing size. Using a recently proposed four-point correlation function, we reveal that the relative orientation of the tetrahedra shows a transition at a distance around 4 Angstroms, a structural modification that is not seen in standard two-point correlation functions. Furthermore, we find that the length scale characterizing the MRO is non-monotonic as a function of temperature, caused by the competition between energetic and entropic terms. Finally, we demonstrate that the structural correlation lengths as obtained from the correlation functions that quantify the MRO are correlated with macroscopic observables such as the kinetic fragility of the liquids and the elastic properties of the glasses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The LnSbTe (Ln = Lanthanides) family, like isostructural ZrSiS type compounds, has emerged as a fertile playground for exploring the interaction of electronic correlations and magnetic ordering with the nodal line band topology. Here, we report a detailed electronic band structure investigation of TbSbTe, corroborated by electrical transport, thermodynamic, and magnetic studies. Temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility and thermodynamic transport studies indicate the onset of antiferromagnetic ordering below TN = 5.1 K. The electronic band structure study, carried out with high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements aided with density functional theory based first-principles calculations reveals presence of nodal lines in the GammaX high symmetry direction, forming a diamond-shaped nodal plane around Gamma high symmetry point. A strongly photon energy dependent nodal feature located at the X point of the surface Brillouin zone, indicating an extended nodal line along X R direction, is also observed. This study elucidates the intricate interplay among symmetry-protected band characteristics, the influence of spin orbit coupling, magnetism, and topological properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Today, interconnect resistance and reliability are key limiters for the performance of advanced CMOS circuits. As transistor scaling is slowing, interconnect scaling has become the main driver for circuit miniaturization, and interconnect limitations are expected to become even more stringent in future CMOS technology nodes. Current Cu dual-damascene metallization is also becoming increasingly challenging as critical interconnect dimensions approach 10 nm, alternative metallization schemes are researched with increasing intensity for about a decade. The selection of alternative metals is a highly multifaceted task and includes many criteria, covering the resistivity at reduced dimension, reliability and thermal aspects, as well as a sustainability perspective. In this tutorial, we introduce the basic criteria for alternative metal benchmarking and selection, and discuss the current state of the art of the field. The tutorial covers materials close to manufacturing introduction, materials under actual research, as well as future directions for fundamental research. While first alternatives to Cu metallization in commercial CMOS devices have become a reality recently, research for the ultimate interconnect metal is ongoing.</description>

      <title>Doubled Shapiro steps in a dynamic axion insulator Josephson junction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic axion insulators feature a time-dependent axion field that can be induced by antiferromagnetic resonance. Here, we show that a Josephson junction incorporating this dynamic axion insulator between two superconductors exhibits a striking doubled Shapiro steps wherein all odd steps are completely suppressed in the jointly presence of a DC bias and a static magnetic field. The resistively shunted junction simulation confirms that these doubled Shapiro steps originate from the distinctive axion electrodynamics driven by the antiferromagnetic resonance, which thus not only furnishes a hallmark to identify the dynamic axion insulator but also provides a method to evaluate its mass term. Furthermore, the experimentally feasible differential conductance is also determined. Our work holds significant importance in condensed matter physics and materials science for understanding the dynamic axion insulator, paving the way for its further exploration and applications.</description>

      <title>The Growth of Passive Membranes: Evidence from Ti and Like Metals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.12964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current contradictory understanding of passivation comes from overly-complex passive models, defective characterization and misplaced theoretical approaches. From brand-new experimentation, we find that a Ti passive membrane has spatiotemporally-ordered macrostructure. At the start, a thermodynamically-stable chemisorbed Ti-O monolayer is immediately formed to inactivate the outmost Ti atoms and shield direct reaction of environmental oxygens on metallic matrix, and then an underneath TiOx@Ti ceramet-like non-equilibrium gradient oxide layer rapidly forms. The two layers work synergistically to keep the macro-ordered passive membrane growing slowly via non-linear mechanism of incremental oxidation damping, thus effecting passivation. These findings disprove "the adsorption theory of passivation" and "the theory of passivity film" and inform a new theory we call "passivation theory of incremental oxidation damping".</description>

      <title>Modeling the ferroelectric phase transition in barium titanate with DFT accuracy and converged sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accurate description of the structural and thermodynamic properties of ferroelectrics has been one of the most remarkable achievements of Density Functional Theory (DFT). However, running large simulation cells with DFT is computationally demanding, while simulations of small cells are often plagued with non-physical effects that are a consequence of the system's finite size. To avoid these finite-size effects one is thus often forced to use empirical models that describe the physics of the material in terms of effective interaction terms, that are fitted using the results from DFT. In this study we use a machine-learning (ML) potential trained on DFT, in combination with accelerated sampling techniques, to converge the thermodynamic properties of Barium Titanate (BTO) with first-principles accuracy and a full atomistic description. Our results indicate that the predicted Curie temperature depends strongly on the choice of DFT functional and system size, because of emergent long-range directional correlations in the local dipole fluctuations. Our findings demonstrate how the combination of ML models and traditional bottom-up modeling allow one to investigate emergent phenomena with the accuracy of first-principles calculations over the large size and time scales afforded by empirical models.</description>

Abstract: Multiple software packages currently exist for the computation of bulk topological invariants in both idealized tight-binding models and realistic Wannier tight-binding models derived from density functional theory. Currently, only one package, PythTB(https://www.physics.rutgers.edu/pythtb/) is capable of computing nested Wilson loops and spin-resolved Wilson loops. These state-of-the-art techniques are vital for accurate analysis of band topology. In this paper we introduce BerryEasy, a python package which is built to work alongside the PyBinding(https://docs.pybinding.site/en/stable/index.html) software package. By working in tandem with the Pybinding package and harnessing the speed of graphical processing units, topological analysis of supercells in the presence of disorder and impurities is made possible. The BerryEasy package simultaneously accommodates use of realistic tight-binding models developed using Wannier90.</description>

Abstract: We present a general framework for modeling power magnetic materials characteristics using deep neural networks. Magnetic materials represented by multidimensional characteristics (that mimic measurements) are used to train the neural autoencoder model in an unsupervised manner. The encoder is trying to predict the material parameters of a theoretical model, which is then used in a decoder part. The decoder, using the predicted parameters, reconstructs the input characteristics. The neural model is trained to capture a synthetically generated set of characteristics that can cover a broad range of material behaviors, leading to a model that can generalize on the underlying physics rather than just optimize the model parameters for a single measurement. After setting up the model, we prove its usefulness in the complex problem of modeling magnetic materials in the frequency and current (out-of-linear range) domains simultaneously, for which we use measured characteristics obtained for frequency up to $10$ MHz and H-field up to saturation.</description>

Abstract: The present work reports experimental evidence of random magnetic behavior observed in modified barium hexagonal ferrites. A significant transition in the magnetic properties of this system is observed when divalent cations (Ni2+, Cu2+, Mn2+) are introduced in the structure and give rise to a magnetic nanocomposite. Such introduction takes place in a random manner throughout each sample and creates the conditions for such materials to behave as random magnets. We verify the occurrence of such behavior in our samples by fitting the magnetization in approaching saturation to the corresponding theoretical model. We therefore analyze the microwave absorption capacities of random magnets in the GHz range and predict large and broad absorption signals under certain conditions. The findings presented here postulate, for the first time, ceramic materials as promising random magnets and underline their potential as microwave absorbers, in good agreement with recent theoretical models.</description>

Abstract: Methane pyrolysis provides a scalable alternative to conventional hydrogen production methods, avoiding greenhouse gas emissions. However, high operating temperatures limit economic feasibility on an industrial scale. A major scientific goal is, therefore, to find a catalyst material that lowers operating temperatures, making methane pyrolysis economically viable. In this work, we derive a model that provides a qualitative comparison of possible catalyst materials. The model is based on calculations of adsorption energies using density functional theory. Thirty different elements were considered. Adsorption energies of intermediate molecules in the methane pyrolysis reaction correlate linearly with the adsorption energy of carbon. Moreover, the adsorption energy increases in magnitude with decreasing group number in the $d$-block of the periodic table. For a temperature range between 600 and 1200 K and a normalized partial pressure range for $\mathrm{H_2}$ between $10^{-1}$ and $10^{-5}$, a total of eighteen different materials were found to be optimal catalysts at least once. This indicates that catalyst selection and reactor operating conditions should be well-matched. The present work establishes the foundation for future large-scale studies of surfaces, alloy compositions, and material classes using machine learning algorithms.</description>

Abstract: Perovskite structure materials based on the Ba1-xGdxTiO3 system, where x = 0.001, 0.002, 0.003, 0.004 and 0.005, were prepared via the Pechini chemical synthesis route. The dielectric properties have been analyzed over a wide temperature and frequency range, revealing a significant contribution of the conduction mechanisms in the dielectric response of the studied ceramics. In fact, by using the Davidson-Cole formalism, the observed electrical behavior was found to be associated with relaxation processes related to intrinsic defects mobility promoted by a thermally-activated polaronic mechanism. The obtained values of the activation energy for the relaxation processes, estimated from the Arrhenius law for the mean relaxation time, revealed a decrease from 0.29 up to 0.21 eV as the Gd-doping concentration increases, which suggests the conduction process to be associated with the polaronic effects due to the coexistence of Ti4+ and Ti3+ ions in the structure. Analysis from the conductivity formalism, by using the Jonscher universal power-law, confirmed the polaron-type conduction mechanism for the dielectric dispersion, as suggested by the dielectric analysis, being the nature of the hopping mechanism governed by small polaron hopping (SPH) charge transport in the studied Ba1-xGdxTiO3 ceramics.</description>

      <title>High-temperature threshold of damage of SiC by swift heavy ions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At ambient conditions, SiC is known to be resistant to irradiation with swift heavy ions (SHI) decelerating in the electronic stopping regime. However, there is no experimental data on the SiC irradiation at elevated temperatures. To investigate this problem, we evaluate the stability of SiC to SHI impacts at high temperatures up to 2200 K. We apply the combination of the Monte-Carlo code TREKIS-3, describing excitation of the electronic and atomic systems using temperature-dependent scattering cross-sections, with molecular-dynamic modeling of the lattice response to the excitation. We demonstrate that increasing irradiation temperature increases the energy transferred to the atomic lattice from the excited electronic system. This material heating leads to formation of a stable nanometric damaged core along the trajectory of 710 MeV Bi ion when the irradiation temperature overcomes the threshold of ~1800 K. In this case, a chain of nanometric voids along the ion trajectory forms due to the mass transport from the track core by edge dislocations. Voids of larger sizes appear at higher irradiation temperatures. At lower irradiation temperatures, the damaged regions recrystallize completely within ~100 ps after the ion passage.</description>

Abstract: For decades, frustrated quantum magnets have been a seed for scientific progress and innovation in condensed matter. As much as the numerical tools for low-dimensional quantum magnetism have thrived and improved in recent years due to breakthroughs inspired by quantum information and quantum computation, higher-dimensional quantum magnetism can be considered as the final frontier, where strong quantum entanglement, multiple ordering channels, and manifold ways of paramagnetism culminate. At the same time, efforts in crystal synthesis have induced a significant increase in the number of tangible frustrated magnets which are generically three-dimensional in nature, creating an urgent need for quantitative theoretical modeling. We review the pseudo-fermion (PF) and pseudo-Majorana (PM) functional renormalization group (FRG) and their specific ability to address higher-dimensional frustrated quantum magnetism. First developed more than a decade ago, the PFFRG interprets a Heisenberg model Hamiltonian in terms of Abrikosov pseudofermions, which is then treated in a diagrammatic resummation scheme formulated as a renormalization group flow of $m$-particle pseudofermion vertices. The article reviews the state of the art of PFFRG and PMFRG and discusses their application to exemplary domains of frustrated magnetism, but most importantly, it makes the algorithmic and implementation details of these methods accessible to everyone. By thus lowering the entry barrier to their application, we hope that this review will contribute towards establishing PFFRG and PMFRG as the numerical methods for addressing frustrated quantum magnetism in higher spatial dimensions.</description>

      <title>Elasticity-Controlled Jamming Criticality in Soft Composite Solids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02354v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Soft composite solids are made of inclusions dispersed within soft matrices. They are ubiquitous in nature and form the basis of many biological tissues. In the field of materials science, synthetic soft composites are promising candidates for building various engineering devices due to their highly programmable features. However, when the volume fraction of the inclusions increases, predicting the mechanical properties of these materials poses a significant challenge for the classical theories of composite mechanics. The difficulty arises from the inherently disordered, multi-scale interactions between the inclusions and the matrix. To address this challenge, we systematically investigated the mechanics of densely filled soft elastomers containing stiff microspheres. We experimentally demonstrated how the strain-stiffening response of the soft composites is governed by the critical scalings in the vicinity of a shear-jamming transition of the included particles. The proposed criticality framework quantitatively connects the overall mechanics of a soft composite with the elasticity of the matrix and the particles, and captures the diverse mechanical responses observed across a wide range of material parameters. The findings uncover a novel design paradigm of composite mechanics that relies on engineering the jamming properties of the embedded inclusions.</description>

      <title>Generally applicable physics-based equation of state for liquids</title>

Abstract: Physics-based first-principles pressure-volume-temperature equations of state (EOS) exist for solids and gases but not for liquids due to the long-standing fundamental problems involved in liquid theory. Current EOS models that are applicable to liquids and supercritical fluids at liquid-like density under conditions relevant to planetary interiors and industrial processes are complex empirical models with many physically meaningless adjustable parameters. Here, we develop a generally applicable physics-based (GAP) EOS for liquids including supercritical fluids at liquid-like density. The GAP equation is explicit in the internal energy, and hence links the most fundamental macroscopic static property of fluids, the pressure-volume-temperature EOS, to their key microscopic property: the molecular hopping frequency or liquid relaxation time, from which the internal energy can be obtained. We test our GAP equation against available experimental data in several different ways and find good agreement. Our GAP equation, unavoidably and similarly to solid EOS, contains a semi-empirical term giving the energy of the static sample as a function of volume only ($E_{ST}(V)$). Our testing includes studies along isochores, in order to examine the validity of the GAP equation independently of the validity of any function we may choose to utilize for $E_{ST}(V)$. The only other adjustable parameter in the equation is the Gr\"uneisen parameter for the fluid. We observe that the GAP equation is similar to the Mie-Gr\"{u}neisen solid EOS in a wide range of the liquid phase diagram. This similarity is ultimately related to the condensed state of these two phases. On the other hand, the differences between the GAP equation and EOS for gases are fundamental. Finally, we identify the key gaps in the experimental data that need to be filled in to proceed further with the liquid EOS.</description>

      <title>Exploring thermal equilibria of the Fermi-Hubbard model with variational quantum algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the thermal properties of the repulsive Fermi-Hubbard model with chemical potential using variational quantum algorithms, crucial in comprehending particle behaviour within lattices at high temperatures in condensed matter systems. Conventional computational methods encounter challenges, especially in managing chemical potential, prompting exploration into Hamiltonian approaches. Despite the promise of quantum algorithms, their efficacy is hampered by coherence limitations when simulating extended imaginary time evolution sequences. To overcome such constraints, this research focuses on optimising variational quantum algorithms to probe the thermal properties of the Fermi-Hubbard model. Physics-inspired circuit designs are tailored to alleviate coherence constraints, facilitating a more comprehensive exploration of materials at elevated temperatures. Our study demonstrates the potential of variational algorithms in simulating the thermal properties of the Fermi-Hubbard model while acknowledging limitations stemming from error sources in quantum devices and encountering barren plateaus.</description>

      <title>Charge self-consistent density functional theory plus ghost rotationally-invariant slave-boson theory for correlated materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a charge self-consistent density functional theory combined with the ghost-rotationally-invariant slave-boson (DFT+gRISB) formalism for studying correlated materials. This method is applied to SrVO$_3$ and NiO, representing prototypical correlated metals and charge-transfer insulators. For SrVO$_3$, we demonstrate that DFT+gRISB yields an accurate equilibrium volume and effective mass close to experimentally observed values. Regarding NiO, DFT+gRISB enables the simultaneous description of charge transfer and Mott-Hubbard bands, significantly enhancing the accuracy of the original DFT+RISB approach. Furthermore, the calculated equilibrium volume and spectral function reasonably agree with experimental observations.</description>
