      <title>Optimal reinsurance and investment via stochastic projected gradient method based on Malliavin calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new approach using the stochastic projected gradient method and Malliavin calculus for optimal reinsurance and investment strategies. Unlike traditional methodologies, we aim to optimize static investment and reinsurance strategies by directly minimizing the ruin probability. Furthermore, we provide a convergence analysis of the stochastic projected gradient method for general constrained optimization problems whose objective function has H\"older continuous gradient. Numerical experiments show the effectiveness of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Model-free portfolio allocation in continuous-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a non-probabilistic, path-by-path framework for studying path-dependent (i.e., where weight is a functional of time and historical time-series), long-only portfolio allocation in continuous-time based on [Chiu &amp; Cont '23], where the fundamental concept of self-financing was introduced, independent of any integration theory. In this article, we extend this concept to a portfolio allocation strategy and characterize it by a path-dependent partial differential equation. We derive the general explicit solution that describes the evolution of wealth in generic markets, including price paths that may not evolve continuously or exhibit variation of any order. Explicit solution examples are provided.
  As an application of our continuous-time, path-dependent framework, we extend an aggregating algorithm of [Vovk '90] and the universal algorithm of [Cover '91] to continuous-time algorithms that combine multiple strategies into a single strategy. These continuous-time (meta) algorithms take multiple strategies as input (which may themselves be generated by other algorithms) and track the wealth generated by the best individual strategy and the best convex combination of strategies, with tracking error bounds in log wealth of order O(1) and O(ln t), respectively. This work extends Cover's theorem [Cover '91, Thm 6.1] to a continuous-time, model-free setting.</description>
