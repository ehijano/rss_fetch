      <title>Zeeman Doppler Imaging of $\tau$Ceti: The Weakest Magnetic Field Detected in a Sun-like Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For nearly a decade, observations have shown that many older Sun-like stars spin faster than predicted, a phenomenon known as weakened magnetic braking (WMB). The leading hypothesis for WMB is a weakening of the large-scale dipole field, which leads to a less efficient angular momentum loss. To test this hypothesis on a star known to be in the WMB regime, we present the first Zeeman Doppler Imaging (ZDI) map of the Sun-like star $\tau$Ceti, reconstructed using spectropolarimetric data from the Canada-France-Hawai'i Telescope (CFHT). Our ZDI analysis reveals a remarkably simple, stable and weak ($\langle B\rangle =0.17 \mathrm{G}$) magnetic field, characterized by a predominantly dipolar ($\sim92\%$ magnetic energy contained in $l=1$ modes), and highly axisymmetric ($\sim88\%$ magnetic energy contained in $m&lt;l/2$ modes) morphology. We infer a dipole field strength of $B_{\mathrm{dip}}=0.31 \mathrm{G}$, nearly an order of magnitude weaker than standard braking model predictions, providing direct confirmation of the weakened large-scale dipole predicted by the WMB hypothesis. This work establishes a new benchmark for ZDI, demonstrating that even extremely quiet stars in the WMB regime are accessible to this technique.</description>

      <title>WIYN Open Cluster Study. XCIII. An Extended Radial-Velocity Survey and Spectroscopic Binary Orbits in the Open Cluster NGC 188</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present 32 new spectroscopic-binary orbits from our extended radial-velocity (RV) survey of the old ($6.4 \pm 0.2$ Gyr) open cluster NGC 188. Using data from the WIYN Open Cluster Study (WOCS) and APOGEE-2, this work nearly doubles the temporal baseline of the previous RV study of NGC 188. We obtain orbital solutions within a stellar sample that spans a magnitude range of $10.8 \leq \mathrm{G} \leq 16.5 \; (0.9\mbox{-}1.2 \; {M_\odot})$. With revised membership determinations using Gaia DR3 proper-motions and parallaxes, we reassess the cluster binary frequency and period-eccentricity distribution, finding an incompleteness-corrected binary frequency of $33.1 \% \pm 3.8\%$ for periods less than $10^4$ days. We also find a tidal-circularization period of $14.4^{+0.14}_{-0.11}$ days. We find evidence that giants are deficient in short-period orbits, and suggest that the missing giants may have undergone mass transfer and in part formed the population of blue straggler stars and blue lurkers. Among the binaries of note, we highlight WOCS 3953 and WOCS 4945, long-period candidate mass-transfer systems that exhibit possible UV excess.</description>

      <title>Brown Dwarf Formation Through Gravitational Collapse: Insights From 3D Numerical Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation mechanism of Brown Dwarfs (BDs), whether akin to stars or ejected planetary-mass objects, remains debated. We present the first 3D radiation-MHD simulations of magnetized, turbulent, gravitationally unstable low-mass cores ($0.05-0.1\ \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$) collapsing into proto-BDs. Using the {\ttfamily RAMSES} code with adaptive mesh refinement, we model the full dynamical range ($10^{5}~-10^{22}\ \mathrm{cm^{-3}}$), including radiative transfer (flux limited diffusion) and non-ideal MHD (ambipolar diffusion). Our simulations self-consistently follow the isothermal collapse, first hydrostatic core formation, H$_{2}$ dissociation, and BD birth. The resulting BDs have initial radii $\approx 0.75\ \mathrm{R_{\odot}}$ and masses $\approx 0.8\ \mathrm{M_{Jup}}$, growing via accretion as we follow the early evolution of the object. Crucially, we find that BDs may form similarly to low-mass stars but with a prolonged first-core phase, supporting a star-like formation scenario.</description>

      <title>SN 2024aecx: Double-Peaked Light Curves and Rapid Evolution in a Nearby Type IIb Supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SN 2024aecx is a nearby ($\sim$11 Mpc) Type IIb SN discovered within $\sim$1 d after explosion. In this paper we report high-cadence photometric and spectroscopic follow-up observations, conducted from as early as 0.27 d post discovery out to the nebular phase at 158.4 d. We analyze the environment of SN 2024aecx and derive a new distance, metallicity and host extinction. The light curve exhibits a hot and luminous shock-cooling peak at the first few days, followed by a main peak with very rapid post-maximum decline. The earliest spectra are blue and featureless, while from 2.3 d after discovery prominent P-Cygni profiles emerge. At nebular phase, the emission lines exhibit asymmetric and double-peaked profiles, indicating asphericity and/or early dust formation in the ejecta. We simulated the progenitor and explosion using a two-component model of shock cooling and radioactive $^{56}$Ni heating; our model favors an extended, low-mass H-rich envelope with$ M_{\mathrm{e}} = 0.08^{+0.02}_{-0.03}\, M_{\odot} $ and a low ejecta mass of $ M_{\mathrm{ej}} = 2.65^{+1.21}_{-0.73} \, M_{\odot}. $The comprehensive monitoring of SN 2024aecx, coupled with the detailed characterization of its local environment, establishes it as a benchmark event for probing the progenitors and explosion mechanisms of Type IIb SNe.</description>

      <title>Predicting Stellar Parameters of Massive Stars from Light Curves with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution spectroscopic measurements of OB stars are important for understanding processes like stellar evolution, but require labor-intensive observations. In contrast, photometric missions like the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) can monitor hundreds of thousands of stars with a range of temporal resolutions, but do not provide such detailed measurements. With surveys like the Legacy Survey of Space and Time promising unprecedented photometric coverage over the next ten years, it is increasingly important to develop methods that connect large-scale time-series photometry with the detailed stellar parameter measurements typically derived from spectroscopy. In this paper, we test whether machine learning can recover such parameters by combining TESS light curves with spectroscopic measurements from the IACOB project, using a sample of 285 light curves from 106 unique O stars. Using both multilayer perceptrons and convolutional neural networks, we demonstrate that (1) O star light curves contain sufficient information to meaningfully infer stellar parameters and (2) periodograms derived from light curves capture substantially more information than previously identified correlation parameters. Our best model achieves moderate success in predicting both spectroscopic luminosity ($R^2 = 0.641_{-0.167}^{+0.107}$) and effective temperature ($R^2 = 0.443_{-0.234}^{+0.056}$), key stellar parameters for determining positions of stars on the spectroscopic Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, despite the small dataset size. Further progress will require expanded datasets of matched photometric and spectroscopic observations.</description>

      <title>A high fraction of close massive binary stars at low metallicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At high metallicity, a majority of massive stars have at least one close stellar companion. The evolution of such binaries is subject to strong interaction processes, heavily impacting the characteristics of their life-ending supernova and compact remnants. For the low-metallicity environments of high-redshift galaxies constraints on the multiplicity properties of massive stars over the separation range leading to binary interaction are crucially missing. Here we show that the presence of massive stars in close binaries is ubiquitous, even at low metallicity. Using the Very Large Telescope, we obtained multi-epoch radial velocity measurements of a representative sample of 139 massive O-type stars across the Small Magellanic Cloud, which has a metal content of about one fifth of the solar value. We find that 45% of them show radial velocity variations which demonstrate that they are members of close binary systems, and predominantly have orbital periods shorter than one year. Correcting for observational biases indicates that at least 70[+11:-6]% of the O stars in our sample are in close binaries, and that at least 68[+7:-8]% of all O stars interact with a companion star during their lifetime. We found no evidence supporting a statistically significant trend of the multiplicity properties with metallicity. Our results indicate that multiplicity and binary interactions govern the evolution of massive stars and determine their cosmic feedback and explosive fates.</description>

      <title>TESS Subgiant and Lower Red Giant Asteroseismology in the Continuous Viewing Zones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asteroseismology, the study of stellar oscillations, and stellar modeling both offer profound insights into the fundamental properties and evolution of stars. With pySYD, a new open-source Python package, we were able to constrain the asteroseismic global parameters, $\nu_{max}$ and $\Delta\nu$, for 82 solar-like oscillating subgiant and lower red giant stars, filling in the region between the Kepler dwarfs and giants. Using asteroseismic scaling relations, we were able to compute seismic masses, radii, and surface gravities for our entire sample with average errors of 0.21 $M_{\bigodot}$, 0.27 $R_{\bigodot}$, and 0.06 dex respectively. Using 4 stellar modeling grids we determine and compare stellar ages for our sample. We find that our age distribution from stellar modeling is consistent with other local star samples. We find small consistent offsets from model predictions across our regime, but offsets were worse at higher gravities (log(g) $\geq$ 3.5 dex), suggesting the need for better calibration. Finally, we discuss our sample in the context of galactic archaeology and show how ages like these could be used to identify and study binary system evolution and galactic evolution in the future. All in all, we show that asteroseismology can be successfully performed with TESS data and can continue to make an impact on our understanding of stellar physics and galactic archaeology.</description>

      <title>TESS Light Curve Analysis: A Case Study of Stellar Rotation in TIC 445493624</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar rotation is a fundamental parameter governing a star's magnetic activity and evolution. The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) provides high-precision photometric data ideal for measuring rotation periods via brightness modulations from starspots. This paper presents a detailed analysis of the star TIC 445493624 using 2-minute cadence data from TESS Sector 58. We process the light curve using a custom pipeline to perform outlier removal, binning, and Savitzky-Golay detrending to isolate the stellar variability. A Lomb-Scargle periodogram of the cleaned data reveals a single, dominant periodic signal at 3.638 days with a power of 0.43, corresponding to a negligible false-alarm probability. The phase-folded light curve at this period is highly coherent and exhibits a stable, non-sinusoidal morphology indicative of large-scale magnetic features or spot groups.</description>

      <title>Wind Accretion in Massive Binaries Experiencing High Mass Loss Rates: I. Dependency on Mass Ratio and Orbital Period</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We run numerical simulations to study high-power wind accretion in a massive binary system during a high mass loss event. The system consists of an evolved primary star with a zero age main sequence mass of $ M_{1} = \rm 100~M_{\odot}$ and a hot secondary star with a mass ranging from $ M_{2} = \rm 30-80~M_{\odot}$, orbiting in a circular orbits with periods between 455 and 1155 days. We initiate a weak eruption event with mass loss at a rate of $10^{-3}~\rm {M_{\odot}}\rm~yr^{-1}$ for 1.5 years. During this event, a fraction of the mass lost by the primary is accreted onto the secondary, with the accretion rate being dependent on the orbital and stellar parameters. From the set of simulations, we derive an analytical relation describing the dependence of the mass accretion rate on the orbital period and stellar mass ratio. We also identify the transitional orbital period for which Roche lobe overflow begins to dominate over wind accretion. We find that accretion leads to a reduction in the effective temperature of the secondary star. However, the mass average accretion rate we obtain in the simulations is low enough for the secondary to remain in thermal equilibrium and avoid radial expansion.</description>

      <title>Apsidal motion and proximity effects in the massive binary BD+60 497</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The eccentric short-period O-star binary BD+60 497 is an interesting laboratory to study tidal interactions in massive binary systems, notably via the detection and characterisation of apsidal motion. The rate of apsidal motion in such systems can help us constrain their age and gain insight into the degree of mass concentration in the interior of massive stars. Spectroscopic data collected over two decades are used to reconstruct the individual spectra of the stars and to establish their epoch-dependent radial velocities. An orbital solution, explicitly accounting for apsidal motion is adjusted to the data. Space-borne photometric time series are analysed with Fourier methods and with binary models. We derive a rate of apsidal motion of $6.15^{+1.05}_{-1.65}$ degree/yr which suggests an age of $4.13^{+0.42}_{-1.37}$ Myr. The disentangled spectra unveil a curious change in the spectral properties of the secondary star between the epochs 2002-2003 and 2018-2022 with the secondary spectrum appearing of earlier spectral type over recent years. Photometric data show variability at the 6 mmag level on the period of the binary system which is hard to explain in terms of proximity effects. Whilst the rate of apsidal motion agrees well with theoretical expectations, the changes in the reconstructed secondary spectrum hint at a highly non-uniform surface temperature distribution for this star. Different effects are discussed that could contribute to the photometric variations. The currently most-likely explanation is a mix of proximity effects and tidally excited oscillations</description>

      <title>Two unseen massive white dwarf candidates in close binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of two binary systems, each consisting of a slightly bloated G-type main-sequence star and an unseen companion, identified through photometric data from TESS and radial velocity variation from Gaia. High-resolution spectroscopy confirms orbital periods of 1.37 and 2.67 days with circular orbits. The visible components have masses of $\sim 0.9\,M_\odot$, while the minimum masses of the unseen companions are $1.073^{+0.058}_{-0.060} M_\odot$ and $0.919^{+0.049}_{-0.051} M_\odot$, respectively. Assuming tidal synchronization, we estimate the companion masses to be $1.12^{+0.10}_{-0.08} M_\odot$ and $1.02^{+0.15}_{-0.10} M_\odot$. The absence of detectable spectral features from the companions rules out main-sequence stars of these masses, suggesting that the unseen companions are likely O/Ne or C/O massive white dwarfs. The short orbital periods imply that these systems are post-common envelope binaries. Their subsequent evolution is uncertain, with possible outcomes including cataclysmic variables, Type Ia supernovae, or accretion-induced collapse, depending on the nature of future mass transfer.</description>

      <title>Binary imposters: Mergers in massive hierarchical triple stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive stars are often born in triples, where gravitational dynamics and stellar interactions play a crucial role in shaping their evolution. One such pathway includes the merger of the inner binary, transforming the system to a binary with a distinct formation history. Therefore, the interpretation of observed binary properties and their inferred formation history may require the consideration of a potential triple origin. We aim to investigate the population of stellar mergers in massive hierarchical triples. Specifically, we assess how frequently mergers occur, and characterise the properties of the post-merger binaries and their subsequent evolution. We combine the triple population synthesis code TRES, which self-consistently models stellar evolution, binary interaction, and gravitational dynamics, with the binary population synthesis code SeBa to simulate 10^5 dynamically stable, massive triples from the zero-age main sequence through merger and post-merger evolution. We explore the effects of a range of physical models for the initial stellar properties, mass transfer, and merger. We find that stellar mergers are a common outcome, occurring in 20-32% of massive triples. Most mergers happen relatively early in the evolution of the system and involve two main-sequence (MS) stars, producing rejuvenated merger remnants that can appear significantly younger than their tertiary companions. Consequently, we predict that 2-10% of all wide MS+MS binaries (P&gt;100 days) have a measurable age discrepancy, and serve as a promising way to identify merged stars. The post-merger systems preferentially evolve into wide, eccentric binaries, with ~80% avoiding further interaction. However, a notable fraction (16-22%) undergoes a second mass-transfer phase, which may result in the formation of high-mass X-ray binaries or mergers of compact objects that spiral in via gravitational-wave emission.</description>

      <title>Solar Flare Hard X-ray Polarimetry with the CUbesat Solar Polarimeter (CUSP) mission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The CUbesat Solar Polarimeter (CUSP) project is a CubeSat mission planned for a launch in low-Earth orbit and aimed to measure the linear polarization of solar flares in the hard X-ray band by means of a Compton scattering polarimeter. CUSP will allow us to study the magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration in the flaring magnetic structures of our star. CUSP is a project in the framework of the Alcor Program of the Italian Space Agency aimed at developing new CubeSat missions. It is undergoing a 12-month Phase B that started in December 2024.
  The Compton polarimeter on board CUSP is composed of two acquisition chains based on plastic scintillators read out by Multi-Anode PhotoMultiplier Tubes for the scatterer part and GAGG crystals coupled to Avalanche PhotoDiodes for the absorbers. An event coincident between the two readout schemes will lead to a measurement of the incoming X-ray's azimuthal scattering angle, linked to the polarization of the solar flare in a statistical manner. The current status of the CUSP mission design, mission analysis, and payload scientific performance will be reported. The latter will be discussed based on preliminary laboratory results obtained in parallel with Geant4 simulations.</description>

      <title>Long-lived coronal loops in solar active regions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronal loops are plasma structures in the solar atmosphere with temperatures reaching millions of Kelvin, shaped and sustained by the magnetic field. However, their morphology and fundamental nature remain subjects of debate. By studying their cross-sectional properties and how they change along the loop and in time, we can understand their magnetic structure and heating mechanisms. In this study, we investigated the cross-sectional intensity profiles, both spatially and temporally, of two unique coronal loops, observed in the periphery of two distinct active regions by the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI/HRI$_{\rm EUV}$) on board the Solar Orbiter spacecraft. The main results of this study are 1. The lifetimes of these two loops (loop1 &gt; 120 min \&amp; loop2 &gt; 50 min) are longer than the typical timescales of radiative cooling and thermal conduction. 2. Their widths determined by the FWHM of the single Gaussian fit to the cross-axis intensity profiles are greater than 6-7 pixels of EUI/HRI$_{\rm EUV}$, indicating that the loop cross-section is uniformly filled on well-resolvable scales. 3. These loops exhibited an almost constant width, both spatially and temporally (width for loop1 is 2.1 $\pm$ 0.4 Mm and for loop2 is 1.3 $\pm$ 0.2 Mm), indicating that they are stable non-expanding structures. 4. We present observational evidence that the one of the loops (loop2) is not braided, which strongly suggests that the non-expanding nature of this multi-stranded loop along its length cannot be attributed to the twist of the magnetic field lines. In conclusion, we find that these coronal loops are long, stable, multi-stranded, non-expanding structures with a uniform cross-section that persist in the corona for an unusually extended duration. This not only challenges our current understanding of the structure of the coronal magnetic field but also raises critical questions about the mechanisms</description>

      <title>SIMBA: A Python-based single-point astrochemical solver and analysis tool</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining molecular abundances in astrophysical environments is crucial for interpreting observational data and constraining physical conditions in these regions. Chemical modelling tools are essential for simulating the complex processes that govern molecular evolution. We present SIMBA, a new Python-based single-point astrochemical modelling package designed to solve chemical reaction networks across diverse astrophysical environments. The software follows standardised rate equation approaches to evolve molecular abundances under specified physical conditions, incorporating gas-phase chemistry, grain-surface processes, and photochemistry. While leveraging Python for accessibility, performance-critical routines utilise just-in-time compilation to achieve computational efficiency suitable for research applications. A key feature of SIMBA is its graphical interface, which enables rapid investigation of chemical evolution under varying physical conditions. This makes it particularly valuable for exploring parameter dependencies and complementing more computationally intensive multi-dimensional models. We demonstrate the package's capabilities by modelling chemical evolution in a photoevaporative flow driven by external FUV irradiation. Using simplified gas dynamics, we chain multiple SIMBA instances to create a dynamic 1D model where gas evolves both chemically and dynamically. Comparing this approach to typical static models - where chemistry in each grid cell evolves independently - reveals that molecular ices, especially those with relatively high binding energies like H2O, can survive much farther into the flow than static models predict. This example case highlights how SIMBA can be extended to higher dimensions for investigating complex chemical processes. The package is open-source and includes comprehensive documentation.</description>

      <title>Star-Black Hole Interactions in Young Star Clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Close encounters between stars and black holes can trigger micro-tidal disruption events (micro-TDEs) in dense young star clusters (YSCs). Using direct N-body simulations with PETAR, we found that most micro-TDEs arise from few-body multiple encounters. The inferred rate is approximately 350-450 Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$. Micro-TDEs could be detected both by upcoming surveys such as LSST, expected to observe roughly 10-100 events per year, and by their gravitational-wave (GW) signals peaking in the deci-Hertz band, detectable with future instruments such as LGWA and DECIGO.</description>

      <title>Do Outer Giants Inflate Neptune-sized Planets? An Architecture-Dependent Mass-Radius Relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exoplanet demographics increasingly reveal that planetary properties depend not only on local irradiation and composition but also on the wider system architecture. We analyse a sample of Neptune-sized short-period planets with well-measured masses and radii, identifying those whose host stars harbour at least one confirmed outer-giant (OG) companion. On the mass-radius (M-R) plane, the two populations diverge modestly: inner planets in OG systems cluster at systematically larger radii than their counterparts in no-giant (NG) systems, a result that remains suggestive after controlling for planet and stellar properties. Bayesian modelling quantifies the offset, revealing an average radius enhancement of $17 \pm 4 \%$ for inner planets in OG systems relative to NG systems at fixed mass. Alternative cuts, including the use of a homogeneous set of parameters, confirm the robustness of the signal, though the result still relies on small-number statistics. Possible mechanisms for the observed inflation include boosted envelope accretion, reduced atmospheric loss, or volatile enrichment by giant-planet stirring. If upheld, this empirical link between outer giants and inflated inner-planet radii offers a new constraint on coupled formation and evolution in planetary systems.</description>

      <title>No Giant Planets in the Eta Cassiopeiae System: Dynamical Implications of a Wide Binary Companion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given the vast number of stars that exist within binary systems, it remains important to explore the effect of binary star environments on the formation and evolution of exoplanetary systems. Nearby binaries provide opportunities to characterize their properties and orbits through a combination of radial velocities, astrometry, and direct imaging. Eta Cassiopeiae is a bright, well-known binary system for which recent observations have provided greatly improved stellar masses and orbital parameters. We present additional radial velocity data that are used to perform an injection-recovery analysis for potential planetary signatures. We further provide a detailed dynamical study that explores the viability of planetary orbits throughout the system. Our combined analysis shows that giant planets are significantly ruled out for the system, and indeed no planetary orbits are viable beyond $\sim$8 AU of the primary star. However, terrestrial planets may yet exist within the Habitable Zone where orbits can remain long-term stable. We discuss the implications of these results, highlighting the effect of wide binary companions on giant planet formation, and the consequences for occurrence rates and planetary habitability.</description>

      <title>The impact of Alfvenic shear flow on magnetic reconnection and turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection is a fundamental and omnipresent energy conversion process in plasma physics. Novel observations of fields and particles from Parker Solar Probe (PSP) have shown the absence of reconnection in a large number of current sheets in the near-Sun solar wind. Using near-Sun observations from PSP Encounters 4 to 11 (Jan 2020 to March 2022), we investigate whether reconnection onset might be suppressed by velocity shear. We compare estimates of the tearing mode growth rate in the presence of shear flow for time periods identified as containing reconnecting current sheets versus non-reconnecting times, finding systematically larger growth rates for reconnection periods. Upon examination of the parameters associated with reconnection onset, we find that 85% of the reconnection events are embedded in slow, non-Alfvenic wind streams. We compare with fast, slow non-Alfvenic, and slow Alfvenic streams, finding that the growth rate is suppressed in highly Alfvenic fast and slow wind and reconnection is not seen in these wind types, as would be expected from our theoretical expressions. These wind streams have strong Alfvenic} flow shear, consistent with the idea of reconnection suppression by such flows. This could help explain the frequent absence of reconnection events in the highly Alfvenic, near-Sun solar wind observed by PSP. Finally, we find a steepening of both the trace and magnitude magnetic field spectra within reconnection periods in comparison to ambient wind. We tie this to the dynamics of relatively balanced turbulence within these reconnection periods and the potential generation of compressible fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Identifying Fixed Points in the Three-Body Problem Using a High-Order Transfer Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Periodic orbits (POs) play a central role in the circular restricted three-body problem (CRTBP). This paper introduces a method to search for POs by identifying single- and multiple-revolution fixed points in chosen Poincare maps that describe the CRTBP dynamics, with a theoretical capability to detect all fixed points across arbitrary revolution counts exhaustively.First, high-order transfer maps (HOTMs), represented as polynomials, are constructed within the differential algebra (DA) framework for both planar and spatial CRTBP to map states between successive Poincare section crossings, with the Jacobi constant used to reduce the number of independent variables. Next, an automatic domain splitting (ADS) strategy is employed to generate subdomains, preserving HOTM accuracy, with an integrated feasibility estimation to reduce ADS's computation burden.Then, a two-stage HOTM-based polynomial optimization framework is introduced, first identifying combinable subdomain sequences and then refining the fixed point solutions. Finally, the method is applied to the Earth-Moon CRTBP, identifying POs up to nine revolutions in the planar case and four in the spatial case. Known families such as distant retrograde orbits (DROs) and Lyapunov orbits are recovered, along with a previously undocumented family that exhibits a hybrid character between DROs and Lyapunov orbits.</description>

      <title>An nl-model with a full radiative transfer treatment for level populations of hydrogen atoms in a spherically symmetric H II region</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. The radiation field consisting of hydrogen recombination lines and continuum emission might significantly affect the hydrogen-level populations in ultra- and hypercompact (U/HC) H II regions. The escape probability approximation was used to estimate the effect of the radiation field in previous models for calculating hydrogen-level populations. The reliability of this approximation has not been systematically studied, however. Aims. We investigate the appropriate ranges of previous models with the escape probability approximation and without the effects of the radiation field. We create a new model for simulating the integrated characteristics and the spatially resolved diagnostics of the hydrogen recombination lines throughout H II regions. Methods. We developed a new nl model with a full radiative transfer treatment of the radiation field causd by hydrogen recombination lines and continuum emission to calculate the hydrogen-level populations and hydrogen recombination lines. We then compared the level populations and the corresponding hydrogen recombination line intensities simulated by the new model and previous models. Results. We studied the applicability and the valid parameter ranges of previous models. Radiation fields exhibit negligible effects on the level populations in classical and UC H II regions. With the modified escape probability, the model with the escape probability approximation is suitable for most HC H II regions. The improved new model performs better in the HC H II region with an extremely high emission measure. To address the high computational costs inherent in numerical models, we trained a precise machine-learning model to enable a rapid estimation of hydrogen-level populations and the associated hydrogen recombination lines.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric radiation in binary systems: Implications for disk evolution and chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current models of binary systems often depend on simplified approach of the radiation field, which are unlikely to accurately capture the complexities of asymmetric environments. We investigate the dynamical and chemical implications of a 3D asymmetric radiation field that accounts for the optical properties of sub-structures present in a protoplanetary disk, as well as the inclusion of a secondary radiation source in binary systems. We conducted a series of 3D-SPH hydrodynamical simulations using PHANTOM, coupled with the 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer code MCFOST, to compute disc temperatures on-the-fly. We explored different binary-disk orientations (0$^o$ and 30$^o$) for an eccentric binary, along with a constant dust-to-gas ratio and dust as a mixture prescription. We also simulated an outburst event as an example of a drastic increase in luminosity. Heating from the secondary star inflates the outer disk, increasing the aspect ratio facing the companion by about 25% in inclined cases compared to 10% in coplanar ones. Dust settling in the mid-plane enhances extinction along the disk plane, making the coplanar case cooler than the inclined one on the side of the disk facing the companion. Besides, heating causes a shift in the snow line for species with freeze-out temperatures below 50 K, depending on the disk-binary inclination and binary phase. During outbursts, the aspect ratio doubles on the star-facing side and increases by 50% on the opposite side in inclined cases. The snow line shift would impact all the species considered in the outburst case. Disk heating in binaries depends on stellar properties, orbital phase, and disk local and global characteristics. This results in temperature asymmetries, especially during secondary star outbursts, leading to variations in aspect ratio and snow lines that can affect chemistry and planet formation.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of the Equations of State (EoSs) of Compact Stars using machine and deep learning regression techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This dissertation focuses on the reconstruction of Equations of State (EoSs) describing the interior of compact stars, using modern machine learning and deep learning methods. The pipeline is based on data from mass-radius (M-R) curves, obtained by numerically solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations for a wide range of admissible EoSs. The manuscript is divided into a Theoretical Part (Chs. 1-4) and a Computational Part (Chs. 5-7). The theoretical chapters analyze the properties of neutron and quark stars, the physical constraints of viable EoS models, and introduce regression algorithms (Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost) and neural networks with normalization and dropout techniques. The computational part presents the generation of artificial EoSs for hadronic and quark stars (MIT bag, CFL), the numerical solution of the TOV equations, data preparation, and hyperparameter tuning. Results include training and evaluation of models using MSE/MSLE metrics, learning curves for neural networks, and reconstruction of 21 hadronic and 20 quark star EoSs. Source code and tools for reproducibility and future research are provided. The work aims to establish a reusable and scalable framework, strengthening the connection between theoretical astrophysics and computational science.</description>

      <title>Nonresonant capture cross section measurement of the 29Si(p,gamma)30P reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The isotopic ratios measured in meteoritic presolar grains are a crucial tool for tracing the nucleosynthetic origin of isotopes. In the case of silicon isotopes, two important indicators to establish the origin of presolar grains are the ratios 29Si/28Si and 30Si/28Si. To constrain theoretical predictions, the rates of key nuclear reactions influencing the abundances of 29Si and 30Si must be well known. One such reaction is 29Si(p,gamma)30P which plays a role in classical nova explosions. The aim of the present work is to determine the nonresonant cross section of the 29Si(p,gamma)30P reaction, which has not been previously measured. The activation method was employed to measure the total cross section at four proton energies between Ep = 1000 and 1430 keV. The measured cross sections were found to be significantly (a factor of 4.3+-0.6) higher than those predicted by theoretical direct capture calculations, thereby impacting the reaction rates at low astrophysical temperatures, below about 30 MK. This higher nonresonant cross section - now based on experimental data - can be used in forthcoming nucleosynthesis calculations of classical novae. As a secondary result, the 16O(p,gamma)17F cross section was also obtained and found to be in good agreement with existing literature data.</description>

      <title>Rotating neutron stars within the macroscopic effective-surface approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The macroscopic model for a neutron star (NS) as a perfect liquid drop at the equilibrium is extended to rotating systems with a small frequency $\omega$ within the effective-surface (ES) approach. The NS angular momentum $I$ and moment of inertia (MI) for a slow stationary azimuthal rotation around the symmetry axis is calculated by using the Kerr metric approach in the Boyer-Lindquist and Hogan forms for the perfect liquid-drop model of NSs. The gradient surface terms of the NS energy density $\mathcal{E}(\rho)$ [Equation of State] are taken into account along with the volume ones at the leading order of the leptodermic parameter $a/R \ll 1$, where $a$ is the ES crust thickness and $R$ is the mean NS radius. The macroscopic NS angular momentum $I$ at small frequencies $\omega$, up to quadratic terms, can be specified for calculations of the adiabatic MI, $\Theta=d I/d \omega$, by using Hogan's inner gravitational metric, $r\le R$. The NS MI, $\Theta=\tilde{\Theta}/(1-\mathcal{G}_{t\varphi})$, was obtained in terms of the statistically averaged MI, $\tilde{\Theta}$, and its time and azimuthal angle correlation, $\mathcal{G}_{t\varphi}$, as sumes of the volume and surface components. The MI $\Theta$ depends dramatically on its effective radius $R$ because of a strong gravitation. We found the significant shift of the Schwarzschild radius $R_{\rm S}$ to a much smaller position due to the time and azimuthal correlation term $\mathcal{G}_{t\varphi}$. The adiabaticity condition is carried out for several neutron stars in a strong gravitation case.</description>

      <title>Probing Stellar Kinematics with the Time-Asymmetric Hanbury Brown and Twiss Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intensity interferometry (II) offers a powerful means to observe stellar objects with a high resolution. In this work, we demonstrate that II can also probe internal stellar kinematics by revealing a time-asymmetric Hanbury Brown and Twiss (HBT) effect, causing a measurable shift in the temporal correlation peak away from zero delay. We develop numerical models to simulate this effect for two distinct astrophysical scenarios: an emission-line circumstellar disk and an absorption-line binary system. Our simulations reveal a clear sensitivity of this temporal asymmetry to the system's inclination angle, velocity symmetry, and internal dynamics. This suggests that, with sufficiently high time resolution, II can be used to extract quantitative information about internal kinematics, offering a new observational window on stellar dynamics.</description>

      <title>Virtual states and exponential decay in small-scale dynamo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop the Kazantsev theory of small-scale dynamo generation at small Prandtl numbers near the generation threshold and restore the concordance between the theory and numerical simulations: the theory predicted a power-law decay below the threshold, while simulations demonstrate exponential decay. We show that the exponential decay is temporary and owes its existence to the flattening of the velocity correlator at large scales. This effect corresponds to the existence of a long-living virtual level in the corresponding Schrodinger type equation. We also find the critical Reynolds number and the increment of growth/decay above and under the threshold; we express them in terms of the quantitative characteristic properties of the velocity correlator, which makes it possible to compare the results with the data of different simulations.</description>

      <title>First detection of ices in intermediate-mass young stellar objects beyond the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using NIRSpec on JWST, we studied a sample of 15 intermediate-mass (1.8-4.1 Msun) young stellar objects (YSOs) previously identified with MIRI photometry in the low-metallicity NGC 346 star-forming cluster in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). All objects, observed in the 1.7-5.3 micron range, show strong hydrogen recombination lines in the Paschen, Brackett, Pfund, and Humphreys series, confirming their very young ages. The spectra of 11 YSOs show prominent absorption bands from the three most important ice species (H2O, CO2, CO), marking the first detection of these ices in intermediate-mass YSOs beyond our Galaxy. In three YSOs, water ice appears to be in crystalline form. In some objects, we also detect 13CO2 and OCS ices -- never before observed beyond the Milky Way (MW) -- and methanol ice in at least one star. We compared the column densities of H2O, CO2, and CO ices with those measured in more and less massive protostars in the MW and Large Magellanic Cloud, finding that in NGC 346 ice column densities reach values nearly an order of magnitude lower than in more massive objects (~1x10^{17} cm-2 for water and ~1x10^{16} cm-2 for CO2 and CO). However, the relative proportions of the ice species abundances do not differ from those in massive MW YSOs. This suggests that metallicity may not significantly affect ice chemistry in protoplanetary discs and that, shielded by the protostellar envelope or deep in the midplane, circumstellar material is likely impervious to the radiation environment.</description>

      <title>Probing Solar Polar Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20502v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The magnetic fields and dynamical processes in the solar polar regions play a crucial role in the solar magnetic cycle and in supplying mass and energy to the fast solar wind, ultimately being vital in controlling solar activities and driving space weather. Despite numerous efforts to explore these regions, to date no imaging observations of the Sun's poles have been achieved from vantage points out of the ecliptic plane, leaving their behavior and evolution poorly understood. This observation gap has left three top-level scientific questions unanswered, 1) How does the solar dynamo work and drive the solar magnetic cycle? 2) What drives the fast solar wind? 3) How do space weather processes globally originate from the Sun and propagate throughout the solar system? The Solar Polar-orbit Observatory (SPO) mission, a solar polar exploration spacecraft, is proposed to address these three unanswered scientific questions by imaging the Sun's poles from high heliolatitudes. In order to achieve its scientific goals, SPO will carry six remote-sensing and four in-situ instruments to measure the vector magnetic fields and Doppler velocity fields in the photosphere, to observed the Sun in the extreme ultraviolet, X-ray, and radio wavelengths, to image the corona and the heliosphere up to 45 $R_\odot$, and to perform in-situ detection of magnetic fields, and low- and high-energy particles in the solar wind.</description>

      <title>The advanced evolution of massive stars: I. New reaction rates for carbon and oxygen nuclear reactions</title>

Abstract: The nuclear rates for reactions involving 12C and 16O are key to compute the energy release and nucleosynthesis of massive stars during their evolution. These rates shape the stellar structure and evolution, and impact the nature of the final compact remnant. We explore the impact of new nuclear reaction rates for 12C({\alpha},{\gamma})16O, 12C+12C, 12C+16O and 16O+16O reactions for massive stars. We aim to investigate how the structure and nucleosynthesis evolve and how these processes influence the stellar fate. We computed stellar models using the GENEC code, including updated rates for 12C({\alpha},{\gamma})16O and, for the three fusion reactions, new rates following a fusion suppression scenario and new theoretical rates obtained with TDHF calculations. The updated 12C({\alpha},{\gamma})16O rates mainly impact the chemical structure evolution changing the 12C/16O ratio with little effect on the CO core mass. This variation in the 12C/16O ratio is critical for predicting the stellar fate, which is very sensitive to 12C abundance. The combined new rates for 12C+12C and 16O+16O fusion reactions according to the HIN(RES) model lead to shorter C- and O-burning lifetimes, and shift the ignition conditions to higher temperatures and densities. Theoretical TDHF rates primarily affect C-burning, increasing its duration and lowering the ignition temperature. These changes alter the core chemical structure, the carbon shell size and duration, and hence the compactness. They also affect nucleosynthesis. This work shows that accurate reaction rates for key processes in massive star evolution drive significant changes in stellar burning lifetimes, chemical evolution, and stellar fate. In addition, discrepancies between experimental and theoretical rates introduce uncertainties in model predictions, influencing both the internal structure and the supernova ejecta composition.</description>

      <title>Orbital and Pulsation Analysis of Forty-Two Heartbeat Stars Discovered in TESS Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heartbeat stars (HBSs) are ideal laboratories for studying the formation and evolution of binary stars in eccentric orbits and their mutual tidal interactions. We present 42 new HBSs discovered based on TESS-SPOC and QLP data. Their physical parameters have been obtained through modeling with appropriate models. Subsequently, Tidally excited oscillations (TEOs) are detected in ten systems, and their pulsation phases and modes are identified. Most pulsation phases can be explained by the dominant being spherical harmonic degree $l=2$ and azimuthal order $m=0$ or $\pm2$. For TIC 156846634, the harmonic with large deviation ($&gt;3\sigma$) from the expected adiabatic phase can be expected to be a traveling wave or significantly nonadiabatic. The harmonic numbers $n$ = 16 in TIC 184413651 may not be considered as a TEO candidate due to its large deviation ($&gt;2\sigma$) from the adiabatic expectation. Moreover, TIC 92828790 shows no TEOs but exhibits a significant $\gamma$\,Dor-type pulsation. The eccentricity-period ($e-P$) relation also shows a positive correlation between eccentricity and period, as well as the existence of orbital circularization. The Hertzsprung-Russell diagram shows that TESS HBSs have higher temperatures and greater luminosities than Kepler HBSs, possibly due to selection effects. This significantly enhances the detectability of massive HBSs and those containing TEOs.</description>

      <title>Magnetic reconnection sustains the mass budget of the solar wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The solar wind originates from regions of open magnetic fields on the Sun, but the relevant processes remain unsolved. We present a self-consistent numerical model of the source region of the wind, in which jets similar to those observed on the Sun naturally emerge due to magnetic reconnection between closed and open magnetic fields. In this process material is transferred from closed to open field lines and fed into the solar wind. We quantify the mass flux through the magnetic field connected to the heliosphere and find that it greatly exceeds the amount required to sustain the wind. This supports a decades-old suspicion based on spectroscopic observations and shows that magnetic reconnection in the low solar atmosphere could sustain the solar wind.</description>

      <title>Granulation on a quiet K dwarf: HD 166620 I. Spectral signatures as a function of line-formation temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04573v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As Radial velocity (RV) spectrographs reach unprecedented precision and stability below 1 m/s, the challenge of granulation in the context of exoplanet detection has intensified. Despite promising advancements in post-processing tools, granulation remains a significant concern for the EPRV community. We present a pilot study to detect and characterise granulation using the High-Accuracy Radial-velocity Planet Searcher for the Northern hemisphere (HARPS-N) spectrograph. We observed HD166620, a K2 star in the Maunder Minimum phase, intensely for two successive nights, expecting granulation to be the dominant nightly noise source in the absence of strong magnetic activity. Following the correction for a newly identified instrumental signature arising from illumination variations across the CCD, we detected the granulation signal using structure functions and a one-component Gaussian Process (GP) model. The granulation signal exhibits a characteristic timescale of 43.65$\pm$15.8 minutes, within one $\sigma$, and a standard deviation of 22.9$\pm$0.77 cm/s, with in three $\sigma$ of the predicted value. By examining spectra and RVs as a function of line formation temperature , we investigated the sensitivity of granulation-induced RV variations across different photospheric layers. We extracted RVs from various photospheric depths using both the line-by-line (LBL) and cross-correlation function (CCF) methods to mitigate any extraction method biases. Our findings indicate that granulation variability is detectable in both temperature bins, with the cooler bins, corresponding to the shallower layers of the photosphere, aligning more closely with predicted values.</description>
