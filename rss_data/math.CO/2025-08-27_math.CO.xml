      <title>Alternating odd cycles and orientations of Kneser-like graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We call an oriented odd cycle alternating if it has exactly one vertex whose in-degree and out-degree are both positive. In this paper, we investigate whether certain graphs admit an orientation that avoids alternating odd cycles as subgraphs, or one in which all their shortest odd cycles become alternating. Our focus is on topologically $\chi$-chromatic graphs, that is, graphs for which the topological method yields a sharp lower bound on the chromatic number. We present results for several graph families, including Kneser graphs, Schrijver graphs, and generalized Mycielski graphs.</description>

      <title>Strong binding numbers and factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a simple graph. The $k$-th neighborhood of a vertex subset $S \subseteq V(G)$, denoted $\Lambda^k(S)$, is the set of vertices that are adjacent to at least $k$ vertices in $S$. The $k$-th binding number $\beta^k(G)$ is defined as the minimum ratio $|\Lambda^k(S)|/|S|$ over all subsets $S \subseteq V(G)$ with $|S| \ge k$ and $\Lambda^k(S) \ne V(G)$. This parameter generalizes the classical binding number introduced by Woodall. Andersen showed that the condition $\beta^1(G) \ge 1$ does not guarantee the existence of a $1$-factor in $G$, while Bar\'at et al. proved that $\beta^2(G) \ge 1$ suffices for the existence of a $2$-factor. In this paper, we extend this result to general $k \ge 2$ by showing that any graph $G$ with even $k|V(G)|$ and $\beta^k(G) \ge 1$ contains a $k$-factor. Moreover, if $G$ is additionally a split graph of even order, then it admits a $(k+1)$-factor. We also prove that any graph $G$ with $\beta^k(G) \ge 1$ contains at least $k-1$ disjoint perfect or near-perfect matchings. Finally, for any bipartite graph $G$ with bipartition $(X, Y)$, we introduce an analogue of the $k$-th binding number and show that, under the condition $\beta^k(G, X) \ge 1$, the graph admits $k$ disjoint matchings, each covering $X$.</description>

      <title>Sums of algebraic dilates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that if $\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_k$ are algebraic numbers, then $$|A+\lambda_1\cdot A+\dots+\lambda_k\cdot A|\geq H(\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_k)|A|-o(|A|)$$ for all finite subsets $A$ of $\mathbb{C}$, where $H(\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_k)$ is an explicit constant that is best possible. The proof combines several ingredients, including a lower bound estimate on the measure of sums of linear transformations of compact sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$, a variant of Freiman's theorem tuned specifically to sums of dilates and the analysis of what we call lattice density, which succinctly captures how a subset of $\mathbb{Z}^d$ is arranged relative to a given flag of lattices. As an application, we revisit the study of sums of linear transformations of finite sets, in particular proving an asymptotically best possible lower bound for sums of two linear transformations.</description>

      <title>An ${\mathfrak S}_3$-cover of $K_4$ and integral polyhedral graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the star graph defined as the Cayley graph of ${\mathfrak S}_{n+1}$ generated by the star transpositions is an ${\mathfrak S}_n$-cover of the complete graph $K_{n+1}$, which is known to have fine spectral properties. In the case $n = 3$, the star graph also has fine geometric properties: it embeds into the honeycomb lattice and has a spectrum computable via both representation theory and an explicit Fourier formula. Intermediate covers correspond to the cube and truncated tetrahedron, offering a new interpretation of their integral spectra.</description>

      <title>Big Varchenko-Gelfand rings and orbit harmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathscr{M}$ be a conditional oriented matroid. We define a graded algebra $\widehat{\mathscr{VG}}_\mathscr{M}$ with vector space dimension given by the number of covectors in $\mathscr{M}$ which admits a distinguished filtration indexed by the poset $\mathscr{L}(\mathscr{M})$ of flats of $\mathscr{M}$. The subquotients of this filtration are isomorphic to graded Varchenko-Gelfand rings of contractions of $\mathscr{M}$, so we call $\widehat{\mathscr{VG}}_\mathscr{M}$ the {\em graded big Varchenko-Gelfand ring of $\mathscr{M}$.} We describe a no broken circuit type basis of $\widehat{\mathscr{VG}}_\mathscr{M}$ and study its equivariant structure under the action of $\mathrm{Aut}(\mathscr{M})$. Our key technique is the orbit harmonics deformation which encodes $\widehat{\mathscr{VG}}_\mathscr{M}$ (as well as the classical Varchenko-Gelfand ring) in terms of a locus of points.</description>

      <title>Existence and nonexistence of spherical $5$-designs of minimal type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the existence and properties of spherical $5$-designs of minimal type. We focus on two cases: tight spherical $5$-designs and antipodal spherical $4$-distance $5$-designs. We prove that a tight spherical $5$-design is of minimal type if and only if it possesses a specific $Q$-polynomial coherent configuration structure. For tight spherical $5$-designs in $\mathbb{R}^d$ of minimal type, we demonstrate that half of the derived code forms an equiangular tight frames (ETF) with parameters $(d-1, \frac{(d-1)(d+1)}{3})$. This provides a sufficient condition for constructing such ETFs from maximal ETFs with parameters $(d, \frac{d(d+1)}{2})$. Moreover, we establish that tight spherical $5$-designs of minimal type cannot exist if the dimension $d$ satisfies a certain arithmetic condition, which holds for infinitely many values of $d$, including $d=119$ and $527$. For antipodal spherical $4$-distance $5$-designs, we utilize valency theory to derive necessary conditions for certain special types of antipodal spherical $4$-distance $5$-designs to be of minimal type.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic enumeration of graph factors by cumulant expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a dense graph with good expansion properties and not too close to being bipartite. Let $\boldsymbol d$ be a graphical degree sequence. Under very weak conditions, we find the number of subgraphs of $G$ with degree sequence $\boldsymbol d$ to arbitrary precision. The average degree can be any power of $n$ and the variation in degrees can be very large. The method uses an explicit bound on the tail of the cumulant generating function found by the first author. As a first application, we prove that there is an asymptotic expansion for the number of regular graphs and find several terms explicitly. We believe that this is the first combinatorial application of the Fourier inversion method for which the integral outside the dominant regions cannot be bounded by the integral of the absolute value, and we give a general method for dealing with that situation.</description>

      <title>Hoffman colorability of (strongly) regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hoffman's bound is a well-known eigenvalue bound on the chromatic number of a graph. By interpreting this bound as a parameter, we show multiple applications of colorings attaining the bound (Hoffman colorings) for several notions of graph regularity: regular, (co-)edge-regular, and strongly regular. For strongly regular graphs, we prove that Hoffman colorability implies pseudo-geometricity, and we strengthen Haemers' finiteness result on strongly regular graphs with a bounded chromatic number by considering the Hoffman bound instead of the chromatic number. Furthermore, by using Hoffman colorings we show that a sufficient condition for non-unique vector colorability shown by Godsil, Roberson, Rooney, \v{S}\'amal and Varvitsiotis [European J. Combin. 79, 2019] can be relaxed in the setting of strongly regular graphs. Lastly, using Hoffman colorings we derive several new characterizations of the mentioned graph regularity notions.</description>

      <title>$k$-fold circuits and coning in rigidity matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1980 Lov\'{a}sz introduced the concept of a double circuit in a matroid. The 2nd, 3rd and 4th authors recently generalised this notion to $k$-fold circuits (for any natural number $k$) and proved foundational results about these $k$-fold circuits. In this article we use $k$-fold circuits to derive new results on the generic $d$-dimensional rigidity matroid $\mathcal{R}_d$. These results include analysing 2-sums, showing sufficient conditions for the $k$-fold circuit property to hold for $k$-fold $\mathcal{R}_d$-circuits, and giving an extension of Whiteley's coning lemma. The last of these allows us to reduce the problem of determining if a graph $G$ with a vertex $v$ of sufficiently high degree is independent in $\mathcal{R}_d$ to that of verifying matroidal properties of $G-v$ in $\mathcal{R}_{d-1}$.</description>

      <title>Ehrhart non-positivity and unimodular triangulations for classes of s-lecture hall simplices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Counting lattice points and triangulating polytopes is a prominent subject in discrete geometry, yet proving Ehrhart positivity or existence of unimodular triangulations remain of utmost difficulty in general, even for ``easy'' simplices. We study these questions for classes of s-lecture hall simplices. Inspired by a question of Olsen, we present a new natural class of sequences s for which the s-lecture hall simplices are not Ehrhart positive, by explicitly estimating a negative coefficient. Meanwhile, motivated by a conjecture of Hibi, Olsen and Tsuchiya, we extend the previously known classes of sequences s for which the s-lecture hall simplex admits a flag, regular and unimodular triangulation. The triangulations we construct are explicit.</description>

      <title>Vertex-partitions of 2-edge-colored graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A {\bf $\mathbf{k}$-majority coloring} of a digraph $D=(V,A)$ is a coloring of $V$ with $k$ colors so that each vertex $v\in V$ has at least as many out-neighbours of color different from its own color as it has out-neighbours with the same color as itself.
  Majority colorings have received much attention in the last years and many interesting open problems remain.
  Inspired by this and the fact that digraphs can be modelled via 2-edge-colored graphs we study several problems concerning vertex partitions of 2-edge-colored graphs. In particular we study vertex partitions with the property that for each $c=1,2$ every vertex $v$ has least as many edges of colour $c$ to vertices outside the set it belongs to as it has to vertices inside its own set. We call such a vertex partition with $k$ sets a {\bf $\mathbf{k}$-majority partition. Among other things we show that every 2-edge-coloured graph has a 4-majority partition and that it is NP-complete to decide whether a 2-edge-coloured graph has a 3-majority partition. We also apply probabilistic tools to show that every $2$-edge-colored graph $G$ of minimum color-degree $\delta$ and maximum degree $\Delta \le \frac{e^{\delta/18}}{9\delta}-2$ has a balanced majority $3$-partition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chung and Graham~[J. London Math. Soc., 1983] claimed that there exists an $n$-vertex graph $G$ containing all $n$-vertex trees as subgraphs that has at most \( \frac{5}{2}n \log_2 n + O(n)\) edges. We identify an error in their proof. This error can be corrected by adding more edges, which increases the number of edges to \( e(G) \le \frac{7}{2}n \log_2 n + O(n). \) Moreover, we further improve this by showing that there exists such an $n$-vertex graph with at most \( \left(5- \frac{1}{3}\right)n \log_3 n + O(n) \leq 2.945 \cdot n\log_2(n)\) edges. This is the first improvement of the bound since Chung and Graham's pioneering work four decades ago.</description>

      <title>On four-rich points defined by pencils</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the number of four-rich points defined by pencils of certain algebraic objects. Our main result concerns the number of four-rich points defined by four sheaves of planes; under certain non-degeneracy conditions, we prove that four sheaves of $n$ planes in $\mathbb P^3$ determine at most $O(n^{8/3})$ four-rich points. We prove this using the four dimensional Elekes-Szab\'{o} theorem. Using the same method, we prove an upper bound on the number of four-rich points determined by four sets of concentric spheres in $\mathbb C^3$. Furthermore, using the same technique with the 3-d Elekes-Szab\'{o} theorem, one can prove upper bounds on four-rich points determined by various configurations of lines/circles in the plane $\mathbb C^2$; we give one such example, involving two pencils of lines and two pencils of concentric circles in $\mathbb C^2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give two new constructions of the harmonic algebra of a lattice polytope $P$, a bigraded algebra whose character is the $q$-Ehrhart series of $P$ defined by Reiner and Rhoades. First, we show that the harmonic algebra is the associated graded algebra of the semigroup algebra of $P$ with respect to a certain natural filtration, clarifying it's relationship with the more classical semigroup algebra. We then give a geometric interpretation of the harmonic algebra as a quotient of the ring of global sections of a certain family of line bundles on the blowup of the toric variety associated to $P$ at a generic point. Using this connection to toric geometry we resolve one the main conjectures of Reiner and Rhoades by showing that the harmonic algebra is not finitely generated in general.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphlets are small subgraphs rooted at a fixed vertex. The number of occurrences of graphlets aligned to a particular vertex, called graphlet degree sequence, gives a topological description of the surrounding of the analyzed vertex. In this article, we study properties and uniqueness of graphlet degree sequences. The information given by graphlets up to size (n-1) is utilized graphs having certain type of asymmetric vertex-deleted subgraphs. Moreover, we show a reconstruction of trees from their (&lt;= n-1)-graphlet degree sequences, which is much easier compared to the standard reconstruction from vertex-deleted subgraphs.</description>

      <title>Local Statistics of the $M_n$-Dimer Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical dimer model is concerned with the (weighted) enumeration of perfect matchings of a graph. An $n$-dimer cover is a multiset of edges that can be realized as the disjoint union of $n$ individual matchings. For a probability measure recently defined by Douglas, Kenyon, and Shi, which we call the $M_n$-dimer model, we study random $n$-dimer covers on bipartite graphs with matrix edge weights and produce formulas for local edge statistics and correlations. We also classify local moves that can be used to simplify the analysis of such graphs.</description>

      <title>Congruences modulo $7$ and $11$ for generalized cubic partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Amdeberhan, Sellers, and Singh introduced the function $a_c(n)$ that counts the number of generalized cubic partitions of $n$, which are partitions of $n$ whose even parts may appear in $c\geq 1$ different colors. Recently, Dockery obtained via modular forms the following isolated congruences modulo $7$ and $11$ for $a_c(n)$, namely $a_5(49n+31)\equiv 0\pmod{7}$ and $a_9(121n+36)\equiv 0\pmod{11}$ for $n\geq 0$. We prove in this short note a generalization of these congruences by employing a result of Ahlgren on the coefficients of a certain product of powers of Euler's product.</description>

      <title>Flipping odd matchings in geometric and combinatorial settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of reconfiguring odd matchings, that is, matchings that cover all but a single vertex. Our reconfiguration operation is a so-called flip where the unmatched vertex of the first matching gets matched, while consequently another vertex becomes unmatched. We consider two distinct settings: the geometric setting, in which the vertices are points embedded in the plane and all occurring odd matchings are crossing-free, and a combinatorial setting, in which we consider odd matchings in general graphs.
  For the latter setting, we provide a complete polynomial time checkable characterization of graphs in which any two odd matchings can be reconfigured into each another. This complements the previously known result that the flip graph is always connected in the geometric setting [Aichholzer, Br\"otzner, Perz, and Schnider. Flips in odd matchings]. In the combinatorial setting, we prove that the diameter of the flip graph, if connected, is linear in the number of vertices. Furthermore, we establish that deciding whether there exists a flip sequence of length $k$ transforming one given matching into another is NP-complete in both the combinatorial and the geometric settings. To prove the latter, we introduce a framework that allows us to transform partial order types into general position with only polynomial overhead. Finally, we demonstrate that when parameterized by the flip distance $k$, the problem is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) in the geometric setting when restricted to convex point sets.</description>

      <title>Universal Matrices for Counting Fibonomial and $C$-nomial Coefficients by their $p$-adic Valuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rowland found a matrix product formula for generating functions counting binomial coefficients by their $p$-adic valuations. A natural generalization of binomial coefficients was introduced by Knuth and Wilf defined by a sequence $C$. We obtain analogous matrix product formulas counting these $C$-nomial coefficients when $C$ is a strong divisibility sequence. Surprisingly, the matrices are universal in the sense that they are independent of $C$. We further extend this product to $C$-multinomial coefficients.</description>

Abstract: A three-dimensional convex body is said to have Rupert's property if its copy can be passed through a straight hole inside that body. In this work we construct a polyhedron which is provably not Rupert, thus we disprove a conjecture from 2017. We also find a polyhedron that is Rupert but not locally Rupert.</description>

      <title>Zero-free sector of the Wronski map on the totally nonnegative Grassmannian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A classical result states that if $f(z)$ is a polynomial of degree at most $n$ with nonnegative coefficients, then $f(z)$ has no zeros in the sector $|\arg(z)| &lt; \frac{\pi}{n}$ of the complex plane, and the bound $\frac{\pi}{n}$ is tight. Motivated by the Shapiro--Shapiro conjecture and related problems in real Schubert calculus, we generalize this result to Wronskians of polynomials. Namely, let $f_1(z), \dots, f_k(z)$ be linearly independent polynomials of degree at most $n$ whose coefficient matrix has all nonnegative $k\times k$ minors (that is, the polynomials span an element of the totally nonnegative Grassmannian in the sense of Lusztig and Postnikov). We show that the Wronskian polynomial $\operatorname{Wr}(f_1, \dots, f_k)$ has no complex zeros in the sector $|\arg(z)| &lt; \frac{\pi}{n}$ (independent of $k$), and the bound $\frac{\pi}{n}$ is tight. Our proof uses classical results of Gantmakher and Krein (1950) and Obreschkoff (1923) on sign variation.</description>

      <title>Borel Polychromatic Number of Grids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Borel polychromatic colorings of grid graphs arising from free Borel actions of $\mathbb{Z}^d$. A polychromatic coloring is one in which every unit $d$-dimensional cube sees all available colors. In the classical setting, every grid admits a $2^d$-polychromatic coloring, while in the Borel setting this fails. Our main result shows that every free $\mathbb{Z}^d$-action admits a Borel $(2^d-1)$-polychromatic coloring. This result is sharp: any action where the generators act ergodically does not admit a Borel $2^d$-polychromatic coloring. We conclude with open directions for extending the theory beyond cube tilings and for exploring the dependence of Borel polychromatic numbers on the underlying action.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic root distribution of polynomials under repeated polar differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a sequence of real rooted polynomials $\{p_n\}_{n\geq 1}$ with a fixed asymptotic root distribution, we study the asymptotic root distribution of the repeated polar derivatives of this sequence. This limiting distribution can be seen as the result of fractional free convolution and pushforward maps along M\"obius transforms for distributions. This new family of operations on measures forms a semigroup and satisfy some other nice properties. Using the fact that polar derivatives commute with one another, we obtain a non-trivial commutation relation between these new operations. We also study a notion of polar free infinite divisibility and construct Belinschi-Nica type semigroups. Finally, we provide some interesting examples of distributions that behave nicely with respect to these new operations, including the Marchenko-Pastur and the Cauchy distributions.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Approaches to Exceptional Sequences for Weighted Projective Lines of Type $(p,q)$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a combinatorial description of morphisms in the coherent sheaf category ${\rm coh}\mbox{-}\mathbb{X}(p,q)$ over weighted projective line of type $(p,q)$ via a marked annulus. This leads to a geometric realization of exceptional sequences in ${\rm coh}\mbox{-}\mathbb{X}(p,q)$. As applications, we present a classification of complete exceptional sequences, an effective method for enlarging exceptional sequences, and a new proof of the transitivity of the braid group action on complete exceptional sequences. Besides, we offer a combinatorial description of tilting bundles via lattice paths and count the number of tilting sheaves in ${\rm coh}\mbox{-}\mathbb{X}(p,q)$, up to the Auslander-Reiten translation.</description>

      <title>Fans and polytopes in tilting theory III: Classification of convex $g$-fans of rank 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $g$-fan $\Sigma(A)$ of a finite dimensional algebra $A$ is a non-singular fan in its real Grothendieck group, defined by tilting theory. If the union ${\rm P}(A)$ of the simplices associated with the cones of $\Sigma(A)$ is convex, we call $A$ $g$-convex. In this case, the $g$-polytope ${\rm P}(A)$ of $A$ is a reflexive polytope. Thus, in each dimension, there are only finitely many isomorphism classes of fans that can be realized as $g$-fans of $g$-convex algebras. An important problem is to classify such fans for a fixed dimension $d$. In this paper, we give a complete answer for the case $d=3$: we prove that there are precisely 61 convex $g$-fans of dimension 3 up to isomorphism. Our method is based on the decomposition of fans into the $2^3$ orthants in the real Grothendieck group of $A$, together with a detailed analysis of possible sequences of $g$-vectors arising from iterated mutations.</description>

      <title>Max-Min and 1-Bounded Space Algorithms for the Bin Packing Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the (1-dimensional) bin packing problem, we are asked to pack all the given items into bins, each of capacity one, so that the number of non-empty bins is minimized. Zhu~[Chaos, Solitons \&amp; Fractals 2016] proposed an approximation algorithm $MM$ that sorts the item sequence in a non-increasing order by size at the beginning, and then repeatedly packs, into the current single open bin, first as many of the largest items in the remaining sequence as possible and then as many of the smallest items in the remaining sequence as possible. In this paper we prove that the asymptotic approximation ratio of $MM$ is at most 1.5. Next, focusing on the fact that $MM$ is at the intersection of two algorithm classes, max-min algorithms and 1-bounded space algorithms, we comprehensively analyze the theoretical performance bounds of each subclass derived from the two classes. Our results include a lower bound of 1.25 for the intersection of the two classes. Furthermore, we extend the theoretical analysis over algorithm classes to the cardinality constrained bin packing problem.</description>

      <title>Power maps on General Linear groups over finite principal ideal local rings of length two</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Word maps have been studied for matrix groups over a field. We initiate the study of problems related to word maps in the context of the group $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathscr O_2)$, where $\mathscr O_2$ is a finite local principal ideal ring of length two (e.g. $\mathbb{Z}/p^2\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb F_q[t]/\langle t^2\rangle$). We study the power map $g\mapsto g^L$, where $L$ is a positive integer. We consider $L$ to be coprime to $p$ (an odd prime), the characteristic of the residue field $k$ of $\mathscr O_2$. We classify all the elements in the image, whose mod-$\mathfrak m$ reduction in $\mathrm{GL}_n(k)$ are either regular semisimple or cyclic, where $\mathfrak m$ is the unique maximal ideal of $\mathscr O_2$. Our main tool is a Hensel lifting for polynomial equations over $\mathrm{M}_n(\mathscr O_2)$, which we establish in this work.
  A central contribution of this work is the construction of canonical forms for certain natural classes of matrices over $\mathscr O_2$. As applications, we derive explicit generating functions for the probabilities that a random element of $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathscr O_2)$ is regular semisimple, $L$-power regular semisimple, compatible cyclic, or $L$-power compatible cyclic.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the notion of intersective polynomials over the Gaussian integers, and prove that given any intersective polynomial $p(x)$ over the Gaussian integers, every subset $A$ of the Gaussian integers of positive upper density contains two distinct elements such that their difference is $p(z)$ for some Gaussian integer $z$. Moreover, we also obtain a quantitative version of this result. The proof is motivated by an argument due to Lucier, and the Fourier-free proof of the Furstenberg--S\'{a}rk\"{o}zy theorem over the integers by Green, Tao and Ziegler.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A practical approach is proposed to construct short presentations for Euclidean crystallographic groups in terms of generators and relations. For our purposes a short presentation is the one with a small number of short relators for a given generating set. The connection is emphasized between relators of a group presentation and cycles in the associated Cayley graph. It is shown by examples that a short presentation is usually the one where relators correspond to strong rings in the Cayley graph and therefore provide a natural upper bound for their size. Presentations are computed for vertex-transitive groups which act with trivial vertex stabilizers on a number of high-symmetry 2-, 3- and 4-periodic graphs. Higher-dimensional as well as subperiodic examples are also considered. Relations are explored between geodesics in periodic graphs and corresponding cycles in their quotients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02528v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In their study of the giant component in inhomogeneous random graphs, Bollob\'as, Janson, and Riordan introduced a class of branching processes parametrized by a possibly unbounded graphon. We prove that the tree structures underlying two such branching processes have the same distributions if and only if the corresponding graphons are fractionally isomorphic, a notion introduced by Greb\'ik and Rocha.
  A different class of branching processes was introduced by Hladk\'y, Nachmias, and Tran in relation to uniform spanning trees in finite graphs approximating a given connected graphon. We prove that that the tree structures of two such branching processes have the same distributions if and only if the corresponding graphons are fractionally isomorphic up to scalar multiple. Combined with a recent result of Archer and Shalev, this implies that if uniform spanning trees of two dense graphs have a similar local structure, they have a similar scaling limit.
  As a side result we give a characterization of fractional isomorphism for graphs as well as graphons in terms of their connected components.</description>

      <title>Solutions for $k$-generalized Fibonacci numbers using Fuss-Catalan numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07922v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present new expressions for the $k$-generalized Fibonacci numbers, say $F_k(n)$. They satisfy the recurrence $F_k(n) = F_k(n-1) +\dots+F_k(n-k)$. Explicit expressions for the roots of the auxiliary (or characteristic) polynomial are presented, using Fuss-Catalan numbers. Properties of the roots are enumerated. We quantify the accuracy of asymptotic approximations for $F_k(n)$ for $n\gg1$. Our results subsume and extend some results published by previous authors. We also present a basis (or `fundamental solutions') to solve the above recurrence for arbitrary initial conditions. We comment on the use of generating functions and multinomial sums for the $k$-generalized Fibonacci numbers and related sequences. We note that the resulting multinomial sums are Dickson polynomials of the second kind in several variables. We also present what may be a new identity for companion matrices.</description>

      <title>Hook-valued tableaux uncrowding and tableau switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Refined canonical stable Grothendieck polynomials were introduced by Hwang, Jang, Kim, Song, and Song. There exist two combinatorial models for these polynomials: one using hook-valued tableaux and the other using pairs of a semistandard Young tableau and (what we call) an exquisite tableau. An uncrowding algorithm on hook-valued tableaux was introduced by Pan, Pappe, Poh, and Schilling. In this paper, we discover a novel connection between the two models via the uncrowding and Goulden--Greene's jeu de taquin algorithms, using a classical result of Benkart, Sottile, and Stroomer on tableau switching. This connection reveals a symmetry of the uncrowding algorithm defined on hook-valued tableaux. As a corollary, we obtain another combinatorial model for the refined canonical stable Grothendieck polynomials in terms of biflagged tableaux, which naturally appear in the characterization of the image of the uncrowding map.</description>

      <title>Prime Multiple Missing Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02529v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The famous Goldbach conjecture remains open for nearly three centuries. Recently Goldbach graphs are introduced to relate the problem with the literature of Graph Theory. It is shown that the connectedness of the graphs is equivalent to the affirmative answer of the conjecture. Some modified version of the graphs, say, near Goldbach graphs are shown to be Hamiltonian for small number of vertices. In this context, we introduce a class of graphs, namely, prime multiple missing graphs such that near Goldbach graphs are finite intersections of these graphs. We study these graphs for primes 3,5 and in general for any odd prime p. We prove that these graphs are connected with diameter at most 3 and Hamiltonian for even (&gt;2) vertices. Next the intersection of prime multiple missing graphs for primes 3 and 5 are studied. We prove that these graphs are connected with diameter at most 4 and they are also Hamiltonian for even (&gt;2) vertices. We observe that the diameters of finite Goldbach graphs and near Goldbach graphs are bounded by 5 (up to 10000 vertices). We believe further study on these graphs with big data analysis will help to understand structures of near Goldbach graphs.</description>

      <title>Eulerian magnitude homology: diagonality, injective words, and regular path homology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we explore the algebraic structure and combinatorial properties of eulerian magnitude homology. First, we analyze the diagonality conditions of eulerian magnitude homology, providing a characterization of complete graphs. Then, we construct the regular magnitude-path spectral sequence as the spectral sequence of the (filtered) injective nerve of the reachability category, and explore its consequences. Among others, we show that such spectral sequence converges to the complex of injective words on a digraph, and yields characterization results for the regular path homology of diagonal directed graphs.</description>

      <title>On likelihood of a Condorcet winner for uniformly random and independent voter preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20613v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a mathematical model of voting contest with $m$ voters and $n$ candidates, with each voter ranking the candidates in order of preference, without ties. A Condorcet winner is a candidate who gets more than $m/2$ votes in pairwise contest with every other candidate. An ``impartial culture'' setting is the case when each voter chooses his/her candidate preference list uniformly at random from all $n!$ preferences, and does it independently of all other voters. For impartial culture case, Robert May and Lisa Sauermann showed that when $m=2k-1$ is fixed ($k=2$ and $k&gt;2$ respectively), and $n$ grows indefinitely, the probability of a Condorcet winner is small, of order $n^{-(k-1)/k}$. We show that when $m$ grows indefinitely and $m\gg n^4$, the probability of a Condercet winner is of order n^{-1}\log^{1/2}n \cdot \log\log n, thus converges to zero.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spinor-helicity formalism in particle physics gives rise to natural subvarieties in the product of two Grassmannians. These include two-step flag varieties for subspaces of complementary dimension. Taking Hadamard products leads to Mandelstam varieties. We study these varieties through the lens of combinatorics and commutative algebra, and we explore their tropicalization, positive geometry, and scattering correspondence.</description>

      <title>Strict inequalities for arm exponents in planar percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss a general method to prove quantitative improvements on correlation inequalities and apply it to arm estimates for Bernoulli bond percolation on the square lattice. Our first result is that the two-arm exponent is strictly larger than twice the one-arm exponent and can be seen as a quantitative improvement on the Harris-FKG inequality. This answers a question of Garban and Steif, which was motivated by the study of exceptional times in dynamical percolation. Our second result is that the monochromatic arm exponents are strictly larger than their polychromatic versions, and can be seen as a quantitative improvement on Reimer's main lemma. This second result is not new and was already proved by Beffara and Nolin using a different argument.</description>

      <title>Hodge-Riemann polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16992v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that Schur classes of ample vector bundles on smooth projective varieties satisfy Hodge-Riemann relations on $H^{p,q}$ under the assumption that $H^{p-2,q-2}$ vanishes. More generally, we study Hodge-Riemann polynomials, which are partially symmetric polynomials that produce cohomology classes satisfying the Hodge-Riemann property when evaluated at Chern roots of ample vector bundles. In the case of line bundles and in bidegree $(1,1)$, these are precisely the nonzero dually Lorentzian polynomials. We prove various properties of Hodge-Riemann polynomials, confirming predictions and answering questions of Ross and Toma. As an application, we show that the derivative sequence of any product of Schur polynomials is Schur log-concave, confirming conjectures of Ross and Wu.</description>
