      <title>On Diffeology of Orbit Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the correspondence between the geometry of a smooth compact Lie group action on a manifold $\mathrm{M}$ and the intrinsic smooth structure of the orbit space $\mathrm{M}/\mathrm{G}$. While the action on $\mathrm{M}$ is classically organized by the orbit-type stratification, we show this structure fails to predict the intrinsic $Klein\ stratif\!ication$ of the quotient, which partitions the space into the orbits of local diffeomorphisms, thereby classifying the space by its intrinsic singularity types. The correct correspondence, we prove, is governed by a finer partition on $\mathrm{M}$: the $isostabilizer\ decomposition$. We establish a surjective map from the components of this partition to the Klein strata of $\mathrm{M}/\mathrm{G}$. As a corollary, we obtain by pullback a new canonical stratification on $\mathrm{M}$, the $Inverse\ Klein\ Stratif\!ication$, and clarify its relationship with classical structures.</description>

      <title>Extrinsic Characterisations of Immersions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We outline the history of the idea of deformation of space, which lead to the concept of curvature invariants, as we understand them today, including contributions of E. Bacaloglu and F. Casorati, among others. We pursue the following question: what is the best way to quantify the deformation of space? This important question could be viewed in a new paradigm after 1956, when John F. Nash, Jr. proved that a Riemannian manifold can be immersed isometrically into an Euclidean ambient space of dimension sufficiently large. This important theorem allowed to view the representation of space from its exterior, from an outside perspective. In 1968, S.-S. Chern pointed out that a key technical element in applying Nash's Theorem effectively is finding useful relationships between intrinsic and extrinsic quantities characterising immersions. And such relations seem to be rather few, at least few enough to present us with a technical challenge in applying Nash's Theorem. One technical difficulty is presented by the passing through the narrow gateway provided by Gauss' equation, and that's why in order to obtain some new results it might be useful to include additional natural conditions. A turning point in the history of the question we pursue was an enlightening paper written by B.-Y. Chen in 1993, which paved the way for a deeper understanding of the meaning of the Riemannian inequalities between intrinsic and extrinsic quantities. Our present discussion invites a reflection on whether we could hope to characterise submanifolds by using mainly extrinsic quantities.</description>

      <title>On a sharp form of curvature conjecture for minimal graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the author and Melentijevi\'c resolved the longstanding Gaussian curvature problem by proving the sharp inequality \[ |\mathcal{K}| &lt; c_0 = \frac{\pi^2}{2} \] for minimal graphs over the unit disk, evaluated at the point of the graph lying directly above the origin. The constant \( c_0 \) is known as the \emph{Heinz constant}. Building on this result, we obtain an improved estimate for the Hopf constant \( c_1 \). In addition, we show that for any prescribed unit normal vector \( \mathbf{n} \), there exists a minimal graph over the unit disk -- bending in the coordinate directions -- whose Gaussian curvature at the point above the origin is strictly smaller, yet arbitrarily close to, the curvature of the associated Scherk-type surface with the same normal, situated above a bicentric quadrilateral. This sharp inequality strengthens the classical result of Finn and Osserman, which applies in the special case when the unit normal is \( (0,0,1) \).</description>

      <title>Gauge theory on $T^*CP^2$: explicit Sp(2)-instantons, HYM connections, and Spin(7)-instantons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct and classify $SU(3)$-invariant primitive Hermitian Yang-Mills connections and $Sp(2)$-instantons with gauge groups $S = S^1$ and $S = SO(3)$ over the Calabi manifold $X = T^*CP^2$, the unique non-flat, complete, cohomogeneity-one hyperkahler 8-manifold. Moreover, in the case of $S = S^1$, we also classify the $SU(3)$-invariant $Spin(7)$-instantons over $X$ in the following sense. Letting $\Phi_I$, $\Phi_J$, $\Phi_K$ denote the $Spin(7)$-structures on $X$ induced from the complex structures $I$, $J$, $K$ in the hyperkahler triple, we prove that on each invariant $S^1$-bundle $\widetilde{E}_k \to X$, $k \in \mathbb{Z}$, the space of invariant $Spin(7)$-instantons with respect to $\Phi_L$ forms a one-parameter family modulo gauge. Moreover, every pair of one-parameter families of $\Phi_I$-, $\Phi_J$-, and $\Phi_K$-$Spin(7)$-instantons intersects only at the unique invariant $Sp(2)$-instanton on $\widetilde{E}_k$, which is non-flat when $k \neq 0$.</description>

      <title>Remark on quasi-negative $k$-Ricci curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we show that if $X$ is a compact K\"ahler manifold with $k$-quasi-negative Ricci curvature, then $K_X$ is ample. This completes a previous result of Chu-Lee-Tam. The key ingredient is an observation that any rational curve $C$ on $X$ satisfy $K_X\cdot C&gt;0$ based on the Gauss-Codazzi equation.</description>

      <title>Extension of a problem of Euler in Lorentz-Minkowski plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study curves in Lorentz-Minkowski space $\mathbb{L}^2$ that are critical points of the moment of inertia with respect to the origin. This extends a problem posed by Euler in the Lorentzian setting. We obtain explicit solutions for stationary curves in $\mathbb{L}^2$ distinguishing if the curve is spacelike or timelike. We also give a method to carry stationary spacelike curves into stationary timelike curves and vice versa via symmetries and inversions about the lightlike cone. Finally, we solve the problem of maximizing the energy among all spacelike curves joining two given points which are collinear with the origin.</description>

      <title>Classification of ruled surfaces in Lorentz-Minkowski space that are stationary for the moment of inertia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study hypersurfaces in Lorentz-Minkowski space $\mathbb{L}^{n+1}$ that are stationary for the moment of inertia with respect to the origin. After giving examples and applications of the maximum principle, we classify, in $\mathbb{L}^3$, all stationary surfaces that are ruled surfaces. We prove that planes are the only cylindrical stationary surfaces. If the surface is not cylindrical, the classification depends on the causal character of the rulings. In addition, we provide explicit parametrizations of all ruled stationary surfaces.</description>

      <title>Invariant $\lambda$-translators for the Gauss curvature flow in Euclidean space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $\lambda$-translator is a surface in Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^3$ whose Gauss curvature $K$ satisfies $K=\langle N, \vec{v} \rangle +\lambda$, where $N$ is the Gauss map, $\vec{v}$ is a fixed direction, and $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$. In this paper, we classify all $\lambda$-translators that are invariant by a one-parameter group of translations and a one-parameter group of rotations.</description>

      <title>Vector field cycles in the tangent bundle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a closed Riemannian manifold $(M^m,g)$ and a vector field $v$ on $M$, we form the Sasaki metric $g_S$ on $TM$, and restrict it to the image of the cross section map of $M$ into $TM$ defined by $v$, whose pull back to $M$ defines a new metric $g(v)$ on $M$. We then view the cross section as an isometric embedding $f_{g(v)}: (M,g(v))\rightarrow (TM,g_S)$, which when $\| v\|_g=1$, ranges into the unit sphere bundle $(S^1(TM),g_S)$. $v$ is minimal or minimal unit if these embeddings have null mean curvature vectors, conditions that occur if, $v$ is in the kernel or is an eigenvector, respectively, of a first order perturbation of a weighted rough Laplacian, the weights and perturbation determined by the covariant derivatives $\nabla^g_{e}v$ along unit directions $e$ in suitable normal frames that include $v$ when $\| v\|_g=1$, and curvature tensor of $g$. A minimal unit field must be Killing, and other than parallel fields, $v=0$ is the only minimal one. We characterize the minimal unit vector fields on the standard sphere $(\mb{S}^{2n+1},g) \hookrightarrow (\mb{R}^{2n+2},\| \, \|^2)$ as those defining contact strictly pseudoconvex CR structures whose Levi form and sign are determined by $g$ and the orientation. If $\Theta_{f_{g(v)}}(M)$ and $\Phi_{f_{g(v)}}(M)$ are the total exterior scalar curvature and squared $L^2$ norm of the mean curvature vector functionals, and $m&gt;2$, a canonical cycle $f_{g(v)}(M)$ is a critical point of the functional $(m/m-1) \Theta_{f_{g(v)}}(M) +\Phi_{f_{g(v)}}(M)$ under conformal deformations, notion conveniently defined also when $m\leq 2$. The zero section of $TM$ is a canonical cycle if, and only if, the scalar curvature of $g$ is constant. We describe some examples of these vector fields and cycles, and analyze their deformations under dilations of the field.</description>

      <title>Groupoids in Diffeology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This expository paper recounts the development and application of the concept of the diffeological groupoid, from its introduction in 1985 to its use in current research. We demonstrate how this single concept has served as a powerful and unifying tool for defining fundamental structures, analyzing the stratification of complex spaces like orbifolds, building a bridge to noncommutative geometry, and, most recently, forging new approaches to geometric quantization. The paper aims to provide a cohesive narrative of this journey, making explicit certain concepts like the "Klein groupoid" and showcasing the enduring vitality of the diffeological groupoid in modern geometry and physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an elementary proof that, for a closed manifold with an integral-integral affine structure, its total volume and number of integral points coincide. This theorem was previously shown to be equivalent to the "independence of polarization" phenomenon of geometric quantization. The proof uses rational Ehrhart theory and elementary Fourier analysis to estimate the difference between the total volume and the number of integral points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent interest of geometers in the $f$-structures of K. Yano (1961) is motivated by the study of the dynamics of contact foliations, as well as their applications in theoretical physics. Weak metric $f$-structures on a smooth manifold, introduced by of the author and R. Wolak (2022), open a new perspective on the theory of classical structures. In the paper, we define structures of this kind, called weak nearly ${\cal S}$- and weak nearly ${\cal C}$- structures, study their geometry, e.g. their relations to Killing vector fields, and characterize weak nearly ${\cal S}$- and weak nearly ${\cal S}$- submanifolds in a weak nearly K\"{a}hler manifold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the asymptotics of shortest filling closed multi-geodesics of closed hyperbolic surfaces as systole $\to 0$ or as genus $\to \infty$. We first show that for a closed hyperbolic surface $X_g$ of genus $g$, the length of a shortest filling closed multi-geodesic of $X_g$ is uniformly comparable to $$\left(g+\sum\limits_{\textit{closed geodesic }\gamma\subset X_g, \ \ell(\gamma)&lt;1}\log \left(\frac{1}{\ell(\gamma)}\right)\right).$$ As an application, we show that as $g\to \infty$, a Weil-Petersson random hyperbolic surface has a shortest closed multi-geodesic of length uniformly comparable to $g$. We also show that this is true for a random hyperbolic surface in the Brooks-Makover model.</description>

      <title>Special Lagrangian sections and stability conditions on threefolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a class of Lagrangian submanifolds, given by sections of a special Lagrangian fibration, contained in certain almost Calabi-Yau threefolds (mirrors of polarised toric threefolds satisfying suitable assumptions). We show that, for a Lagrangian section $L$ in this class, the shift $L[2]$ defines an object in the heart of a natural Bridgeland stability condition on the relevant Fukaya-Seidel category, and that if $L[2]$ is semistable with respect to this stability condition, then it is isomorphic to a special Lagrangian. For mirrors of weak Fanos, the central charge of the stability condition is very close to periods of the holomorphic volume form. These results are consistent with Joyce's interpretation of the Thomas-Yau conjecture. As part of the proof we describe a set of line bundles and polarisations on suitable toric threefolds for which semistability with respect to the Bridgeland stability conditions constructed by Bernardara-Macr\`i-Schmidt-Zhao implies the existence of a deformed Hermitian Yang-Mills connection.</description>

      <title>Hot spots on cones and warped product manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study extrema of solutions to the heat equation (i.e. hot spots) on certain types of warped product manifolds of the form $([0,L]\times M,dr^2+f(r)^2h)$ where $(M,h)$ is a closed Riemannian manifold. We prove that, under certain conditions on the warping function $f$, the statement of Rauch's hot spots conjecture holds for the corresponding warped product. We then go on to study the long-time behavior of hot spots on infinite cones over closed Riemannian manifolds. In this case, under appropriate hypotheses on the initial condition, there are four possible long-time behaviors depending only on the spectral gap of the fiber $(M,h)$.</description>

      <title>From graph to Riesz continuity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.03337v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that every graph continuous family of unbounded operators in a Hilbert space becomes Riesz continuous after one-sided multiplication by an appropriate family of unitary operators. This result provides a simple definition of the index for graph continuous families of Fredholm operators, and we show that for such families this index coincides with the index defined by N. Ivanov in arXiv:2111.15081. This result also has two corollaries for operators with compact resolvents: (1) the identity map between the space of such operators with the Riesz topology and the space of such operators with the graph topology is a homotopy equivalence; (2) every graph continuous family of such operators acting between fibers of Hilbert bundles becomes Riesz continuous in appropriate trivializations of the bundles.
  For self-adjoint operators, multiplication by unitary operators should be replaced by conjugation. In general, a graph continuous family of self-adjoint operators with compact resolvents cannot be made Riesz continuous by an appropriate conjugation. We obtain a partial analogue of the "trivialization" result above for self-adjoint operators and describe obstructions to existence of such a trivialization in the general case. This motivates the notion of a polarization of a Hilbert bundle, and we prove a similar result for polarizations. These results are closely related to the recent work arXiv:2111.15081 of Ivanov and provide alternative proofs for some of his results. We then show that, under a minor assumption on the space of parameters and for operators which are neither essentially positive nor essentially negative, there is always a trivialization making the family Riesz continuous.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the geometry and topology of compact submanifolds of arbitrary codimension in space forms satisfying a certain pinching condition involving the length of the second fundamental form and the mean curvature. We prove that this pinching condition either forces homology to vanish in a range of intermediate dimensions, or completely determines the submanifold up to congruence. The results are sharp and extend previous results due to several authors without imposing any further assumption on the mean curvature.</description>

      <title>Volume renormalization of higher-codimension singular Yamabe spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01882v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given an embedded closed submanifold $\Sigma^n$ in the closed Riemannian manifold $M^{n + k}$, where $k &lt; n + 2$, we define extrinsic global conformal invariants of $\Sigma$ by renormalizing the volume associated to the unique singular Yamabe metric with singular set $\Sigma$. In case $n$ is odd, the renormalized volume is an absolute conformal invariant, while if $n$ is even, there is a conformally invariant energy term given by the integral of a local Riemannian submanifold invariant. In particular, the renormalized volume gives a global conformal invariant of a knot embedding in the three-sphere. We compute the variations of these quantities with respect to variations of the submanifold. We extend the construction of energies for even $n$ to general codimension by considering formal solutions to the singular Yamabe problem; except that, for each fixed $n$, there are finitely many $k \geq n + 2$, which we identify, for which the smoothness of the formal solution is obstructed and we obtain instead a pointwise conformal invariant. We compute the new quantities in several cases.</description>

      <title>Hypersurfaces of constant scalar curvature in hyperbolic space with prescribed asymptotic boundary at infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07656v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article concerns a natural generalization of the classical asymptotic Plateau problem in hyperbolic space. We prove the existence of a smooth complete hypersurface of constant scalar curvature with a prescribed asymptotic boundary at infinity. The desired hypersurface is constructed as the limit of constant scalar curvature graphs (with respect to vertical geodesics) over a fixed compact domain in a horosphere, and the problem is thus reduced to solving a Dirichlet problem for a fully nonlinear elliptic partial differential equation which is degenerate along the boundary. Previously, the result was known only for a restricted range of curvature values. Now, in this article, by introducing some new techniques, we are able to solve the Dirichlet problem for all possible curvature values. The main ingredient is the establishment of the crucial second order a priori estimates for admissible solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03882v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Every closed connected Riemannian spin manifold of non-zero $\hat{A}$-genus or non-zero Hitchin invariant with non-negative scalar curvature admits a parallel spinor, in particular is Ricci-flat. In this note, we generalize this result to closed connected spin manifolds of non-vanishing Rosenberg index. This provides a criterion for the existence of a parallel spinor on a finite covering and yields that every closed connected Ricci-flat spin manifold of dimension $\geq 2$ with non-vanishing Rosenberg index has special holonomy.</description>

      <title>An extension of Liebmann's Theorem to hypersurfaces with boundary</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03368v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Liebmann's Theorem asserts that a compact, connected, convex surface with constant mean curvature (CMC) in the Euclidean space must be a totally umbilical sphere. In this article we extend Liebmann's result to hypersurfaces with boundary. More precisely, we prove that a locally convex, embedded, compact, connected CMC hypersurface bounded by a closed strictly convex $(n-1)$-dimensional submanifold in a hyperplane $\Pi^n\subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ lies in one of the two halfspace determined by $\Pi$ and inherits the symmetries of the boundary. Consequently, spherical caps are the only such hypersurfaces with non-zero constant mean curvature bounded by a $(n-1)-$sphere.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Morse-Bott volume form on a manifold is a top-degree form which vanishes along a non-degenerate critical submanifold. We prove that two such forms are diffeomorphic (by a diffeomorphism fixed on the submanifold) provided that their relative cohomology classes with respect to the submanifold coincide. For a zero submanifold of codimension at least 2, this means that two Morse-Bott volume forms with the same zero set are diffeomorphic if and only if they have equal total volumes. We show how "Moser's trick" for establishing equivalence of non-degenerate volume forms can be adapted to this setting.</description>

      <title>Partition functions of determinantal point processes on polarized K\"ahler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01524v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the asymptotic expansion of the partition functions of determinantal point processes defined on a polarized K\"ahler manifold. The full asymptotic expansion of the partition functions is derived in two ways: one using Bergman kernel asymptotics and the other using the Quillen anomaly formula along with the asymptotic expansion of the Ray-Singer analytic torsion. By combining these two expressions, we show that each coefficient is given by geometric functionals on K\"ahler metrics satisfying the cocycle identity, and its first variation is closely related to the asymptotic expansion of the Bergman kernel. In particular, these functionals naturally generalize the Mabuchi functional in K\"ahler geometry and the Liouville functional on Riemann surfaces. Furthermore, we show that a Futaki-type holomorphic invariant obstructs the existence of critical points for each geometric functional given by the coefficients of the asymptotic expansion. Finally, we verify some of our results through explicit computations, which hold without the polarization assumption.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian stochastic Lie systems and applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06232v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a practical approach to stochastic Lie systems, i.e. stochastic differential equations whose general solutions can be written as a function depending only on a generic family of particular solutions and some constants related to initial conditions. We correct the stochastic Lie theorem characterising stochastic Lie systems, proving that, contrary to previous claims, it retains its classical form in the Stratonovich approach. Meanwhile, we show that the form of stochastic Lie systems may significantly differ from the classical one in the It\^{o} formalism. New generalisations of stochastic Lie systems, like the so-called stochastic foliated Lie systems, are introduced. Subsequently, we focus on stochastic Lie systems that are Hamiltonian systems relative to different geometric structures. Special attention is paid to the symplectic case. We study their stability properties and lay the foundations of a stochastic energy-momentum method. A stochastic Poisson coalgebra method is developed to derive superposition rules for Hamiltonian stochastic Lie systems. Potential applications of our results are presented for biological stochastic models, stochastic oscillators, stochastic Lotka--Volterra systems, Palomba--Goodwin models, among others. Our findings complement previous approaches by using stochastic differential equations instead of deterministic equations designed to capture some of the features of models of stochastic nature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08396v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study tilings of the plane composed of two repeating tiles of different assigned areas relative to an arbitrary periodic lattice. We classify isoperimetric configurations (i.e., configurations with minimal length of the interfaces) both in the case of a fixed lattice or for an arbitrary periodic lattice. We find three different configurations depending on the ratio between the assigned areas of the two tiles and compute the isoperimetric profile. The three different configurations are composed of tiles with a different number of circular edges, moreover, different configurations exhibit a different optimal lattice. Finally, we raise some open problems related to our investigation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we study the level sets of entire solutions of the Allen-Cahn equation and we prove minimality of the zero level set with respect to a certain perimeter functional with density. This provides a direct relationship between phase transition type problems and minimal surfaces with some weight. In addition, we obtain that the zero level set of entire solutions of the Allen-Cahn equation has zero mean curvature. As an application, we establish the De Giorgi conjecture in it's original statement, without the limiting assumption of O. Savin, by reducing it to classical Bernstein type results for minimal graphs, thus directly linking it to the geometric problem.</description>
