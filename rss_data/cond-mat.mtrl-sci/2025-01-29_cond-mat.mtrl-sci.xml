      <title>Influence of Humidity on the Resistive Switching of Hexagonal Boron Nitride-Based Memristors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional material-based memristors have recently gained attention as components of future neuromorphic computing concepts. However, their surrounding atmosphere can influence their behavior. In this work, we investigate the resistive switching behavior of hexagonal boron nitride-based memristors with active nickel electrodes under vacuum conditions. Our cells exhibit repeatable, bipolar, nonvolatile switching under voltage stress after initial forming, with a switching window &gt; 10${^3}$ under ambient conditions. However, in a vacuum, the forming is suppressed, and hence, no switching is observed. Compact model simulations can reproduce the set kinetics of our cells under ambient conditions and predict highly suppressed resistive switching in a water-deficient environment, supporting the experimental results. Our findings have important implications for the application of h-BN-based memristors with electrochemically active electrodes since semiconductor chips are typically processed under high vacuum conditions and encapsulated to protect them from atmospheric influences.</description>

      <title>Optical coherence and hyperfine structure of the 7F0-5D0 transition in EuCaWO4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare-earth ions doped in crystals with low nuclear-spin densities are highly promising candidates for quantum technology applications. In this study, we investigated the spectroscopic properties of the 7F0 - 5 D0 optical and the hyperfine transitions of Eu3+ ions in a CaWO4 crystal, where the nuclear spin arises solely from the 183W isotope, with a natural abundance of 14%. At a temperature of 3 K, we experimentally identified four distinct crystal field environments for Eu3+ ions in a 0.1 at.% Eu3+ doped CaWO4 crystal. The optical coherence properties of Eu3+ ions in these environments were characterized. Additionally, we resolved the hyperfine structures in the 7F0 ground state and 5D0 excited state, and determined the 7F0 ground state lifetimes using spectral hole-burning techniques. These findings highlight the significant potential of Eu3+:CaWO4 for optical quantum memory applications.</description>

      <title>Electrically tunable Floquet Weyl photon emission from Dirac semimetal Cd3As2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to optically engineer the Dirac band and electrically control the Fermi level in two-dimensional (2D) Dirac systems, such as graphene, has significantly advanced quantum technologies. However, similar tunability has remained elusive in three-dimensional Dirac systems. In this work, we demonstrate both optical and electrical tunability of the band structure in the 3D Dirac semimetal Cd3As2. Photoexcitation with circularly polarized light breaks time-reversal symmetry, lifting the degeneracy at Dirac points to transform the material into a Floquet Weyl semimetal with chiral Weyl nodes. This transition induces nonzero Berry curvature, giving rise to helicity-dependent transverse anomalous photocurrents, detectable through terahertz emission at normal incidence. Furthermore, applying an external electric field displaces the Fermi level away from the Dirac point, enlarging the Dirac cone projection leading to a reduced density of states of Fermi arcs. As a result, we achieve precise electrical control over Floquet band engineering, resulting in a large modulation of THz emission. Moreover, at oblique incidence, the circular photon-drag effect induces helicity-dependent longitudinal photocurrents. Simultaneous generation and manipulation of both longitudinal and transverse photocurrents enable precise control of the helicity of emitted THz pulses. These results pave the way for electric field-controlled Floquet Weyl THz sources, offering significant potential for applications in quantum computing and low-power electronics.</description>

      <title>Analytical dispersion relation for forward volume spin waves in ferrimagnets near the angular momentum compensation condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic magnonics has become the focus of intense scientific research because of the advantages of these materials compared to ferromagnets. However, ferrimagnetic materials have received much less attention despite exhibiting similar dynamical features at the angular momentum compensation point. In this paper, we present analytical expressions describing the dispersion relation of forward volume spin waves in ferrimagnetic materials near the angular momentum compensation point. Besides, we benchmark the derived dispersion relations with full micromagnetic simulations showing a complete agreement between both approaches. This work predicts two different branches for forward volume spin waves in ferrimagnetic materials merging into a single branch at the angular momentum compensation point. Our results can assist in the design of magnonic devices built on ferrimagnetic materials.</description>

      <title>How to properly measure the fracture properties of brittle materials using molecular simulations? Application to mode I and mode III in silica glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fundamental understanding of the root causes of failure requires information on atomic-scale processes. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are widely used to provide these insights while maintaining chemical specificity. However, the boundary conditions that can be applied in MD fracture simulations are limited to the linear-elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) far-field solution, posing restrictions in simulating bending or shearing deformations commonly applied in classical experimental setups. This has to date prevented the accurate and precise prediction of key fracture quantities such as critical stress intensity factors. To overcome these limitations, we here apply the domain-decomposition Capriccio method to couple atomistic MD samples representing silica glass synthesized at various quenching rates with the finite element (FE) method and perform both mode I (tension, three- and four-point bending) and mode III simulations at different loading rates. We investigate multiple criteria to best identify the onset of crack propagation based on the virial stress, the number of pair interactions, the kinetic energy/temperature, the crack velocity, and the crack opening displacement. Based on this, we propose a novel protocol that allows us to determine the fracture toughness of silica glass under mode I and III conditions from atomistic data with increased fidelity, with our results being in good agreement with experimental data and predictions from LEFM. Overall, our contribution demonstrates how coupled FE-MD simulations enable chemically specific quantitative predictions of the fracture behavior of amorphous materials under arbitrary mechanical loading conditions.</description>

      <title>Exploring the defect landscape and dopability of chalcogenide perovskite BaZrS3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: BaZrS3 is a chalcogenide perovskite that has shown great promise as a photovoltaic absorber over the last few years. Despite its impressive electronic and optical properties, native point defects and impurities could impose significant limitations on the photovoltaic performance of BaZrS3. Such defects may form spontaneously, create deep levels that act as traps for carriers, and influence the device performance by changing the concentrations of electrons and holes. On the other hand, functional dopants that dominate over native defects can help tune the nature of conductivity in BaZrS3. In this work, we applied first principles computations to comprehensively investigate the defect landscape of BaZrS3, including all intrinsic defects and select impurities and dopants. BaZrS3 intrinsically exhibits n-type equilibrium conductivity under Zr-rich and Zr-poor conditions, as determined by low energy vacancy and interstitial defects. O and H impurities create relatively low energy neutral and donor-type defects. La and Nb are calculated to be stable donor-type defects, which will make BaZrS3 even more n-type, whereas As and O form amphoteric defects, which generally show higher formation energies than native defects. This work highlights the difficulty of tuning the electrical properties of BaZrS3 via doping, especially making it more p-type. However, it points to some possible avenues to inform our future work.</description>

      <title>Landau-level composition of bound exciton states in magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theory that studies the state composition of a bound exciton in magnetic field. Using a basis set made of products of free electron and hole wavefunctions in Landau gauge, we derive a secular equation which shows the relation between Landau levels (LLs) of the electron and hole when a bound exciton is formed. Focusing on excitons in the light cone, we establish a scattering selection rule for the interaction of an electron in LL $n_\text{e}$ with a hole in LL $n_\text{h}$. We solve the resulting secular equation and identify a simple pairing law, $n_\text{e} = n_\text{h} + l$, which informs us on the construction of a bound exciton state with magnetic quantum number $l$, and on the interaction of the exciton magnetic moment with magnetic field. We obtain good agreement between theory results and recent measurements of the diamagnetic shifts of exciton states in WSe$_2$ monolayers.</description>

      <title>Correlation between ferroelectricity and torsional motion of acetyl groups in tris(4-acetylphenyl)amine observed by muon spin relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is demonstrated by muon spin relaxation and resonance experiments that the switchable spontaneous polarization of the organic ferroelectric compound tris(4-acetylphenyl)amine (TAPA) is governed by the local molecular dynamics of the acetyl group. The implanted muon forms paramagnetic states which exhibit longitudinal spin relaxation due to the fluctuation of hyperfine fields exerted from unpaired electrons. The first-principle density functional theory calculations indicate that these states are muonated radicals localized at the phenyl group and on the carbon/oxygen of the acetyl group, thereby suggesting that the spin relaxation is dominated by the random torsional motion of acetyl group around the CC bond to the phenyl group. The stepwise change in the relative yield of radicals at $T_0\approx 350$ K and the gradual increase in the spin relaxation rate with temperature ($T$) indicate that the torsional motion is significantly enhanced by thermal excitation above $T_0$. This occurs concomitantly with the strong enhancement in the atomic displacement parameter of oxygen in the acetyl group (which is non-linear in $T$), indicating that it is the local molecular motion of the acetyl groups that drives the structural transition.</description>

      <title>Small hole polarons in yellow phase $\delta$-CsPbI$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A heterophase containing both the optically active $\alpha$-CsPbI$_3$ and non-active $\delta$-CsPbI$_3$ has been demonstrated as an efficient white light emitter. This has challenged the conventional perspective that non-active phases of perovskites are undesirable in any perovskite-based optoelectronic devices. To understand the role that the yellow phase $\delta$-CsPbI$_3$ plays in the light emission process, we performed a systematic computational study on its electronic and optical properties, which are relatively unexplored in the literature. Using the Fr\"ohlich model we showed that the electron and hole both exhibit moderate coupling to longitudinal optical phonons. Explicit density functional theory calculations show that small hole polarons exist with a formation energy of -96 meV, corresponding to the contraction of the Pb-I bonds within a [PbI$_6$] octahedra and wavefunction localization. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that the small hole polaron is stable against thermal disorder, and exhibit periodic localization and delocalization behavior similar to carrier hopping with a characteristic lifetime of 0.3 ps. Our results might have elucidated the role that $\delta$-CsPbI$_3$ play in the self-trapped emission in perovskite-based white light emitting diodes by supporting the presence of a localized small hole polaron.</description>

      <title>Spin frustration and unconventional spin twisting state in van der Waals ferromagnet/antiferromagnet heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomically flat surfaces of van der Waals (vdW) materials pave an avenue for addressing a long-standing fundamental issue of how a perfectly compensated antiferromagnet (AFM) surface frustrates a ferromagnetic (FM) overlayer in FM/AFM heterostructures. By revealing the AFM and FM spin structures separately in vdW Fe5GeTe2/NiPS3 heterostructures, we find that C-type in-plane AFM NiPS3 develops three equivalent AFM domains which are robust against external magnetic field and magnetic coupling with Fe5GeTe2. Consequently, spin frustration at the Fe5GeTe2/NiPS3 interface was shown to develop a perpendicular Fe5GeTe2 magnetization in the interfacial region that switches separately from the bulk of the Fe5GeTe2 magnetizations. In particular, we discover an unconventional spin twisting state that the Fe5GeTe2 spins twist from perpendicular direction near the interface to in-plane direction away from the interface in Fe5GeTe2/NiPS3. Our finding of the twisting spin texture is a unique property of spin frustration in van der Waals magnetic heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Laser patterning of the room temperature van der Waals ferromagnet 1$T$-CrTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lamellar crystalline materials, whose layers are bond by van der Waals forces, can be stacked to form ultrathin artificial heterostructures, and in particular vertical magnetic junctions when some of the stacked materials are (ferro)magnetic. Here, using the room temperature van der Waals ferromagnet 1$T$-CrTe$_2$, we report a method for patterning lateral magnetic junctions. Exploiting the heat-induced phase transformation of the material into Cr$_x$Te$_y$ compounds ($x/y&gt;1/2$), we use local laser heating to imprint patterns at the micron-scale. Optimizing laser heat dissipation, we further demonstrate the crucial role of the substrate to control the phase transformation. If plain, unstructured poorly heat-conducting substrates allow for direct writing of magnetic patterns, structured $h$-BN layers can serve as heat stencils to draw potentially thinner patterns. Besides, $h$-BN encapsulation turns out to be heat-protective (in addition from protecting against oxidation as it is generally used for), allowing the demonstration of room temperature ferromagnetism in $&lt;$7~nm-thick 1$T$-CrTe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Quantum Geometric Origin of Strain-Tunable Giant Second-Harmonic Generation in Bi$_2$O$_2$X (X=S, Se, Te)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials with giant nonlinear optical (NLO) responses are essential for the development of advanced on-chip NLO devices. Using first-principles calculations, we predict a remarkable strain-induced enhancement of second-harmonic generation (SHG) in the high-performance 2D semiconductors Bi$_2$O$_2$X (X = S, Se, Te). The SHG susceptibilities of Bi$_2$O$_2$X under strain are on the order of 1~nm/V, rivalling the highest values reported among 2D materials. This giant SHG response originates from gauge-invariant geometric quantities, including the quantum metric, shift vector, and triple phase product. The strain also induces a bandgap variation in Bi$_2$O$_2$X. Intriguingly, in Bi$_2$O$_2$Te, strain-induced bandgap tuning drives a transition from a semiconductor to a half-metal, and ultimately to a polar metal. Our findings present a unique platform that combines strain-tunable bandgap engineering with exceptional NLO properties, while also highlighting the crucial role of quantum geometry in enhancing SHG.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic galvanomagnetic effects in single-crystal Fe(001) films elucidated by a phenomenological theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing the phenomenological theory based on crystal symmetry operation, we have established the complete angular dependencies of the galvanomagnetic effects, encompassing both anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) and the planar Hall effect (PHE), for the ferromagnetic films with C4v symmetry. These dependencies were experimentally confirmed via comprehensive angular-mapping of AMR and PHE in single-crystal Fe(001) films at room temperature. We demonstrated that the intrinsic magnetization-induced effects are independent of the field strength by carefully separating the field-induced and magnetization-induced galvanomagnetic effects. Our theoretical and experimental findings highlight the absence of in-plane four-fold angular dependence in PHE, a feature prohibited by the Onsager relation in systems with C4 symmetry. This study affirms that the universal angular dependencies of AMR and PHE in single crystals can be accurately predicted by the conventional phenomenological theory.</description>

Here, the contribution of polarity of compositional gradient on spin-current generation is explored. A nanoscale compositional gradient, formed by in-situ atomic diffusion of ultrathin Ti and W layers, is introduced between 10-nm-thick W and Ti layers. Spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance in ferromagnetic Ni95Cu5 deposited on this gradient reveals that a moderate compositional gradient suppresses negative spin torque from the spin Hall effect in W. In contrast, reversing the Ti/W stacking order, which inverts the gradient, suppresses positive spin torque from the orbital Hall effect in Ti. These findings suggest that the sign of spin torque is governed by the polarity of compositional gradient, providing a novel strategy for efficient spin-torque generation without relying on materials with strong spin or orbital Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Theoretical study of the impact of carrier density screening on Urbach tail energies and optical polarization in (Al,Ga)N quantum well systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aluminium Gallium Nitride ((Al,Ga)N) presents an ideal platform for designing ultra-violet (UV) light emitters across the entire UV spectral range. However, in the deep-UV spectral range (&lt;280 nm) these emitters exhibit very low quantum efficiencies, which in part is linked to the light polarization characteristics of (Al,Ga)N quantum wells (QWs). In this study we provide insight into the degree of optical polarization of (Al,Ga)N QW systems operating across the UV-C spectral range by means of an atomistic, multi-band electronic structure model. Our model not only captures the difference in valence band ordering in AlN and GaN, it accounts also for alloy disorder induced band mixing effects originating from random alloy fluctuations in (Al,Ga)N QWs. The latter aspect is not captured in widely employed continuum based models. The impact of alloy disorder on the electronic structure is studied in terms of Urbach tail energies, which reflect the broadening of the valence band density of states due to carrier localization effects. We find that especially in wider wells, Urbach tail energies are reduced with increasing carrier densities in the well, highlighting that alloy disorder induced carrier localization effects in (Al,Ga)N QWs are also tightly linked to electrostatic built-in fields. Our calculations show that for QWs designed to emit at the longer wavelength end of the UV-C spectrum, carrier density and well width are of secondary importance for their light emission properties, meaning that one observes mainly transverse electrical polarization. However, for (Al,Ga)N QWs with high Al contents, we find that both well width and carrier density will impact the degree of optical polarization. Our calculations suggest that wider wells will increase the degree of optical polarization and may therefore be a viable option to improve the light extraction efficiency in deep UV light emitters.</description>

      <title>Original Ultra-hard Orthorhombic Carbon allotropes C8 with lonsdaleite-type lon topology: Crystallographic and DFT investigations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lon topology inherent to lonsdaleite C4 hexagonal diamond is shown to characterize three original carbon allotropes C8 in the orthorhombic system with irregular orientations of the C4 tetrahedra. The octacarbon stoichiometries were devised from crystal structure engineering and identified close to lonsdaleite from density functional theory (DFT) based calculations of ground state structures and energy derived physical properties. Characterized with high densities, the three allotropes are identified with ultra hard with hardness magnitudes close and superior to lonsdaleite. Dynamically, all three allotropes were found stable with positive frequencies revealed from their phonons band structures with specific heat CV = f(T) calculated curves close to diamond experimental values from literature.</description>

      <title>Bi-self-trapping of excitons via the long-living phonon mode and their superfluorescent markers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the origin of the system response offers guidance for designing single-component material devices with required properties. A notable phenomenon of room-temperature superfluorescence recently observed in hybrid perovskites at high concentrations of excitations lacks of comprehensive theoretical framework. Addressing this gap necessitates a discussion grounded in non-linear and multiparticle theories. In this study, we offer the two-step mechanism: formation of two self-trapped excitons entangled via the same long-living phonon mode, and their rearrangement into a superradiating mirror symmetric configuration. Based on the semiclassical equations of motion we examine the criteria for the high-temperature self-trapping and bi-self trapping of excitons. Our findings indicate that the self-trapped excitons are described by the stable phase-locked steadystate solution of the equations of motion, and at elevated exciton concentrations, they compete with the bi-self-trapped excitons. The latter is described by the Dicke model and is thus responsible for the generation of the superfluorescent spectral peak. The obtained theoretical spectra are in good agreement with the experimental observation.</description>

      <title>Unconventional resistive switching in dense Ag-based nanowire networks with brain-inspired perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an unconventional resistive switching effect on high-density self-assembled Ag-nanowire networks tailored by a fuse-like operation. We propose a mechanism to rationalize the observed phenomenology by analyzing the electrical signatures before and after such a fusing. The explanation allows reconciling the results obtained in similar systems early adopted as transparent electrodes and the more recent attempts to use this type of substrate for in-materia computational operations. In addition to the usual analog nature of the available resistance states and the ability to tune internal weights, we show that these networks' sparsity and non-linear behavior are also attributes. Thus, the formerly exhibited nanowires' abilities to code synaptic behavior are complemented by neuronal features upon properly tuning the network density and the applied electrical protocol.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Thermoelectric Performance through Site-Specific Doping in Tetragonal Cu$_{2}$S: A First-Principles Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates how site-specific doping can enhance the thermoelectric performance of tetragonal Cu$_{2}$S using Density functional Theory and Projected Atomic Orbital Framework for Electronic Transport. We address the gap in current research, where most doping studies focus on the high-temperature cubic polymorph, leaving the tetragonal structure underexplored. By substituting Cu with Li, Na, or Mg, as well as partially replacing S with Se or Te, we systematically examine changes in electronic structure and transport properties. Our results reveal that cation-site doping can strongly shift the Fermi level. In particular, Li doping enhances the power factor ($\sigma S^2$) by optimizing carrier concentrations and band-edge alignments, whereas Mg, due to its divalent nature, offers a higher carrier density but requires careful balancing to maintain a large Seebeck coefficient. On the anion side, substituting heavier chalcogens (Se or Te) reshapes the valence bands and subtly shifts the Fermi level, yielding moderate improvements in both electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient. These doping-induced alterations, captured through transport calculations, demonstrate a clear route for tailoring the interplay between conductivity and thermal transport toward potentially high figure-of-merit values. Overall, the findings highlight the importance of site specificity in doping strategies for tetragonal Cu$_{2}$S, showing that judicious choice of dopant elements and concentrations can significantly improve key thermoelectric metrics. Such insights provide a foundation for experimental validation and further development of Cu$_{2}$S-based materials for mid- to high-temperature thermoelectric applications.</description>

      <title>Quantitative study on anomalous Nernst effect in Co thin films by laser irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) generates electromotive forces transverse to temperature gradients and has attracted much attention for potential applications into novel thermoelectric power generators. ANE efficiency is generally characterized by uniform temperature gradients in a steady state prepared by heaters. However, although focusing laser beams on a magnetic film can form much larger temperature gradients, the laser irradiation method has not been sufficiently considered for quantifying the ANE coefficient due to the difficulty in estimating the localized in-homogeneous temperature gradients. In this study, we present a quantitative study of ANE in Ru(5 nm)/Co($t_{\mathrm{Co}}$) ($t_{\mathrm{Co}}$ = 3, 5, 7, 10, 20, 40, and 60 nm) bilayers on sapphire (0001) substrates by combining a laser irradiation approach with finite element analysis of temperature gradients under laser excitation. We find that the estimated ANE coefficients are consistent with previously reported values and one independently characterized using a heater. Our results also reveal the advantages of the laser irradiation method over the conventional method using heaters. Intensity-modulated laser beams can create ac temperature gradients as large as approximately 10$^3$ K/mm at a frequency of tens of kilohertz in a micrometer-scale region.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous Electric Fields for Precise Control and Displacement of Polar Textures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the discovery of polar topological textures, achieving efficient control and manipulation of them has emerged as a significant challenge for their integration into nanoelectronic devices. In this study, we use second principles molecular dynamic simulations to demonstrate the precise and reversible control of domain arrangements stabilizing diverse polarization textures through the application of various inhomogeneous electric fields. Furthermore, we conduct an in-depth study of ferroelectric domain motion under such fields, revealing features consistent with creep dynamics and establishing an upper limit for their propagation speed. Notably, our findings show that domain walls exhibit an asymmetric inertial response, present at the onset of the dynamics but absent during their cessation. These findings provide valuable insights into the dynamic behavior of polar textures, paving the way for the development of high-speed, low-power nanoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Mechanism of Oxygen Reduction via Chemical Affinity in NiO/SiO2 Interfaces Irradiated with keV Energy Hydrogen and Helium Ions for Heterostructure Fabrication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-energy light ion beams are an essential resource in lithography for nanopatterning magnetic materials and interfaces due to their ability to modify the structure and properties of metamaterials. Here we create ferromagnetic/non-ferromagnetic heterostructures with a controlled layer thickness and nanometer-scale precision. For this, hydrogen ion (H+) irradiation is used to reduce the antiferromagnetic nickel oxide (NiO) layer into ferromagnetic Ni with lower fluence than in the case of helium ion (He+) irradiation. Our results indicate that H+ chemical affinity with oxygen is the primary mechanism for efficient atom remotion, as opposed to He+ irradiation, where the chemical affinity for oxygen is negligible.</description>

      <title>Nanoparticle simulations of logarithmic creep and microprestress relaxation in concrete and other disordered solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ba\v{z}ant's microprestress theory relates the logarithmic basic creep of concrete to power-law relaxation of heterogeneous eigenstresses at the nanoscale. However, the link between material chemistry, nanostructure, and microprestress relaxation, is not understood. To approach this, we use a simple model of harmonically interacting, packed nanoparticles, relaxing with and without external stress. Microprestresses are related to per-particle virial stress heterogeneities. Simulation results show that logarithmic creep and power-law microprestress relaxation emerge from generic deformation kinetics in disordered systems, which can occur in various materials and at various scales. When the interactions are matched to some mechanical properties of C--S--H at the 100 nm scale, the predicted microprestresses have similar magnitude as in Ba\v{z}ant's theory. The ability of our simulations to quantitatively link stress relaxation with nanostructure and chemistry-dependent interactions, provides a pathway to better characterise, extrapolate, and even engineer the creep behaviour of traditional and new concretes.</description>

      <title>Interlayer Hopping between Surface Mott Insulator and Bulk Band Insulator in layered 1T-TaS_{2}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In condensed matter physics, various mechanisms give rise to distinct insulating phases. The competition and interplay between these phases remain elusive, even for the seemingly most distinguishable band and Mott insulators. In multilayer systems, such interplay is mediated by interlayer hopping, which competes with the Coulomb repulsion to determine the nature of insulators. The layered compound 1T-TaS_{2} provides an ideal platform for investigating this phenomenon, as it naturally hosts coexisting Mott and band insulating states. However, distinguishing these distinct insulating states and characterizing the evolution remain challenging. In this study, we employ a dual approach utilizing surface-sensitive High-Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (HREELS) and bulk-sensitive Fourier-transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) to investigate the electronic excitation spectrum of 1T-TaS_{2}. Our methodology effectively identifies the features originating from the Mott and band insulators by analyzing the differences in their bulk and surface spectral weights, along with their energy distinctions. Based on the previous identification, we further investigate the evolution of insulating state features in the homostructure as they are modulated by temperature. The measurements and Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT) calculations suggest that the softening and broadening of Hubbard excitations in the Mott state with increasing temperature result from enhanced interlayer hopping between the Mott and band insulators.</description>

      <title>Phase-field modeling of radiation-induced composition redistribution: An application to additively manufactured austenitic Fe-Cr-Ni</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multicomponent alloys undergoing irradiation damage develop radiation-induced composition redistribution at point defect sinks such as grain boundaries (GBs) and dislocations. Such redistribution results in undesired changes to their mechanical behavior and corrosion resistance. Additively manufactured alloys proposed for future nuclear applications are expected to demonstrate a distinct response to irradiation owing to their unique microstructure with as-solidified dislocation density and chemical microsegregation. To capture the composition redistribution in such systems, we develop a mesoscale model with coupled evolution of atomic and point defect components in the presence of dislocation density, dislocation heterogeneity, and thermodynamic interactions at the GB. The model is parameterized for an FCC Fe-Cr-Ni alloy as a representative system for austenitic stainless steels, and simulations are performed in 1D and 2D as a function of irradiation temperature, dose, dislocation density, and grain size. Radiation-induced segregation (RIS) characterized by Cr depletion and Ni enrichment is predicted at both the GB and the dislocation cell wall, with RIS being lower in magnitude but wider at the cell wall. Strongly biased absorption of self-interstitials by dislocations is found to suppress Ni enrichment but slightly enhance Cr depletion under certain conditions. Thermodynamic segregation at the GB is predicted to be narrower and opposite in sign to RIS for both Cr and Ni. Importantly, non-monotonic segregation is found to occur when both thermodynamic and RIS mechanisms are considered, providing a novel physical interpretation of experimental observations. The model is expected to serve as a key tool in accelerated qualification of irradiated materials.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometric bounds in spinful systems with trivial band topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive quantum geometric bounds in spinful systems with spin-topology characterized by a single $\mathbb{Z}$-index protected by a spin gap. Our bounds provide geometric conditions on the spin topology, distinct from the known quantum geometric bounds associated with Wilson loops and nontrivial band topologies. As a result, we obtain stricter bounds in time-reversal symmetric systems with a nontrivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ index and also bounds in systems with a trivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ index, where quantum metric should be otherwise unbounded. We benchmark these findings with first-principles calculations in elemental Bismuth realizing higher even nontrivial spin-Chern numbers. Moreover, we connect these bounds to optical responses, demonstrating that spin-resolved quantum geometry can be observed experimentally. Finally, we connect spin-bounds to quantum Fisher information and Cram\'er-Rao bounds which are central to quantum metrology, showing that the elemental Bi and other spin-topological phases hold promises for topological free fermion quantum sensors.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a generalization of the Kelvin-Voigt model in order to include and characterize heterogeneities in viscoelastic semisolid materials. By considering a microrheological approach, we present analytical expressions for the mean square displacement and for the time-dependent diffusion coefficient of probe particles immersed in a viscoelastic material described by this model. Besides validating our theoretical approach through Brownian dynamics simulations, we show how the model can be used to describe experimental data obtained for polyacrylamide and laponite gels.</description>

      <title>Symmetry- and Gradient-enhanced Gaussian Process Regression for the Active Learning of Potential Energy Surfaces in Porous Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theoretical investigation of gas adsorption, storage, separation, diffusion and related transport processes in porous materials relies on a detailed knowledge of the potential energy surface of molecules in a stationary environment. In this article, a new algorithm is presented, specifically developed for gas transport phenomena, which allows for a highly cost-effective determination of molecular potential energy surfaces. It is based on a symmetry-enhanced version of Gaussian Process Regression with embedded gradient information and employs an active learning strategy to keep the number of single point evaluations as low as possible. The performance of the algorithm is tested for a selection of gas sieving scenarios on porous, N-functionalized graphene and for the intermolecular interaction of CH$_4$ and N$_2$.</description>

      <title>Adhesion and Reconstruction of Graphene/Hexagonal Boron Nitride Heterostructures: A Quantum Monte Carlo Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate interlayer adhesion and relaxation at interfaces between graphene and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) monolayers in van der Waals heterostructures. The adhesion potential between graphene and hBN is calculated as a function of local lattice offset using diffusion quantum Monte Carlo methods, which provide an accurate treatment of van der Waals interactions. Combining the adhesion potential with elasticity theory, we determine the relaxed structures of graphene and hBN layers at interfaces, finding no metastable structures. The adhesion potential is well described by simple Lennard-Jones pair potentials that we parameterize using our quantum Monte Carlo data. Encapsulation of graphene between near-aligned crystals of hBN gives rise to a moir\'{e} pattern whose period is determined by the misalignment angle between the hBN crystals superimposed over the moir\'{e} superlattice previously studied in graphene on an hBN substrate. We model minibands in such supermoir\'{e} superlattices and find them to be sensitive to a 180$^\circ$ rotation of one of the encapsulating hBN crystals. We find that monolayer and bilayer graphene placed on a bulk hBN substrate and bulk hBN/graphene/bulk hBN systems do not relax to adopt a common lattice constant. The energetic balance is much closer for free-standing monolayer graphene/hBN bilayers and hBN/graphene/hBN trilayers. The layers in an alternating stack of graphene and hBN are predicted to strain to adopt a common lattice constant and hence we obtain a new, stable three-dimensional crystal with a unique electronic structure.</description>

      <title>GPU acceleration of hybrid functional calculations in the SPARC electronic structure code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a GPU-accelerated version of the real-space SPARC electronic structure code for performing hybrid functional calculations in generalized Kohn-Sham density functional theory. In particular, we develop a batch variant of the recently formulated Kronecker product-based linear solver for the simultaneous solution of multiple linear systems. We then develop a modular, math kernel based implementation for hybrid functionals on NVIDIA architectures, where computationally intensive operations are offloaded to the GPUs while the remaining workload is handled by the CPUs. Considering bulk and slab examples, we demonstrate that GPUs enable up to 8x speedup in node-hours and 80x in core-hours compared to CPU-only execution, reducing the time to solution on V100 GPUs to around 300 seconds for a metallic system with over 6,000 electrons, and significantly reducing the computational resources required for a given wall time.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Theory of Polaron-Polariton Dispersion and Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an analytical microscopic theory to describe the polaron-polariton dispersion, formed by hybridizing excitons, photons, and phonons, and their coherent dynamics inside optical cavities. Starting from a microscopic light-matter Hamiltonian, we derive a simple analytical model by pursuing a non-perturbative treatment of the phonon and photon couplings to excitons. Within our theoretical framework, the phonons are treated as classical fields that are then quantized via the Floquet formalism. We show that, to a good approximation, the entire polaron-polariton system can be described using a band picture despite the phonons breaking translational symmetry. Our theory also sheds light on the long-lived coherent ballistic motion of exciton-polaritons with high excitonic character that propagate with group velocities lower than is expected from pure exciton-polariton bands, offering a microscopic explanation for these puzzling experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Pair Wavefunction Symmetry in UTe2 from Zero-Energy Surface State Visualization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16636v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although nodal spin-triplet topological superconductivity appears probable in UTe2, its superconductive order-parameter $\Delta_k$ remains unestablished. In theory, a distinctive identifier would be the existence of a superconductive topological surface band (TSB), which could facilitate zero-energy Andreev tunneling to an s-wave superconductor, and also distinguish a chiral from non-chiral $\Delta_k$ via enhanced s-wave proximity. Here we employ s-wave superconductive scan-tips and detect intense zero-energy Andreev conductance at the UTe2 (0-11) termination surface. Imaging reveals sub-gap quasiparticle scattering interference signatures with a-axis orientation. The observed zero-energy Andreev peak splitting with enhanced s-wave proximity, signifies that $\Delta_k$ of UTe2 is a non-chiral state: B1u, B2u or B3u. However, if the quasiparticle scattering along the a-axis is internodal, then a non-chiral B3u state is the most consistent for UTe2.</description>

      <title>A sturdy spin-momentum locking in a chiral organic superconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Among noncentrosymmetric structures, chirality has recently been recognized as a novel source of asymmetrical charge/spin transports as exemplified by electrical magnetochiral anisotropy (EMChA) and chirality-induced spin selectivity. Although similar bulk-charge rectification and Rashba-Edelstein effect in polar systems are quantitively reproducible by theory based on the electronic band structures, the relevance of band parameters in chiral effects remains elusive. Here, by working with a chiral organic superconductor, we experimentally demonstrate a gigantic EMChA and large superconducting diode effect, both of which are difficult to be explained solely by its band parameters. A two-critical-current signature and an enhanced critical field suggested triplet-mixed Cooper pairs with anomalously enhanced spin-orbit coupling above atomic limit. Our results clearly highlight a unique spin-momentum locking with large stiffness beyond the expectation, suggesting an unknown driving force for spin polarization inherent to chirality.</description>

      <title>The Effect of the Non-Abelian Quantum Metric on Superfluidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum geometric tensor, which encodes the full geometric information of quantum states in projective Hilbert space, plays a crucial role in condensed matter physics. In this work, we examine the effect of the non-Abelian quantum metric -- the real part of the non-Abelian quantum geometric tensor -- on the superfluid weight in time-reversal symmetric systems. For conventional $s$-wave pairing, we demonstrate that the superfluid weight includes a contribution proportional to the trace of the non-Abelian quantum metric. Notably, this contribution remains significant even when the total Chern number of a set of degenerate bands is zero and can exceed the conventional contribution, as confirmed using lattice models. Ab initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations for MoS$_2$ and TiSe$_2$ further corroborate these findings, revealing that the non-Abelian quantum metric accounts for up to 20% of the superfluid weight in MoS$_2$ and 50% in TiSe$_2$. Our results provide new insights into the nontrivial relationship between the geometric properties of quantum states and superconductivity, opening avenues for further exploration in topological and superconducting materials.</description>

      <title>Multiscale simulations of three-dimensional nanotube networks: Enhanced modeling using unit cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a simulation approach for three-dimensional nanotube networks using cubic and tetragonal unit cells to enhance modeling efficiency. A random-walk algorithm was developed to generate these networks, which were analyzed in a Finite Element Method (FEM) simulation to assess their electrical conductivity. The percolation probability as a function of the nanotube filling factor can be derived from these simulation results. It is found that smaller tetragonal unit cells can replicate the behavior of larger networks with significantly reduced computational effort, achieving a 20 times reduction in computational time while receiving similar results. In this work, we focus on carbon-doped titanate nanotubes for hydrogen applications, but the method is adaptable for other nanocomposite applications. The findings provide a universal framework for the investigation of nanotube-based materials.</description>

      <title>Robust purely optical signatures of Floquet-Bloch states in crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong light-matter interactions enable triggering on-demand novel functionalities in materials. For periodically driven solids, the Floquet-Bloch states have emerged as the natural states to characterize the physical properties of these non-equilibrium systems. However, robust signatures of the Floquet-Bloch states are needed as common experimental conditions, such as pulsed laser excitation and dissipative many-body dynamics can disrupt their formation and survival. Here, we identify a tell-tale signature of Floquet-Bloch states in the linear optical response of laser-dressed solids that remains prominent even in the presence of strong spectral congestion of bulk matter. To do so, we introduce a computationally efficient strategy to finally capture the response properties of realistic laser-dressed solids, and use it to compute the optical absorption of ZnO using a model of full-dimensionality. The computations reveal intense, spectrally isolated, absorption/stimulated emission features at mid-infrared energies present for a wide range of laser-driving conditions that arise due to the hybridization of the Floquet-Bloch states. As such, these spectral features open a purely optical pathway to investigate the birth and survival of Floquet-Bloch states while avoiding the experimental challenges of fully reconstructing the band structure.</description>

      <title>Excited State Absorption: Reference Oscillator Strengths, Wavefunction and TD-DFT Benchmarks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Excited-state absorption (ESA) corresponds to the transition between two electronic excited states and is a fundamental process for probing and understanding light-matter interactions. Accurate modeling of ESA is indeed often required to interpret time-resolved experiments. In this contribution, we present a dataset of 53 ESA oscillator strengths in three different gauges and the associated vertical transition energies between 71 excited states of 23 small- and medium-sized molecules from the QUEST database. The reference values were obtained within the quadratic-response (QR) CC3 formalism using eight different Dunning basis sets. We found that the d-aug-cc-pVTZ basis set is always adequate while its more compact double-$\zeta$ counterpart, d-aug-cc-pVDZ, performs well in most applications. These QR-CC3 data allow us to assess the performance of QR-TDDFT, with and without applying the Tamm-Dancoff approximation, using a panel of global and range-separated hybrids (B3LYP, BH{\&amp;}HLYP, CAM-B3LYP, LC-BLYP33, and LC-BLYP47), as well as several lower-order wavefunction methods, i.e., QR-CCSD, QR-CC2, EOM-CCSD, ISR-ADC(2), and ISR-ADC(3). We show that QR-TDDFT delivers acceptable errors for ESA oscillator strengths, with CAM-B3LYP showing particular promise, especially for the largest molecules of our set. We also find that ISR-ADC(3) exhibits excellent performance</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electron-phonon coupling (EPC) is foundational in condensed matter physics, determining intriguing phenomena and properties in both conventional and quantum materials. In this manuscript, we propose and demonstrate a novel two dimensional (2D) EPC spectroscopy which allows for direct extraction of EPC matrix elements for specific phonon modes and different electron energies, simultaneously. Using this technique, we are able to measure the electron-energy dependence of the EPC strength for individual phonon modes. This capability allows us to identify unique signatures distinguishing nonlocal Su-SchriefferHeeger (SSH)-type couplings from local Holstein-type couplings. In application to a methylammonium lead iodide (MAPI) perovskite, we find that two pronounced phonon modes at room temperature exhibit highly distinctive EPC behaviors, concerning strength, anisotropy, and temperature-dependence across the structural phase transition. Our approach paves the way for unraveling the microscopic origin of EPC, the change of the phonon-mode-specific EPC with external conditions, and phonon-mediated ultrafast control of condensed materials.</description>

      <title>Flat Band Generation through Interlayer Geometric Frustration in Intercalated Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electronic flat bands can lead to rich many-body quantum phases by quenching the electron's kinetic energy and enhancing many-body correlation. The reduced bandwidth can be realized by either destructive quantum interference in frustrated lattices, or by generating heavy band folding with avoided band crossing in Moire superlattices. Here we propose a general approach to introduce flat bands into widely studied transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) materials by dilute intercalation. A flat band with vanishing dispersion is observed by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) over the entire momentum space in intercalated Mn1/4TaS2. Polarization dependent ARPES measurements combined with symmetry analysis reveals the orbital characters of the flat band. Supercell tight-binding simulations suggest that such flat bands arising from destructive interference between Mn and Ta on S through hopping pathways, are ubiquitous in a range of TMD families as well as for different intercalation configurations. Our findings establish a new material platform to manipulate flat band structures and explore their corresponding emergent correlated properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the use of the adaptively compressed exchange (ACE) operator to accelerate many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) calculations, including G$_0$W$_0$ and the Bethe Salpeter equation (BSE), for hybrid density functional theory starting points. We show that by approximating the exact exchange operator with the low-rank ACE operator, substantial computational savings can be achieved with systematically controllable errors in the quasiparticle energies computed with full-frequency G$_0$W$_0$ and the optical absorption spectra and vertical excitation energies computed by solving the BSE within density matrix perturbation theory. Our implementation makes use of the ACE-accelerated electronic Hamiltonian to carry out both G$_0$W$_0$ and BSE without explicitly computing empty states. We show the robustness of the approach and present the computational gains obtained on both the central processing unit and graphics processing unit nodes. Our work will facilitate the exploration and evaluation of fine-tuned hybrid starting points aimed at enhancing the accuracy of MBPT calculations without involving computationally demanding self-consistency in Hedin's equations.</description>

      <title>Energy-Specific Bethe-Salpeter Equation Implementation for Efficient Optical Spectrum Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an energy-specific Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) implementation for efficient core and valence optical spectrum calculations. In energy-specific BSE, high-lying excitation energies are obtained by constructing trial vectors and expanding the subspace targeting excitation energies above the predefined energy threshold in the Davidson algorithm. To calculate optical spectra over a wide energy range, energy-specific BSE can be applied to multiple consecutive small energy windows, where trial vectors for each subsequent energy window are made orthogonal to the subspace of preceding windows to accelerate the convergence of the Davidson algorithm. For seven small molecules, energy-specific BSE combined with $G_0W_0$ provides small errors around 0.8 eV for absolute and relative $K$-edge excitation energies when starting from a hybrid PBEh solution with 45% exact exchange. We further showcase the computational efficiency of this approach by simulating the N $1s$ $K$-edge excitation spectrum of the porphine molecule and the valence optical spectrum of silicon nanoclusters involving 6,000 excited states using $G_0W_0$-BSE. This work expands the applicability of the $GW$-BSE formalism for investigating high-energy excited states of large systems.</description>

      <title>Unconventional and Powerful Ion Sources for Solid-State Ion Exchange, Cu2SO4 and Cu3PO4: Exemplified by Synthesis of Metastable \beta-CuGaO2 from Stable \beta-LiGaO2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05310v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces a new method for synthesizing Cu+-containing metastable phases through ion exchange. Traditionally, CuCl has been used as a Cu+ ion source for solid-state ion exchanges; however, its thermodynamic driving force is often insufficient for complete ion exchange with Li+-containing precursors. First-principles calculations have identified Cu2SO4 and Cu3PO4 as more powerful alternatives, providing a higher driving force than CuCl. It has been experimentally demon-strated that these ion sources can open up new reaction pathways through experimental ion exchanges, such as from \beta-LiGaO2 to \beta-CuGaO2, which were previously unattainable. An important perspective provided by this study is that the poten-tial of such basic compounds to act as powerful ion sources has been overlooked, and that they were identified through straightforward first-principles calculations. This work presents the initial strategic design of an ion exchange reaction by exploring suitable ion sources, thereby expanding the potential for synthesizing metastable materials.</description>

      <title>Diffusion behavior of Li ions in crystalline and amorphous Li-Zr-O and Li-Nb-O phases</title>

Abstract: Li containing transition metal oxides are known as good ionic conductors. Performing classical molecular dynamics simulations, the diffusion behavior of Li ions is investigated in crystalline and amorphous phases with the stoichiometries Li$_2$ZrO$_3$ and LiNbO$_3$. We first demonstrate the stability of the crystal structures for the used interatomic potential model and then analyze the amorphous phases, which result from melt-and-quench simulations, in terms of radial distribution functions. Diffusivities of Li ions in those systems are obtained from a statistical Arrhenius analysis of mean square displacement curves at different temperatures. The crystalline phase of Li$_2$ZrO$_3$ exhibits two well-defined migration mechanisms: vacancy-mediated migration is dominant below and a site exchange of Li ions above a crossover region between about 1700 and 1800 K. The latter mechanism also prevails in the amorphous phases of Li$_2$ZrO$_3$ with a strongly reduced activation energy, which is due to a smaller equilibrium separation of Li ions as in the crystal structure. This migration mechanism is found in amorphous LiNbO$_3$, too.</description>

      <title>Foundational Large Language Models for Materials Research</title>

Abstract: Materials discovery and development are critical for addressing global challenges. Yet, the exponential growth in materials science literature comprising vast amounts of textual data has created significant bottlenecks in knowledge extraction, synthesis, and scientific reasoning. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer unprecedented opportunities to accelerate materials research through automated analysis and prediction. Still, their effective deployment requires domain-specific adaptation for understanding and solving domain-relevant tasks. Here, we present LLaMat, a family of foundational models for materials science developed through continued pretraining of LLaMA models on an extensive corpus of materials literature and crystallographic data. Through systematic evaluation, we demonstrate that LLaMat excels in materials-specific NLP and structured information extraction while maintaining general linguistic capabilities. The specialized LLaMat-CIF variant demonstrates unprecedented capabilities in crystal structure generation, predicting stable crystals with high coverage across the periodic table. Intriguingly, despite LLaMA-3's superior performance in comparison to LLaMA-2, we observe that LLaMat-2 demonstrates unexpectedly enhanced domain-specific performance across diverse materials science tasks, including structured information extraction from text and tables, more particularly in crystal structure generation, a potential adaptation rigidity in overtrained LLMs. Altogether, the present work demonstrates the effectiveness of domain adaptation towards developing practically deployable LLM copilots for materials research. Beyond materials science, our findings reveal important considerations for domain adaptation of LLMs, such as model selection, training methodology, and domain-specific performance, which may influence the development of specialized scientific AI systems.</description>

      <title>Deterministic role of chemical bonding in the formation of altermagnetism: Reflection from correlated electron system NiS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnetism, a new collinear magnetic state, has gained significant attention in the last few years, and the underlying mechanisms driving this quantum phase are still evolving. Going beyond the group theoretical analyses, which focus on providing a binary description of the presence or absence of the altermagnetic state, in this work, we explore the role of crystal chemical bonding. As the latter successfully integrates the crystal and orbital symmetries and is tunable, it provides a quantitative and realistic mechanism to explain the formation of altermagnetism. From the first principles calculations and tight-binding models within the framework of the linear combination of atomic orbitals on NiS, we establish a set of selection rules for the formation of altermagnetism in the NiAs prototype compounds (e.g. CrSb, MnTe, etc.). Broadly, if single orbitals from Ni and S sites are involved in the bonding, the second neighbor interaction between the nonmagnetic atoms is a must to modulate the intra-sublattice interactions differently for the opposite spin sublattices so that the antiferromagnetic sublattice band degeneracy is lifted and momentum-dependent altermagnetic spin split (ASS) appears. However, when multiple orbitals are involved from the Ni and S sites in the chemical bonding, altermagnetism is naturally present. Together they amplify the ASS. Further, we propose twelve antinodal regions in the NiAs type hexagonal crystals, where ASS split is maximum. Specific to NiS, ASS increases with correlation, and for the edge valence and conduction bands it can go beyond 1eV. The present study opens up new pathways to design chemical bonding driven selection rules in addition to the existing crystal symmetry criteria to tailor tunable altermagnetism.</description>

      <title>Off-resonant photoluminescence spectroscopy of high-optical quality single photon emitters in GaN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the relevance of excitation parameters on the emission from single-photon emitting defect centers in GaN. We investigate the absorption spectrum of different emitters by photoluminescence excitation technique at 10\,K. We report large spectral jumps (shifts up to 22\,meV) in the emitters' zero-phonon line (ZPL). The likelihood of such jumps is increased by the change in excitation energy. The shifts indicate a large built-in dipole moment of the defects and suggest a possibility to electrically tune their ZPL in a wide range. From the photoluminescence excitation studies, we observe that for majority of the emitters the absorption peaks exist between 2 and 2.55\,eV. The absorption peaks vary from emitter to emitter, and no universal absorption pattern is apparent. Finally, for selected emitters we observe significantly reduced spectral diffusion and instrument-limited linewidth of $138\,\mu eV$ (0.04\,nm).These findings show a new perspective for atomic defect GaN emitters as sources of coherent photons, shine new light on their energy level structure and show the possibility of tuning the ZPL, paving the way to fully harness their potential for applications in quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Tuning Higher Order Structure in Colloidal Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.09029v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Colloidal particles self assemble into a wide range of structures under external AC electric fields due to induced dipolar interactions [Yethiraj and Van Blaaderen Nature 421 513 (2003)]. As a result of these dipolar interactions, at low volume fraction the system is modulated between a hard-sphere like state (in the case of zero applied field) and a "string fluid" upon application of the field. Using both particle-resolved experiments and Brownian dynamics simulations, we investigate the emergence of the string fluid with a variety of structural measures including two-body and higher-order correlations. The higher-order structure we probe using three-body spatial correlation functions and a many-body approach based on minimum energy clusters of a dipolar-Lennard-Jones system. This yields a series of geometrically distinct minimum energy clusters upon increasing the strength of the dipolar interaction, which are echoed in the higher-order structure of the colloidal fluids we study here. We find good agreement between experiment and simulation at the two-body level, although some discrepancies are found at higher field strength, where the system falls out of equilibrium. Higher-order correlations exhibit reasonable agreement between experiment and simulation, again with more discrepancy at higher field strength for three--body correlation functions. At higher field strength, the cluster population in our experiments and simulations is dominated by the minimum energy clusters for all sizes $8 \leq m \leq 12$. The agreement that we find here is notable considering that there is no fit parameter in our mapping between experiment and simulation.</description>

      <title>Why Charge Added Using Transition Metals To Some Insulators -- Including LK-99 -- Localizes and Does Not Yield a Metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07295v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While adding charge to semiconductors via dopants is a well-established method for tuning electronic properties, we demonstrate that introducing transition metal impurities into certain insulators can lead to localized charge, assisted by a Jahn-Teller distortion. This leads to isolated charge, and an insulating material as opposed to emergent states - including superconductivity. We focus on Cu impurities added to Pb$_{10}$(PO$_4$)$_6$O ('LK-99'), replacing 10% of Cu ions, as discussed in recent literature. Our calculations show that the material remains a wide bandgap insulator with isolated, S=1/2 localized charges on the Cu ions-similar to color centers-even within standard DFT, without the need for electron correlation corrections to the Cu d-orbitals. Superconductivity is excluded by known mechanisms that require the material to be metallic. We resolve previously observed inconsistencies between density functional theory results and experimental findings related to doping site energetics, crystal structure, and transparency. We find that Cu doping either Pb site leads to CuO$_4$ coordination and a similar unit cell volume contraction. Engineering materials with dopant sites that have different local symmetries can induce non-relativistic spin splitting-often referred to as altermagnetism. However, in the case of localized charges, this may enable spins to be individually controlled.</description>

      <title>Sensitive dependence of pairing symmetry on Ni-$e_g$ crystal field splitting in the nickelate superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure has drawn great attention. However, consensus has not been reached on its pairing symmetry in theory. By combining density-functional-theory (DFT), maximally-localized-Wannier-function, and linearized gap equation with random-phase-approximation, we find that the pairing symmetry of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is $d_{xy}$, if its DFT band structure is accurately reproduced by a downfolded bilayer two-orbital model. More importantly, we reveal that the pairing symmetry of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ sensitively depends on the crystal field splitting between two Ni-$e_g$ orbitals. A slight increase in Ni-$e_g$ crystal field splitting alters the pairing symmetry from $d_{xy}$ to $s_{\pm}$. Such a transition is associated with the change in inverse Fermi velocity and susceptibility, while the shape of Fermi surface remains almost unchanged. Our work highlights the sensitive dependence of pairing symmetry on low-energy electronic structure in multi-orbital superconductors, which calls for care in the downfolding procedure when one calculates their pairing symmetry.</description>

      <title>Theory and Modeling of Transport for Simple Fluids in Nanoporous Materials: From Microscopic to Coarse-Grained Descriptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the state-of-the-art theoretical modeling, molecular simulation, and coarse-graining strategies for the transport of gases and liquids in nanoporous materials (pore size 1-100 nm). Special emphasis is placed on the transport of small molecules in zeolites, active carbons, metal-organic frameworks, but also in nanoporous materials with larger pores such as ordered and disordered mesoporous oxides. We present different atomistic and mesoscopic methods as well as the theoretical formalisms. Attention is given to the investigation of different molecular transport coefficients - including the self, collective and transport diffusivities - but also to the determination of free energy barriers and their role in overall adsorption/separation process rates. We also introduce other available approaches such as hierarchical simulations and upscaling strategies. This review focuses on simple fluids in prototypical nanoporous materials. While the phenomena covered here capture the main physical mechanisms in such systems, complex molecules will exhibit additional specific features. For the sake of clarity and brevity, we also omit multicomponent systems (e.g. fluid mixtures, electrolytes, etc.) and electrokinetic effects arising when charged systems are considered (ionic species, charged surfaces, etc.), both of which add to the complexity.</description>

      <title>Effect of spin-dependent tunneling in a MoSe$_2$/Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ van der Waals heterostructure on exciton and trion emission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study van der Waals heterostructures consisting of monolayer MoSe$_2$ and few-layer Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ fully encapsulated in hexagonal Boron Nitride using low-temperature photoluminescence and polar magneto-optic Kerr effect measurements. Photoluminescence characterization reveals a partial quenching and a change of the exciton-trion emission ratio in the heterostructure as compared to the isolated MoSe$_2$ monolayer. Under circularly polarized excitation, we find that the exciton-trion emission ratio depends on the relative orientation of excitation helicity and Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ magnetization, even though the photoluminescence emission itself is unpolarized. This observation hints at an ultrafast, spin-dependent interlayer charge transfer that competes with exciton and trion formation and recombination.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Raman spectroscopy is a valuable characterization tool for two-dimensional materials. Starting from model Hamiltonians for Chern insulators and magnetized monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides, we theoretically predict two unconventional features of Raman spectroscopy. First, a selection rule emerges in the Raman tensor when the incident and scattered photons are circularly polarized. This rule generalizes the well-known valley selection rule of optical conductivity in Dirac insulators. Second, for an electronic model with single massive Dirac fermion, the phase difference between Raman tensor elements is quantized to $\pm\pi/2$ for any frequency of the incident light. The quantization is robust under perturbations and the sign of the phase difference is reversed when the mass term of the Hamiltonian is inverted.</description>

      <title>Binary random packing fraction of hyperspheres with small or large size difference: a geometric approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The random packing fraction of binary particles in D-dimensional Euclidean space R^D is studied using a geometric approach. First, the binary packing fraction of assemblies with small size difference are studied, using the excluded volume model by Onsager for particles in three-dimensional space (D = 3). According to this model the packing increase by bidispersity is proportional to (1 - f)(u^D - 1)^2, with f as monosized packing fraction, u as size ratio and D as space dimension. The model predictions are compared with computational results for disks in two dimensions (D = 2) and hyperspheres in the large-dimension limit (D to infinity), yielding good agreement. Subsequently, the packing of hyperspheres with large size difference is modeled, employing the classic theory of Furnas. This theory, developed for three dimensions, starts from an infinite size ratio of larger and smaller particles (u to infinity). Here, the pertaining equations are applied to hyperspheres, and successfully compared with computational results for hyperspheres in the large-dimension limit. Furthermore, an asymptotic approximation of the binary packing fraction for large size ratio is derived, which shows that the first order variation of the Furnas packing fraction (u^-1 = 0) is proportional to (2 - f)u^-1. Finally, a scaled D-dimensional binary packing graph is presented, governing a simplified phase diagram that borders the binary random packing fraction of amorphous assemblies. To summarize, basic space-filling and geometric (a-thermal) theories on simple hard spheres appear to be a valuable tool for the study of hyperspheres packing and amorphization.</description>
