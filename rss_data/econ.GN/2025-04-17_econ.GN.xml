      <title>Climate-economy projections under shared socioeconomic pathways and net-zero scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine future trajectories of the social cost of carbon, global temperatures, and carbon concentrations using the cost-benefit Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy (DICE) model calibrated to the five Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) under two mitigation scenarios: achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 and by 2100. The DICE model is calibrated to align industrial and land-use carbon emissions with projections from six leading process-based integrated assessment models (IAMs): IMAGE, MESSAGE--GLOBIOM, AIM/CGE, GCAM, REMIND--MAgPIE and WITCH--GLOBIOM. We find that even with aggressive mitigation (net-zero by 2050), global temperatures are projected to exceed $2^\circ\text{C}$ above preindustrial levels by 2100, with estimates ranging from $2.5^\circ\text{C}$ to $2.7^\circ\text{C}$ across all SSPs and IAMs considered. Under the more lenient mitigation scenario (net-zero by 2100), global temperatures are projected to rise to between $3^\circ\text{C}$ and $3.7^\circ\text{C}$ by 2100. Additionally, the social cost of carbon is estimated to increase from approximately USD 30--50 in 2025 to USD 250--400 in 2100.</description>

      <title>Energy Storage Autonomy in Renewable Energy Systems Through Hydrogen Salt Caverns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The expansion of renewable energy sources leads to volatility in electricity generation within energy systems. Subsurface storage of hydrogen in salt caverns can play an important role in long-term energy storage, but their global potential is not fully understood. This study investigates the global status quo and how much hydrogen salt caverns can contribute to stabilizing future renewable energy systems. A global geological suitability and land eligibility analysis for salt cavern placement is conducted and compared with the derived long-term storage needs of renewable energy systems. Results show that hydrogen salt caverns can balance between 43% and 66% of the global electricity demand and exist in North America, Europe, China, and Australia. By sharing the salt cavern potential with neighboring countries, up to 85% of the global electricity demand can be stabilized by salt caverns. Therefore, global hydrogen can play a significant role in stabilizing renewable energy systems.</description>

      <title>Steering Prosocial AI Agents: Computational Basis of LLM's Decision Making in Social Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as human-like decision-making agents in social science and applied settings. These LLM-agents are typically assigned human-like characters and placed in real-life contexts. However, how these characters and contexts shape an LLM's behavior remains underexplored. This study proposes and tests methods for probing, quantifying, and modifying an LLM's internal representations in a Dictator Game -- a classic behavioral experiment on fairness and prosocial behavior. We extract ``vectors of variable variations'' (e.g., ``male'' to ``female'') from the LLM's internal state. Manipulating these vectors during the model's inference can substantially alter how those variables relate to the model's decision-making. This approach offers a principled way to study and regulate how social concepts can be encoded and engineered within transformer-based models, with implications for alignment, debiasing, and designing AI agents for social simulations in both academic and commercial applications.</description>

      <title>The Role of Patents: Incentivizing Innovation or Hindering Progress?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14370v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article examines the complex trade-offs inherent in the patent system, exploring whether patents truly incentivize innovation or inadvertently hinder progress. It traces the historical evolution of patent rights from their origins in Renaissance Venice to the modern framework enshrined in constitutional and international law. By balancing the exclusivity granted to inventors with the need for public access to knowledge, the article highlights how patents stimulate R&amp;D investments while sometimes limiting follow-on innovation due to prolonged monopolies. It discusses the economic rationales for patent protection, such as increasing private returns to encourage invention, against criticisms that patents restrict the free flow of ideas essential for collective progress. Ultimately, the review argues that although patents are designed to reward creativity and secure economic benefits, they remain a contentious instrument whose benefits and limitations must be carefully weighed in policy debates.</description>

      <title>What Proportion of Knowledge is Patented?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18043v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article examines the proportion of technical knowledge that is eventually patented and discusses implications for innovation. Drawing from economic theory and information science, the study considers a continuum from raw data to applied understanding, while distinguishing between patentable inventions and other types of knowledge. The article explains that although the patent system is designed to incentivize the creation of economically valuable technology, only a small fraction of patentable inventions receive patent protection. Empirical evidence from surveys and historical data reveal that patenting remains an exception rather than a rule in many, but not all, industries. Furthermore, the article explores the trade-offs inherent in public disclosure requirements in patent law, which facilitate knowledge dissemination and may aid competitors. In doing so, it highlights the critical balance between rewarding inventors and preserving the free flow of knowledge, ultimately underscoring the complex role patents play in modern innovation ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Why do firms patent?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11555v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Firms' decisions to patent innovations involve a complex evaluation of costs, benefits, and strategic considerations. This article explores the economic and practical factors that influence whether companies seek patent protection. It discusses explicit monetary costs--such as legal fees, filing, and international expenses--and non-monetary costs related to public disclosure. Benefits include the provision of exclusion rights that secure returns and protect competitive advantages. Additionally, firms use patents as strategic tools to block rivals, strengthen bargaining positions, signal innovation quality, and attract investment. The analysis also considers alternative protection strategies like secrecy, particularly for small enterprises or industries where disclosure is detrimental.</description>

      <title>What is patent quality?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Patent quality is a critical yet complex concept of interest to inventors, legal experts, and policymakers alike. This article demystifies patent quality by examining its various dimensions and definitions. It begins by discussing invention quality, emphasizing that the notion of 'technological superiority' is often too abstract to capture practical impact. The work distinguishes between incremental and radical innovations, highlighting that inventions can be evaluated by improvements over previous technologies and their economic potential. Four definitions of patent quality are explored: one based on invention quality, another linking quality with economic value, a third focusing on drafting clarity, and a fourth measuring compliance with legal standards. The article explains that high-quality patents may not necessarily protect valuable inventions and that weak patents can hold significant economic value due to legal advantages. This accessible review provides a comprehensive framework that benefits a broad audience interested in innovation policy and intellectual property.</description>

      <title>Public Health Insurance of Children and Maternal Labor Market Outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper exploits variation resulting from a series of federal and state Medicaid expansions between 1977 and 2017 to estimate the effects of children's increased access to public health insurance on the labor market outcomes of their mothers. The results imply that the extended Medicaid eligibility of children leads to positive labor supply responses of single mothers and to negative labor supply responses of married mothers. The analysis of mechanisms suggests that extended children's Medicaid eligibility positively affects take-up of Medicaid and health of children.</description>
