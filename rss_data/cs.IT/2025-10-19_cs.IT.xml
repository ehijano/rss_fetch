      <title>Adaptive Base Representation Theorem: An Alternative to Binary Number System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Adaptive Base Representation (ABR) Theorem and proposes a novel number system that offers a structured alternative to the binary number system for digital computers. The ABR number system enables each decimal number to be represented uniquely and using the same number of bits, $n$, as the binary encoding. Theoretical foundations and mathematical formulations demonstrate that ABR can encode the same integer range as binary, validating its potential as a viable alternative. Additionally, the ABR number system is compatible with existing data compression algorithms like Huffman coding and arithmetic coding, as well as error detection and correction mechanisms such as Hamming codes. We further explore practical applications, including digital steganography, to illustrate the utility of ABR in information theory and digital encoding, suggesting that the ABR number system could inspire new approaches in digital data representation and computational design.</description>

      <title>Outage-Aware Sum Rate Maximization in Movable Antennas-Enabled Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the movable antennas (MAs)-enabled multiple-input-single-output (MISO) systems, where the base station (BS) equipped with multiple MAs serves multiple single-antenna user. The delay-sensitive scenario is considered, where users refrain from periodically sending training signals to the BS for channel estimations to avoid additional latency. As a result, the BS relies solely on the statistical channel state information (CSI) to transmit data with a fixed rate. Under this setup, we aim to maximize the outage-aware sum rate of all users, by jointly optimizing antenna positions and the transmit beamforming at the BS, while satisfying the given target outage probability requirement at each user. The problem is highly non-convex, primarily because the exact cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of each user is difficult to derive. To simplify analysis and without comprising performance, we adopt the statistical CSI based zero-forcing beamforming design. We then introduce one important lemma to derive the tight mean and variance of the SINR. Leveraging these results, we further exploit the Laguerre series approximation to successfully derive the closedform and tight CDF of the SINR. Subsequently, the outageaware sum rate expression is presented but still includes complex structure with respect to antenna positions. Facing this challenge, the projected gradient ascent (PGA) method is developed to iteratively update antenna positions until convergence. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed schemes compared to conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) and other competitive benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Rotatable Antenna Meets UAV: Towards Dual-Level Channel Reconfiguration Paradigm for ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is viewed as a key enabler for future wireless networks by sharing the hardware and wireless resources between the functionalities of sensing and communication (S&amp;C). Due to the shared wireless resources for both S&amp;C, it is challenging to achieve a critical trade-off between these two integrated functionalities. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel dual-level channel reconfiguration framework for ISAC by deploying rotatable antennas at an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), where both the large-scale path loss and the correlation of S&amp;C channels can be proactively controlled, thereby allowing a flexible trade-off between S&amp;C performance. To characterize the S&amp;C tradeoff, we aim to maximize the communication rate by jointly optimizing the RA rotation, the transmit beamforming, and the UAV trajectory, subject to the given requirement of sensing performance. For the typical scenario of static UAV deployment, we introduce the concept of subspace correlation coefficient to derive closed-form solutions for the optimal RA rotation, transmit beamforming, and UAV hovering location. For the scenario of a fully mobile UAV, we prove that the optimal trajectory of a UAV follows a hover-fly-hover (HFH) structure, thereby obtaining its global optimal solution. Simulation results show that the proposed design significantly improves the achievable S&amp;C trade-off region compared to benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Subverting Flexible Multiuser Communications via Movable Antenna-Enabled Jammer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) is an emerging technology which can reconfigure wireless channels via adaptive antenna position adjustments at transceivers, thereby bringing additional spatial degrees of freedom for improving system performance. In this paper, from a security perspective, we exploit the MAenabled legitimate jammer (MAJ) to subvert suspicious multiuser downlink communications consisting of one suspicious transmitter (ST) and multiple suspicious receivers (SRs). Specifically, our objective is to minimize the benefit (the sum rate of all SRs or the minimum rate among all SRs) of such suspicious communications, by jointly optimizing antenna positions and the jamming beamforming at the MAJ. However, the key challenge lies in that given the MAJ's actions, the ST can reactively adjust its power allocations to instead maximize its benefit for mitigating the unfavorable interference. Such flexible behavior of the ST confuses the optimization design of the MAJ to a certain extent. Facing this difficulty, corresponding to the above two different benefits: i) we respectively determine the optimal behavior of the ST given the MAJ's actions; ii) armed with these, we arrive at two simplified problems and then develop effective alternating optimization based algorithms to iteratively solve them. In addition to these, we also focus on the special case of two SRs, and reveal insightful conclusions about the deployment rule of antenna positions at the MAJ. Furthermore, we analyze the ideal antenna deployment scheme at the MAJ for achieving the globally performance lower bound. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed schemes compared to conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) and other competitive benchmarks.</description>

      <title>ProxySelect: Frequency Selectivity-Aware Scheduling for Joint OFDMA and MU-MIMO in 802.11ax WiFi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: IEEE 802.11ax introduces orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) to WiFi to support concurrent transmissions to a larger number of users. As bandwidth continues to grow, WiFi channels exhibit increased frequency selectivity, which poses new challenges for MU-MIMO user selection: the optimal user set varies across frequency and is interleaved over subbands (called resource units, or RUs). This frequency selectivity, coupled with the complex subband allocation pattern, renders conventional narrowband user selection algorithms inefficient for 802.11ax. In this paper, we propose \emph{ProxySelect}, a scalable and frequency selectivity-aware user scheduling algorithm for joint OFDMA and MU-MIMO usage in 802.11ax under zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF). The scheduling task is formulated as an integer linear program (ILP) with binary variables indicating user (group)-RU associations, and linear constraints ensuring standard compatibility. To reduce complexity, we introduce a novel proxy rate--a function of individual channel strengths and their correlations--that approximates the ZFBF rate without requiring cubic-complexity matrix inversion. Additionally, we develop a sampling-based candidate group generation scheme that selects up to $T$ near-orthogonal user groups for each RU, thereby bounding the ILP size and ensuring scalability. Simulations using realistic ray-tracing-based channel models show that ProxySelect achieves near-optimal rate performance with significantly lower complexity.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Imaging by Exploiting Frequency Correlation in Wireless Communication Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we address the near-field imaging under a wideband wireless communication network by exploiting both the near-field channel of a uniform linear array (ULA) and the image correlation in the frequency domain. We first formulate the image recovery as a special multiple measurement vector (MMV) compressed sensing (CS) problem, where at various frequencies the sensing matrices can be different, and the image coefficients are correlated. To solve such an MMV problem with various sensing matrices and correlated coefficients, we propose a sparse Bayesian learning (SBL)-based solution to simultaneously estimate all image coefficients and their correlation on multiple frequencies. Moreover, to enhance estimation performance, we design two illumination patterns following two different criteria. From the CS perspective, the first design minimizes the total coherence of the sensing matrix to increase the mutual orthogonality of the basis vectors. Alternatively, to improve SNR, the second design maximizes the illumination power of the imaging area. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SBL-based method and the superiority of the illumination designs.</description>

      <title>New generalizations of circular complex fuzzy sets and Gaussian weighted aggregation operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the concept of the circular complex $q$-rung orthopair fuzzy set (CC$q$-ROFS) as a novel generalization that unifies the existing frameworks of circular complex intuitionistic fuzzy sets (CCIFSs) and complex $q$-rung orthopair fuzzy sets. If $q = 2$, the structure is referred to as a circular complex Pythagorean fuzzy set, and if $q = 3$, it is called a circular complex Fermatean fuzzy set. The proposed approach extends the Gaussian-based framework to the CC$q$-ROFSs, aiming to achieve a smoother and statistically meaningful representation of uncertainty. Within this setting, new Gaussian-based aggregation operators for CC$q$-ROFSs are constructed by employing the Gaussian triangular norm and conorm. Furthermore, Gaussian-weighted arithmetic and Gaussian-weighted geometric aggregation operators are formulated to enable consistent integration of membership and non-membership information for fuzzy modeling and decision-making.</description>

      <title>Beyond-Diagonal RIS Under Non-Idealities: Learning-Based Architecture Discovery and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) has recently been introduced to enable advanced control over electromagnetic waves to further increase the benefits of traditional RIS in enhancing signal quality and improving spectral and energy efficiency for next-generation wireless networks. A significant issue in designing and deploying BD-RIS is the tradeoff between its performance and circuit complexity. Despite some efforts in exploring optimal architectures with the lowest circuit complexities for ideal BD-RIS, architecture discovery for non-ideal BD-RIS remains uninvestigated. Therefore, how non-idealities and circuit complexity jointly affect the performance of BD-RIS remains unclear, making it difficult to achieve the performance - circuit complexity tradeoff in the presence of non-idealities. Essentially, architecture discovery for non-ideal BD-RIS faces challenges from both the computational complexity of global architecture search and the difficulty in achieving global optima. To tackle these challenges, we propose a learning-based two-tier architecture discovery framework (LTTADF) consisting of an architecture generator and a performance optimizer to jointly discover optimal architectures of non-ideal BD-RIS given specific circuit complexities, which can effectively explore over a large architecture space while avoiding getting trapped in poor local optima and thus achieving near-optimal solutions for the performance optimization. Numerical results provide valuable insights for deploying non-ideal BD-RIS considering the performance - circuit complexity tradeoff.</description>

      <title>Higher power polyadic group rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces and systematically develops the theory of polyadic group rings, a higher arity generalization of classical group rings $\mathcal{R}[\mathsf{G}]$. We construct the fundamental operations of these structures, defining the $\mathbf{m}_{r}$-ary addition and $\mathbf{n}_{r} $-ary multiplication for a polyadic group ring $\mathrm{R}^{[\mathbf{m} _{r},\mathbf{n}_{r}]}=\mathcal{R}^{[m_{r},n_{r}]}[\mathsf{G}^{[n_{g}]}]$ built from an $(m_{r},n_{r})$-ring and an $n_{g}$-ary group. A central result is the derivation of the "quantization" conditions that interrelate these arities, governed by the arity freedom principle, which also extends to operations with higher polyadic powers. We establish key algebraic properties, including conditions for total associativity and the existence of a zero element and identity. The concepts of the polyadic augmentation map and augmentation ideal are generalized, providing a bridge to the classical theory. The framework is illustrated with explicit examples, solidifying the theoretical constructions. This work establishes a new foundation in ring theory with potential applications in cryptography and coding theory, as evidenced by recent schemes utilizing polyadic structures.</description>

      <title>Quantum Low-Density Parity-Check Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) is a cornerstone of quantum computing, enabling reliable information processing in the presence of noise. Sparse stabilizer codes -- referred to generally as quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes -- have risen to the forefront of QEC research in recent years. This can be attributed to several key factors. First, classical LDPC codes admit low-complexity belief propagation iterative decoding and near-capacity performance, which contributed to the early interest in QLDPC codes. Then, the result promising constant overhead fault tolerance using QLDPC codes led to the search for code families that go beyond the long-holding $\sqrt{n}$ scaling barrier of minimum distance for codelength $n$. This resulted in recent breakthroughs in the construction of QLDPC codes, which, combined with efficient decoding algorithms and the development of fault-tolerant protocols operating on QLDPC-encoded quantum information, provide a promising pathway to low-overhead, fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, despite their potential, challenges remain, particularly in constructing and decoding finite-length codes that account for, or efficiently leverage, specific characteristics of quantum hardware, such as connectivity, topology, native gate sets, and noise models. This article provides an in-depth examination of QLDPC codes and their iterative decoders, catering to an information theory audience with no or limited background in quantum mechanics. We discuss the theoretical underpinnings, explore unique characteristics of quantum channels, and delineate key code constructions and decoding algorithms, ultimately highlighting the impact and future prospects of QLDPC codes in quantum information science.</description>

      <title>Physical Layer Deception based on Semantic Distortion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physical layer deception (PLD) is a framework we previously introduced that integrates physical layer security (PLS) with deception techniques, enabling proactive countermeasures against eavesdropping rather than relying solely on passive defense. We extend this framework to a semantic communication model and conduct a theoretical analysis using semantic distortion as the performance metric. In this work, we further investigate the receiver's selection of decryption strategies and the transmitter's optimization of encryption strategies. By anticipating the decryption strategy likely to be employed by the legitimate receiver and eavesdropper, the transmitter can optimize resource allocation and encryption parameters, thereby maximizing the semantic distortion at the eavesdropper while maintaining a low level of semantic distortion for the legitimate receiver. We present a rigorous analysis of the resulting optimization problem, propose an efficient optimization algorithm, and derive closed-form optimal solutions for multiple scenarios. Finally, we corroborate the theoretical findings with numerical simulations, which also confirm the practicality of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Pulse Shaping Filter Design for Integrated Sensing &amp; Communication with Zak-OTFS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zak-OTFS is an emerging framework for integrated sensing &amp; communication (ISAC) in high delay and Doppler spread environments. A critical enabler for ISAC with Zak-OTFS is the design of pulse shaping filters. For sensing, a localized pulse shaping filter enables ideal input-output (I/O) relation estimates close to the physical scattering channel. For communication, orthogonality of the pulse shape on the information lattice prevents inter-symbol interference, and no time and bandwidth expansion enables full spectral efficiency. A filter simultaneously meeting all three objectives is ideal for ISAC. Existing filter designs achieve two of the above objectives, but not all three simultaneously. For instance, the sinc filter is orthogonal and bandwidth/time-limited, but is not localized. The Gaussian filter is localized and bandwidth/time-limited, but not orthogonal. The RRC filter is localized and orthogonal, but not bandwidth/time-limited. A recently proposed hybrid Gaussian-sinc filter is more localized than the sinc filter and bandwidth/time-limited, but is not orthogonal. In this work, we design optimal pulse shaping filters meeting all three objectives via the Isotropic Orthogonal Transform Algorithm. The proposed pulse shaping filters offer improved data detection (communication) and I/O relation estimation (sensing) performance compared to existing filter choices in the literature.</description>

      <title>Quantum Voting Protocol for Centralized and Distributed Voting Based on Phase-Flip Counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel quantum voting protocol that leverages quantum superposition and entanglement to achieve secure, anonymous voting in both centralized and distributed settings. Our approach utilizes phase-flip encoding on entangled candidate states, where votes are recorded as controlled phase operations conditioned on voter identity registers. The protocol employs a simplified tallying mechanism based on candidate register measurements. We provide comprehensive mathematical formulations for a centralized single-machine model suitable for local voting systems, and a distributed quantum channel model enabling remote voting with enhanced security through entanglement verification. The efficiency of the protocol stems from its use of basic quantum gates (Hadamard and controlled-Z) and its ability to count votes through quantum measurements rather than iterative classical counting. We demonstrate the practicality of the protocol through examples with 4 voters (2 candidates) and 8 voters (3 candidates), showing exact probability preservation and correct vote tallying. The protocol ensures voter anonymity through quantum superposition, prevents double-voting through entanglement mechanisms, and can offer speedup potential for large-scale elections.</description>

Abstract: Beyond its widespread application in signal and image processing, \emph{compressed sensing} principles have been greatly applied to secure information transmission (often termed 'compressive security'). In this scenario, the measurement matrix $Q$ acts as a one time pad encryption key (in complex number domain) which can achieve perfect information-theoretic security together with other benefits such as reduced complexity and energy efficiency particularly useful in IoT. However, unless the matrix is changed for every message it is vulnerable towards known plain text attacks: only $n$ observations suffices to recover a key $Q$ with $n$ columns. In this paper, we invent and analyze a new method (termed 'Bilinear Compressive Security (BCS)') addressing these shortcomings: In addition to the linear encoding of the message $x$ with a matrix $Q$, the sender convolves the resulting vector with a randomly generated filter $h$. Assuming that $h$ and $x$ are sparse, the receiver can then recover $x$ without knowledge of $h$ from $y=h*Qx$ through blind deconvolution. We study a rather idealized known plaintext attack for recovering $Q$ from repeated observations of $y$'s for different, known $x_k$, with varying and unknown $h$ ,giving Eve a number of advantages not present in practice. Our main result for BCS states that under a weak symmetry condition on the filter $h$, recovering $Q$ will require extensive sampling from transmissions of $\Omega\left(\max\left(n,(n/s)^2\right)\right)$ messages $x_k$ if they are $s$-sparse. Remarkably, with $s=1$ it is impossible to recover the key. In this way, the scheme is much safer than standard compressed sensing even though our assumptions are much in favor towards a potential attacker.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Engagement Effectiveness of Cyber Cognitive Attacks: A Behavioral Metric for Disinformation Campaigns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As disinformation-driven cognitive attacks become increasingly sophisticated, the ability to quantify their impact is essential for advancing cybersecurity defense strategies. This paper presents a novel framework for measuring the engagement effectiveness of cognitive attacks by introducing a weighted interaction metric that accounts for both the type and volume of user engagement relative to the number of attacker-generated transmissions. Applying this model to real-world disinformation campaigns across social media platforms, we demonstrate how the metric captures not just reach but the behavioral depth of user engagement. Our findings provide new insights into the behavioral dynamics of cognitive warfare and offer actionable tools for researchers and practitioners seeking to assess and counter the spread of malicious influence online.</description>

      <title>Resilient Full-Duplex ISAC in the Face of Imperfect SI Cancellation: Globally Optimal Timeslot Allocation and Beam Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work addresses the radio resource management (RRM) design in downlink full-duplex integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) systems, jointly optimizing timeslot allocation and beam selection under imperfect self-interference cancellation. Timeslot allocation governs the distribution of discrete channel uses between sensing and communication tasks, while beam selection determines transmit and receive directions along with adaptive beamwidths. The joint design leads to a semi-infinite, nonconvex mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP), which is difficult to solve. To overcome this, we develop a tailored reformulation strategy that transforms the problem into a tractable mixed-integer linear program (MILP), enabling globally optimal solutions. Our approach provides insights into the coordinated optimization of timeslot allocation and beam selection, enhancing the efficiency of full-duplex ISAC systems while ensuring resilience against residual self-interference.</description>

      <title>On the Optimality of Gaussian Code-books for Signaling over a Two-Users Weak Gaussian Interference Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14941v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article shows that the capacity region of a 2-users weak Gaussian interference channel is achieved using Gaussian code-books. The approach relies on traversing the boundary in incremental steps. Starting from a corner point with Gaussian code-books, and relying on calculus of variation, it is shown that the end point in each step is achieved using Gaussian code-books. Optimality of Gaussian code-books is first established by limiting the random coding to independent and identically distributed scalar (single-letter) samples. Then, it is shown that the optimum solution for vector inputs coincides with the single-letter case. It is also shown that the maximum number of phases needed to realize the gain due to power allocation over time is two. It is also established that the solution to the Han-Kobayashi achievable rate region, with single letter Gaussian random code-books, achieves the optimum boundary.</description>

      <title>A Markov Chain Monte Carlo Method for Efficient Finite-Length LDPC Code Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are among the most prominent error-correction schemes. They find application to fortify various modern storage, communication, and computing systems. Protograph-based (PB) LDPC codes offer many degrees of freedom in the code design and enable fast encoding and decoding. In particular, spatially-coupled (SC) and multi-dimensional (MD) circulant-based codes are PB-LDPC codes with excellent performance. Efficient finite-length (FL) algorithms are required in order to effectively exploit the available degrees of freedom offered by SC partitioning, lifting, and MD relocations. In this paper, we propose a novel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC or MC$^2$) method to perform this FL optimization, addressing the removal of short cycles. While iterating, we draw samples from a defined distribution where the probability decreases as the number of short cycles from the previous iteration increases. We analyze our MC$^2$ method theoretically as we prove the invariance of the Markov chain where each state represents a possible partitioning or lifting arrangement. Via our simulations, we then fit the distribution of the number of cycles resulting from a given arrangement on a Gaussian distribution. We derive estimates for cycle counts that are close to the actual counts. Furthermore, we derive the order of the expected number of iterations required by our approach to reach a local minimum as well as the size of the Markov chain recurrent class. Our approach is compatible with code design techniques based on gradient-descent. Numerical results show that our MC$^2$ method generates SC codes with remarkably less number of short cycles compared with the current state-of-the-art. Moreover, to reach the same number of cycles, our method requires orders of magnitude less overall time compared with the available literature methods.</description>

      <title>Elias' Encoding from Lagrangians and Renormalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23447v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present paper we give a derivation of Elias' Omega code from physics principles by combining a constrained variational formulation of prefix coding with a renormalization flow on codeword distributions.
  Starting from a Lagrangian that minimizes average codelength under the Kraft-McMillan constraint, we show that the implied distribution is a fixed point of a coarse-graining map, yielding the canonical iterated log-sum length, asymptotically up to an additive constant.
  This establishes completeness and asymptotic optimality, and connects universal integer coding with coarse-grained entropy, uncertainty-type bounds, and entropy relations familiar from statistical physics.</description>

      <title>Loss-Complexity Landscape and Model Structure Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13543v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a framework for dualizing the Kolmogorov structure function $h_x(\alpha)$, which then allows using computable complexity proxies. We establish a mathematical analogy between information-theoretic constructs and statistical mechanics, introducing a suitable partition function and free energy functional. We explicitly prove the Legendre-Fenchel duality between the structure function and free energy, showing detailed balance of the Metropolis kernel, and interpret acceptance probabilities as information-theoretic scattering amplitudes. A susceptibility-like variance of model complexity is shown to peak precisely at loss-complexity trade-offs interpreted as phase transitions. Practical experiments with linear and tree-based regression models verify these theoretical predictions, explicitly demonstrating the interplay between the model complexity, generalization, and overfitting threshold.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Mechanisms of Human Learning: Implications for Research and Practice in Education</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning underlies nearly all human behavior and is central to education and education reform. Although recent advances in neuroscience have revealed the fundamental structure of learning processes, these insights have yet to be integrated into research and practice. Specifically, neuroscience has found that decision-making is governed by a structured process of perception, action-selection, and execution, supported by multiple neural systems with distinct memory stores and learning mechanisms. These systems extract different types of information (categorical, predictive, structural, and sequential) challenging canonical models of memory used in learning and behavioral science research by providing a mechanistic account of how humans acquire and use knowledge. Because each system learns differently, effective teaching requires alignment with system-specific processes. We propose a unified model that integrates these neuroscientific insights, bridging basic mechanisms with outcomes in education, identity, belonging, and wellbeing. By translating first principles of neural information processing into a generalizable framework, this work advances theories of skill acquisition and transfer while establishing a foundation for interdisciplinary research to refine how learning is understood and supported across domains of human behavior.</description>

      <title>Multiplicative Turing Ensembles, Pareto's Law, and Creativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study integer-valued multiplicative dynamics driven by i.i.d. prime multipliers and connect their macroscopic statistics to universal codelengths. We introduce the Multiplicative Turing Ensemble (MTE) and show how it arises naturally - though not uniquely - from ensembles of probabilistic Turing machines. Our modeling principle is variational: taking Elias' Omega codelength as an energy and imposing maximum entropy constraints yields a canonical Gibbs prior on integers and, by restriction, on primes. Under mild tail assumptions, this prior induces exponential tails for log-multipliers (up to slowly varying corrections), which in turn generate Pareto tails for additive gaps. We also prove time-average laws for the Omega codelength along MTE trajectories. Empirically, on Debian and PyPI package size datasets, a scaled Omega prior achieves the lowest KL divergence against codelength histograms. Taken together, the theory-data comparison suggests a qualitative split: machine-adapted regimes (Gibbs-aligned, finite first moment) exhibit clean averaging behavior, whereas human-generated complexity appears to sit beyond this regime, with tails heavy enough to produce an unbounded first moment, and therefore no averaging of the same kind.</description>

      <title>Soft Graph Transformer for MIMO Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12694v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the Soft Graph Transformer (SGT), a soft-input-soft-output neural architecture designed for MIMO detection. While Maximum Likelihood (ML) detection achieves optimal accuracy, its exponential complexity makes it infeasible in large systems, and conventional message-passing algorithms rely on asymptotic assumptions that often fail in finite dimensions. Recent Transformer-based detectors show strong performance but typically overlook the MIMO factor graph structure and cannot exploit prior soft information. SGT addresses these limitations by combining self-attention, which encodes contextual dependencies within symbol and constraint subgraphs, with graph-aware cross-attention, which performs structured message passing across subgraphs. Its soft-input interface allows the integration of auxiliary priors, producing effective soft outputs while maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that SGT achieves near-ML performance and offers a flexible and interpretable framework for receiver systems that leverage soft priors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This letter proposes a novel anti-interference communication method leveraging computational antennas, utilizing time averaging and 1-bit reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) to achieve robust signal modulation with minimal hardware complexity. We develop a communication model for computational antennas and propose an efficient signal processing algorithm optimized for temporal modulation. A USRP-based experimental platform is established to validate the approach under strong interference conditions (e.g., 5 dB jamming-to-signal ratio). Experimental results reveal up to an 80.9\% reduction in bit error rate (BER) and effective restoration of distorted images in transmission tests. Compared to conventional techniques like spread spectrum or frequency hopping, which require significant spectral resources, our method offers superior anti-interference performance without additional spectral overhead. This research provides valuable insights for radar detection, military communications, and next-generation wireless networks.</description>
