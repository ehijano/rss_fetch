      <title>Data-driven time-dependent bases for turbulent airfoil wake-extreme vortex gust interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze interactions between turbulent airfoil wake and an extremely strong gust using a data-driven framework with time-dependent bases. The current approach represents each snapshot with time-varying bases consisting of two-dimensional in-plane modes and one-dimensional spanwise modes, together with a reduced covariance matrix. We derive closed-form evolution equations for these time-varying components and advance them over time, requiring only a small rolling window and avoiding full-history storage. Applied to extreme vortex gust-airfoil interaction at Re=5000, we examine how in-plane modes and their associated energy level evolve across gust conditions of varying intensity and size. Before impingement, the first in-plane mode dominates; after impingement, the second mode gains energy_amplified by stronger/larger gusts. A larger leading-mode energy gap implies coherent structure and faster recovery; a smaller gap with slower decay indicates richer multiscale activity and delayed re-stabilization. These trends follow the transient lift dynamics as well, with higher amplitude and more oscillations indicated by a rise in the leading singular values. This work provides an interpretable, time-varying data-driven modal analysis of extreme gust encounter.</description>

      <title>High Order Numerical Methods Preserving Invariant Domain for Hyperbolic and Related Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Admissible states in hyperbolic systems and related equations often form a convex invariant domain. Numerical violations of this domain can lead to loss of hyperbolicity, resulting in illposedness and severe numerical instabilities. It is therefore crucial for numerical schemes to preserve the invariant domain to ensure both physically meaningful solutions and robust computations. For complex systems, constructing invariant-domain-preserving (IDP) schemes is highly nontrivial and particularly challenging for high-order accurate methods. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of IDP schemes for hyperbolic and related systems, with a focus on the most popular approaches for constructing provable IDP schemes. We first give a systematic review of the fundamental approaches for establishing the IDP property in first-order accurate schemes, covering finite difference, finite volume, finite element, and residual distribution methods. Then we focus on two widely used and actively developed classes of high order IDP schemes as well as their recent developments, most of which have emerged in the past decade. The first class of methods seeks an intrinsic weak IDP property in high-order schemes and then designs polynomial limiters to enforce a strong IDP property at the points of interest. This generic approach applies to high-order finite volume and discontinuousGalerkin schemes. The second class is based on the flux limiting approaches, which originated from the flux-corrected transport method and can be adapted to a broader range of spatial discretizations, including finite difference and continuous finite element methods. In this survey, we elucidate the main ideas in the construction of IDP schemes, provide some new perspectives and insights, with extensive examples, and numerical experiments in gas dynamics and magnetohydrodynamics.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Neural Network-Finite Element Method for the Viscous-Plastic Sea-Ice Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an efficient hybrid Neural Network-Finite Element Method (NN-FEM) for solving the viscous-plastic (VP) sea-ice model. The VP model is widely used in climate simulations to represent large-scale sea-ice dynamics. However, the strong nonlinearity introduced by the material law makes VP solvers computationally expensive, with the cost per degree of freedom increasing rapidly under mesh refinement. High spatial resolution is particularly required to capture narrow deformation bands known as linear kinematic features in viscous-plastic models. To improve computational efficiency in simulating such fine-scale deformation features, we propose to enrich coarse-mesh finite element approximations with fine-scale corrections predicted by neural networks trained with high-resolution simulations. The neural network operates locally on small patches of grid elements, which is efficient due to its relatively small size and parallel applicability across grid patches. An advantage of this local approach is that it generalizes well to different right-hand sides and computational domains, since the network operates on small subregions rather than learning details tied to a specific choice of boundary conditions, forcing, or geometry. The numerical examples quantify the runtime and evaluate the error for this hybrid approach with respect to the simulation of sea-ice deformations. Applying the learned network correction enables coarser-grid simulations to achieve qualitatively similar accuracy at approximately 11 times lower computational cost relative to the high-resolution reference simulations. Moreover, the learned correction accelerates the Newton solver by up to 10% compared to runs without the correction at the same mesh resolution.</description>

      <title>Simulating surfactant effects in phase-transforming fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surfactants are critical in natural processes and engineering, but measuring their concentrations in non-equilibrium conditions and in the presence of flow is difficult. Therefore, computational methods are a key tool for improving our understanding. Predicting the effect of surfactants on liquid-vapor transformations is particularly challenging due to (1) simultaneous mass transfer, non-equilibrium thermodynamics and Marangoni stresses, and (2) the phenomenological assumptions underlying many liquid-vapor phase-change models. Starting from the Navier-Stokes-Korteweg equations, a first-principles approach to liquid-vapor phase transformations, we developed a model of liquid-vapor flows with surfactants. We performed simulations of bubbles under equilibrium and liquid-vapor interface oscillations to demonstrate that the model successfully reproduces surfactant-mediated reductions in surface tension. We also investigated the mechanisms whereby surfactant affects bubble coalescence and condensation. Overall, this work provides a new framework for studying the effect of surfactants on liquid-vapor transformations and suggests multiple areas for future research, including the impact of complex surface chemistries on flow around bubbles and the acoustic response of bubbles with surfactants.</description>

      <title>Predicting tunable nonreciprocal spin wave generation mediated by interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in magnonic heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thin, metallic magnetic films can support nonreciprocal spin waves due to the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (iDMI). However, these films typically have high damping, making spin wave propagation distances short (less than one micrometer). In this work, we theoretically study a thin ferromagnetic strip with iDMI and excite spin waves by driving a central segment of the strip. Spin waves propagate with different amplitudes to the left versus to the right from the driving region (i.e. nonreciprocity occurs) due to the iDMI. Our calculation based on spin-wave-dispersion plus our micromagnetic simulations both show that changing the driving segment width, driving frequency and static applied field strength tunes the nonreciprocity. Our calculation based on spin-wave-dispersion, using a so-called "overlap function" will allow researchers to predict conditions of maximum nonreciprocity, without the need for computational solvers. Moreover, to circumvent the issue of short propagation distances, we propose a geometry where iDMI is only present in the driving region and low-damping materials comprise the remainder of the strip. Our calculations show significant spin wave amplitudes over several microns from the excitation region.</description>

      <title>GEARS - A Fully Run-Time Configurable Geant4 Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09246v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Geant4 toolkit is the standard for simulating the passage of particles through matter, but its conventional architecture often requires users to modify and recompile C++ code to alter fundamental simulation parameters such as geometry, physics list, and primary particle source. This architectural constraint introduces significant friction for new users and slows down the experimental iteration cycle. This paper introduces GEARS (Geant4 Example Application with Rich features yet Small footprint), a universally applicable Geant4 application that fundamentally addresses this issue. GEARS achieves complete simulation configurability without C++ recompilation by strictly utilizing external configuration methods: Geometry is defined via simple text-based configuration, the Physics List is selected via the standard PHYSLIST environment variable, and the Primary Source is defined through the General Particle Source (GPS) macro commands. Furthermore, regarding GEARS as an application instead of a framework, key features include a flat ntuple structure with short variable names for highly efficient analysis and a solution for capturing vital initial step data. Output creation is also fully managed via run-time macro commands and volume properties. The project is distributed as a ready-to-use Docker container to eliminate compilation barriers. Through these design considerations, GEARS transforms Geant4 into a practical, ready-to-use tool, enabling users to rapidly prototype and execute simulations for diverse experiments solely through simple text configuration files, without ever needing to modify or compile the underlying C++ source code.</description>

      <title>Functional Percolation: A Perspective on Criticality of Form and Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09317v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the physical constraints and minimal conditions that enable information processing in extended systems remains a central challenge across disciplines, from neuroscience and artificial intelligence to social and physical networks. Here we study how network connectivity both limits and enables information processing by analyzing random networks across the structural percolation transition. Using cascade-mediated dynamics as a minimal and universal mechanism for propagating state-dependent responses, we examine structural, functional, and information-theoretic observables as functions of mean degree in Erdos-Renyi networks. We find that the emergence of a giant connected component coincides with a sharp transition in realizable information processing: complex input-output response functions become accessible, functional diversity increases rapidly, output entropy rises, and directed information flow quantified by transfer entropy extends beyond local neighborhoods. These coincident transitions define a regime of functional percolation, referring to a sharp expansion of the space of realizable input-output functions at the structural percolation transition. Near criticality, networks exhibit a Pareto-optimal tradeoff between functional complexity and diversity, suggesting that percolation criticality provides a universal organizing principle for information processing in systems with local interactions and propagating influences.</description>

      <title>A Propagator-based Multi-level Monte Carlo Method for Kinetic Neutral Species in Edge Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and investigate a new multi-level Monte Carlo scheme for numerical solutions of the kinetic Boltzmann equation for neutral species in edge plasmas. In particular, this method explicitly exploits a key structural property of neutral particle dynamics: the prevalence of frequent collisions for which the outgoing velocity is determined by local plasma parameters. Using this property, we derive a multi-level algorithm based on collision event propagator and show, both analytically and through numerical experiments, that it reproduces the results of standard Monte Carlo methods. We further demonstrate that, in the context of coupled plasma-neutral edge simulations employing correlated Monte Carlo, the proposed scheme retains trajectory correlation to machine precision as the system evolves, whereas conventional methods exhibit rapid decorrelation. These results indicate that the propagator-based multi-level Monte Carlo scheme is a promising candidate for use in fully implicit Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov (JFNK) solvers for coupled plasma-neutral systems.</description>

      <title>Exact Screening-Ranged Expansions for Many-Body Electrostatics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09421v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an exact many-body framework for electrostatic interactions among $N$ arbitrarily charged spheres in an electrolyte, modeled by the linearized Poisson--Boltzmann equation. Building on a spectral analysis of nonstandard Neumann--Poincar\'e-type operators introduced in a companion mathematical work arXiv:2512.08684, we construct convergent screening-ranged series for the potential, interaction energy, and forces, where each term is associated with a well-defined Debye--H\"uckel screening order and can be obtained evaluating an analytical expression rather than numerically solving an infinitely dimensional linear system. This formulation unifies and extends classical and recent approaches, providing a rigorous basis for electrostatic interactions among heterogeneously charged particles (including Janus colloids) and yielding many-body generalizations of analytical explicit-form results previously available only for two-body systems. The framework captures and clarifies complex effects such as asymmetric dielectric screening, opposite-charge repulsion, and like-charge attraction, which remain largely analytically elusive in existing treatments. Beyond its fundamental significance, the method leads to numerically efficient schemes, offering a versatile tool for modeling colloids and soft/biological matter in electrolytic solution.</description>

      <title>Scalable Construction of Spiking Neural Networks using up to thousands of GPUs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diverse scientific and engineering research areas deal with discrete, time-stamped changes in large systems of interacting delay differential equations. Simulating such complex systems at scale on high-performance computing clusters demands efficient management of communication and memory. Inspired by the human cerebral cortex -- a sparsely connected network of $\mathcal{O}(10^{10})$ neurons, each forming $\mathcal{O}(10^{3})$--$\mathcal{O}(10^{4})$ synapses and communicating via short electrical pulses called spikes -- we study the simulation of large-scale spiking neural networks for computational neuroscience research. This work presents a novel network construction method for multi-GPU clusters and upcoming exascale supercomputers using the Message Passing Interface (MPI), where each process builds its local connectivity and prepares the data structures for efficient spike exchange across the cluster during state propagation. We demonstrate scaling performance of two cortical models using point-to-point and collective communication, respectively.</description>

      <title>Structural Optimization in Tensor LEED Using a Parameter Tree and $R$-Factor Gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantitative low-energy electron diffraction [LEED $I(V)$] is a powerful method for surface-structure determination, based on a direct comparison of experimentally observed $I(V)$ data with computations for a structure model. As the diffraction intensities $I$ are highly sensitive to subtle structural changes, local structure optimization is essential for assessing the validity of a structure model and finding the best-fit structure. The calculation of diffraction intensities is well established, but the large number of evaluations required for reliable structural optimization renders it computationally demanding. The computational effort is mitigated by the tensor-LEED approximation, which accelerates optimization by applying a perturbative treatment of small deviations from a reference structure. Nevertheless, optimization of complex structures is a tedious process.
  Here, the problem of surface-structure optimization is reformulated using a tree-based data structure, which helps to avoid redundant function evaluations. In the new tensor-LEED implementation presented in this work, intensities are computed on the fly, eliminating limitations of previous algorithms that are limited to precomputed values at a grid of search parameters. It also enables the use of state-of-the-art optimization algorithms. Implemented in \textsc{Python} with the JAX library, the method provides access to gradients of the $R$ factor and supports execution on graphics processing units (GPUs). Based on these developments, the computing time can be reduced by more than an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Rotational excitation of molecules in the regime of strong ro-vibrational coupling: Comparison between an optical centrifuge and a transform-limited pulse</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate theoretically the ability of an optical centrifuge - a laser pulse whose linear polarization is rotating at an accelerated rate, to control molecular rotation in the regime when the rigid-rotor approximation breaks down due to coupling between the vibrational and rotational degrees of freedom. Our analysis demonstrates that the centrifuge field enables controlled excitation of high rotational states while maintaining relatively low spread along the vibrational coordinate. We contrast this to the rotational excitation by a linearly polarized Gaussian pulse of equal spectral width and pulse energy which, although comparable to the centrifuge-induced rotation, is unavoidably accompanied by a substantial broadening of the vibrational wavepacket.</description>

      <title>Frequency-Dependent Polarization Propagator Calculation for Quantum Dots Using Optimized Inverse Krylov Subspace and Folded-Spectrum Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of the frequency response of quantum dots under electromagnetic radiation is essential for investigating absorption spectra, excitonic effects, and nonlinear optical behavior in quantum dots and semiconductor nanoparticles. The polarization propagator provides a rigorous framework for evaluating these properties, but its construction is computationally demanding. Challenges arise from the level of electron correlation, the size of the excitonic basis, and the cost of evaluating two-electron integrals. This work addresses these difficulties by developing first- and second-order frequency-dependent polarization propagator calculations for PbS and CdS quantum dots. The propagator is formulated using the electron propagator approach and expressed as the resolvent of the Hamiltonian superoperator. Light-matter interaction is treated using the dipole approximation and represented in a particle-hole excitation operator basis. The correlated ground state is treated at the MP2 level, and all response-matrix terms up to second order in the fluctuating potential are included. A frequency-dependent inverse Krylov subspace method is derived and combined with the folded-spectrum technique to isolate excitation energies within a chosen frequency window. This strategy avoids full diagonalization of the response matrix and significantly reduces computational cost for large systems. The method is implemented in a matrix-free manner in which no explicit response matrix is assembled, and all operations rely on matrix-vector products. UV-VIS excitation spectra of PbS and CdS quantum dots were computed, demonstrating that the inverse Krylov subspace projection approach provides an efficient and accurate approximation for excitation spectra when full diagonalization is computationally prohibitive.</description>

      <title>Py-DiSMech: A Scalable and Efficient Framework for Discrete Differential Geometry-Based Modeling and Control of Soft Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-fidelity simulation has become essential to the design and control of soft robots, where large geometric deformations and complex contact interactions challenge conventional modeling tools. Recent advances in the field demand simulation frameworks that combine physical accuracy, computational scalability, and seamless integration with modern control and optimization pipelines. In this work, we present Py-DiSMech, a Python-based, open-source simulation framework for modeling and control of soft robotic structures grounded in the principles of Discrete Differential Geometry (DDG). By discretizing geometric quantities such as curvature and strain directly on meshes, Py-DiSMech captures the nonlinear deformation of rods, shells, and hybrid structures with high fidelity and reduced computational cost. The framework introduces (i) a fully vectorized NumPy implementation achieving order-of-magnitude speed-ups over existing geometry-based simulators; (ii) a penalty-energy-based fully implicit contact model that supports rod-rod, rod-shell, and shell-shell interactions; (iii) a natural-strain-based feedback-control module featuring a proportional-integral (PI) controller for shape regulation and trajectory tracking; and (iv) a modular, object-oriented software design enabling user-defined elastic energies, actuation schemes, and integration with machine-learning libraries. Benchmark comparisons demonstrate that Py-DiSMech substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art simulator Elastica in computational efficiency while maintaining physical accuracy. Together, these features establish Py-DiSMech as a scalable, extensible platform for simulation-driven design, control validation, and sim-to-real research in soft robotics.</description>

      <title>ChemGen: Code Generation for Multispecies Chemically Reacting Flow Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10005v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces ChemGen, a software package that uses code generation to integrate multispecies thermodynamics and chemical kinetics into C+-based computational physics codes. ChemGen aims to make chemical kinetics more accessible in existing simulation frameworks and help bridge the gap between combustion modeling and computational physics. The package employs the concept of decorators which enable flexible C++ code generation to target established software ecosystems. ChemGen generates code to evaluate thermodynamic properties, chemical source terms, and their analytical derivatives for Jacobian calculations. Also included are a variety of implicit time integration schemes, linear solvers, and preconditioners. The various components of Chemgen are verified by demonstrating agreement with Cantera and/or theoretical convergence rates. Finally, we integrate ChemGen into OpenFOAM and achieve a speedup over its native chemistry solver by approximately four times. ChemGen is an ongoing project released under the NRL Open License, a source-available license provided by the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory.</description>

      <title>Matrix-free algorithms for fast ab initio calculations on distributed CPU architectures using finite-element discretization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finite-element (FE) discretisations have emerged as a powerful real-space alternative to large-scale Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) calculations, offering systematic convergence, excellent parallel scalability, while accommodating generic boundary conditions. However, the dominant computational bottleneck in FE-based DFT arises from the repeated application of the discretised sparse Hamiltonian to large blocks of trial vectors during iterations in an iterative eigensolver. Traditional sparse matrix-vector multiplications and FE cell-matrix approaches encounter memory limitations and high data-movement overheads, particularly at higher polynomial orders, typically used in DFT calculations. To overcome these challenges, this work develops matrix-free algorithms for FE-discretised DFT that substantially accelerate these products by doing on-the-fly operations that utilize structured tensor contractions over 1D basis functions and quadrature data. A unified multilevel batched data layout that handles both real and complex-valued operators is introduced to maximise cache reuse and SIMD utilisation on Frontier (AVX2), Param Pravega (AVX512) and Fugaku (SVE). We also combine terms for optimal cache reuse, even-odd decomposition to reduce FLOP, and mixed-precision intrinsics. Extensive benchmarks show that for large multivector pseudopotential DFT calculations, the matrix-free kernels deliver 1.5-4x speedups over the state-of-the-art cell-matrix approach baselines. For all-electron DFT calculations, the matrix-free operator achieves gains of up to 5.8x due to its efficient implementation and superior arithmetic intensity. When integrated with an error-tolerant Chebyshev-filtered subspace iteration eigensolver, the matrix-free formalism yields substantial reductions in end-to-end time-to-solution using FE meshes that deliver desired accuracies in ground-state properties.</description>

      <title>Pre-training, fine-tuning, and distillation (PFD): Automatically generating machine learning force fields from universal models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20809v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Universal force fields generalizable across the periodic table represent a new trend in computational materials science. However, the applications of universal force fields in material simulations are limited by their slow inference speed and the lack of first-principles accuracy. Instead of building a single model simultaneously satisfying these characteristics, a strategy that quickly generates material-specific models from the universal model may be more feasible. Here, we propose a new workflow pattern, PFD (Pre-training, Fine-tuning, and Distillation), which automatically generates machine-learning force fields for specific materials from a pre-trained universal model through fine-tuning and distillation. By fine-tuning the pre-trained model, our PFD workflow generates force fields with first-principles accuracy while requiring one to two orders of magnitude less training data compared to traditional methods. The inference speed of the generated force field is further improved through distillation, meeting the requirements of large-scale molecular simulations. Comprehensive testing across diverse materials including complex systems, such as amorphous carbon, interface, etc., reveals marked enhancements in training efficiency, which suggests the PFD workflow a practical and reliable approach for force field generation in computational material sciences.</description>

      <title>Adjoint path-kernel method for backpropagation and data assimilation in unstable diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the adjoint path-kernel method for computing parameter-gradients (linear responses) of SDEs. Its cost is almost independent of the number of parameters, and it works for non-hyperbolic systems with parameter-controlled multiplicative noise. With this new formula, we extend the conventional backpropagation method to settings with gradient explosion, and demonstrate it on the 40-dimensional Lorenz 96 system.
  Moreover, we consider a difficult version of the 4D-Var data assimilation problem where (1) the deterministic part of the model is chaotic, (2) the loss is a single long-time functional accounting for discrepancies in both the observations and the dynamics, (3) some parameters in the dynamics are unknown, and (4) some coordinates of the states cannot be observed, and cannot be reasonably inferred from other coordinates within a short time. We model the correction term at each time-step separately as a parameterized function of the random state. With our new tool, we can run stochastic gradient descent to find the path and parameters that best match the low-dimensional observation data. We demonstrate this on the 10D Lorenz-96 system with 8D observations.</description>

      <title>Stoquasticity is not enough: towards a sharper diagnostic for Quantum Monte Carlo simulability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods are powerful tools for simulating quantum many-body systems, yet their applicability is limited by the infamous sign problem. We approach this challenge through the lens of Vanishing Geometric Phases (VGP) \cite{Hen_2021}, introducing it as a `geometric' criterion for diagnosing QMC simulability. We characterize the class of VGP Hamiltonians, and analyze the complexity of recognizing this class, identifying both hard and efficiently identifiable cases. We further highlight the practical advantage of the VGP criterion by exhibiting specific Hamiltonians that are readily identified as sign-problem-free through VGP, yet whose stoquasticity is difficult to ascertain. These examples underscore the efficiency and sharpness of VGP as a diagnostic tool compared to stoquasticity-based heuristics. Beyond classification, we propose a family of VGP-inspired diagnostics that serve as quantitative indicators of sign problem severity. While exact evaluation of these quantities is generically intractable, we demonstrate their mathematical power in performing scaling analysis for the average sign under unitary transformations. Our results provide both a conceptual foundation and practical tools for understanding and mitigating the sign problem.</description>

      <title>Bayesian power spectral density estimation for LISA noise based on P-splines with a parametric boost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flexible and accurate noise characterization is crucial for the precise estimation of gravitational-wave parameters. We introduce a Bayesian method for estimating the power spectral density (PSD) of long, stationary time series, explicitly tailored for LISA data analysis. Our approach models the PSD as the geometric mean of a parametric and a nonparametric component, combining the knowledge from parametric models with the flexibility to capture deviations from theoretical expectations. The nonparametric component is expressed by a mixture of penalized B-splines. Adaptive, data-driven knot placement, performed once at initialization, removes the need for reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo, while hierarchical roughness-penalty priors prevent overfitting. Validation on simulated autoregressive AR(4) data demonstrates estimator consistency and shows that well-matched parametric components reduce the integrated absolute error compared to an uninformative baseline, requiring fewer spline knots to achieve comparable accuracy. Applied to one year of simulated LISA X-channel (univariate) noise, our method achieves relative integrated absolute errors of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})$, making it suitable for iterative analysis pipelines and multi-year mission data sets.</description>

      <title>Optimized Single-Core PCF-Based SPR Biosensor for High-Performance Early-Stage Multi-Cancer Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17283v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we present a highly sensitive Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)-based biosensor integrated with a circular-lattice Photonic Crystal Fiber (PCF) for early-stage cancer detection. The proposed sensor leverages the synergy between SPR and PCF technologies to overcome the bulkiness and limited sensitivity of traditional SPR systems. A thin gold (Au) layer, responsible for plasmon excitation, is deposited on the fiber structure, while a nanolayer of vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) is introduced to enhance adhesion between the gold and the silica background, improving structural stability and field confinement. The sensor is designed to detect refractive index (RI) variations in biological analytes, specifically targeting cancerous cells from skin, blood, and adrenal gland tissues. The optical characteristics and performance of the sensor were thoroughly analyzed using the Finite Element Method (FEM) in COMSOL Multiphysics 6.1, allowing for precise simulation and optimization. The sensor demonstrates high sensitivity within the RI range of 1.360-1.395, corresponding to the RI values of the target cancer cells. Remarkable wavelength sensitivities of 21,250 nm/RIU, 53,571 nm/RIU, and 103,571 nm/RIU were achieved for skin, blood, and adrenal gland cancers, respectively. In addition, a maximum figure of merit (FOM) of 306.424 RIU^-1 and a spectral resolution (SR) of 9.57x10^-7 RIU further affirm the sensor's exceptional detection capabilities. These findings indicate the proposed SPR-PCF sensor's strong potential for real-time, label-free biosensing applications, particularly in precise and early cancer diagnostics.</description>

      <title>N\'eel-Vector-Orientation Induced Intrinsic Half-Metallicity in Two-Dimensional Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Whether a zero-moment antiferromagnet can host an intrinsic half-metallic ground state with a single-spin Fermi surface remains an open question in antiferromagnetic spintronics. Existing proposals in compensated magnets reach only transport analogues of this limit and do not realize a genuine AFM half-metallic ground state with a single-spin Fermi surface. Here we show that in two-dimensional altermagnets the N\'eel-vector orientation acts as an intrinsic knob for magnetic-space-group reduction that lifts the degeneracy between spin sectors. Using Janus monolayer Ta$_2$TeSeO as a realistic and clean platform and combining symmetry analysis with first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that rotating the N\'eel vector first breaks the relevant mirror symmetry, opening a gap in one spin sector of symmetry-related Weyl pairs, and then breaks the residual $C_{2z}$ symmetry, shifting the remaining Weyl cones in opposite energy directions so that a single spin sector retains a Fermi surface at the Fermi level. These two symmetry-lowering steps convert a compensated altermagnetic Weyl semimetal into an intrinsic AFM half-metal. The nearly degenerate in-plane magnetic anisotropy then enables reversible switching between the two spin channels using minute strain or weak anisotropic fields. Because this mechanism relies solely on N\'eel-vector-induced symmetry reduction, it provides a general low-power route to intrinsic half-metallicity in compensated altermagnetic Weyl semimetals.</description>

      <title>Challenges in predicting positron annihilation lifetimes in lead halide perovskites: correlation functionals and polymorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06926v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Halide perovskites have emerged in the last decade as a new important class of semiconductors for a variety of optoelectronic applications. A lot of previous studies were thus devoted to the characterisation of their point defects. Positron annihilation spectroscopy is a well recognized tool for probing vacancies in materials. Recent applications of this technique to APbX$_3$ halide perovskites are sparse, and the rare theoretical predictions of positron lifetimes in these materials, published in association with experiments, do not fully agree with each other. These works suggest that vacancies on the A site are not detected.
  In our theoretical study we focus on the role of the electron-positron correlation functional. We thoroughly revisit and compare several approximations when applied to methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI$_3$) with or without vacancies, as well as inorganic perovskites CsPbI$_3$ and CsPbBr$_3$, in various phases. We show also the relationship between the size of the voids, through Voronoi volumes, and the calculated lifetimes. For the cubic phases we investigate in detail the role of polymorphism, including the distribution of vacancy formation energies and positron annihilation lifetimes.
  In our lifetimes calculations, apart from older and more recent semi-local approximations for the electron-positron correlation potential, we also consider the weighted density approximation (WDA), which is truly non-local and should better describe positron annihilation in regions with strong electronic density variations. We show that for this class of materials, and especially for cations vacancies, the influence of the chosen approximation is crucial, much stronger than in metals, alloys and conventional semiconductors. This influence may induce to reconsider the interpretation of experimentally determined lifetimes.</description>

      <title>PyMieDiff: A differentiable Mie scattering library</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Light scattering by spherical-shaped particles of sizes comparable to the wavelength is foundational in many areas of science, from chemistry to atmospheric science, photonics and nanotechnology. With the new capabilities offered by machine learning, there is a great interest in end-to-end differentiable frameworks for scattering calculations. Here we introduce PyMieDiff, a fully differentiable, GPU-compatible implementation of Mie scattering for core-shell particles in PyTorch. The library provides native, autograd-compatible spherical Bessel and Hankel functions, vectorized evaluation of Mie coefficients, and APIs for computing efficiencies, angular scattering, and near-fields. All inputs - geometry, material dispersion, wavelengths, and observation angles and positions - are represented as tensors, enabling seamless integration with gradient-based optimisation or physics-informed neural networks. The toolkit can also be combined with "TorchGDM" for end-to-end differentiable multi-particle scattering simulations. PyMieDiff is available under an open source licence at https://github.com/UoS-Integrated-Nanophotonics-group/MieDiff.</description>
