      <title>Universal Efimov Scaling in the Rabi-Coupled Few-Body Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of the Efimov effect -- a universal quantum few-body phenomenon -- in the presence of an external driving field. Specifically, we consider up to three bosonic atoms, such as $^{133}$Cs, interacting with a light atom, such as $^{6}$Li, where the latter has two internal spin states $\{\uparrow, \downarrow\}$ that are Rabi coupled. Assuming that only the spin-$\uparrow$ light atom interacts with the bosons, we find that the Rabi drive transposes the entire Efimov spectrum such that the Efimov trimers and tetramers are centered around the Rabi-shifted two-body scattering resonance. Crucially, we show that the Rabi drive preserves the trimers' discrete scaling symmetry, while universally shifting the Efimov three-body parameter, leading to a log-periodic modulation in the spectrum as the Rabi drive is varied. Our results suggest that Efimov physics can be conveniently explored using an applied driving field, opening up the prospect of an externally tunable three-body parameter.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic attractor in periodically driven ultracold quantum gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrodynamic attractors are a universal phenomenon of strongly interacting systems that describe the hydrodynamic-like evolution far from local equilibrium. In particular, the rapid hydrodynamization of the Quark-Gluon Plasma is behind the remarkable success of hydrodynamic models of high-energy nuclear collisions. So far, hydrodynamic attractors have been explored only in systems undergoing monotonic expansion, such as Bjorken flow. We demonstrate that a system with an oscillating isotropic expansion exhibits a novel cyclic attractor behavior. This phenomenon can be investigated in ultracold quantum gases with externally modulated scattering length, offering a new avenue for experimentally discovering hydrodynamic attractors.</description>

      <title>Impurities in a trapped 1D Bose gas of arbitrary interaction strength: localization-delocalization transition and absence of self-localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss impurities in a one-dimensional Bose gas with arbitrary boson-boson and boson-impurity interactions. To fully account for quantum effects, we employ numerical simulations based on the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) and - in the regime of strong boson-boson interactions - the mapping to weakly interacting fermions. A mean-field description of the Bose polaron based on coupled Gross-Pitaevski -- Schr\"odinger equations predicts the existence of a self-localized polaron. We here show that such a solution does not exist and is an artifact of the underlying decoupling approximation. To this end we consider a mobile impurity in a box potential. Our work demonstrates that correlations between the impurity position and the bosons are important even in the limit where mean-field approaches are expected to work well. Furthermore we derive analytical approximations for the energy of a single polaron formed by a heavy impurity for arbitrary interaction strengths and large but finite boson-boson couplings which accurately reproduce DMRG results. This demonstrates that the polaron problem of a heavy impurity in a 1D Bose gas can be accurately approximated by a proper mean-field description plus a linearized treatment of quantum fluctuations for arbitrary boson-boson and impurity-boson couplings. Finally we determine the polaron-polaron interaction potential $V(r)$ in Born-Oppenheimer approximation for small and intermediate distances $r$, which in the Tonks gas limit is oscillatory due to Friedel oscillations in the Bose gas.</description>

      <title>Numerical investigation of quantum phases and phase transitions in a two-leg ladder of Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Experiments on chains of Rydberg atoms appear as a new playground to study quantum phase transitions in 1D. As a natural extension, we report a quantitative ground-state phase diagram of Rydberg atoms arranged in a two-leg ladder that interact via van der Waals potential. We address this problem numerically, using the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm. Our results suggest that, surprisingly enough, $\mathbb{Z}_k$ crystalline phases, with the exception of the checkerboard phase, appear in pairs characterized by the same pattern of occupied rungs but distinguishable by a spontaneously broken $\tilde{\mathbb{Z}}_2$ symmetry between the two legs of the ladder. Within each pair, the two phases are separated by a continuous transition in the Ising universality class, which eventually fuses with the $\mathbb{Z}_k$ transition, whose nature depends on $k$. According to our results, the transition into the $\mathbb{Z}_2\otimes \tilde{\mathbb{Z}}_2$ phase changes its nature multiple of times and, over extended intervals, falls first into the Ashkin-Teller, latter into the $\mathbb{Z}_4$-chiral universality class and finally in a two step-process mediated by a floating phase. The transition into the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ phase with resonant states on the rungs belongs to the three-state Potts universality class at the commensurate point, to the $\mathbb{Z}_3$-chiral Huse-Fisher universality class away from it, and eventually it is through an intermediate floating phase. The Ising transition between $\mathbb{Z}_3$ and $\mathbb{Z}_3\otimes \tilde{\mathbb{Z}}_2$ phases, coming across the floating phase, opens the possibility to realize lattice supersymmetry in Rydberg quantum simulators.</description>
