      <title>LLM Agents can Autonomously Exploit One-day Vulnerabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLMs have becoming increasingly powerful, both in their benign and malicious uses. With the increase in capabilities, researchers have been increasingly interested in their ability to exploit cybersecurity vulnerabilities. In particular, recent work has conducted preliminary studies on the ability of LLM agents to autonomously hack websites. However, these studies are limited to simple vulnerabilities.
  In this work, we show that LLM agents can autonomously exploit one-day vulnerabilities in real-world systems. To show this, we collected a dataset of 15 one-day vulnerabilities that include ones categorized as critical severity in the CVE description. When given the CVE description, GPT-4 is capable of exploiting 87% of these vulnerabilities compared to 0% for every other model we test (GPT-3.5, open-source LLMs) and open-source vulnerability scanners (ZAP and Metasploit). Fortunately, our GPT-4 agent requires the CVE description for high performance: without the description, GPT-4 can exploit only 7% of the vulnerabilities. Our findings raise questions around the widespread deployment of highly capable LLM agents.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Security of Ultra/Hyper Reliable Low Latency Communication: Recent Advancements, Challenges, and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-reliable low latency communication (URLLC) is an innovative service offered by fifth-generation (5G) wireless systems. URLLC enables various mission-critical applications by facilitating reliable and low-latency signal transmission to support extreme Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. Apart from reliability and latency, ensuring secure data transmission for URLLC has been a prominent issue for researchers in recent years. Using finite blocklength signals to achieve the stringent reliability and latency criteria in URLLC eliminates the possibility of using conventional complex cryptographic security enhancement techniques based on encoding and decoding of secret keys. Thus, the development of lightweight security mechanisms is of paramount importance for URLLC. Recently, Physical-Layer Security (PLS) techniques have emerged as a powerful alternative to the complex cryptography-based security approaches for facilitating secure URLLC by exploiting the randomness of the wireless channel. Therefore, in this survey, we present a comprehensive and in-depth review of the state-of-the-art PLS enhancements utilized to unleash secure URLLC while analyzing the impact of various system design parameters on its performance. Moreover, the survey incorporates a detailed overview of the recent advancements in ensuring secure URLLC using PLS in various mission-critical applications, and 5G URLLC enabling technologies like non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), multi-antenna systems, cooperative communication using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), and intelligent reflective surfaces (IRS). Apart from this, we briefly discuss the role of advanced Machine Learning (ML) techniques in designing robust and intelligent PLS schemes for URLLC service.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Cryptanalysis of IoT Encryption Algorithms : Is Quota Sampling the Answer?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid growth in the number of small sensor devices known as the Internet of Things (IoT) has seen the development of lightweight encryption algorithms. Two well-known lightweight algorithms are SIMON and SIMECK which have been specifically designed for use on resource-constrained IoT devices. These lightweight encryption algorithms are based on the efficient Feistel block structure which is known to exhibit vulnerabilities to differential cryptanalysis. Consequently, it is necessary to test these algorithms for resilience against such attacks. While existing state-of-the-art research has demonstrated novel heuristic methods of differential cryptanalysis that improve time efficiency on previous techniques, the large state sizes of these encryption algorithms inhibit cryptanalysis time efficiency. In this paper, we introduce Versatile Investigative Sampling Technique for Advanced Cryptanalysis (VISTA-CRYPT) - a time-efficient enhancement of differential cryptanalysis of lightweight encryption algorithms. The proposed technique introduces a simple framework of quota sampling that produces state-of-the-art results with time reductions of up to $76\%$ over existing techniques. Further, we present a preliminary graph-based analysis of the output differentials for the identification of relationships within the data and future research opportunities to further enhance the performance of differential cryptanalysis. The code designed for this work and associated datasets will be available at https://github.com/johncook1979/simon-cryptanalysis.</description>

      <title>Evaluation Framework for Quantum Security Risk Assessment: A Comprehensive Study for Quantum-Safe Migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of large-scale quantum computing poses a significant threat to traditional cryptographic security measures. Quantum attacks undermine current asymmetric cryptographic algorithms, rendering them ineffective. Even symmetric key cryptography is vulnerable, albeit to a lesser extent, suggesting longer keys or extended hash functions for security. Thus, current cryptographic solutions are inadequate against emerging quantum threats. Organizations must transition to quantum-safe environments with robust continuity plans and meticulous risk management. This study explores the challenges of migrating to quantum-safe cryptographic states, introducing a comprehensive security risk assessment framework. We propose a security risk assessment framework that examines vulnerabilities across algorithms, certificates, and protocols throughout the migration process (pre-migration, during migration, post-migration). We link these vulnerabilities to the STRIDE threat model to assess their impact and likelihood. Then, we discuss practical mitigation strategies for critical components like algorithms, public key infrastructures, and protocols. Our study not only identifies potential attacks and vulnerabilities at each layer and migration stage but also suggests possible countermeasures and alternatives to enhance system resilience, empowering organizations to construct a secure infrastructure for the quantum era. Through these efforts, we establish the foundation for enduring security in networked systems amid the challenges of the quantum era.</description>

      <title>Navigating Quantum Security Risks in Networked Environments: A Comprehensive Study of Quantum-Safe Network Protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of quantum computing poses a formidable security challenge to network protocols traditionally safeguarded by classical cryptographic algorithms. This paper provides an exhaustive analysis of vulnerabilities introduced by quantum computing in a diverse array of widely utilized security protocols across the layers of the TCP/IP model, including TLS, IPsec, SSH, PGP, and more. Our investigation focuses on precisely identifying vulnerabilities susceptible to exploitation by quantum adversaries at various migration stages for each protocol while also assessing the associated risks and consequences for secure communication. We delve deep into the impact of quantum computing on each protocol, emphasizing potential threats posed by quantum attacks and scrutinizing the effectiveness of post-quantum cryptographic solutions. Through carefully evaluating vulnerabilities and risks that network protocols face in the post-quantum era, this study provides invaluable insights to guide the development of appropriate countermeasures. Our findings contribute to a broader comprehension of quantum computing's influence on network security and offer practical guidance for protocol designers, implementers, and policymakers in addressing the challenges stemming from the advancement of quantum computing. This comprehensive study is a crucial step toward fortifying the security of networked environments in the quantum age.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Construction Approach for All $4\times 4$ Involutory MDS Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maximum distance separable (MDS) matrices play a crucial role not only in coding theory but also in the design of block ciphers and hash functions. Of particular interest are involutory MDS matrices, which facilitate the use of a single circuit for both encryption and decryption in hardware implementations. In this article, we present several characterizations of involutory MDS matrices of even order. Additionally, we introduce a new matrix form for obtaining all involutory MDS matrices of even order and compare it with other matrix forms available in the literature. We then propose a technique to systematically construct all $4 \times 4$ involutory MDS matrices over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$. This method significantly reduces the search space by focusing on involutory MDS class representative matrices, leading to the generation of all such matrices within a substantially smaller set compared to considering all $4 \times 4$ involutory matrices. Specifically, our approach involves searching for these representative matrices within a set of cardinality $(2^m-1)^5$. Through this method, we provide an explicit enumeration of the total number of $4 \times 4$ involutory MDS matrices over $\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$ for $m=3,4,\ldots,8$.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks and Centralized Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) represents a shift in the digital infrastructure of today's Internet. While Centralized Service Providers (CSP) monopolize cloud computing, DePINs aim to enhance data sovereignty and confidentiality and increase resilience against a single point of failure. Due to the novelty of the emerging field of DePIN, this work focuses on the potential of DePINs to disrupt traditional centralized architectures by taking advantage of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices and crypto-economic design in combination with blockchains. This combination yields Acurast, a more distributed, resilient, and user-centric physical infrastructure deployment. Through comparative analysis with centralized systems, particularly in serverless computing contexts, this work seeks to lay the first steps in scientifically evaluating DePINs and quantitatively comparing them in terms of efficiency and effectiveness in real-world applications. The findings suggest DePINs' potential to (i) reduce trust assumptions and physically decentralized infrastructure, (ii) increase efficiency and performance simultaneously while improving the computation's (iii) confidentiality and verifiability.</description>

      <title>Subtoxic Questions: Dive Into Attitude Change of LLM's Response in Jailbreak Attempts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) of Prompt Jailbreaking are getting more and more attention, it is of great significance to raise a generalized research paradigm to evaluate attack strengths and a basic model to conduct subtler experiments. In this paper, we propose a novel approach by focusing on a set of target questions that are inherently more sensitive to jailbreak prompts, aiming to circumvent the limitations posed by enhanced LLM security. Through designing and analyzing these sensitive questions, this paper reveals a more effective method of identifying vulnerabilities in LLMs, thereby contributing to the advancement of LLM security. This research not only challenges existing jailbreaking methodologies but also fortifies LLMs against potential exploits.</description>

      <title>Manifest V3 Unveiled: Navigating the New Era of Browser Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Introduced over a decade ago, Chrome extensions now exceed 200,000 in number. In 2020, Google announced a shift in extension development with Manifest Version 3 (V3), aiming to replace the previous Version 2 (V2) by January 2023. This deadline was later extended to January 2025. The company's decision is grounded in enhancing three main pillars: privacy, security, and performance. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the Manifest V3 ecosystem. We start by investigating the adoption rate of V3, detailing the percentage of adoption from its announcement up until 2024. Our findings indicate, prior to the 2023 pause, less than 5% of all extensions had transitioned to V3, despite the looming deadline for the complete removal of V2, while currently nine out of ten new extensions are being uploaded in Manifest V3. Furthermore, we compare the security and privacy enhancements between V2 and V3 and we evaluate the improved security attributable to V3's safer APIs, examining how certain APIs, which were vulnerable or facilitated malicious behavior, have been deprecated or removed in V3. We dynamically execute 517 confirmed malicious extensions and we see a 87.8% removal of APIs related to malicious behavior due to the improvements of V3. We discover that only 154 (29.8%) of these extensions remain functional post-conversion. This analysis leads to the conclusion that V3 reduces the avenues for abuse of such APIs. However, despite the reduction in APIs associated with malicious activities, the new Manifest V3 protocol is not immune to such behavior. Our research demonstrates, through a proof of concept, the adaptability of malicious activities to V3. After the proof of concept changes are applied, we showcase 290 (56%) of the examined malicious extensions retain their capability to conduct harmful activities within the V3 framework.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Neural Control Flow Execution: An Agent-Based Deep Equilibrium Approach for Binary Vulnerability Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Software vulnerabilities are a challenge in cybersecurity. Manual security patches are often difficult and slow to be deployed, while new vulnerabilities are created. Binary code vulnerability detection is less studied and more complex compared to source code, and this has important practical implications. Deep learning has become an efficient and powerful tool in the security domain, where it provides end-to-end and accurate prediction. Modern deep learning approaches learn the program semantics through sequence and graph neural networks, using various intermediate representation of programs, such as abstract syntax trees (AST) or control flow graphs (CFG). Due to the complex nature of program execution, the output of an execution depends on the many program states and inputs. Also, a CFG generated from static analysis can be an overestimation of the true program flow. Moreover, the size of programs often does not allow a graph neural network with fixed layers to aggregate global information. To address these issues, we propose DeepEXE, an agent-based implicit neural network that mimics the execution path of a program. We use reinforcement learning to enhance the branching decision at every program state transition and create a dynamic environment to learn the dependency between a vulnerability and certain program states. An implicitly defined neural network enables nearly infinite state transitions until convergence, which captures the structural information at a higher level. The experiments are conducted on two semi-synthetic and two real-world datasets. We show that DeepEXE is an accurate and efficient method and outperforms the state-of-the-art vulnerability detection methods.</description>

      <title>FCert: Certifiably Robust Few-Shot Classification in the Era of Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Few-shot classification with foundation models (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2, PaLM-2) enables users to build an accurate classifier with a few labeled training samples (called support samples) for a classification task. However, an attacker could perform data poisoning attacks by manipulating some support samples such that the classifier makes the attacker-desired, arbitrary prediction for a testing input. Empirical defenses cannot provide formal robustness guarantees, leading to a cat-and-mouse game between the attacker and defender. Existing certified defenses are designed for traditional supervised learning, resulting in sub-optimal performance when extended to few-shot classification. In our work, we propose FCert, the first certified defense against data poisoning attacks to few-shot classification. We show our FCert provably predicts the same label for a testing input under arbitrary data poisoning attacks when the total number of poisoned support samples is bounded. We perform extensive experiments on benchmark few-shot classification datasets with foundation models released by OpenAI, Meta, and Google in both vision and text domains. Our experimental results show our FCert: 1) maintains classification accuracy without attacks, 2) outperforms existing state-of-the-art certified defenses for data poisoning attacks, and 3) is efficient and general.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Speech Anonymization on Pathology and Its Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integration of speech into healthcare has intensified privacy concerns due to its potential as a non-invasive biomarker containing individual biometric information. In response, speaker anonymization aims to conceal personally identifiable information while retaining crucial linguistic content. However, the application of anonymization techniques to pathological speech, a critical area where privacy is especially vital, has not been extensively examined. This study investigates anonymization's impact on pathological speech across over 2,700 speakers from multiple German institutions, focusing on privacy, pathological utility, and demographic fairness. We explore both training-based and signal processing-based anonymization methods, and document substantial privacy improvements across disorders-evidenced by equal error rate increases up to 1933%, with minimal overall impact on utility. Specific disorders such as Dysarthria, Dysphonia, and Cleft Lip and Palate experienced minimal utility changes, while Dysglossia showed slight improvements. Our findings underscore that the impact of anonymization varies substantially across different disorders. This necessitates disorder-specific anonymization strategies to optimally balance privacy with diagnostic utility. Additionally, our fairness analysis revealed consistent anonymization effects across most of the demographics. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of anonymization in pathological speech for enhancing privacy, while also highlighting the importance of customized approaches to account for inversion attacks.</description>

      <title>HCL-MTSAD: Hierarchical Contrastive Consistency Learning for Accurate Detection of Industrial Multivariate Time Series Anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multivariate Time Series (MTS) anomaly detection focuses on pinpointing samples that diverge from standard operational patterns, which is crucial for ensuring the safety and security of industrial applications. The primary challenge in this domain is to develop representations capable of discerning anomalies effectively. The prevalent methods for anomaly detection in the literature are predominantly reconstruction-based and predictive in nature. However, they typically concentrate on a single-dimensional instance level, thereby not fully harnessing the complex associations inherent in industrial MTS. To address this issue, we propose a novel self-supervised hierarchical contrastive consistency learning method for detecting anomalies in MTS, named HCL-MTSAD. It innovatively leverages data consistency at multiple levels inherent in industrial MTS, systematically capturing consistent associations across four latent levels-measurement, sample, channel, and process. By developing a multi-layer contrastive loss, HCL-MTSAD can extensively mine data consistency and spatio-temporal association, resulting in more informative representations. Subsequently, an anomaly discrimination module, grounded in self-supervised hierarchical contrastive learning, is designed to detect timestamp-level anomalies by calculating multi-scale data consistency. Extensive experiments conducted on six diverse MTS datasets retrieved from real cyber-physical systems and server machines, in comparison with 20 baselines, indicate that HCL-MTSAD's anomaly detection capability outperforms the state-of-the-art benchmark models by an average of 1.8\% in terms of F1 score.</description>

      <title>Practical Region-level Attack against Segment Anything Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Segment Anything Models (SAM) have made significant advancements in image segmentation, allowing users to segment target portions of an image with a single click (i.e., user prompt). Given its broad applications, the robustness of SAM against adversarial attacks is a critical concern. While recent works have explored adversarial attacks against a pre-defined prompt/click, their threat model is not yet realistic: (1) they often assume the user-click position is known to the attacker (point-based attack), and (2) they often operate under a white-box setting with limited transferability. In this paper, we propose a more practical region-level attack where attackers do not need to know the precise user prompt. The attack remains effective as the user clicks on any point on the target object in the image, hiding the object from SAM. Also, by adapting a spectrum transformation method, we make the attack more transferable under a black-box setting. Both control experiments and testing against real-world SAM services confirm its effectiveness.</description>

Abstract: Adversarial attacks induce misclassification by introducing subtle perturbations. Recently, diffusion models are applied to the image classifiers to improve adversarial robustness through adversarial training or by purifying adversarial noise. However, diffusion-based adversarial training often encounters convergence challenges and high computational expenses. Additionally, diffusion-based purification inevitably causes data shift and is deemed susceptible to stronger adaptive attacks. To tackle these issues, we propose the Truth Maximization Diffusion Classifier (TMDC), a generative Bayesian classifier that builds upon pre-trained diffusion models and the Bayesian theorem. Unlike data-driven classifiers, TMDC, guided by Bayesian principles, utilizes the conditional likelihood from diffusion models to determine the class probabilities of input images, thereby insulating against the influences of data shift and the limitations of adversarial training. Moreover, to enhance TMDC's resilience against more potent adversarial attacks, we propose an optimization strategy for diffusion classifiers. This strategy involves post-training the diffusion model on perturbed datasets with ground-truth labels as conditions, guiding the diffusion model to learn the data distribution and maximizing the likelihood under the ground-truth labels. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CIFAR10 dataset against heavy white-box attacks and strong adaptive attacks. Specifically, TMDC achieves robust accuracies of 82.81% against $l_{\infty}$ norm-bounded perturbations and 86.05% against $l_{2}$ norm-bounded perturbations, respectively, with $\epsilon=0.05$.</description>

      <title>Online Safety Analysis for LLMs: a Benchmark, an Assessment, and a Path Forward</title>

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have seen widespread applications across numerous fields, their limited interpretability poses concerns regarding their safe operations from multiple aspects, e.g., truthfulness, robustness, and fairness. Recent research has started developing quality assurance methods for LLMs, introducing techniques such as offline detector-based or uncertainty estimation methods. However, these approaches predominantly concentrate on post-generation analysis, leaving the online safety analysis for LLMs during the generation phase an unexplored area. To bridge this gap, we conduct in this work a comprehensive evaluation of the effectiveness of existing online safety analysis methods on LLMs. We begin with a pilot study that validates the feasibility of detecting unsafe outputs in the early generation process. Following this, we establish the first publicly available benchmark of online safety analysis for LLMs, including a broad spectrum of methods, models, tasks, datasets, and evaluation metrics. Utilizing this benchmark, we extensively analyze the performance of state-of-the-art online safety analysis methods on both open-source and closed-source LLMs. This analysis reveals the strengths and weaknesses of individual methods and offers valuable insights into selecting the most appropriate method based on specific application scenarios and task requirements. Furthermore, we also explore the potential of using hybridization methods, i.e., combining multiple methods to derive a collective safety conclusion, to enhance the efficacy of online safety analysis for LLMs. Our findings indicate a promising direction for the development of innovative and trustworthy quality assurance methodologies for LLMs, facilitating their reliable deployments across diverse domains.</description>

      <title>Mayhem: Targeted Corruption of Register and Stack Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the past decade, many vulnerabilities were discovered in microarchitectures which yielded attack vectors and motivated the study of countermeasures. Further, architectural and physical imperfections in DRAMs led to the discovery of Rowhammer attacks which give an adversary power to introduce bit flips in a victim's memory space. Numerous studies analyzed Rowhammer and proposed techniques to prevent it altogether or to mitigate its effects.
  In this work, we push the boundary and show how Rowhammer can be further exploited to inject faults into stack variables and even register values in a victim's process. We achieve this by targeting the register value that is stored in the process's stack, which subsequently is flushed out into the memory, where it becomes vulnerable to Rowhammer. When the faulty value is restored into the register, it will end up used in subsequent iterations. The register value can be stored in the stack via latent function calls in the source or by actively triggering signal handlers. We demonstrate the power of the findings by applying the techniques to bypass SUDO and SSH authentication. We further outline how MySQL and other cryptographic libraries can be targeted with the new attack vector. There are a number of challenges this work overcomes with extensive experimentation before coming together to yield an end-to-end attack on an OpenSSL digital signature: achieving co-location with stack and register variables, with synchronization provided via a blocking window. We show that stack and registers are no longer safe from the Rowhammer attack.</description>

Abstract: The rise of advanced persistent threats (APTs) has marked a significant cybersecurity challenge, characterized by sophisticated orchestration, stealthy execution, extended persistence, and targeting valuable assets across diverse sectors. Provenance graph-based kernel-level auditing has emerged as a promising approach to enhance visibility and traceability within intricate network environments. However, it still faces challenges including reconstructing complex lateral attack chains, detecting dynamic evasion behaviors, and defending smart adversarial subgraphs. To bridge the research gap, this paper proposes an efficient and robust APT defense scheme leveraging provenance graphs, including a network-level distributed audit model for cost-effective lateral attack reconstruction, a trust-oriented APT evasion behavior detection strategy, and a hidden Markov model based adversarial subgraph defense approach. Through prototype implementation and extensive experiments, we validate the effectiveness of our system. Lastly, crucial open research directions are outlined in this emerging field.</description>

      <title>PrivAgE: A Toolchain for Privacy-Preserving Distributed Aggregation on Edge-Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Valuable insights, such as frequently visited environments in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, can oftentimes only be gained by analyzing sensitive data spread across edge-devices like smartphones. To facilitate such an analysis, we present a toolchain called PrivAgE for a distributed, privacy-preserving aggregation of local data by taking the limited resources of edge-devices into account. The distributed aggregation is based on secure summation and simultaneously satisfies the notion of differential privacy. In this way, other parties can neither learn the sensitive data of single clients nor a single client's influence on the final result. We perform an evaluation of the power consumption, the running time and the bandwidth overhead on real as well as simulated devices and demonstrate the flexibility of our toolchain by presenting an extension of the summation of histograms to distributed clustering.</description>

      <title>Systematically Assessing the Security Risks of AI/ML-enabled Connected Healthcare Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The adoption of machine-learning-enabled systems in the healthcare domain is on the rise. While the use of ML in healthcare has several benefits, it also expands the threat surface of medical systems. We show that the use of ML in medical systems, particularly connected systems that involve interfacing the ML engine with multiple peripheral devices, has security risks that might cause life-threatening damage to a patient's health in case of adversarial interventions. These new risks arise due to security vulnerabilities in the peripheral devices and communication channels. We present a case study where we demonstrate an attack on an ML-enabled blood glucose monitoring system by introducing adversarial data points during inference. We show that an adversary can achieve this by exploiting a known vulnerability in the Bluetooth communication channel connecting the glucose meter with the ML-enabled app. We further show that state-of-the-art risk assessment techniques are not adequate for identifying and assessing these new risks. Our study highlights the need for novel risk analysis methods for analyzing the security of AI-enabled connected health devices.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Cyber Response Time on Temporal Active Directory Networks Using Decoys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Microsoft Active Directory (AD) is the default security management system for Window domain network. We study the problem of placing decoys in AD network to detect potential attacks. We model the problem as a Stackelberg game between an attacker and a defender on AD attack graphs where the defender employs a set of decoys to detect the attacker on their way to Domain Admin (DA). Contrary to previous works, we consider time-varying (temporal) attack graphs. We proposed a novel metric called response time, to measure the effectiveness of our decoy placement in temporal attack graphs. Response time is defined as the duration from the moment attackers trigger the first decoy to when they compromise the DA. Our goal is to maximize the defender's response time to the worst-case attack paths. We establish the NP-hard nature of the defender's optimization problem, leading us to develop Evolutionary Diversity Optimization (EDO) algorithms. EDO algorithms identify diverse sets of high-quality solutions for the optimization problem. Despite the polynomial nature of the fitness function, it proves experimentally slow for larger graphs. To enhance scalability, we proposed an algorithm that exploits the static nature of AD infrastructure in the temporal setting. Then, we introduce tailored repair operations, ensuring the convergence to better results while maintaining scalability for larger graphs.</description>

      <title>Accurate Low-Degree Polynomial Approximation of Non-polynomial Operators for Fast Private Inference in Homomorphic Encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As machine learning (ML) permeates fields like healthcare, facial recognition, and blockchain, the need to protect sensitive data intensifies. Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) allows inference on encrypted data, preserving the privacy of both data and the ML model. However, it slows down non-secure inference by up to five magnitudes, with a root cause of replacing non-polynomial operators (ReLU and MaxPooling) with high-degree Polynomial Approximated Function (PAF). We propose SmartPAF, a framework to replace non-polynomial operators with low-degree PAF and then recover the accuracy of PAF-approximated model through four techniques: (1) Coefficient Tuning (CT) -- adjust PAF coefficients based on the input distributions before training, (2) Progressive Approximation (PA) -- progressively replace one non-polynomial operator at a time followed by a fine-tuning, (3) Alternate Training (AT) -- alternate the training between PAFs and other linear operators in the decoupled manner, and (4) Dynamic Scale (DS) / Static Scale (SS) -- dynamically scale PAF input value within (-1, 1) in training, and fix the scale as the running max value in FHE deployment. The synergistic effect of CT, PA, AT, and DS/SS enables SmartPAF to enhance the accuracy of the various models approximated by PAFs with various low degrees under multiple datasets. For ResNet-18 under ImageNet-1k, the Pareto-frontier spotted by SmartPAF in latency-accuracy tradeoff space achieves 1.42x ~ 13.64x accuracy improvement and 6.79x ~ 14.9x speedup than prior works. Further, SmartPAF enables a 14-degree PAF (f1^2 g_1^2) to achieve 7.81x speedup compared to the 27-degree PAF obtained by minimax approximation with the same 69.4% post-replacement accuracy. Our code is available at https://github.com/EfficientFHE/SmartPAF.</description>

      <title>Inferentialist Resource Semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09217v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In systems modelling, a system typically comprises located resources relative to which processes execute. One important use of logic in informatics is in modelling such systems for the purpose of reasoning (perhaps automated) about their behaviour and properties. To this end, one requires an interpretation of logical formulae in terms of the resources and states of the system; such an interpretation is called a resource semantics of the logic. This paper shows how inferentialism -- the view that meaning is given in terms of inferential behaviour -- enables a versatile and expressive framework for resource semantics. Specifically, how inferentialism seamlessly incorporates the assertion-based approach of the logic of Bunched Implications, foundational in program verification (e.g., as the basis of Separation Logic), and the renowned number-of-uses reading of Linear Logic. This integration enables reasoning about shared and separated resources in intuitive and familiar ways, as well as about the composition and interfacing of system components.</description>

      <title>Rethinking How to Evaluate Language Model Jailbreak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly integrated with various applications. To ensure that LLMs do not generate unsafe responses, they are aligned with safeguards that specify what content is restricted. However, such alignment can be bypassed to produce prohibited content using a technique commonly referred to as jailbreak. Different systems have been proposed to perform the jailbreak automatically. These systems rely on evaluation methods to determine whether a jailbreak attempt is successful. However, our analysis reveals that current jailbreak evaluation methods have two limitations. (1) Their objectives lack clarity and do not align with the goal of identifying unsafe responses. (2) They oversimplify the jailbreak result as a binary outcome, successful or not. In this paper, we propose three metrics, safeguard violation, informativeness, and relative truthfulness, to evaluate language model jailbreak. Additionally, we demonstrate how these metrics correlate with the goal of different malicious actors. To compute these metrics, we introduce a multifaceted approach that extends the natural language generation evaluation method after preprocessing the response. We evaluate our metrics on a benchmark dataset produced from three malicious intent datasets and three jailbreak systems. The benchmark dataset is labeled by three annotators. We compare our multifaceted approach with three existing jailbreak evaluation methods. Experiments demonstrate that our multifaceted evaluation outperforms existing methods, with F1 scores improving on average by 17% compared to existing baselines. Our findings motivate the need to move away from the binary view of the jailbreak problem and incorporate a more comprehensive evaluation to ensure the safety of the language model.</description>
