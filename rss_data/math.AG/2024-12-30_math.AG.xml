      <title>Standard models for Calabi-Yau pairs of complexity two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Calabi-Yau pair of index one and complexity zero is toric. Furthermore, a Calabi-Yau pair of index one and complexity one is of cluster type. In this article, we study Calabi-Yau pairs of index one and complexity two. For each such pair, we either prove that its alteration complexity is zero or we associate to it a del Pezzo fibration over a toric variety. In the latter case, we show that the initial pair is of cluster type if and only if the del Pezzo fibration is of cluster type. We give criteria for del Pezzo fibrations over toric bases to be of cluster type. Along the way, we prove a statement about the invariance of the coregularity in families of Calabi-Yau pairs over toric bases.</description>

      <title>The automorphism groups of Kummer surfaces in characteristic two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We shall calculate the automorphism group of the Kummer surfaces associated with a curve of genus 2 or the product of two elliptic curves in characteristic two under the assumption that the Kummer surface is a K3 surface. Moreover we discuss the corresponding complex case and a generalized Kummer surface in characteristic three. The paper has an appendix by the second author.</description>

      <title>Counting absolutely indecomposable $G$-bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a reductive group $G$ over a finite field $k$, and a smooth projective curve $X/k$, we give a motivic counting formula for the number of absolutely indecomposable $G$-bundles on $X$. We prove that the counting can be expressed via the cohomology of the moduli stack of stable parabolic $G$-Higgs bundles on $X$. This result generalizes work of Schiffmann and work of Dobrovolska, Ginzburg, and Travkin from $\mathrm{GL}_n$ to a general reductive group. Along the way we prove some structural results on automorphism groups of $G$-torsors, and we study certain Lie-theoretic counting problems related to the case when $X$ is an elliptic curve - a case which we investigate more carefully following Fratila, Gunningham and P. Li.</description>

      <title>Bilinear secants and birational geometry of blowups of $\mathbb P^n \times \mathbb P^{n+1}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce bilinear secant varieties and joins of subvarieties of products of projective spaces, as a generalisation of the classical secant varieties and joins of projective varieties. We show that the bilinear secant varieties of certain rational normal curves of $\mathbb P^n \times \mathbb P^{n+1}$ play a central role in the study of the birational geometry of $X^{n,n+1}_s$, its blowup in $s$ points in general position. We show that $X^{n,n+1}_s$ is log Fano, and we compute its effective and movable cones, for $s\le n+2$ and $n\ge 1$ and for $s\le n+3$ and $n\le 2$, and we compute the effective and movable cones of $X^{3,4}_6$.</description>

      <title>On the Quantum K-theory of Quiver Varieties at Roots of Unity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Psi(\mathbb{z},\mathbb{a},q)$ be the fundamental solution matrix of the quantum difference equation in the equivariant quantum K-theory for Nakajima variety $X$. In this work, we prove that the operator $$ \Psi(\mathbb{z},\mathbb{a},q) \Psi\left(\mathbb{z}^p,\mathbb{a}^p,q^{p^2}\right)^{-1} $$ has no poles at the primitive complex $p$-th roots of unity $\zeta_p$ in the curve counting parameter $q$. As a byproduct, we show that the eigenvalues of the iterated product of the operators ${\bf M}_{\mathcal{L}}$ from the quantum difference equation on $X$ $$ {\bf M}_{\mathcal{L}} (\mathbb{z},\mathbb{a},q) {\bf M}_{\mathcal{L}} (\mathbb{z} q^{\mathcal{L}},\mathbb{a},q) \cdots {\bf M}_{\mathcal{L}} (\mathbb{z} q^{(p-1)\mathcal{L}},\mathbb{a},q) $$ evaluated at $\zeta_p$ are described by the Bethe equations for $X$ in which all variables are substituted by their $p$-th powers.
  Finally, upon a reduction of the quantum difference equation on $X$ to the quantum differential equation over the field with finite characteristic, the above iterated product transforms into a Grothendiek-Katz $p$-curvature of the corresponding differential connection whereas ${\bf M}_{\mathcal{L}} (\mathbb{z}^p,\mathbb{a}^p,q^p)$ becomes a certain Frobenius twist of that connection. In this way, we are reproducing, in part, the statement of a theorem by Etingof and Varchenko.</description>

      <title>Canonical bundle formula and a conjecture on certain algebraic fiber spaces by Schnell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We interpret a conjecture of Schnell on the equivalence of the non-vanishing and the Campana--Peternell conjectures, using the canonical bundle formula. As a result, we improve Schnell's assumption on pseudo-effectivity of the canonical bundle by adding extra effective divisors supported on the discriminant locus. We also give an inductive approach and an unconditional result for fourfolds, using rigid currents. As a side note, we include a proof that for varieties of Kodaira dimension zero, the rigidity of their canonical class implies the existence of good minimal models.</description>

      <title>Perverse sheaves on smooth toric varieties and stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is usually not straightforward to work with the category of perverse sheaves on a variety using only its definition as a heart of a $t$-structure. In this paper, the category of perverse sheaves on a smooth toric variety with its orbit stratification is described explicitly as a category of finite-dimensional modules over an algebra. An analogous result is also established for various categories of equivariant perverse sheaves, which in particular gives a description of perverse sheaves on toric orbifolds, and we also compare the derived category of the category of perverse sheaves to the derived category of constructible sheaves.</description>

      <title>Viewing Quasi-Coherent Sheaves of Ideals as Ideals of a Ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a technique for viewing quasi-coherent sheaves of ideals of a given blowup as regular ideals of a ring. In the paper, we first describe (Zariski) models as integral schemes that are separated and of finite type over an integral domain $D$. We then construct a ring $D^*$ for a given projective model (e.g. blowup of $D$ over a finitely generated ideal) by intersecting Nagata function rings. The spectrum of $D^*$ contains the projective model, but similar to the Proj-construction, it includes additional prime ideals. We characterize the relevant ideals and construct a faithfully flat morphism of schemes from the spectrum of $D^*$ to the model. Finally, using Abhyankar's definition of ideals on models, we identify the relevant ideals of $D^*$ with the quasi-coherent sheaves of ideals of the corresponding projective model.</description>

      <title>Calabi-Yau completions for roots of dualizing dg bimodules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Roots of shifted Serre functors appear naturally in representation theory and algebraic geometry. We give an analogue of Keller's Calabi-Yau completion for roots of shifted inverse dualizing bimodules over dg categories. Given a positive integer $a$, we introduce the notion of the $a$-th root pair on smooth dg categories and define its Calabi-Yau completion. We prove that the Calabi-Yau completion has the Calabi-Yau property when the $a$-th root pair has certain invariance under an action of the cyclic group of order $a$, and observe that it is only twisted Calabi-Yau in general. Next, we establish a bijection between Adams graded Calabi-Yau dg categories of Gorenstein parameter $a$ and $a$-th root pairs on a dg category with the cyclic invariance. Applying this bijection, we prove that a certain operation on dg categories, called the $a$-Segre product, allows us to reproduce Calabi-Yau dg categories. Furthermore, we discuss the cluster category of these Calabi-Yau completions, and prove that it is a $\mathbb{Z}/a\mathbb{Z}$-quotient of the usual cluster category, which thereby establishes the $a$-th root versions of cluster categories. In the appendix, we give a generalization of Beilinson's theorem on tilting bundles on projective spaces to the setting of Adams graded dg categories.</description>

      <title>Smoothness of commutative Hopf algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hopf algebras, most generally in a semisimple abelian symmetric monoidal category, are here supposed to be commutative but not to be of finite-type, and their (equivariant) smoothness are discussed. Given a Hopf algebra $H$ in a category such as above, it is proved that the following are equivalent: (i) $H$ is smooth as an algebra; (ii) $H$ is smooth as an $H$-comodule algebra; (iii) the product morphism $S_H^2(H^+) \to H^+$ defined on the 2nd symmetric power is monic. Working over a field $k$ of characteristic zero, we prove: (1) every ordinary Hopf algebra, i.e., such in the category $\mathsf{Vec}$ of vector spaces, satisfies the equivalent conditions (i)--(iii) and some others; (2) every Hopf algebra in the category $\mathsf{sVec}$ of super-vector spaces has a certain property that is stronger than (i). In the case where $\operatorname{char}k=p&gt;0$, there are shown weaker properties of ordinary Hopf algebras and of Hopf algebras in $\mathsf{sVec}$ or in the ind-completion $\mathsf{Ver}_p^{\mathrm{ind}}$ of the Verlinde category.</description>

      <title>Random matrix statistics and zeroes of $L$-functions via probability in $\lambda$-rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a theory of probability in $\lambda$-rings designed to efficiently describe random variables valued in multisets of complex numbers, varieties over a field, or other similar enriched settings. A key role is played by the $\sigma$-moment generating function based on the plethystic exponential, which allows us to describe distributions and argue with independence in a way that is as simple as classical probability theory. As a first application, we use this theory to obtain a concise description of the asymptotic $\sigma$-moment generating functions describing distributions of eigenvalues of Haar random matrices in compact classical groups. Beyond the theory of probability in $\lambda$-rings, the proof uses only classical invariant theory. Using our description we reprove the results of Diaconis and Shahshahani on the joint distributions of traces of powers of matrices, and we also treat symmetric groups. Next, we use Poonen's sieve to establish equidistribution results for the zeroes of $L$-functions in some natural families: simple Dirichlet characters for $\mathbb{F}_q(x)$ and the vanishing cohomology of smooth hypersurface sections. We give concise descriptions of the asymptotic $\sigma$-moment generating functions in these families, then compare them to the associated random matrix distributions. These equidistribution results are sideways in that we fix $q$ and take the degree $d$ to infinity, as opposed to Deligne equidistribution for fixed $d$ as $q \rightarrow \infty$, and the large $d$-limits are related to explicit descriptions of stable homology with twisted coefficients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The combinatorics of dimer models on brane tilings describe a large class of four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ gauge theories that afford quiver descriptions and have toric moduli spaces. We introduce a combinatorial optimization method leveraging simulated annealing to explicitly construct geometrically consistent brane tilings, providing a proof of concept for efficient generation of gauge theories using metaheuristic techniques. The implementation of this idea recovers known examples and allows us to derive a new brane tiling with $26$ quantum fields, whose construction is beyond the computational power of current methods.</description>

      <title>Moduli spaces of polynomial maps and multipliers at small cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fix an integer $d \geq 2$. The space $\mathcal{P}_{d}$ of polynomial maps of degree $d$ modulo conjugation by affine transformations is naturally an affine variety over $\mathbb{Q}$ of dimension $d -1$. For each integer $P \geq 1$, the elementary symmetric functions of the multipliers at all the cycles with period $p \in \lbrace 1, \dotsc, P \rbrace$ induce a natural morphism $\operatorname{Mult}_{d}^{(P)}$ defined on $\mathcal{P}_{d}$. In this article, we show that the morphism $\operatorname{Mult}_{d}^{(2)}$ induced by the multipliers at the cycles with periods $1$ and $2$ is both finite and birational onto its image. In the case of polynomial maps, this strengthens results by McMullen and by Ji and Xie stating that $\operatorname{Mult}_{d}^{(P)}$ is quasifinite and birational onto its image for all sufficiently large integers $P$. Our result arises as the combination of the following two statements: $\mathord{\bullet}$ A sequence of polynomials over $\mathbb{C}$ of degree $d$ with bounded multipliers at its cycles with periods $1$ and $2$ is necessarily bounded in $\mathcal{P}_{d}(\mathbb{C})$. $\mathord{\bullet}$ A generic conjugacy class of polynomials over $\mathbb{C}$ of degree $d$ is uniquely determined by its multipliers at its cycles with periods $1$ and $2$.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we explore some recent advancements in enumerative algebraic geometry, focusing particularly on the role of quantum K-theory of quiver varieties as viewed through the lens of integrable systems. We highlight a number of conjectures and open questions.

      <title>Branes and Representations of DAHA $C^\vee C_1$: affine braid group action on category</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the representation theory of the spherical double affine Hecke algebra (DAHA) of $C^\vee C_1$, using brane quantization. By showing a one-to-one correspondence between Lagrangian $A$-branes with compact support and finite-dimensional representations of the spherical DAHA, we provide evidence of derived equivalence between the $A$-brane category of $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$-character variety of a four-punctured sphere and the representation category of DAHA of $C^\vee C_1$. The $D_4$ root system plays an essential role in understanding both the geometry and representation theory. In particular, this $A$-model approach reveals the action of an affine braid group of type $D_4$ on the category. As a by-product, our geometric investigation offers detailed information about the low-energy dynamics of the SU(2) $N_f=4$ Seiberg-Witten theory.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Approximations to Ricci-flat Metrics Via Extrinsic Symmetries of Calabi-Yau Hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ever since Yau's non-constructive existence proof of Ricci-flat metrics on Calabi-Yau manifolds, finding their explicit construction remains a major obstacle to development of both string theory and algebraic geometry. Recent computational approaches employ machine learning to create novel neural representations for approximating these metrics, offering high accuracy but limited interpretability. In this paper, we analyse machine learning approximations to flat metrics of Fermat Calabi-Yau n-folds and some of their one-parameter deformations in three dimensions in order to discover their new properties. We formalise cases in which the flat metric has more symmetries than the underlying manifold, and prove that these symmetries imply that the flat metric admits a surprisingly compact representation for certain choices of complex structure moduli. We show that such symmetries uniquely determine the flat metric on certain loci, for which we present an analytic form. We also incorporate our theoretical results into neural networks to achieve state-of-the-art reductions in Ricci curvature for multiple Calabi-Yau manifolds. We conclude by distilling the ML models to obtain for the first time closed form expressions for Kahler metrics with near-zero scalar curvature.</description>

      <title>Computing Direct Sum Decompositions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problems of finding isomorphism classes of indecomposable modules with certain properties, or determining the indecomposable summands of a module, are ubiquitous in commutative algebra, group theory, representation theory, and other fields. The purpose of this work is to describe and prove correctness of a practical algorithm for computing indecomposable summands of finitely generated modules over a finitely generated k-algebra, for k a field of positive characteristic. Our algorithm works over multigraded rings, which enables the computation of indecomposable summands of coherent sheaves on subvarieties of toric varieties (in particular, for varieties embedded in projective space). We also present multiple examples, including some which present previously unknown phenomena regarding the behavior of summands of Frobenius pushforwards and syzygies over Artinian rings.</description>

      <title>Derived categories of nodal del Pezzo threefolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2108.04499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a complete answer for the existence of Kawamata type semiorthogonal decompositions of derived categories of nodal del Pezzo threefolds. More precisely, we show that nodal del Pezzo threefolds of degree $1\leq d \leq 4$ have no Kawamata type decomposition and that all nodal del Pezzo threefolds of degree $5$ admit a Kawamata decomposition. For the proof we go through the classification of singular del Pezzo threefolds, compute divisor class groups of nodal del Pezzo threefolds of small degree and use projection from a line to construct Kawamata semiorthogonal decompositions for the degree $5$ case. An analogous decomposition of the nodal del Pezzo threefold of degree $6$ has been recently constructed by Kawamata.
  Our construction of the Kawamata decomposition for a singular del Pezzo threefold of degree $5$ fits into a family of semiorthogonal decompositions (which we call a relative tilting decomposition) interpolating between a Kawamata decomposition on a singular fiber and a full exceptional collection on the smooth fibers.</description>

Abstract: We construct two examples of projective hyper-K\"ahler fourfolds of K3[2]-type with an action of the alternating group A7, making them some of the most symmetric hyper-K\"ahler fourfolds. They are realized as so called double EPW sextics and this allows us to construct an explicit family of irrational Gushel-Mukai threefolds.</description>

      <title>Idempotentization of Affine Schemes and Sheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.04872v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce the idempotentization process, which bears some philosophical and mathematical similarities with modern analytification and tropicalization. Idempotentization associates to any affine scheme an idempotent version of itself with respect to a fixed covering by distinguished affine open subschemes. Once this cover is fixed, we can functorially associate a Zariski sheaf of rings or modules to a sheaf of idempotent semiring or a sheaf of idempotent semimodules. We show that idempotentization is independent of the chosen cover and in the Noetherian case, the idempotentization of the structure sheaf recovers the global sections. Underlying our formalism is a combinatorial reflection of lattices of subobjects of ordered-theoretic objects seen as lattices coming from commutative algebra. This has topological consequences for the semiring of subtractive ideals of a commutative semiring $S$: On one hand, it is a topological retract of the semiring of congruence relations of $S$ for the coarse lower topology. On the other hand, it is a topological retract of the semiring of ideals of $S$ for the coarse upper topology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the work of Pomoni-Yan-Zhang in String Theory, we introduce the moduli space of tetrahedron instantons as a Quot scheme and describe it as a moduli space of quiver representations. We construct a virtual fundamental class and virtual structure sheaf \`a la Oh-Thomas, by which we define K-theoretic invariants. We show that the partition function of such invariants reproduces the one studied by Pomoni-Yan-Zhang, and explicitly determine it, as a product of shifted partition functions of rank one Donaldson-Thomas invariants of the three-dimensional affine space. Our geometric construction answers a series of questions of Pomoni-Yan-Zhang on the geometry of the moduli space of tetrahedron instantons and the behaviour of its partition function, and provides a new application of the recent work of Oh-Thomas.</description>

Abstract: We describe new algorithms to compute Whitney stratifications of real algebraic varieties. Using either conormal or polar techniques, these algorithms stratify a complexification of a given real variety. We then show that the resulting stratification can be described by real polynomials. We also extend these methods to stratification problems involving the so-called full semialgebraic sets as well as real algebraic maps.</description>

Abstract: Let X be a zero-dimensional scheme contained in a multiprojective space. Let $s_i$ be the length of the projection of X onto the i-th component of the multiprojective space. A result of Van Tuyl states that the Hilbert function of X, in the case when X is reduced, is completely determined by its restriction to the product of the intervals $[0, s_i - 1]$. We prove that the same is also true for non-reduced schemes X.</description>

Abstract: We construct a smooth compactification of the space of similarity classes of labeled, oriented, possibly-degenerate triangles that includes all degenerate configurations. The space $\mathbb D$, a connected sum of three projective planes, projects via blowdown to two shape spaces that have appeared in the literature, the well-known (Riemann) sphere (\cite{Kend84}, \cite{Beh}, \cite{ES15}), and the less-well-known 2-torus (\cite{BG23}). A natural action by the dihedral group $D_6$ defines a quotient stack $[\mathbb D/D_6]$, which is the stack of the absolute (unlabeled, unoriented) possibly-degenerate classes.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present new necessary conditions and sufficient conditions for the (positive parts of) the varieties of vertically parametrized systems to admit monomial parametrizations. The conditions are based on a combination of polyhedral geometry and previously known results about injectivity of monomial maps. The motivation arises from the study of steady state varieties of reaction networks, as toricity simplifies the determination of multistationarity substantially.</description>

      <title>Deautonomisation by singularity confinement and degree growth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.01372v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we give an explanation of a number of observations relating to degree growth of birational mappings of the plane and their deautonomisation by singularity confinement. These observations are of a link between two a priori unrelated notions: firstly the dynamical degree of the mapping and secondly the evolution of parameters required for its singularity structure to remain unchanged under a sufficiently general deautonomisation. We explain this correspondence for a large class of birational mappings of the plane via the spaces of initial conditions for their deautonomised versions. We show that even for non-integrable mappings in this class, the surfaces forming these spaces have effective anticanonical divisors and one can define a period map parametrising them, similar to that in the theory of rational surfaces associated with discrete Painlev\'e equations. This provides a bridge between the evolution of coefficients in the deautonomised mapping and the induced dynamics on the Picard lattice which encode the dynamical degree.</description>

      <title>Iterated Resultants and Rational Functions in Real Quantifier Elimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper builds and extends on the authors' previous work related to the algorithmic tool, Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition (CAD), and one of its core applications, Real Quantifier Elimination (QE). These topics are at the heart of symbolic computation and were first implemented in computer algebra systems decades ago, but have recently received renewed interest as part of the ongoing development of SMT solvers for non-linear real arithmetic.
  First, we consider the use of iterated univariate resultants in traditional CAD, and how this leads to inefficiencies, especially in the case of an input with multiple equational constraints. We reproduce the workshop paper [Davenport and England, 2023], adding important clarifications to our suggestions first made there to make use of multivariate resultants in the projection phase of CAD. We then consider an alternative approach to this problem first documented in [McCallum and Brown, 2009] which redefines the actual object under construction, albeit only in the case of two equational constraints. We correct an unhelpful typo and provide a proof missing from that paper.
  We finish by revising the topic of how to deal with SMT or Real QE problems expressed using rational functions (as opposed to the usual polynomial ones) noting that these are often found in industrial applications. We revisit a proposal made in [Uncu, Davenport and England, 2023] for doing this in the case of satisfiability, explaining why such an approach does not trivially extend to more complicated quantification structure and giving a suitable alternative.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14606v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the construction of local subtraction schemes through the lenses of tropical geometry. We focus on individual Feynman integrals in parametric presentation, and think of them as particular instances of Euler integrals. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition for a combination of Euler integrands to be locally finite, i.e. to be expandable as a Taylor series in the exponent variables directly under sign of integration. We use this to construct a local subtraction scheme that is applicable to a class of Euler integrals that satisfy a certain geometric property. We apply this to compute the Laurent expansion in the dimensional regulator $\epsilon$ of various Feynman integrals involving both UV and IR singularities, as well as to generalizations of Feynman integrals that arise in effective field theories and in phase-space integrations, for which we provide new analytic results.</description>
