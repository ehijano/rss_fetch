      <title>Construal Level and Cognitive Reflection in Newsvendor Games: Unveiling the Influence of Individual Heterogeneity on Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the last decade, scholars have studied the behavior of decision-making in newsvendor settings and have identified numerous behavior patterns for deviating from normative behavior. However, there is a dearth of research which have examined the influence of individual heterogeneity on decision-making in newsvendor settings. This study examines the level of construal (Abstract and concrete) using construal level theory (CLT) on performance in newsvendor games. In addition, this study measures the cognitive reflection of individuals using cognitive reflection test (CRT) ex-ante to analyze the true impact of how people construe a problem and its impact on their decision-making.</description>

      <title>Aging in coevolving voter models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aging, understood as the tendency to remain in a given state the longer the persistence time in that state, plays a crucial role in the dynamics of complex systems. In this paper, we explore the influence of aging on coevolution models, that is, models in which the dynamics of the states of the nodes in a complex network is coupled to the dynamics of the structure of the network. In particular we consider the coevolving voter model, and we introduce two versions of this model that include aging effects: the Link Aging Model (LAM) and the Node Aging Model (NAM). In the LAM, aging is associated with the persistence time of a link in the evolving network, while in the NAM, aging is associated with the persistence time of a node in a given state. We show that aging significantly affects the absorbing phase transition of the coevolution voter model, shifting the transition point in opposite directions for the LAM and NAM. We also show that the generic absorbing phase transition can disappear due to aging effects.</description>

      <title>Model-based reconstruction of real-world fractal complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a versatile model for generating fractal complex networks that closely mirror the properties of real-world systems. By combining features of reverse renormalization and evolving network models, the proposed approach introduces several tunable parameters, offering exceptional flexibility in capturing the diverse topologies and scaling behaviors found in both natural and man-made networks. The model effectively replicates their key characteristics such as fractal dimensions, power-law degree distributions, and densities. Unlike traditional deterministic models, it incorporates stochasticity into the network growth process, overcoming limitations like discontinuities in degree distributions and rigid size constraints. The model's applicability is demonstrated through its ability to reproduce the structural features of real-world fractal networks, including the Internet, the World Wide Web, and co-authorship networks.</description>

      <title>Beyond 2050: From deployment to renewal of the global solar PV system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global energy transition relies heavily on the large-scale deployment of PV capacity with deployment targets typically defined for 2050. However, sustaining the PV system beyond 2050 will require continuous renewal. This research explores the overlooked industrial transition from the initial implementation phase to the long-term renewal phase, emphasizing the consequences of this dynamic shift. Using streamlined modelling we estimate the annual production needed to both expand and maintain the global PV system. Our results indicate that PV panel production dynamics during this transition are very sensitive to two key factors: deployment speed and panel lifespan. If deployment occurs over a shorter period than the average panel lifespan, production initially overshoots and exhibits an endogenous damped oscillatory behavior due to a succession of installation and replacement cycles. Conversely, if deployment is more gradual, production increases smoothly before stabilizing at the renewal rate. Given the current deployment scenarios and lifespan estimates, the PV industry is likely to face significant production damped oscillations, up to 60%. These oscillations, corresponding to over/underproduction, are further amplified by the increasingly ambitious energy transition targets, which accelerate deployment rates. Panel lifespan conversly remains a less flexible parameter. This study discusses oscillations from a systemic perspective and how they could exacerbate challenges for the long-term sustainability of PV, including industrial, workforce, economic and geopolitical dimensions. Beyond the case of PV, this study underscores a broader issue in the energy transition: the shift from infrastructure expansion to long-term maintenance through renewal. Addressing this often-overlooked phase is essential for ensuring the sustainability of renewable energy systems beyond 2050.</description>

      <title>HOG-Diff: Higher-Order Guided Diffusion for Graph Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph generation is a critical yet challenging task as empirical analyses require a deep understanding of complex, non-Euclidean structures. Although diffusion models have recently made significant achievements in graph generation, these models typically adapt from the frameworks designed for image generation, making them ill-suited for capturing the topological properties of graphs. In this work, we propose a novel Higher-order Guided Diffusion (HOG-Diff) model that follows a coarse-to-fine generation curriculum and is guided by higher-order information, enabling the progressive generation of plausible graphs with inherent topological structures. We further prove that our model exhibits a stronger theoretical guarantee than classical diffusion frameworks. Extensive experiments on both molecular and generic graph generation tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms or remains competitive with state-of-the-art baselines. Our code is available at https://github.com/Yiminghh/HOG-Diff.</description>

      <title>Higher-order shortest paths in hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the defining features of complex networks is the connectivity properties that we observe emerging from local interactions. Recently, hypergraphs have emerged as a versatile tool to model networks with non-dyadic, higher-order interactions. Nevertheless, the connectivity properties of real-world hypergraphs remain largely understudied. In this work we introduce path size as a measure to characterise higher-order connectivity and quantify the relevance of non-dyadic ties for efficient shortest paths in a diverse set of empirical networks with and without temporal information. By comparing our results with simple randomised null models, our analysis presents a nuanced picture, suggesting that non-dyadic ties are often central and are vital for system connectivity, while dyadic edges remain essential to connect more peripheral nodes, an effect which is particularly pronounced for time-varying systems. Our work contributes to a better understanding of the structural organisation of systems with higher-order interactions.</description>

      <title>Destabilizing a Social Network Model via Intrinsic Feedback Vulnerabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social influence plays a significant role in shaping individual opinions and actions, particularly in a world of ubiquitous digital interconnection. The rapid development of generative AI has engendered well-founded concerns regarding the potential scalable implementation of radicalization techniques in social media. Motivated by these developments, we present a case study investigating the effects of small but intentional perturbations on a simple social network. We employ Taylor's classic model of social influence and use tools from robust control theory (most notably the Dynamical Structure Function (DSF)), to identify perturbations that qualitatively alter the system's behavior while remaining as unobtrusive as possible. We examine two such scenarios: perturbations to an existing link and perturbations that introduce a new link to the network. In each case, we identify destabilizing perturbations of minimal norm and simulate their effects. Remarkably, we find that small but targeted alterations to network structure may lead to the radicalization of all agents -- sentiments grow without bound -- exhibiting the potential for large-scale shifts in collective behavior to be triggered by comparatively minuscule adjustments in social influence. Given that this method of identifying perturbations that are innocuous but destabilizing applies to any suitable dynamical system, our findings emphasize a need for similar analyses to be carried out on real systems (e.g., real social networks), to identify where such dynamics may already exist.</description>
