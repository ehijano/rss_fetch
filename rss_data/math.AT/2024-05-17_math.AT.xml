      <title>An Alternative to Spherical Witt Vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a direct construction of the ring spectrum of spherical Witt vectors of a perfect $\mathbb{F}_p$-algebra R as the completion of the spherical monoid algebra $\mathbb{S}[R]$ of the multiplicative monoid $(R,\cdot)$ at the ideal $I = \mathrm{fib}(\mathbb{S}[R] \to R)$. This generalizes a construction of Cuntz and Deninger. We also use this to give a description of the category of p-complete modules over the spherical Witt vectors and a universal property for spherical Witt vectors as an $\mathbb{E}_1$-ring.</description>

      <title>Topological components of spaces of commuting elements in connected nilpotent Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the homotopy type of spaces of commuting elements in connected nilpotent Lie groups, via almost commuting elements in their Lie algebras. We give a necessary and sufficient condition on the fundamental group of such a Lie group $G$ to ensure $\mathrm{Hom}(\mathbb{Z}^k,G)$ is path-connected. In particular for the reduced upper unitriangular groups and the reduced generalized Heisenberg groups, $\mathrm{Hom}(\mathbb{Z}^k,G)$ is not path-connected, and we compute the homotopy type of its path-connected components in terms of Stiefel manifolds and the maximal torus of $G$.</description>

      <title>Partial bases and homological stability of $\operatorname{GL}_{n}(R)$ revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a unital ring satisfying the invariant basis number property, that every stably free $R$-module is free, and that the complex of partial bases of every finite rank free module is Cohen--Macaulay. This class of rings includes every ring of stable rank $1$ (e.g. any local, semi-local or Artinian ring), every Euclidean domain, and every Dedekind domain $\mathcal{O}_S$ of arithmetic type where $|S| &gt; 1$ and $S$ contains at least one non-complex place. Extending recent work of Galatius--Kupers--Randal-Williams and Kupers--Miller--Patzt, we prove that the sequence of general linear groups $\operatorname{GL}_n(R)$ satisfies slope-$1$ homological stability with $\mathbb{Z}[1/2]$-coefficients.</description>

      <title>Simplicial lists in operad theory I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a category $\mathsf{List}$ whose objects are sets and morphisms are mappings which assign to an element in the domain an ordered sequence (list) of elements in the codomain. We introduce and study a category of simplicial objects $\mathsf{slist}$ whose objects are functors $\Delta^{op} \to \mathsf{List}$, which we call simplicial lists, and morphisms are natural transformations which have functions as components. We demonstrate that $\mathsf{sList}$ supports the combinatorics of (non-symmetric) operads by constructing a fully-faithful nerve functor $N^l : \mathsf{Operad} \to \mathsf{sList}$ from the category of operads. This leads to a reasonable model for the theory of non-symmetric $\infty$-operads.
  We also demonstrate that $\mathsf{sList}$ has the structure of a presheaf category. In particular, we study a subcategory $\mathsf{sList}_{\text{op}}$ of operadic simplicial lists, in which the nerve functor takes values. The latter category is also a presheaf category over a base whose objects may be interpreted as levelled trees. We construct a coherent nerve functor which outputs an $\infty$-operad for each operad enriched in Kan complexes. We also define homology groups of simplicial lists and study first properties.</description>

Abstract: In the present paper, we construct $(2n-4)\times (2n-4)$ matrices corresponding to the motion of points on standard round sphere from the point of view of Delaunay triangulations.

      <title>Delooping cyclic groups with lens spaces in homotopy type theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the setting of homotopy type theory, each type can be interpreted as a space. Moreover, given an element of a type, i.e. a point in the corresponding space, one can define another type which encodes the space of loops based at this point. In particular, when the type we started with is a groupoid, this loop space is always a group. Conversely, to every group we can associate a type (more precisely, a pointed connected groupoid) whose loop space is this group: this operation is called delooping. The generic procedures for constructing such deloopings of groups (based on torsors, or on descriptions of Eilenberg-MacLane spaces as higher inductive types) are unfortunately equipped with elimination principles which do not directly allow eliminating to untruncated types, and are thus difficult to work with in practice. Here, we construct deloopings of the cyclic groups $\mathbb{Z}_m$ which are cellular, and thus do not suffer from this shortcoming. In order to do so, we provide type-theoretic implementations of lens spaces, which constitute an important family of spaces in algebraic topology. Our definition is based on the computation of an iterative join of suitable maps from the circle to an arbitrary delooping of $\mathbb{Z}_m$. In some sense, this work generalizes the construction of real projective spaces by Buchholtz and Rijke, which handles the case m=2, although the general setting requires more involved tools. Finally, we use this construction to also provide cellular descriptions of dihedral groups, and explain how we can hope to use those to compute the cohomology and higher actions of such groups.</description>

      <title>Cartan calculi on the free loop spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.05941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A typical example of a Cartan calculus consists of the Lie derivative and the contraction with vector fields of a manifold on the derivation ring of the de Rham complex. In this manuscript, a second stage of the Cartan calculus is investigated. In a general setting, the stage is formulated with operators obtained by the Andr\'e-Quillen cohomology of a commutative differential graded algebra $A$ on the Hochschild homology of $A$ in terms of the homotopy Cartan calculus in the sense of Fiorenza and Kowalzig. Moreover, the Cartan calculus is interpreted geometrically with maps from the rational homotopy group of the monoid of self-homotopy equivalences on a space $M$ to the derivation ring on the loop cohomology of $M$. We also give a geometric description to Sullivan's isomorphism, which relates the geometric Cartan calculus to the algebraic one, via the $\Gamma_1$ map due to F\'elix and Thomas.</description>

Abstract: We establish a Quillen equivalence between the Kan-Quillen model structure and a model structure, derived from a cubical model of homotopy type theory, on the category of cartesian cubical sets with one connection. We thereby identify a second model structure which both constructively models homotopy type theory and presents infinity-groupoids, the first example being the equivariant cartesian model of Awodey-Cavallo-Coquand-Riehl-Sattler.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Wasserstein distances and stable homological invariants of data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.06484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distances have a ubiquitous role in persistent homology, from the direct comparison of homological representations of data to the definition and optimization of invariants. In this article we introduce a family of parametrized pseudometrics between persistence modules based on the algebraic Wasserstein distance defined by Skraba and Turner, and phrase them in the formalism of noise systems. This is achieved by comparing $p$-norms of cokernels (resp. kernels) of monomorphisms (resp. epimorphisms) between persistence modules and corresponding bar-to-bar morphisms, a novel notion that allows us to bridge between algebraic and combinatorial aspects of persistence modules. We use algebraic Wasserstein distances to define invariants, called Wasserstein stable ranks, which are 1-Lipschitz stable with respect to such pseudometrics. We prove a low-rank approximation result for persistence modules which allows us to efficiently compute Wasserstein stable ranks, and we propose an efficient algorithm to compute the interleaving distance between them. Importantly, Wasserstein stable ranks depend on interpretable parameters which can be learnt in a machine learning context. Experimental results illustrate the use of Wasserstein stable ranks on real and artificial data and highlight how such pseudometrics could be useful in data analysis tasks.</description>

      <title>Natural homotopy of multipointed d-spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify Grandis' directed spaces as a full reflective subcategory of the category of multipointed $d$-spaces. When the multipointed $d$-space realizes a precubical set, its reflection coincides with the standard realization of the precubical set as a directed space. The reflection enables us to extend the construction of the natural system of topological spaces in Baues-Wirsching's sense from directed spaces to multipointed $d$-spaces. In the case of a cellular multipointed $d$-space, there is a discrete version of this natural system which is proved to be bisimilar up to homotopy. We also prove that these constructions are invariant up to homotopy under globular subdivision. These results are the globular analogue of Dubut's results. Finally, we point the incompatibility between the notion of bisimilar natural systems and the q-model structure of multipointed $d$-spaces. This means that either the notion of bisimilar natural systems is too rigid or new model structures should be considered on multipointed $d$-spaces.</description>

Abstract: We investigate a conjecture due to Haefliger and Thurston in the context of foliated manifold bundles. In this context, Haefliger-Thurston's conjecture predicts that every $M$-bundle over a manifold $B$ where $\text{dim}(B)\leq \text{dim}(M)$ is cobordant to a flat $M$-bundle. In particular, we study the bordism class of flat $M$-bundles over low dimensional manifolds, comparing a finite dimensional Lie group $G$ with $\text{Diff}_0(G)$ and localizing the holonomy of flat M-bundles to be supported in a ball.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08082v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a ring $R$, we have a classical result stating that the ordinary category of modules is the abelianization of the category of augmented $R$-algebras. Analogously, using the framework of infinity categories and higher algebra, Francis showed that the infinity category of $R$-modules is the stabilization of the infinity category of augmented $R$-algebras. In this work we show a dual result for coalgebras over a cooperad $Q$: namely that given a coalgebra $C$, comodules over $C$ are the costabilization of coalgebras over $C$, which is the universal stable category with a finite colimit preserving functor to coalgebras over $C$.</description>
