      <title>Rings such that, for each unit $u$, $u^n-1$ belongs to the $\Delta(R)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study in-depth those rings $R$ for which, there exists a fixed $n\geq 1$, such that $u^n-1$ lies in the subring $\Delta(R)$ of $R$ for every unit $u\in R$. We succeeded to describe for any $n\geq 1$ all reduced $\pi$-regular $(2n-1)$-$\Delta$U rings by showing that they satisfy the equation $x^{2n}=x$ as well as to prove that the property of being exchange and clean are tantamount in the class of $(2n-1)$-$\Delta$U rings. These achievements considerably extend results established by Danchev (Rend. Sem. Mat. Univ. Pol. Torino, 2019) and Ko\c{s}an et al. (Hacettepe J. Math. \&amp; Stat., 2020). Some other closely related results of this branch are also established.</description>

      <title>The Determinants of Pascal Tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The determinant of the $m$th order two dimensional symmetric Pascal tensor is equal to the determinant of its Sylvester-Pascal matrix. That determinant is equal to the product of the absolute values of the diagonal entries of the upper triangular matrix of the LU decomposition of the Sylvester-Pascal matrix after a certain pivoting reshape. Based upon this analysis, we prove that the determinant of the $m$th order two dimensional symmetric Pascal tensor is equal to the $m$th power of the factorial of $m-1$. With some further computation, we make a conjecture that the determinant of the $m$th order $n$-dimensional symmetric Pascal tensor is equal to the $m$th power of an integer function, and is an integer factor of the determinant of the $m$th order $n+1$-dimensional symmetric Pascal tensor.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Centroids and Quasi-Derivations of low-dimensional Zinbiel algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the concepts of quasi-centroid and quasi-derivation for Zinbiel algebras. Utilizing the classification results of Zinbiel algebras established previously, we describe the quasi-centroids and quasi-derivations of low-dimensional Zinbiel algebras. Additionally, we explore certain properties of quasi-centroids in the context of Zinbiel algebras and employ these properties to classify algebras with so-called small quasi-centroids. This description of quasi-derivations allows us to identify a significant subclass of Zinbiel algebras characterized as quasi-characteristically nilpotent.</description>

      <title>Computing the Bernstein Polynomial and the Krull-type Dimension of finitely generated $\boldsymbol{D}$-modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the existence of the Bernstein polynomial in one indeterminate $t$, and provide a method for its explicit computation. The Bernstein polynomial is associated with finitely generated modules over the Weyl algebra, known as $D$-modules, and is notoriously difficult to compute directly. Our approach is constructive, offering a systematic method to compute the Bernstein polynomial and its associated invariants explicitly. We begin by introducing the Weyl algebra as a ring of operators and stating some of its main properties, followed by considering the class of numerical polynomials. We then develop a generalization of the theory of Gr\"obner bases specifically for $D$-modules and use it to compute the Bernstein polynomial and its invariants. As an application of the properties of the Bernstein polynomial, we develop the concept of the Krull-type dimension for $D$-modules, which sheds light on the structure of these modules.</description>

      <title>Lusztig sheaves and integrable highest weight modules in symmetrizable case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present paper continues the work of [2]. For any symmetrizable generalized Cartan Matrix $C$ and the corresponding quantum group $\mathbf{U}$, we consider the associated quiver $Q$ with an admissible automorphism $a$. We construct the category $\widetilde{\mathcal{Q}/\mathcal{N}}$ of the localization of Lusztig sheaves for the quiver with the automorphism. Its Grothendieck group gives a realization of the integrable highest weight $\mathbf{U}-$module $\Lambda_{\lambda}$, and modulo the traceless ones Lusztig sheaves provide the (signed) canonical basis of $\Lambda_{\lambda}$. As an application, the symmetrizable crystal structures on Nakajima's quiver varieties and Lusztig's nilpotent varieties of preprojective algebras are deduced.</description>

      <title>Operator Kantor Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.13208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kantor pairs, (quadratic) Jordan pairs, and similar structures have been instrumental in the study of $\mathbb{Z}$-graded Lie algebras and algebraic groups. We introduce the notion of an operator Kantor pair, a generalization of Kantor pairs to arbitrary (commutative, unital) rings, similar in spirit as to how quadratic Jordan pairs and algebras generalize linear Jordan pairs and algebras. Such an operator Kantor pair is formed by a pair of $\Phi$-groups $(G^+,G^-)$ of a specific kind, equipped with certain homogeneous operators. For each such a pair $(G^+,G^-)$, we construct a $5$-graded Lie algebra $L$ together with actions of $G^\pm$ on $L$ as automorphisms. Moreover, we can associate a group $G(G^+,G^-) \subset \operatorname{Aut}(L)$ to this pair generalizing the projective elementary group of Jordan pairs. If the non-$0$-graded part of $L$ is projective, we can uniquely recover $G^+,G^-$ from $G(G^+,G^-)$ and the grading on $L$ alone. We establish, over rings $\Phi$ with $1/30 \in \Phi$, a one to one correspondence between Kantor pairs and operator Kantor pairs. Finally, we construct operator Kantor pairs for the different families of central simple structurable algebras.</description>

      <title>Twisted post-Hopf algebras, twisted relative Rota-Baxter operators and Hopf trusses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present article is devoted to study the categorical relationships between the categories of Hopf trusses, weak twisted post-Hopf algebras and weak twisted relative Rota-Baxter operators. The latter objects are a generalisation of relative Rota-Baxter operators where the Rota-Baxter condition is modified through a cocycle. Under certain conditions, this work shows that the three aforementioned categories are equivalent.</description>

      <title>Inverse semigroups of separated graphs and associated algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce an inverse semigroup $\mathcal{S}(E,C)$ associated to a separated graph $(E,C)$ and describe its internal structure. In particular we show that it is strongly $E^*$-unitary and can be realized as a partial semidirect product of the form $\mathcal{Y}\rtimes\mathbb{F}$ for a certain partial action of the free group $\mathbb{F}=\mathbb{F}(E^1)$ on the edges of $E$ on a semilattice $\mathcal{Y}$ realizing the idempotents of $\mathcal{S}(E,C)$. In addition we also describe the spectrum as well as the tight spectrum of $\mathcal{Y}$.
  We then use the inverse semigroup $\mathcal{S}(E,C)$ to describe several "tame" algebras associated to $(E,C)$, including its Cohn algebra, its Leavitt-path algebra, and analogues in the realm of $C^*$-algebras, like the tame $C^*$-algebra $\mathcal{O}(E,C)$ and its Toeplitz extension $\mathcal{T}(E,C)$, proving that these algebras are canonically isomorphic to certain algebras attached to $\mathcal{S}(E,C)$. Our structural results on $\mathcal{S}(E,C)$ imply that these algebras can be realized as partial crossed products, revealing a great portion of their structure.</description>

      <title>Geometric rigidity of simple modules for algebraic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let k be a field, let G be a smooth affine k-group and V a finite-dimensional G-module. We say V is \emph{rigid} if the socle series and radical series coincide for the action of G on each indecomposable summand of V; say V is \emph{geometrically rigid} (resp.~\emph{absolutely rigid}) if V is rigid after base change of G and V to \bar k (resp.~any field extension of k). We show that all simple G-modules are geometrically rigid, though not in general absolutely rigid. More precisley, we show that if V is a simple G-module, then there is a finite purely inseparable extension k_V/k naturally attached to V such that V_{k_V} is absolutely rigid as a G_{k_V}-module. The proof for connected G turns on an investigation of algebras of the form K\otimes_k E where K and E are field extensions of k; we give an example of such an algebra which is not rigid as a module over itself. We establish the existence of the purely inseparable field extension k_V/k through an analogous version for artinian algebras.
  In the second half of the paper we apply recent results on the structure and representation theory of pseudo-reductive groups to gives a concrete description of k_V. Namely, we combine the main structure theorem of the Conrad--Prasad classification of pseudo-reductive G together with our previous high weight theory. For V a simple G-module, we calculate the minimal field of definition of the geometric Jacobson radical of \End_G(V) in terms of the high weight of V and the Conrad--Prasad classification data; this gives a concrete construction of the field k_V as a subextension of the minimal field of definition of the geometric unipotent radical of G.
  We also observe that the Conrad--Prasad classification can be used to hone the dimension formula for G we had previously established; we also use it to give a description of \End_G(V) which includes a dimension formula.</description>
