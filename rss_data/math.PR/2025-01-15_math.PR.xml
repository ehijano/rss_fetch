      <title>Mixing time for a noisy SIS model on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the mixing time of the noisy SIS (Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible) model on graphs. The noisy SIS model is a variant of the standard SIS model, which allows individuals to become infected not just due to contacts with infected individuals but also due to external noise. We show that, under strong external noise, the mixing time is of order $O(n \log n)$. Additionally, we demonstrate that the mixing time on random graphs, namely Erd\"os--R\'enyi graphs, regular multigraphs, and Galton--Watson trees, is also of order $O(n \log n)$ with high probability.</description>

      <title>Monochromatic Subgraphs in Randomly Colored Dense Multiplex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a sequence of graphs $G_n$ and a fixed graph $H$, denote by $T(H, G_n)$ the number of monochromatic copies of the graph $H$ in a uniformly random $c$-coloring of the vertices of $G_n$. In this paper we study the joint distribution of a finite collection of monochromatic graphs in networks with multiple layers (multiplex networks). Specifically, given a finite collection of graphs $H_1, H_2, \ldots, H_r$ we derive the joint distribution of $(T(H_1, G_n^{(1)}), T(H_2, G_n^{(2)}), \ldots, T(H_r, G_n^{(r)}))$, where $\boldsymbol{G}_n = (G_n^{(1)}, G_n^{(2)}, \ldots, G_n^{(d)})$ is a collection of dense graphs on the same vertex set converging in the joint cut-metric. The limiting distribution is the sum of 2 independent components: a multivariate Gaussian and a sum of independent bivariate stochastic integrals. This extends previous results on the marginal convergence of monochromatic subgraphs in a sequence of graphs to the joint convergence of a finite collection of monochromatic subgraphs in a sequence of multiplex networks. Several applications and examples are discussed.</description>

      <title>Strong existence, pathwise uniqueness and chains of collisions in infinite Brownian particle systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study strong existence and pathwise uniqueness for a class of infinite-dimensional singular stochastic differential equations (SDE), with state space as the cone $\{x \in \mathbb{R}^{\mathbb{N}}: -\infty &lt; x_1 \leq x_2 \leq \cdots\}$, referred to as an infinite system of competing Brownian particles. A `mass' parameter $p \in [0,1]$ governs the splitting proportions of the singular collision local time between adjacent state coordinates. Solutions in the case $p=1/2$ correspond to the well-studied rank-based diffusions, while the general case arises from scaling limits of interacting particle systems on the lattice with asymmetric interactions and the study of the KPZ equation. Under conditions on the initial configuration, the drift vector, and the growth of the local time terms, we establish pathwise uniqueness and strong existence of solutions to the SDE. A key observation is the connection between pathwise uniqueness and the finiteness of `chains of collisions' between adjacent particles influencing a tagged particle in the system. Ingredients in the proofs include classical comparison and monotonicity arguments for reflected Brownian motions, techniques from Brownian last-passage percolation, large deviation bounds for random matrix eigenvalues, and concentration estimates for extrema of Gaussian processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the complex Ginibre ensemble, whose eigenvalues are $(\lambda_i)_{1\le i\le n}$ and the spectral radius $R_n=\max_{1\le i\le n}|\lambda_i|.$ Set $X_n=\sqrt{4 \gamma_{n}}(R_{n}-\sqrt{n}-\frac12\sqrt{\gamma_{n}})$ and $F_n$ be its distribution function, where $\gamma_{n}=\log n-2\log(\sqrt{2\pi}\log n).$ It was proved in \cite{Rider 2003} that $F_n$ converges weakly to the Gumbel distribution $\Lambda.$ We prove in further in this paper that $$\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{\log n}{\log\log n}\, W_1\left(F_n, \Lambda\right)=2$$
  and the Berry-Esseen bound
  $$\lim\limits_{n\to \infty} \frac{\log n}{\log\log n}\sup_{x\in \mathbb{R}}|F_{n}(x)-e^{-e^{-x}}|=\frac{2}{e}.$$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new algorithmic execution model that integrates interbank limit and market orders with internal liquidity generated through market making. Based on the Cartea et al.\cite{cartea2015algorithmic} framework, we incorporate market impact in interbank orders while excluding it for internal market-making transactions. Our model aims to optimize the balance between interbank and internal liquidity, reducing market impact and improving execution efficiency.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric estimation of the multivariate Spearman's footrule: a further discussion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose two new estimators of the multivariate rank correlation coefficient Spearman's footrule which are based on two general estimators for Average Orthant Dependence measures. We compare the new proposals with a previous estimator existing in the literature and show that the three estimators are asymptotically equivalent, but, in small samples, one of the proposed estimators outperforms the others. We also analyse Pitman efficiency of these indices to test for multivariate independence as compared to multivariate versions of Kendall's tau and Spearman's rho.</description>

      <title>Quadratic variation and local times of the horizontal component of the Peano curve (square filling curve)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the horizontal component of the Peano curve has quadratic variation equal the limit of quadratic variations along the Lebesgue partitions for grids of the form $3^{-n}p\mathbb{Z}+3^{-n}r$, where $p$ is a rational number, while $r$ is irrational number, but the value of such quadratic variation depends on $p$. This also yields that the horizontal component of the Peano curve is an example of a deterministic function possessing local time (density of the occupation measure) with respect to the Lebesgue measure, whose local time may be expressed as the limit of normalized numbers of interval crossings by this function.</description>

      <title>Some observations on the ambivalent role of symmetries in Bayesian inference problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We collect in this note some observations on the role of symmetries in Bayesian inference problems, that can be useful or detrimental depending on the way they act on the signal and on the observations. We emphasize in particular the need to gauge away unobservable invariances in the definition of a distance between a signal and its estimator, and the consequences this implies for the statistical mechanics treatment of such models, taking as a motivating example the extensive rank matrix factorization problem.</description>

      <title>Convergence Analysis of Real-time Recurrent Learning (RTRL) for a class of Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are commonly trained with the truncated backpropagation-through-time (TBPTT) algorithm. For the purposes of computational tractability, the TBPTT algorithm truncates the chain rule and calculates the gradient on a finite block of the overall data sequence. Such approximation could lead to significant inaccuracies, as the block length for the truncated backpropagation is typically limited to be much smaller than the overall sequence length. In contrast, Real-time recurrent learning (RTRL) is an online optimization algorithm which asymptotically follows the true gradient of the loss on the data sequence as the number of sequence time steps $t \rightarrow \infty$. RTRL forward propagates the derivatives of the RNN hidden/memory units with respect to the parameters and, using the forward derivatives, performs online updates of the parameters at each time step in the data sequence. RTRL's online forward propagation allows for exact optimization over extremely long data sequences, although it can be computationally costly for models with large numbers of parameters. We prove convergence of the RTRL algorithm for a class of RNNs. The convergence analysis establishes a fixed point for the joint distribution of the data sequence, RNN hidden layer, and the RNN hidden layer forward derivatives as the number of data samples from the sequence and the number of training steps tend to infinity. We prove convergence of the RTRL algorithm to a stationary point of the loss. Numerical studies illustrate our theoretical results. One potential application area for RTRL is the analysis of financial data, which typically involve long time series and models with small to medium numbers of parameters. This makes RTRL computationally tractable and a potentially appealing optimization method for training models. Thus, we include an example of RTRL applied to limit order book data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the BPHZ renormalisation via multi-indices, a combinatorial structure extremely succesful for describing scalar valued singular SPDEs. We propose the multi-indices counterpart of the Hopf algebraic program initiated by Connes and Kreimer on the renormalisation of Feynman diagrams. The construction relies on a well-chosen extraction-contraction coproduct of multi-indices equipped with a correct symmetry factor. We illustrate our construction on the renormalisation of the $ \Phi^4 $ measure.</description>

      <title>Avoiding subtraction and division of stochastic signals using normalizing flows: NFdeconvolve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Across the scientific realm, we find ourselves subtracting or dividing stochastic signals. For instance, consider a stochastic realization, $x$, generated from the addition or multiplication of two stochastic signals $a$ and $b$, namely $x=a+b$ or $x = ab$. For the $x=a+b$ example, $a$ can be fluorescence background and $b$ the signal of interest whose statistics are to be learned from the measured $x$. Similarly, when writing $x=ab$, $a$ can be thought of as the illumination intensity and $b$ the density of fluorescent molecules of interest. Yet dividing or subtracting stochastic signals amplifies noise, and we ask instead whether, using the statistics of $a$ and the measurement of $x$ as input, we can recover the statistics of $b$. Here, we show how normalizing flows can generate an approximation of the probability distribution over $b$, thereby avoiding subtraction or division altogether. This method is implemented in our software package, NFdeconvolve, available on GitHub with a tutorial linked in the main text.</description>

      <title>Stochastic equations with singular drift driven by fractional Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.11937v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider stochastic differential equation $$ d X_t=b(X_t) dt +d W_t^H, $$ where the drift $b$ is either a measure or an integrable function, and $W^H$ is a $d$-dimensional fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter $H\in(0,1)$, $d\in\mathbb{N}$. For the case where $b\in L_p(\mathbb{R}^d)$, $p\in[1,\infty]$ we show weak existence of solutions to this equation under the condition $$ \frac{d}p&lt;\frac1H-1, $$ which is an extension of the Krylov-R\"ockner condition (2005) to the fractional case. We construct a counter-example showing optimality of this condition. If $b$ is a Radon measure, particularly the delta measure, we prove weak existence of solutions to this equation under the optimal condition $H&lt;\frac1{d+1}$. We also show strong well-posedness of solutions to this equation under certain conditions. To establish these results, we utilize the stochastic sewing technique and develop a new version of the stochastic sewing lemma.</description>

      <title>Hitting probabilities and uniformly $S$-transient subgraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the probability that a random walk started inside a subgraph of a larger graph exits that subgraph (or, equivalently, hits the exterior boundary of the subgraph). Considering the chance a random walk started in the subgraph never leaves the subgraph leads to a notion we call "survival" transience, or $S$-transience. In the case where the heat kernel of the larger graph satisfies two-sided Gaussian estimates, we prove an upper bound on the probability of hitting the boundary of the subgraph. Under the additional hypothesis that the subgraph is inner uniform, we prove a two-sided estimate for this probability. The estimate depends upon a harmonic function in the subgraph. We also provide two-sided estimates for related probabilities, such as the harmonic measure (the chance the walk exits the subgraph at a particular point on its boundary).</description>

Abstract: The present manuscript is devoted to the study of the convergence to equilibrium as the noise intensity $\varepsilon&gt;0$ tends to zero for ergodic random systems out of equilibrium of the type \begin{align*} \mathrm{d} X^{\varepsilon}_t(x) = (\mathfrak{b}-\mathfrak{a} X^{\varepsilon}_t(x))\mathrm{d} t+\varepsilon \sqrt{X^{\varepsilon}_t(x)}\mathrm{d} B_t, \quad X^{\varepsilon}_0(x) = x, \quad t\geqslant 0, \end{align*} where $x\geqslant 0$, $\mathfrak{a}&gt;0$ and $\mathfrak{b}&gt;0$ are constants, and $(B_t)_{t \geqslant 0}$ is a one dimensional standard Brownian motion. More precisely, we show the strongest notion of asymptotic profile cut-off phenomenon in the total variation distance and in the renormalized Wasserstein distance when $\varepsilon$ tends to zero with explicit cut-off time, explicit time window, and explicit profile function. In addition, asymptotics of the so-called mixing times are given explicitly.</description>

      <title>$\lambda$-shaped random matrices, $\lambda$-plane trees, and $\lambda$-Dyck paths</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider random matrices whose shape is the dilation $N\lambda$ of a self-conjugate Young diagram $\lambda$. In the large-$N$ limit, the empirical distribution of the squared singular values converges almost surely to a probability distribution $F^{\lambda}$. The moments of $F^{\lambda}$ enumerate two combinatorial objects: $\lambda$-plane trees and $\lambda$-Dyck paths, which we introduce and show to be in bijection. We also prove that the distribution $F^{\lambda}$ is algebraic, in the sense of Rao and Edelman. In the case of fat hook shapes we provide explicit formulae for $F^{\lambda}$ and we express it as a free convolution of two measures involving a Marchenko-Pastur and a Bernoulli distribution.</description>

      <title>Generalized percolation games on the $2$-dimensional square lattice, and ergodicity of associated probabilistic cellular automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Each vertex of the infinite $2$-dimensional square lattice graph is assigned, independently, a label that reads trap with probability $p$, target with probability $q$, and open with probability $(1-p-q)$, and each edge is assigned, independently, a label that reads trap with probability $r$ and open with probability $(1-r)$. A percolation game is played on this random board, wherein two players take turns to make moves, where a move involves relocating the token from where it is currently located, say $(x,y) \in \mathbb{Z}^{2}$, to one of $(x+1,y)$ and $(x,y+1)$. A player wins if she is able to move the token to a vertex labeled a target, or force her opponent to either move the token to a vertex labeled a trap or along an edge labeled a trap. We seek to find a regime, in terms of $p$, $q$ and $r$, in which the probability of this game resulting in a draw equals $0$. We consider special cases of this game, such as when each edge is assigned, independently, a label that reads trap with probability $r$, target with probability $s$, and open with probability $(1-r-s)$, but the vertices are left unlabeled. Various regimes of values of $r$ and $s$ are explored in which the probability of draw is guaranteed to be $0$. We show that the probability of draw in each such game equals $0$ if and only if a certain probabilistic cellular automaton (PCA) is ergodic, following which we implement the technique of weight functions to investigate the regimes in which said PCA is ergodic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01320v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically analyze the original version of the denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) presented in Ho, J., Jain, A., and Abbeel, P., Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 33 (2020), pp. 6840-6851. Our main theorem states that the sequence constructed by the original DDPM sampling algorithm weakly converges to a given data distribution as the number of time steps goes to infinity, under some asymptotic conditions on the parameters for the variance schedule, the $L^2$-based score estimation error, and the noise estimating function with respect to the number of time steps. In proving the theorem, we reveal that the sampling sequence can be seen as an exponential integrator type approximation of a reverse time stochastic differential equation over a finite time interval.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09516v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present two sharp empirical Bernstein inequalities for symmetric random matrices with bounded eigenvalues. By sharp, we mean that both inequalities adapt to the unknown variance in a tight manner: the deviation captured by the first-order $1/\sqrt{n}$ term asymptotically matches the matrix Bernstein inequality exactly, including constants, the latter requiring knowledge of the variance. Our first inequality holds for the sample mean of independent matrices, and our second inequality holds for a mean estimator under martingale dependence at stopping times.</description>

Abstract: On the flat torus $\mathbb{T}^m=\mathbb{R}^m/\mathbb{Z}^m$ with angular coordinates $\vec{\theta}$ we consider the random function $F_R=\mathfrak{a}\big(\, R^{-1} \sqrt{\Delta}\,\big) W$, where $R&gt;0$, $\Delta$ is the Laplacian on this flat torus, $\mathfrak{a}$ is an even Schwartz function on $\mathbb{R}$ such that $\mathfrak{a}(0)&gt;0$ and $W$ is the Gaussian white noise on $\mathbb{T}^m$ viewed as a random generalized function. For any $f\in C(\mathbb{T}^m)$ we set \[ Z_R(f):=\sum_{\nabla F_R(\vec{\theta})=0} f(\vec{\theta}) \] We prove that if the support of $f$ is contained in a geodesic ball of $\mathbb{T}^m$, then the variance of $Z_R(f)$ is asymptotic to $const\times R^{m}$ as $R\to\infty$. We use this to prove that if $m\geq 2$, then as $N\to\infty$ the random measures $N^{-m}Z_N(-)$ converge a.s. to an explicit multiple of the volume measure on the flat torus.</description>

      <title>Decoupled Functional Central Limit Theorems for Two-Time-Scale Stochastic Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17070v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In two-time-scale stochastic approximation (SA), two iterates are updated at different rates, governed by distinct step sizes, with each update influencing the other. Previous studies have demonstrated that the convergence rates of the error terms for these updates depend solely on their respective step sizes, a property known as decoupled convergence. However, a functional version of this decoupled convergence has not been explored. Our work fills this gap by establishing decoupled functional central limit theorems for two-time-scale SA, offering a more precise characterization of its asymptotic behavior. To achieve these results, we leverage the martingale problem approach and establish tightness as a crucial intermediate step. Furthermore, to address the interdependence between different time scales, we introduce an innovative auxiliary sequence to eliminate the primary influence of the fast-time-scale update on the slow-time-scale update.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we study the cover time of the simple random walk on the giant component of supercritical $d$-dimensional random geometric graphs on $n$ vertices. We show that the cover time undergoes a jump at the connectivity threshold radius $r_c$: with $r_g$ denoting the threshold for having a giant component, we show that if the radius $r$ satisfies $(1+\eps)r_g \le r \le (1-\eps)r_c$ for $\eps &gt; 0$ arbitrarily small, the cover time of the giant component is asymptotically almost surely $\Theta(n \log^2 n$). On the other hand, we show that for $r \ge (1+\eps)r_c$, the cover time of the graph is asymptotically almost surely $\Theta(n \log n)$ (which was known for $d=2$ only for a radius larger by a constant factor).</description>

      <title>Stochastic Calculus via Stopping Derivatives</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a substantial portion of stochastic calculus can be developed along similar lines to ordinary calculus, with derivative-based concepts driving the development. We define a notion of stopping derivative, which is a form of right derivative with respect to stopping times. Using this, we define the drift and variance rate of a process as stopping derivatives for conditional expectation and conditional variance respectively. Applying elementary, derivative-based methods, we derive a calculus of rules describing how drift and variance rate transform under constructions on processes, culminating in a version of the multi-dimensional It\^o formula. Our approach connects with the standard machinery of stochastic calculus via a theorem establishing that continuous processes with zero drift coincide with continuous local martingales. This equivalence allows us to derive a Fundamental Theorem of Calculus for stopping derivatives, which relates the quantities of drift and variance rate, defined as stopping derivatives, to parameters used in the description of a process as a stochastic integral.</description>

Abstract: We obtain two-sided heat kernel estimates for Riemannian manifolds with ends with mixed boundary condition, provided that the heat kernels for the ends are well understood. These results extend previous results of Grigor'yan and Saloff-Coste by allowing for Dirichlet boundary condition. The proof requires the construction of a global harmonic function which is then used in the $h$-transform technique.</description>

      <title>Optimal Scaling for the Proximal Langevin Algorithm in High Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.10793v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Metropolis-adjusted Langevin (MALA) algorithm is a sampling algorithm that incorporates the gradient of the logarithm of the target density in its proposal distribution. In an earlier joint work \citet{pill:stu:12}, the author had extended the seminal work of \cite{Robe:Rose:98} and showed that in stationarity, MALA applied to an $N-$dimensional approximation of the target will take ${\cal O}(N^{\frac13})$ steps to explore its target measure. It was also shown that the MALA algorithm is optimized at an average acceptance probability of $0.574$. In \citet{pere:16}, the author introduced the proximal MALA algorithm where the gradient of the log target density is replaced by the proximal function. In this paper, we show that for a wide class of twice differentiable target densities, the proximal MALA enjoys the same optimal scaling as that of MALA in high dimensions and also has an average optimal acceptance probability of $0.574$. The results of this paper thus give the following practically useful guideline: for smooth target densities where it is expensive to compute the gradient while implementing MALA, users may replace the gradient with the corresponding proximal function (that can be often computed relatively cheaply via convex optimization) \emph{without} losing any efficiency gains from optimal scaling. This confirms some of the empirical observations made in \cite{pere:16}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08243v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper primarily establishes an asymptotic variance estimate for smooth linear statistics associated with zero sets of systems of random holomorphic sections in a sequence of positive Hermitian holomorphic line bundles on a compact K\"ahler manifold $(X, \omega)$. Using this variance estimate and the expected distribution, we derive an equidistribution result for zeros of these random systems, which, in terms of approximation theory, proves that the smooth positive closed form $\omega^{k}$ can be approximated by currents of integration along analytic subsets of $X$ of codimension $k$, $k \in \{1, \ldots, n\}$. The probability measures taken into consideration in this paper are sufficiently general to include a wide range of the measures commonly encountered in the literature, for which we give equidistribution results at the end, such as the standard Gaussian measure, Fubini-Study measure, the area measure of spheres, probability measures whose distributions have bounded densities with logarithmically decaying tails and locally moderate measures among others.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03169v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents a comprehensive understanding of the estimation of a planted low-rank signal from a general spiked tensor model near the computational threshold. Relying on standard tools from the theory of large random matrices, we characterize the large-dimensional spectral behavior of the unfoldings of the data tensor and exhibit relevant signal-to-noise ratios governing the detectability of the principal directions of the signal. These results allow to accurately predict the reconstruction performance of truncated multilinear SVD (MLSVD) in the non-trivial regime. This is particularly important since it serves as an initialization of the higher-order orthogonal iteration (HOOI) scheme, whose convergence to the best low-multilinear-rank approximation depends entirely on its initialization. We give a sufficient condition for the convergence of HOOI and show that the number of iterations before convergence tends to $1$ in the large-dimensional limit.</description>

      <title>Exact Label Recovery in Euclidean Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a family of label recovery problems on weighted Euclidean random graphs. The vertices of a graph are embedded in $\mathbb{R}^d$ according to a Poisson point process, and are assigned to a discrete community label. Our goal is to infer the vertex labels, given edge weights whose distributions depend on the vertex labels as well as their geometric positions. Our general model provides a geometric extension of popular graph and matrix problems, including submatrix localization and $\mathbb{Z}_2$-synchronization, and includes the Geometric Stochastic Block Model (proposed by Sankararaman and Baccelli) as a special case. We study the fundamental limits of exact recovery of the vertex labels. Under a mild distinctness of distributions assumption, we determine the information-theoretic threshold for exact label recovery, in terms of a Chernoff-Hellinger divergence criterion. Impossibility of recovery below the threshold is proven by a unified analysis using a Cram\'er lower bound. Achievability above the threshold is proven via an efficient two-phase algorithm, where the first phase computes an almost-exact labeling through a local propagation scheme, while the second phase refines the labels. The information-theoretic threshold is dictated by the performance of the so-called genie estimator, which decodes the label of a single vertex given all the other labels. This shows that our proposed models exhibit the local-to-global amplification phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Explicit dynamical properties of the Pelikan random map in the chaotic region and at the intermittent critical point towards the non-chaotic region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Pelikan random trajectories $x_t \in [0,1[$ are generated by choosing the chaotic doubling map $x_{t+1}=2 x_t [mod 1]$ with probability $p$ and the non-chaotic half-contracting map $x_{t+1}=\frac{x_t}{2}$ with probability $(1-p)$. We compute various dynamical observables as a function of the parameter $p$ via two perspectives. In the first perspective, we focus on the closed dynamics within the subspace of probability densities that remain constant on the binary-intervals $x \in [ 2^{-n-1}, 2^{-n}[$ partitioning the interval $x \in [0,1[$ : the dynamics for the weights $\pi_t(n)$ of these intervals corresponds to a biased random walk on the half-infinite lattice $n \in \{0,1,2,..+\infty\}$ with resetting occurring with probability $p$ from the origin $n=0$ towards any site $n$ drawn with the distribution $2^{-n-1}$. In the second perspective, we study the Pelikan dynamics for any initial condition $x_0$ via the binary decomposition $x_t = \sum_{l=1}^{+\infty} \frac{\sigma_l (t)}{2^l} $, where the dynamics for the half-infinite lattice $l=1,2,..$ of the binary variables $\sigma_l(t) \in \{0,1\}$ can be reformulated in terms of two global variables : $z_t$ corresponds to a biased random walk on the half-infinite lattice $z \in \{0,1,2,..+\infty\}$ that may remain at the origin $z=0$ with probability $p$, while $F_t \in \{0,1,2,..t\}$ counts the number of time-steps $\tau \in [0,t-1]$ where $z_{\tau+1}=0=z_{\tau}$ and represents the number of the binary coefficients of the initial condition that have been erased. We discuss typical and large deviations properties in the chaotic region $\frac{1}{2}&lt;p&lt;1 $ as well as at the intermittent critical point $p_c=\frac{1}{2}$ towards the non-chaotic region $0&lt;p&lt;\frac{1}{2}$.</description>

      <title>Electricity Price Prediction Using Multi-Kernel Gaussian Process Regression Combined with Kernel-Based Support Vector Regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00123v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new hybrid model for predicting German electricity prices. The algorithm is based on combining Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and Support Vector Regression (SVR). While GPR is a competent model for learning the stochastic pattern within the data and interpolation, its performance for out-of-sample data is not very promising. By choosing a suitable data-dependent covariance function, we can enhance the performance of GPR for the tested German hourly power prices. However, since the out-of-sample prediction depends on the training data, the prediction is vulnerable to noise and outliers. To overcome this issue, a separate prediction is made using SVR, which applies margin-based optimization, having an advantage in dealing with non-linear processes and outliers, since only certain necessary points (support vectors) in the training data are responsible for regression. Both individual predictions are later combined using the performance-based weight assignment method. A test on historic German power prices shows that this approach outperforms its chosen benchmarks such as the autoregressive exogenous model, the naive approach, as well as the long short-term memory approach of prediction.</description>

      <title>Parsings of Stationary Processes, Stopping Times and the Fundamental Pointwise Convergence Theorems of Ergodic Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The idea of a parsing of a stationary process according to a collection of words is introduced, and the basic framework required for the asymptotic analysis of these parsings is presented. We demonstrate how the pointwise ergodic theorem and the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman theorem can be deduced from their respective weaker convergence in probability versions combined with our observations regarding parsings, where the parsings are done according to collections that originate in stopping times tailored for that purpose.</description>

      <title>Pathwise guessing in categorical time series with unbounded alphabets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The following learning problem arises naturally in various applications: Given a finite sample from a categorical or count time series, can we learn a function of the sample that (nearly) maximizes the probability of correctly guessing the values of a given portion of the data using the values from the remaining parts? Unlike the classical task of estimating conditional probabilities in a stochastic process, our approach avoids explicitly estimating these probabilities. We propose a non-parametric guessing function with a learning rate that is independent of the alphabet size. Our analysis focuses on a broad class of time series models that encompasses finite-order Markov chains, some hidden Markov chains, Poisson regression for count process, and one-dimensional Gibbs measures. Additionally, we establish a minimax lower bound for the rate of convergence of the risk associated with our guessing problem. This lower bound matches the upper bound achieved by our estimator up to a logarithmic factor, demonstrating its near-optimality.</description>

      <title>Monotone Curve Estimation via Convex Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06975v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A principal curve serves as a powerful tool for uncovering underlying structures of data through 1-dimensional smooth and continuous representations. On the basis of optimal transport theories, this paper introduces a novel principal curve framework constrained by monotonicity with rigorous theoretical justifications. We establish statistical guarantees for our monotone curve estimate, including expected empirical and generalized mean squared errors, while proving the existence of such estimates. These statistical foundations justify adopting the popular early stopping procedure in machine learning to implement our numeric algorithm with neural networks. Comprehensive simulation studies reveal that the proposed monotone curve estimate outperforms competing methods in terms of accuracy when the data exhibits a monotonic structure. Moreover, through two real-world applications on future prices of copper, gold, and silver, and avocado prices and sales volume, we underline the robustness of our curve estimate against variable transformation, further confirming its effective applicability for noisy and complex data sets. We believe that this monotone curve-fitting framework offers significant potential for numerous applications where monotonic relationships are intrinsic or need to be imposed.</description>
