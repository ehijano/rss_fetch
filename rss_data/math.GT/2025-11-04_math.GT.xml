      <title>Biquandle Module Quiver Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an infinite family of quiver representation-valued invariants of classical, virtual and surface-knots and links associated to a choice of finite biquandle, commutative unital ring, biquandle module and set of biquandle endomorphisms. As an application, we use this quiver to define a new infinite family of two-variable polynomial invariants.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Lefschetz fibrations with four-dimensional fibers from Seiberg--Witten theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish constraints on the topology of smooth Lefschetz fibrations with $4$-dimensional fibers, by studying the family Bauer-Furuta invariant. To compute this invariant, we analyze the framed bordism class of 1-dimensional Seiberg--Witten moduli spaces using the local index theorem by Bismut--Freed. Using this, we deduce new obstructions to the smooth isotopy to the identity for compositions of Dehn twists on $(-2)$--spheres in closed $4$-manifolds. We obtain several applications: (1) We exhibit the first examples of closed simply-connected symplectic $4$-manifolds admitting Torelli symplectomorphisms which are smoothly non-trivial. In particular, their symplectic Torelli mapping class group is not generated by squared Dehn--Seidel twists on Lagrangian spheres -- providing a negative answer to a question of Donaldson. (2) We provide the first examples of irreducible closed $4$-manifolds (both symplectic and non-symplectic) that admit exotic diffeomorphisms given by Seifert-fibered Dehn twist.</description>

Abstract: We survey techniques for constructing spaces with non-trivial self covers. These process include methods for building low and high dimension continua which non-trivially self. We also discuss several related group theoretic and topological concerns. Statements of a number of open problems related to self covering phenomena are included.</description>

      <title>A local $\mathfrak{gl}_{1|1}$-action on odd Khovanov homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that odd Khovanov homology carries an action of the super Lie algebra $\mathfrak{gl}_{1|1}$, given extra choice of markings on the link. Moreover, we show that this action arises from an action on super $\mathfrak{gl}_{2}$-foams, in the extended-TQFT framework developed by the second author and Vaz; in particular, it extends to tangles. Finally, we relate the action to torsion $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ in pretzel links $P(n,n,-n)$. In particular, this shows that all torsion can appear in odd Khovanov homology.</description>

      <title>Bounded domains in the 3-dimensional space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the shapes of compact connected 3-manifolds with connected smooth boundary in the 3-dimensional Euclidean space $\boldsymbol{R}^3$. We call them bounded domains. Since compact connected surfaces in $\boldsymbol{R}^3$ bound unique bounded domains, the objects are the same as compact connected surfaces in $\boldsymbol{R}^3$. To understand their shapes, we use the Morse height functions $F: M\to \boldsymbol{R}$ which are the orthogonal projections from the bounded domains $M$ to lines, and their Reeb graphs $\mathcal{R}_F$ and $\mathcal{R}_{F|\partial M}$ which are obtained by identifying connected components of level sets of maps to points. We introduce the weighted Reeb graphs $\mathcal{R}_F^w$ and the weighted indexed Reeb graphs $\mathcal{R}_F^{wi}$. We investigate whether a bounded domain admits a Morse height function $F$ with the weighted Reeb graphs $\mathcal{R}_F^w$ with small weight. We show that if the weights are less than 2. $M$ can be deformed by isotopy to an embedded handlebody. The original question which lead us to investigate bounded domains is the following question: "Can the domain $M$ be isotoped so that, for every point of the boundary $\partial M$, there is a ray from the point which intersects the domain $M$ only at the end point?" In other words, "Can $M$ be isotoped to $\iota(M)$ so that every point of $\partial \iota (M)$ is visible from the infinity?" Under the minNCP hypothesis, we show that if a bounded domain $M$ can be isotoped to $\iota(M)$ so that every point of the boundary is visible from the infinity, then $M$ is an embedded handlebody. Here the minNCP hypothesis asserts that, if $M$ is isotopic to a visible $\iota(M)$, $\iota(M)$ can be taken so that $z:\iota(M)\to \boldsymbol{R}$ is a Morse height function with minimum number of critical points in the isotopy class of the embedding $M\subset \boldsymbol{R}^3$.</description>

      <title>Quasi-holomorphic maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new notion, called quasi-holomorphic maps. These are real smooth maps equipped with a structure that imitates the singularities and singularity stratifications of holomorphic maps on the source and target manifolds, although the manifolds themselves carry no global complex structures. Some important examples of quasi-holomorphic maps are branched coverings and links of finitely determined holomorphic map germs. We show a Pontryagin--Thom type construction for a ``universal'' quasi-holomorphic map with prescribed multisingularities, from which all such maps can be induced, and a similar result for maps with prescribed singularities. Applying this, we prove that the Thom polynomials of holomorphic singularities determine the cohomology classes represented by the singular loci of not only holomorphic but quasi-holomorphic maps as well. As another application we define the cobordism groups of quasi-holomorphic maps with restricted multisingularities, whose classifying space was given by the above construction. We completely compute the free parts of these cobordism groups and in some special cases also obtain results on their torsion parts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Khovanov complex of closed piecewise linear curves in the 3-space. A polygonal link representation endows the cube of resolutions with an additional combinatorial structure. The set of symmetries preserving this structure and its quotient under link equivalence are studied. Our results offer new combinatorial ways of computing Khovanov homology and might lead to other group-theoretic invariants of links.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a family of $4$-regular graphs constructed to test for the presence of combinatorial structure in a sequence of distinct real numbers. We show that the graphs constructed from the Kronecker sequence can be embedded into the torus, while the graphs constructed from the binary van der Corput sequence can be embedded into the Chamanara surface, in both cases with the possible removal of one edge. These results allude to a general theory of sequence graphs which can be embedded into particular translation surfaces coming from interval exchange transformations.</description>

      <title>Small Cancellation for Random Branched Covers of Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a random model for an $n$-fold branched cover of a finite acceptable $2$-complex $X$. This includes presentation $2$-complexes for finitely presented groups satisfying some mild conditions. For any $\lambda &gt;0$, we show that as $n$ goes to infinity, a random branched cover asymptotically almost surely is homotopy equivalent to a $2$-complex satisfying geometric small cancellation $C'(\lambda)$. As a consequence the fundamental group of a random branched cover is asymptotically almost surely Gromov hyperbolic and has small cohomological dimension.</description>

      <title>Decorated Marked Surfaces with vortices: Cluster braid group vs. braid twist group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathbf{S}$ be a marked surface with vortices (=punctures with extra $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry). We study the decorated version $\mathbf{S}_\bigtriangleup$, where the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry lifts to the relation that the fourth power of the braid twist of any collision path (connecting a decoration in $\bigtriangleup$ and a vortex) is identity.
  We prove the following three groups are isomorphic: King-Qiu's cluster braid group associated to $\mathbf{S}$, the braid twist group of $\mathbf{S}_\bigtriangleup$ and the fundamental group of Bridgeland-Smith's moduli space of $\mathbf{S}$-framed GMN differentials. Moreover, we give finite presentations of such groups.</description>

      <title>Tropicalising hypergeometric $\tau$-functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weighted Hurwitz numbers arise as coefficients in the power sum expansion of deformed hypergeometric $\tau$--functions. They specialise to essentially all known cases of Hurwitz numbers, including classical, monotone, strictly monotone and completed cycles Hurwitz numbers. In this work, we develop a tropical geometry framework for their study, thus enabling a simultaneous investigation of all these cases. We obtain a correspondence theorem expressing weighted Hurwitz numbers in terms of tropical covers. Using this tropical approach, we generalise most known structural results previously obtained for the aforementioned special cases to all weighted Hurwitz numbers. In particular, we study their polynomiality and derive wall--crossing formulae. Moreover, we introduce elliptic weighted Hurwitz numbers and derive tropical mirror symmetry for these new invariants, i.e. we prove that their generating function is quasimodular and that they may be expressed as Feynman integrals.</description>

Abstract: Adapting the construction of global Kuranishi charts to the contact setting, we associate to any non-degenerate contact manifold a flow category based on Reeb orbits and moduli spaces of pseudo-holomorphic buildings. The construction lifts contact homology and is natural in the sense that to any exact symplectic cobordism we can associate a flow bimodule between the flow categories of its ends.</description>

Abstract: The paper is devoted to the study of homotopy properties of stabilizers of smooth functions on oriented surfaces, i.e., groups of diffeomorphisms of surfaces preserving a given function. For some class of smooth functions which is a generalization of the class of Morse-Bott functions on oriented surfaces, the homotopy type of the connected component of the identity map of the stabilizer is completely described.</description>

Abstract: We determine the minimum dilatation $\delta_n$ among pseudo-Anosov braids with $n$ strands, for large enough values of $n$. These are the dilatations attained by the examples of Hironaka-Kin and Venzke, and they satisfy $\lim_{n \to \infty} \delta_n^n = (2+\sqrt{3})^2 \approx 13.928$. Together with previous work, this result confirms conjectures by Kin-Takasawa and Venzke, and solves the minimum dilatation problem on the $n$-punctured sphere, for all but $6$ values of $n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09524v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, by employing the Gauss-Bonnet theorem for Riemannian simplices due to Allendoerfer and Weil, we show that if a closed nonpositively curved $4$-manifold has nonzero Euler characteristic, then its simplicial volume is necessarily positive. This result partially resolves conjectures posed by Connell-Ruan-Wang and Gromov concerning the relationship between the simplicial volume and the Euler characteristic for four-dimensional manifolds. As an application, we show that if a closed nonpositively curved $4$-manifold has negative Ricci curvature, then its simplicial volume is positive, thereby confirming in dimension four another conjecture of Gromov on the positivity of simplicial volume.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We first prove that given a Fuchsian representation $\rho_\circ: \pi_1S \ra {\rm PSL}(2,\R)$, where $S$ is a closed oriented surface of genus $\geq 2$, any hyperbolic cone-metric on $S$ with cone-angles $&gt;2\pi$ isometrically embeds as a future-convex bent Cauchy surface in a globally hyperbolic maximal Cauchy compact (GHMC) anti-de Sitter (2+1)-spacetime whose left representation is $\rho_\circ$. Second, we show that given any two such cone-metrics, there exists a GHMC anti-de Sitter (2+1)-spacetime in which the cone-metrics embed simultaneously, one as a future-convex bent Cauchy surface and one as a past-convex. Furthermore, in both cases we establish that such a spacetime and embeddings are unique provided that the cone-metrics are sufficiently small.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the full Fock--Goncharov conjecture for $\mathcal{A}_{SL_2,\Sigma_{g,p}}$, the $\mathcal{A}$-cluster variety of the moduli of decorated twisted $SL_2$-local systems on triangulable surfaces $\Sigma_{g,p}$ with at least 2 punctures. Equivalently, we show that the tagged skein algebra $Sk^{ta}(\Sigma)$, or the middle cluster algebra $\mathrm{mid}(\mathcal{A})$, coincides with the upper cluster algebra $U(\Sigma)$. Inspired by the work of Shen--Sun--Weng, we introduce the localized cluster variety $\mathring{\mathcal{A}}$ as the algebraic version of the decorated Teichm\"uller space $\mathcal{T}^d(\Sigma)$. We show its global section $\Gamma(\mathring{\mathcal{A}},\mathcal{O}_{\mathring{\mathcal{A}}})$ equals the classical Roger-Yang skein algebra $Sk^{RY}_{q\to1}(\Sigma)$, providing a quantization of $\mathcal{T}^d(\Sigma)$ in terms of the Roger--Yang skein algebra $Sk^{RY}_q(\Sigma)$. As a consequence of our geometric characterizations, we deduce normality and the Gorenstein property of the tagged skein algebra $Sk^{ta}(\Sigma)$ and the classical Roger--Yang skein algebra $Sk^{RY}_{q\to1}(\Sigma)$, as well as finite generation of upper cluster algebra $U(\Sigma)$.</description>

      <title>Geometric models of simple Lie algebras via singularity theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22836v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that ADE Dynkin diagrams classify both the simply-laced simple Lie algebras and simple singularities. We introduce a polygonal wheel in a plane for each case of ADE, called the Coxeter wheel. We show that equivalence classes of edges and spokes of a Coxeter wheel form a geometric root system isomorphic to the classical root system of the corresponding type. This wheel is in fact derived from the Milnor fiber of corresponding simple singularities of two variables, and the bilinear form on the geometric root system is the negative of its symmetrized Seifert form. Furthermore, we give a completely geometric definition of simple Lie algebras using arcs, Seifert form and variation operator of the singularity theory.</description>
