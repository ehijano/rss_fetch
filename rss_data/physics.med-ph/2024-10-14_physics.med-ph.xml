      <title>Optimizing Quantitative Photoacoustic Imaging Systems: The Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao Bound Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantitative photoacoustic computed tomography (qPACT) is an emerging medical imaging modality that carries the promise of high-contrast, fine-resolution imaging of clinically relevant quantities like hemoglobin concentration and blood-oxygen saturation. However, qPACT image reconstruction is governed by a multiphysics, partial differential equation (PDE) based inverse problem that is highly non-linear and severely ill-posed. Compounding the difficulty of the problem is the lack of established design standards for qPACT imaging systems, as there is currently a proliferation of qPACT system designs for various applications and it is unknown which ones are optimal or how to best modify the systems under various design constraints. This work introduces a novel computational approach for the optimal experimental design (OED) of qPACT imaging systems based on the Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB). Our approach incorporates several techniques to address challenges associated with forming the bound in the infinite-dimensional function space setting of qPACT, including priors with trace-class covariance operators and the use of the variational adjoint method to compute derivatives of the log-likelihood function needed in the bound computation. The resulting Bayesian CRB based design metric is computationally efficient and independent of the choice of estimator used to solve the inverse problem. The efficacy of the bound in guiding experimental design was demonstrated in a numerical study of qPACT design schemes under a stylized two-dimensional imaging geometry. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose Bayesian CRB based design for systems governed by PDEs.</description>

      <title>Tomographic Model Based Iterative Reconstruction of Symmetric Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT) reconstruction of objects with cylindrical symmetry can be performed with a single projection. When the measured rays are parallel, and the axis of symmetry is perpendicular to the optical axis, the data can be modeled with the so-called Abel Transform. The Abel Transform has been extensively studied and many methods exist for accurate reconstruction. However, most CT geometries are cone-beam rather than parallel-beam. Using Abel methods for reconstruction in these cases can lead to distortions and reconstruction artifacts. Here, we develop analytic and model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR) methods to reconstruct symmetric objects with an arbitrary axis of symmetry from a cone-beam geometry. The MBIR methods demonstrate superior results relative to the analytic inversion methods by mitigating artifacts and reducing noise while retaining fine image features. We demonstrate the efficacy of our methods using simulated and experimentally-acquired x-ray and neutron projections.</description>

      <title>FPGA-based digitizer for BGO-based time-of-flight PET</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel FPGA-based bismuth germanate (BGO) time-of-flight (TOF) digitizer, implemented on an FPGA (VC707 evaluation kit, Xilinx). This digitizer was designed to address the recently highlighted characteristics of BGO, which generates scintillation and prompt Cerenkov photons when 511-keV photon interacts with BGO. The developed digitizer independently processes these two types of photons for precise energy and timing measurements. The digitizer incorporates a noise-resistant binary counter that measures energy signals using a time-over-threshold (TOT) method. For timing measurement, we employ an embedded dual-side monitoring time-to-digital converter (TDC), which efficiently captures timing information while maintaining low resource usage. We validated the efficacy of our FPGA-based TOF digitizer through extensive experiments, including both an electrical setup and a coincidence test using BGO pixels. Our evaluations of TOT energy and timing performance utilized two $3 \times 3 \times 20 \ \text{mm}^3$ BGO pixels coupled to CHK-HD MT silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs). The digitizer achieved a coincidence timing resolution (CTR) of 407 ps full width at half maximum (FWHM) for coincidence events falling within the full width at tenth maximum (FWTM) of the measured TOT energy spectrum. Notably, when measured with an oscilloscope, the same detector pair exhibited a CTR of 403 ps FWHM, confirming that the performance of the developed digitizer is comparable to that of oscilloscopes. With the low resource usage of our design, it offers significant potential for scalability, making it particularly promising for multi-channel BGO-based PET systems.</description>

      <title>Cross-Detection and Dual-Side Monitoring Schemes for FPGA-Based High-Accuracy and High-Precision Time-to-Digital Converters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a novel field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based Time-to-Digital Converter (TDC) design suitable for high timing resolution applications, utilizing two new techniques. First, a cross-detection (CD) method is introduced that minimizes the occurrence of bubbles, which cause inaccuracy in the timing measurement of a TDC in thermometer codes, by altering the conventional sampling pattern, thereby yielding an average bin size half of its typical size. The second technique employs dual-side monitoring (DSM) of thermometer codes, including end-of-propagation (EOP) and start-of-propagation (SOP). Distinct from conventional TDCs, which focus solely on SOP thermometer codes, this technique utilizes EOP to calibrate SOP, simultaneously enhancing time resolution and the TDC's stability against changes in temperature and location. The proposed DSM scheme necessitates only an additional CARRY4 for capturing the EOP thermometer code, rendering it a resource-efficient solution. The CD-DSM TDC has been successfully implemented on a Virtex-7 Xilinx FPGA (a 28-nm process), with an average bin size of 6.1 ps and a root mean square of 3.8 ps. Compared to conventional TDCs, the CD-DSM TDC offers superior linearity. The successful measurement of ultra-high coincidence timing resolution (CTR) from two Cerenkov radiator integrated microchannel plate photomultiplier tubes (CRI-MCP-PMTs) was conducted with the CD-DSM TDCs for sub-100 ps timing measurements. A comparison with current-edge TDCs further highlights the superior performance of the CD-DSM TDCs.</description>

      <title>Monitoring Drug-Induced Brain Activity Changes with Functional Ultrasound Imaging and Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Functional ultrasound imaging (fUSI) is a cutting-edge technology that measures changes in cerebral blood volume (CBV) by detecting backscattered echoes from red blood cells moving within its field of view (FOV). It offers high spatiotemporal resolution and sensitivity, allowing for detailed visualization of cerebral blood flow dynamics. While fUSI has been utilized in preclinical drug development studies to explore the mechanisms of action of various drugs targeting the central nervous system, many of these studies have primarily focused on predetermined regions of interest (ROIs). This focus may overlook relevant brain activity outside these specific areas, which could influence the results. To address this limitation, we combined convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with fUSI to comprehensively understand the pharmacokinetic process of Dizocilpine, also known as MK-801, a drug that blocks the N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor in the central nervous system. CNN and class activation mapping (CAM) revealed the spatiotemporal effects of MK-801, which originated in the cortex and propagated to the hippocampus, demonstrating the ability to detect dynamic drug effects over time. Additionally, CNN and CAM assessed the impact of anesthesia on the spatiotemporal hemodynamics of the brain, revealing no distinct patterns between early and late stages. The integration of fUSI and CNN provides a powerful tool to gain insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics of drug action in the brain. This combination enables a comprehensive and unbiased assessment of drug effects on brain function, potentially accelerating the development of new therapies in neuropharmacological studies.</description>

      <title>Tracking the Morphological Evolution of Neuronal Dendrites by First-Passage Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A high degree of structural complexity arises in dynamic neuronal dendrites due to extensive branching patterns and diverse spine morphologies, which enable the nervous system to adjust function, construct complex input pathways and thereby enhance the computational power of the system. Owing to the determinant role of dendrite morphology in the functionality of the nervous system, recognition of pathological changes due to neurodegenerative disorders is of crucial importance. We show that the statistical analysis of a temporary signal generated by cargos that have diffusively passed through the complex dendritic structure yields vital information about dendrite morphology. As a feasible scenario, we propose engineering mRNA-carrying multilamellar liposomes to diffusively reach the soma and release mRNAs, which encodes a specific protein upon encountering ribosomes. The concentration of this protein over a large population of neurons can be externally measured, as a detectable temporary signal. By developing a stochastic coarse-grained approach for first-passage through dendrites, we connect the model parameters to the characteristics of the evolving signal and, on the other hand, map them to the key morphological properties affected by neurodegenerative diseases -- including the density and size of spines, the extent of the tree, and the segmental increase of dendrite diameter towards soma. Thus, we establish a direct link between the dendrite morphology and the statistical characteristics of the detectable signal. Our approach provides a fast noninvasive measurement technique to indirectly extract vital information about the morphological evolution of dendrites in the course of neurodegenerative disease progression.</description>

      <title>TraX Engine: Advanced Processing of Radiation Data Acquired by Timepix Detectors in Space, Medical, Educational and Imaging Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The TraX Engine is an advanced data processing tool developed by ADVACAM in collaboration with the European Space Agency (ESA), specifically designed for analyzing data from Timepix detectors equipped with various sensor materials (Si, CdTe, GaAs, SiC). TraX Engine can process large datasets across various scientific and medical applications, including space radiation monitoring, particle therapy, and imaging. In space applications, the TraX Engine has been used to process data from satellites like OneWeb JoeySat deployed in LEO orbit, where it continuously monitors space radiation environments measuring flux, dose, and dose rate in real-time. In medical applications, particularly in particle therapy, the TraX Engine is used to process data to characterize radiation fields in terms of particle flux, Linear Energy Transfer, and spatial distribution of the radiation dose. The TraX Engine can identify and classify scattered particles, such as secondary protons and electrons, and estimate their contribution to out-of-field doses. In imaging applications, the TraX Engine is integrated into Compton cameras, where it supports photon source localization through directional reconstruction of photons. The system ability to identify gamma radiation source with high precision makes it suitable for medical imaging tasks, such as tracking I-131 used in thyroid cancer treatment or localizing radiation sources. This paper presents the architecture and capabilities of the newly developed software TraX Engine, alongside results from various applications, demonstrating its role in particle tracking, radiation monitoring, imaging, and others. With its modular architecture, the TraX Engine offers multiple interfaces, including a command-line tool, an API, a web portal, and a graphical user interface, ensuring usability across different fields and user expertise levels.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Convergent Motion Compensated Image Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motion correction aims to prevent motion artefacts which may be caused by respiration, heartbeat, or head movements for example. In a preliminary step, the measured data is divided in gates corresponding to motion states, and displacement maps from a reference state to each motion state are estimated. One common technique to perform motion correction is the motion compensated image reconstruction framework, where the displacement maps are integrated into the forward model corresponding to gated data. For standard algorithms, the computational cost per iteration increases linearly with the number of gates. In order to accelerate the reconstruction, we propose the use of a randomized and convergent algorithm whose per iteration computational cost scales constantly with the number of gates. We show improvement on theoretical rates of convergence and observe the predicted speed-up on two synthetic datasets corresponding to rigid and non-rigid motion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper analyzes conventional and deep learning methods for eliminating electromagnetic interference (EMI) in MRI systems. We compare traditional analytical and adaptive techniques with advanced deep learning approaches. Key strengths and limitations of each method are highlighted. Recent advancements in active EMI elimination, such as external EMI receiver coils, are discussed alongside deep learning methods, which show superior EMI suppression by leveraging neural networks trained on MRI data. While deep learning improves EMI elimination and diagnostic capabilities, it introduces security and safety concerns, particularly in commercial applications. A balanced approach, integrating conventional reliability with deep learning's advanced capabilities, is proposed for more effective EMI suppression in MRI systems.</description>

      <title>Quantification of the Plan Aperture Modulation of Radiotherapy Treatment Plans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel metric, Plan Aperture Modulation (PAM), developed to quantify the modulation of radiotherapy treatment plans. PAM aims to provide a clear geometric interpretation, addressing the limitations of previous complexity metrics and facilitating its integration into treatment planning systems (TPSs) and clinical workflows. The PAM metric was defined as the average fraction of the target area outside the beam aperture, weighted over all control points in a treatment plan. The metric was evaluated in VMAT plans for two sites: prostate with lymph nodes and lung SBRT. Plans with varying complexities were generated using the Eclipse TPS, and PAM was compared to established metrics, including Plan Modulation (PM), Modulation Complexity Score (MCS), and monitor units per Gray (MU/Gy). The relationship between PAM and the Modulation Factor (MF), which quantifies the increase in MUs due to plan modulation, was also investigated. PAM provided a more intuitive assessment of plan modulation compared to the other metrics, and was validated across different delivery systems, such as C-arm linacs and Halcyon systems. The metric outperformed the previous metrics, indicated a zero modulation for Dynamic Conformal Arc plans, and was independent of confounding variables, such as treatment technique, beam energy, delivery system, and patient anatomy. Derived equations enabled the calculation of MF based on PAM, allowing for a robust quantification of plan modulation. PAM is a robust and intuitive metric for quantifying modulation in radiotherapy plans. It overcomes the limitations of previous metrics and can be readily implemented in TPSs to control plan modulation during optimization and for reporting. PAM is a promising tool for improving treatment planning workflows and for comparing and benchmarking radiotherapy plans in multi-institutional studies, clinical trials, and audits.</description>

      <title>Laser-FLASH: radiobiology at high dose, ultra-high dose-rate, single pulse laser-driven proton source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Laser-driven proton sources have long been developed with an eye on their potential for medical application to radiation therapy. These sources are compact, versatile, and show peculiar characteristics such as extreme instantaneous dose rates, short duration and broad energy spectrum. Typical temporal modality of laser-driven irradiation, the so-called fast-fractionation, results from the composition of multiple, temporally separated, ultra-short dose fractions. In this paper we present the use of a high-energy laser system for delivering the target dose in a single nanosecond pulse, for ultra-fast irradiation of biological samples. A transport line composed by two permanent magnet quadrupoles and a scattering system is used to improve the dose profile and to control the delivered dose-per-pulse. A single-shot dosimetry protocol for the broad-spectrum proton source using Monte Carlo simulations was developed. Doses as high as 20Gy could be delivered in a single shot, lasting less than 10ns over a 1.0cm diameter sample holder, at a dose-rate exceeding 10^9 Gy/s. Exploratory application of extreme laser-driven irradiation conditions, falling within the FLASH irradiation protocol, are presented for in vitro and in vivo irradiation. A reduction of radiation-induced oxidative stress in-vitro and radiation-induced developmental damage in vivo were observed, whereas anti-tumoral efficacy was confirmed by cell survival assay.</description>

The generalizability of the framework is evaluated using aortic and cerebrovascular 4D flow MRI acquisitions acquired on systems from two different vendors for various undersampling factors (R=8,16,24) and compared to state-of-the-art compressed sensing (CS-LLR) and deep learning-based (FlowVN) reconstructions. Evaluation includes quantitative analysis of image magnitudes, velocity magnitudes, and peak velocity curves. FlowMRINet outperforms CS-LLR and FlowVN for aortic 4D flow MRI reconstruction, resulting in vectorial normalized root mean square errors of $0.239\pm0.055$, $0.308\pm0.066$, and $0.302\pm0.085$ and mean directional errors of $0.023\pm0.015$, $0.036\pm0.018$, and $0.039\pm0.025$ for velocities in the thoracic aorta for R=16, respectively. Furthermore, FlowMRI-Net outperforms CS-LLR for cerebrovascular 4D flow MRI reconstruction, where no FlowVN can be trained due to the lack of a highquality reference, resulting in a consistent increase in SNR of around 6 dB and more accurate peak velocity curves for R=8,16,24. Reconstruction times ranged from 1 to 7 minutes on commodity CPU/GPU hardware. FlowMRI-Net enables fast and accurate quantification of aortic and cerebrovascular flow dynamics, with possible applications to other vascular territories. This will improve clinical adaptation of 4D flow MRI and hence may aid in the diagnosis and therapeutic management of cardiovascular diseases.</description>
