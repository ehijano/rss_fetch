      <title>Modelling variability of the immunity build-up and waning following RNA-based vaccination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RNA-based vaccination has been broadly applied in the COVID pandemic. A characteristic of the immunization was fast waning immunity. However, the time scale of this process varied considerable for virus subtypes and among individuals. Understanding the origin of this variability is crucial in order to improve future vaccination strategies. Here, we introduce a mathematical model of RNA-based vaccination and the kinetics of the induced immune response. In the model, antigens produced following vaccination rise an immune response leading to germinal center reactions and accordingly B-cell differentiation into memory B-cells and plasma cells. In a negative feedback loop, the antibodies synthesized by newly specified plasma cells shut down the germinal center reaction as well as antigen-induced differentiation of memory B-cell into plasma cells. This limits the build-up of long-lasting immunity and thus is accompanied by fast waning immunity. The detailed data available on infection with and vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 enabled computational simulation of essential processes of the immune response. By simulation, we analyzed to which extent a single or double dose vaccination provides protection against infection. We find that variability of the immune response in individuals, originating e.g. in different immune cell densities, results in a broad log-normal-like distribution of the vaccine-induced protection times that peaks around 100 days. Protection times decrease for virus variants with mutated antibody binding sites or increased replication rates. Independent of these virus specifics, our simulations suggest optimal timing of a second dose about 5 weeks after the first in agreement with clinical trials.</description>

      <title>Making mathematical online resources FAIR: at the example of small phylogenetic trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10823v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on the process of taking an early 2000's mathematical library, the Small Phylogenetic Trees, and transforming it into a FAIR, modern, and sustainable repository for data from algebraic phylogenetics. This process is based on a three-fold strategy: (1) writing a software package which enables the user to reproduce results of the database; (2) setting up a user-friendly new website with cross links to theoretical publications, code snippets, and serialized output of computations; and (3) all-the-while documenting the steps we take in order to derive lessons learned which may be generalised to other such projects. This paper addresses (3). (1) is found in https://docs.oscar-system.org/dev/Experimental/AlgebraicStatistics/phylogenetics, and (2) is located at https://algebraicphylogenetics.org.</description>
