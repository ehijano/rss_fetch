      <title>Sculpting of Martian brain terrain reveals the drying of ancient Mars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Martian brain terrain (MBT), characterized by its unique brain-like morphology, is a potential geological archive for finding hints of paleoclimatic conditions during its formation period. The morphological similarity of MBT to self-organized patterned ground on Earth suggests a shared formation mechanism. However, the lack of quantitative descriptions and robust physical modeling of self-organized stone transport jointly limits the study of the thermal and aqueous conditions governing MBT's formation. Here we established a specialized quantitative system for extracting the morphological features of MBT, taking a typical region located in the northern Arabia Terra as an example, and then employed a numerical model to investigate its formation mechanisms. Our simulation results accurately replicate the observed morphology of MBT, matching its key geometric metrics with deviations $&lt;10\%$. Crucially, however, we find that the self-organized transport can solely produce relief $&lt;0.5$ m, insufficient to explain the formation of MBT with average relief of $3.29 \pm 0.65$ m. We attribute this discrepancy to sculpting driven by late-stage sublimation, constraining cumulative subsurface ice loss in this region to $\sim 3$ meters over the past $\sim 3$ Ma. These findings demonstrate that MBT's formation is a multi-stage process: initial patterning driven by freeze-thaw cycles (implying liquid water) followed by vertical sculpting via sublimation (requiring a dry environment). This evolution provides physical evidence for the transition of the ancient Martian climate from a wetter period to a colder hyper-arid state.</description>

      <title>Forward and Inverse Mantle Convection with Neural Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal state reconstruction -- reversing convection to recover the thermal structure of the mantle at an earlier geologic time -- is an important tool to understand the evolution of mantle convection and its relation to seismic tomographic images and observations at the surface. Thermal state reconstructions are computationally expensive. Here we transformed the basic computational element, numerical solvers, into neural operators, a class of machine learning models for learning mappings between function spaces. Focusing on a specific architecture, Fourier Neural Operators, we demonstrate that they can represent not only a surrogate model like the Stokes system of equations using a purely physics informed approach, but also discover operators without explicit mathematical formulations or even ill-posedness from data, including the direct mapping between two convecting thermal states separated by a long time interval much larger than the Courant Fredrich Lewy condition and its reversal. These neural operators significantly accelerate forward and inverse convection modeling by transforming forward physical processes into surrogate models with lower complexity while utilizing auto-differentiation to calculate gradients. With this framework, we demonstrate the strength and weaknesses of four methods for thermal state reconstructions: Reverse buoyancy, reverse convection operator, an inversion with only the terminal thermal state, and a joint inversion with the terminal thermal state and surface velocity evolution. The reverse convection operator is shown to perform poorly in the presence of observational noise, but the joint inversion overcomes this limitation. The joint technique could probably become a solution to large-scale thermal state inversion problems using seismic tomography and plate tectonic reconstructions.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Analytical Heat Transfer Model for Enhanced Geothermal Systems: Capturing Fracture Interactions and Correcting Classical Optimistic Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical analytical heat transfer models play a critical role in geothermal design and feasibility studies. Classical solutions, such as those proposed by Gringarten et al. 1975, rely on simplified assumptions and systematically overestimate thermal performance, which can lead to unrealistic engineering decisions.
  This study presents a generalized analytical model for enhanced geothermal systems that explicitly captures thermal interactions between fractures while preserving analytical tractability.
  The formulation is based on Green\'s functions and reproduces realistic thermal behavior under conditions representative of fractured geothermal reservoirs. The resulting solution is computationally efficient and sufficiently simple to be implemented directly in standard spreadsheets, without requiring Laplace space transformations or numerical inversion algorithms.
  The model is validated against numerical simulations performed using CMG STARS and Volsung software, showing close agreement in temperature evolution, including the effects of interacting fractures. Compared with classical analytical approaches, the proposed model corrects optimistic bias and provides more reliable predictions of production temperature and energy recovery.
  These results have direct implications for geothermal feasibility studies, well design, and power forecasting, effectively bridging the gap between legacy analytical models and numerical or commercial engineering tools. Building on the analytical framework originally introduced by Gringarten et al. 1975, the proposed formulation generalizes classical heat transfer solutions to account for fracture interaction while retaining analytical simplicity and practical applicability.</description>

      <title>Self-Arresting and Runaway Earthquakes:Nucleation, Propagation, Gutenberg-Richter law and Dragon-King Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a dissipation-based framework for earthquake rupture on homogeneous faults that explicitly separates the onset of unstable slip from the conditions required for self-sustained rupture propagation. This distinction explains the coexistence of self-arresting earthquakes and run-away ruptures (subshear and supershear events) observed in numerical simulations and empirical studies. We identify two distinct characteristic fault sizes: a nucleation radius controlling the instability of slip, and in general a larger propagation radius controlling whether an unstable rupture can be energetically sustained. Ruptures initiated above the nucleation scale but below the propagation scale spontaneously arrest. We further derive the Gutenberg-Richter law for self-arresting earthquakes by linking rupture physics to the fractal geometry of faulting. Finally, we interpret run-away ruptures as extreme events generated by an amplifying mechanism, consistent with the dragon-king concept. These results provide a unified physical basis for earthquake initiation, arrest, and seismicity statistics.</description>

      <title>SPIDER: Scalable Probabilistic Inference for Differential Earthquake Relocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Seismicity catalogs are larger than ever due to an explosion of techniques for enhanced earthquake detection and an abundance of high-quality datasets. Bayesian inference is an appealing framework for locating earthquakes due to its ability to propagate and quantify uncertainty into the inversion results, but traditional methods do not scale well to high-dimensional parameter spaces, making them unsuitable for double-difference relocation where the number of parameters can reach the millions. Here we introduce SPIDER, a scalable Bayesian inference framework for double-difference hypocenter relocation. SPIDER uses a physics-informed neural network Eikonal solver together with a highly efficient sampler called Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics to generate posterior samples jointly for entire seismicity catalogs. We show that traditional double-difference relocation formulations neglect residual correlation between observations with common events, which biases uncertainty estimates. Our formulation is designed to whiten this residual correlation, and is readily parallelized over multiple GPUs for enhanced computational efficiency. We demonstrate the capabilities of SPIDER on a rigorous synthetic seismicity catalog and three real data catalogs from California and Japan. We introduce several ways to analyze high-dimensional posterior distributions to aid in scientific interpretation and evaluation.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of spherical dynamos exhibiting a small-scale MAC balance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21348v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the asymptotic behaviour of numerical dynamo models is critical for extrapolating results to the physical conditions that characterise terrestrial planetary cores. Here we investigate the behaviour of convection-driven dynamos reaching a MAC (magnetic-Archimedes-Coriolis) balance on the convective length scale and compare the results with non-magnetic convection cases. In particular, the dependence of physical quantities on the Ekman number, $Ek$, is studied in detail. The scaling of velocity dependent quantities is observed to be independent of the force balance and in agreement with quasi-geostrophic theory. The primary difference between dynamo and non-magnetic cases is that the fluctuating temperature is order unity in the former such that the buoyancy force scales with the Coriolis force. The MAC state yields a scaling for the flow speeds that is identical to the so-called CIA (Coriolis-inertia-Archimedes) scaling. There is an $O(Ek^{1/3})$ length scale present within the velocity field irrespective of the leading order force balance. This length scale is consistent with the asymptotic scaling of the terms of the governing equations and is not an indication that viscosity plays a dominant role. The peak of the kinetic energy spectrum and the ohmic dissipation length scale both exhibit an Ekman number dependence of approximately $Ek^{1/6}$, which is consistent with a scaling of $Rm^{-1/2}$, where $Rm$ is the magnetic Reynolds number. For the dynamos, advection remains comparable to, and scales similarly with, both inertia and viscosity, implying that nonlinear convective Rossby waves play an important role in the dynamics even in a MAC regime.</description>

      <title>Instability of the halocline at the North Pole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we address the issue of stability for the near-inertial Pollard waves, as a model for the halocline in the region of the Arctic Ocean centered around the North Pole, derived in Puntini (2025a). Adopting the short-wavelength instability approach, the stability of such flows reduces to study the stability of a system of ODEs along fluid trajectories, leading to the result that, when the steepness of the near-inertial Pollard waves exceeds a specific threshold, those waves are linearly unstable. The explicit dispersion relation of the model allows to easily compute such threshold, knowing the physical properties of the water column.</description>
