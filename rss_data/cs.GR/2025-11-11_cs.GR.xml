      <title>Modeling and Topology Estimation of Low Rank Dynamical Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional topology learning methods for dynamical networks become inapplicable to processes exhibiting low-rank characteristics. To address this, we propose the low rank dynamical network model which ensures identifiability. By employing causal Wiener filtering, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition that links the sparsity pattern of the filter to conditional Granger causality. Building on this theoretical result, we develop a consistent method for estimating all network edges. Simulation results demonstrate the parsimony of the proposed framework and consistency of the topology estimation approach.</description>

      <title>A computational framework for evaluating an edge-integrated, multi-ramp construction model of the Great Pyramid of Giza</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite decades of study, a quantitative, integrated framework to evaluate minutescale throughput, geometric control, and a zero external footprint for Khufu's pyramid has been lacking. We test the Integrated Edge-Ramp (IER) model-a helical path formed by omitting and backfilling perimeter courses-using a unified, end-to-end pipeline coupling parametric geometry, discrete-event logistics, and staged finite-element analysis (FEA). An adaptive multiramp strategy can sustain 4-6-minute dispatches and yields a median on-site duration of 13.8-20.6 years (95% CI); including quarrying, river transport, and seasonal pauses gives 20-27 years. FEA indicates that stresses and settlements remain within plausible limits for Old Kingdom limestone under self-weight. The model's geometry is also consistent with internal voids identified by muon imaging (a hypothesis-generating result). The IER helps reconcile throughput, survey access, and zero-footprint closure, and produces falsifiable predictions (edge-fill signatures, corner wear). Our study provides a transferable, open-data/code framework for testing construction hypotheses for ancient megastructures.</description>

      <title>Robust and High-Fidelity 3D Gaussian Splatting: Fusing Pose Priors and Geometry Constraints for Texture-Deficient Outdoor Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a key rendering pipeline for digital asset creation due to its balance between efficiency and visual quality. To address the issues of unstable pose estimation and scene representation distortion caused by geometric texture inconsistency in large outdoor scenes with weak or repetitive textures, we approach the problem from two aspects: pose estimation and scene representation. For pose estimation, we leverage LiDAR-IMU Odometry to provide prior poses for cameras in large-scale environments. These prior pose constraints are incorporated into COLMAP's triangulation process, with pose optimization performed via bundle adjustment. Ensuring consistency between pixel data association and prior poses helps maintain both robustness and accuracy. For scene representation, we introduce normal vector constraints and effective rank regularization to enforce consistency in the direction and shape of Gaussian primitives. These constraints are jointly optimized with the existing photometric loss to enhance the map quality. We evaluate our approach using both public and self-collected datasets. In terms of pose optimization, our method requires only one-third of the time while maintaining accuracy and robustness across both datasets. In terms of scene representation, the results show that our method significantly outperforms conventional 3DGS pipelines. Notably, on self-collected datasets characterized by weak or repetitive textures, our approach demonstrates enhanced visualization capabilities and achieves superior overall performance. Codes and data will be publicly available at https://github.com/justinyeah/normal_shape.git.</description>

      <title>Geometric implicit neural representations for signed distance functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: \textit{Implicit neural representations} (INRs) have emerged as a promising framework for representing signals in low-dimensional spaces. This survey reviews the existing literature on the specialized INR problem of approximating \textit{signed distance functions} (SDFs) for surface scenes, using either oriented point clouds or a set of posed images. We refer to neural SDFs that incorporate differential geometry tools, such as normals and curvatures, in their loss functions as \textit{geometric} INRs. The key idea behind this 3D reconstruction approach is to include additional \textit{regularization} terms in the loss function, ensuring that the INR satisfies certain global properties that the function should hold -- such as having unit gradient in the case of SDFs. We explore key methodological components, including the definition of INR, the construction of geometric loss functions, and sampling schemes from a differential geometry perspective. Our review highlights the significant advancements enabled by geometric INRs in surface reconstruction from oriented point clouds and posed images.</description>

      <title>Lightning Grasp: High Performance Procedural Grasp Synthesis with Contact Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite years of research, real-time diverse grasp synthesis for dexterous hands remains an unsolved core challenge in robotics and computer graphics. We present Lightning Grasp, a novel high-performance procedural grasp synthesis algorithm that achieves orders-of-magnitude speedups over state-of-the-art approaches, while enabling unsupervised grasp generation for irregular, tool-like objects. The method avoids many limitations of prior approaches, such as the need for carefully tuned energy functions and sensitive initialization. This breakthrough is driven by a key insight: decoupling complex geometric computation from the search process via a simple, efficient data structure - the Contact Field. This abstraction collapses the problem complexity, enabling a procedural search at unprecedented speeds. We open-source our system to propel further innovation in robotic manipulation.</description>

      <title>M^3ashy: Multi-Modal Material Synthesis via Hyperdiffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-quality material synthesis is essential for replicating complex surface properties to create realistic scenes. Despite advances in the generation of material appearance based on analytic models, the synthesis of real-world measured BRDFs remains largely unexplored. To address this challenge, we propose M^3ashy, a novel multi-modal material synthesis framework based on hyperdiffusion. M^3ashy enables high-quality reconstruction of complex real-world materials by leveraging neural fields as a compact continuous representation of BRDFs. Furthermore, our multi-modal conditional hyperdiffusion model allows for flexible material synthesis conditioned on material type, natural language descriptions, or reference images, providing greater user control over material generation. To support future research, we contribute two new material datasets and introduce two BRDF distributional metrics for more rigorous evaluation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Mashy through extensive experiments, including a novel statistics-based constrained synthesis, which enables the generation of materials of desired categories.</description>

      <title>Distilling Diversity and Control in Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10637v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distilled diffusion models generate images in far fewer timesteps but suffer from reduced sample diversity when generating multiple outputs from the same prompt. To understand this phenomenon, we first investigate whether distillation damages concept representations by examining if the required diversity is properly learned. Surprisingly, distilled models retain the base model's representational structure: control mechanisms like Concept Sliders and LoRAs transfer seamlessly without retraining, and SliderSpace analysis reveals distilled models possess variational directions needed for diversity yet fail to activate them. This redirects our investigation to understanding how the generation dynamics differ between base and distilled models. Using $\hat{\mathbf{x}}_{0}$ trajectory visualization, we discover distilled models commit to their final image structure almost immediately at the first timestep, while base models distribute structural decisions across many steps. To test whether this first-step commitment causes the diversity loss, we introduce diversity distillation, a hybrid approach using the base model for only the first critical timestep before switching to the distilled model. This single intervention restores sample diversity while maintaining computational efficiency. We provide both causal validation and theoretical support showing why the very first timestep concentrates the diversity bottleneck in distilled models.

      <title>ACT-R: Adaptive Camera Trajectories for Single View 3D Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08239v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the simple idea of adaptive view planning to multi-view synthesis, aiming to improve both occlusion revelation and 3D consistency for single-view 3D reconstruction. Instead of producing an unordered set of views independently or simultaneously, we generate a sequence of views, leveraging temporal consistency to enhance 3D coherence. More importantly, our view sequence is not determined by a pre-determined and fixed camera setup. Instead, we compute an adaptive camera trajectory (ACT), forming an orbit, which seeks to maximize the visibility of occluded regions of the 3D object to be reconstructed. Once the best orbit is found, we feed it to a video diffusion model to generate novel views around the orbit, which can then be passed to any multi-view 3D reconstruction model to obtain the final result. Our multi-view synthesis pipeline is quite efficient since it involves no run-time training/optimization, only forward inferences by applying pre-trained models for occlusion analysis and multi-view synthesis. Our method predicts camera trajectories that reveal occlusions effectively and produce consistent novel views, significantly improving 3D reconstruction over SOTA alternatives on the unseen GSO dataset.

      <title>SIG-Chat: Spatial Intent-Guided Conversational Gesture Generation Involving How, When and Where</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23852v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accompanying actions and gestures in dialogue are often closely linked to interactions with the environment, such as looking toward the interlocutor or using gestures to point to the described target at appropriate moments. Speech and semantics guide the production of gestures by determining their timing (WHEN) and style (HOW), while the spatial locations of interactive objects dictate their directional execution (WHERE). Existing approaches either rely solely on descriptive language to generate motions or utilize audio to produce non-interactive gestures, thereby lacking the characterization of interactive timing and spatial intent. This significantly limits the applicability of conversational gesture generation, whether in robotics or in the fields of game and animation production. To address this gap, we present a full-stack solution. We first established a unique data collection method to simultaneously capture high-precision human motion and spatial intent. We then developed a generation model driven by audio, language, and spatial data, alongside dedicated metrics for evaluating interaction timing and spatial accuracy. Finally, we deployed the solution on a humanoid robot, enabling rich, context-aware physical interactions.</description>

      <title>MACS: Multi-source Audio-to-image Generation with Contextual Significance and Semantic Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Propelled by the breakthrough in deep generative models, audio-to-image generation has emerged as a pivotal cross-modal task that converts complex auditory signals into rich visual representations. However, previous works only focus on single-source audio inputs for image generation, ignoring the multi-source characteristic in natural auditory scenes, thus limiting the performance in generating comprehensive visual content. To bridge this gap, we propose a method called MACS to conduct multi-source audio-to-image generation. To our best knowledge, this is the first work that explicitly separates multi-source audio to capture the rich audio components before image generation. MACS is a two-stage method. In the first stage, multi-source audio inputs are separated by a weakly supervised method, where the audio and text labels are semantically aligned by casting into a common space using the large pre-trained CLAP model. We introduce a ranking loss to consider the contextual significance of the separated audio signals. In the second stage, effective image generation is achieved by mapping the separated audio signals to the generation condition using only a trainable adapter and a MLP layer. We preprocess the LLP dataset as the first full multi-source audio-to-image generation benchmark. The experiments are conducted on multi-source, mixed-source, and single-source audio-to-image generation tasks. The proposed MACS outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods in 17 out of the 21 evaluation indexes on all tasks and delivers superior visual quality.</description>

      <title>GauSSmart: Enhanced 3D Reconstruction through 2D Foundation Models and Geometric Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14270v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scene reconstruction has emerged as a central challenge in computer vision, with approaches such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting achieving remarkable progress. While Gaussian Splatting demonstrates strong performance on large-scale datasets, it often struggles to capture fine details or maintain realism in regions with sparse coverage, largely due to the inherent limitations of sparse 3D training data.
  In this work, we propose GauSSmart, a hybrid method that effectively bridges 2D foundational models and 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction. Our approach integrates established 2D computer vision techniques, including convex filtering and semantic feature supervision from foundational models such as DINO, to enhance Gaussian-based scene reconstruction. By leveraging 2D segmentation priors and high-dimensional feature embeddings, our method guides the densification and refinement of Gaussian splats, improving coverage in underrepresented areas and preserving intricate structural details.
  We validate our approach across three datasets, where GauSSmart consistently outperforms existing Gaussian Splatting in the majority of evaluated scenes. Our results demonstrate the significant potential of hybrid 2D-3D approaches, highlighting how the thoughtful combination of 2D foundational models with 3D reconstruction pipelines can overcome the limitations inherent in either approach alone.</description>
