      <title>A thermodynamically consistent free-energy lattice Boltzmann model: Incorporating generalized equilibria derived from the color-gradient approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the chemical-potential-based free-energy lattice Boltzmann (LB) model of Li et al. [Phys. Rev. E 103, 013304 (2021)] by integrating generalized equilibria, originally formulated for the color-gradient LB model using sixth-order Hermite polynomials [Saito et al., Phys Rev E 108, 065305 (2023)], into a thermodynamically consistent framework. Our model is formulated on a three-dimensional D3Q27 lattice with a central-moment collision scheme, simplifying implementation and improving Galilean invariance. Numerical tests, including flat-interface equilibrium, stationary and moving droplets in free space, and wetting on solid surfaces, confirm the model's capability to accurately simulate multiphase phenomena while maintaining strict thermodynamic consistency.</description>

      <title>Ordering transition of the three-dimensional four-state random-field Potts model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin systems exposed to the influence of random magnetic fields are paradigmatic examples for studying the effect of quenched disorder on condensed-matter systems. In this context, previous studies have almost exclusively focused on systems with Ising or continuous symmetries, while the Potts symmetry, albeit being of fundamental importance also for the description of realistic physical systems, has received very little attention. In the present study, we use a recently developed quasi-exact method for determining ground states in the random-field Potts model to study the problem with four states. Extending the protocol applied for the three-state model, we use extensive finite-size scaling analyses of the magnetization, Binder parameter, energy cumulant, specific heat, and the connected as well as disconnected susceptibilities to study the magnetic ordering transition of the model. In contrast to the system in the absence of disorder, we find compelling evidence for a continuous transition, and we precisely determine the critical point as well as the critical exponents, which are found to differ from the exponents of the three-state system as well as from those of the random-field Ising model.</description>

      <title>Minimal thermodynamic cost of computing with circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All digital devices have components that implement Boolean functions, mapping that component's input to its output. However, any fixed Boolean function can be implemented by an infinite number of circuits, all of which vary in their resource costs. This has given rise to the field of circuit complexity theory, which studies the minimal resource cost to implement a given Boolean function with any circuit. Traditionally, circuit complexity theory has focused on the resource costs of a circuit's size (its number of gates) and depth (the longest path length from the circuit's input to its output). In this paper, we extend circuit complexity theory by investigating the minimal thermodynamic cost of a circuit's operation. We do this by using the mismatch cost of a given circuit that is run multiple times in a row to calculate a lower bound on the entropy production incurred in each such run of the circuit. Specifically, we derive conditions for mismatch cost to be proportional to the size of a circuit, and conditions for them to diverge. We also use our results to compare the thermodynamic costs of different circuit families implementing the same family of Boolean functions. In addition, we analyze how heterogeneity in the underlying physical processes implementing the gates in a circuit influences the minimal thermodynamic cost of the overall circuit. These and other results of ours lay the foundation for extending circuit complexity theory to include mismatch cost as a resource cost.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic analysis of the 2D narrow-capture problem for partially accessible targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we use singular perturbation theory to solve the 2D narrow capture problem for a set of partially accessible targets $\calU_k$, $k=1,\ldots,N$, in a bounded domain $\Omega\subset \R^2$. In contrast to previous models of narrow capture, we assume that when a searcher finds a target by attaching to the partially adsorbing surface $\partial \calU_k$ it does not have immediate access to the resources within the target interior. Instead, the searcher remains attached to the surface for a random waiting time $\tau$, after which it either gains access to the resources within ({\em surface absorption}) or detaches and continues its search process ({\em surface desorption)}. We also consider two distinct desorption scenarios -- either the particle continues its search from the point of desorption or rapidly returns to its initial search position. We formulate the narrow capture problem in terms of a set of renewal equations that relate the probability density and target flux densities for absorption to the corresponding quantities for irreversible adsorption. The renewal equations, which effectively sew together successive rounds of adsorption and desorption prior to the final absorption event, provide a general probabilistic framework for incorporating non-Markovian models of desorption/absorption and different search scenarios following desorption. We solve the general renewal equations in two stages. First, we calculate the Laplace transformed target fluxes for irreversible adsorption by solving a Robbin boundary value problem (BVP) in the small-target limit using matched asymptotic analysis. We then use the inner solution of the BVP to solve the corresponding Laplace transformed renewal equations for non-Markovian desorption/absorption, which leads to explicit Neumann series expansions of the corresponding target fluxes.</description>

      <title>Fixed Points and Universality Classes in Coupled Kardar-Parisi-Zhang Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studied are coupled KPZ equations with three control parameters $X,Y,T$. These equations are used in the context of stretched polymers in a random medium, for the spacetime spin-spin correlator of the isotropic quantum Heisenberg chain, and for exciton-polariton condensates. In an earlier article we investigated merely the diagonal $X=Y$, $T=1$. Then the stationary measure is delta-correlated Gaussian and the dynamical exponent equals $z = \tfrac{3}{2}$. We observed that the scaling functions of the dynamic correlator change smoothly when varying $X$. In this contribution, the analysis is extended to the whole $X$-$Y$-$T$ plane. Solutions are stable only if $XY \geq 0$. Based on numerical simulations, the static correlator still has rapid decay. We argue that the parameter space is foliated into distinct universality classes. They are labeled by $X$ and consist of half-planes parallel to the $Y$-$T$ plane containing the point $(X,X,1)$.</description>

      <title>Variational autoencoders understand knot topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supervised machine learning (ML) methods are emerging as valid alternatives to standard mathematical methods for identifying knots in long, collapsed polymers. Here, we introduce a hybrid supervised/unsupervised ML approach for knot classification based on a variational autoencoder enhanced with a knot type classifier (VAEC). The neat organization of knots in its latent representation suggests that the VAEC, only based on an arbitrary labeling of three-dimensional configurations, has grasped complex topological concepts such as chirality, unknotting number, braid index, and the grouping in families such as achiral, torus, and twist knots. The understanding of topological concepts is confirmed by the ability of the VAEC to distinguish the chirality of knots $9_{42}$ and $10_{71}$ not used for its training and with a notoriously undetected chirality to standard tools. The well-organized latent space is also key for generating configurations with the decoder that reliably preserves the topology of the input ones. Our findings demonstrate the ability of a hybrid supervised-generative ML algorithm to capture different topological features of entangled filaments and to exploit this knowledge to faithfully reconstruct or produce new knotted configurations without simulations.</description>

      <title>Universality in many-body driven systems with an umbilic point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study stationary fluctuations of conserved slow modes in a two-lane model of hardcore particles which are expected to show universal behaviour. Specifically, we focus on the properties of fluctuations at a special umbilic point where the characteristic velocities coincide. At large space and time scales, fluctuations are described by a system of stochastic Burgers equations studied recently in [13]. Our data suggest coupling-dependent scaling functions and, even more surprisingly, coupling-dependent dynamical scaling exponents, distinct from KPZ scaling exponent typical for surface growth processes.</description>

      <title>Non-Equilibrium Dynamics of Hard Spheres in the Fluid, Crystalline, and Glassy Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the response of a system of hard spheres to two classes of perturbations over a range of densities spanning the fluid, crystalline, and glassy regimes within a molecular dynamics framework. Firstly, we consider the relaxation of a "thermal inhomogeneity," in which a central region of particles is given a higher temperature than its surroundings and is then allowed to evolve under Newtonian dynamics. In this case, the hot central "core" of particles expands and collides with the cold surrounding material, creating a transient radially-expanding "compression wave," which is rapidly dissipated by particle-particle collisions and interaction with periodic images at the boundary, leading to a rapid relaxation to equilibrium. Secondly, we consider a rapid compression of the spheres into a disordered glassy state at high densities. Such rapidly compressed systems exhibit very slow structural relaxation times, many orders of magnitude longer than thermalization times for simple temperature inhomogeneities. We find that thermal relaxation of the velocity distribution is determined simply by the total collision rate, whereas structural relaxation requires coordinated collective motion, which is strongly suppressed at high density, although some particle rearrangement nevertheless occurs. We further find that collisions propagate significantly faster through glassy systems than through crystalline systems at the same density, which leads to very rapid relaxation of velocity perturbations, although structural relaxation remains very slow. These results extend the validity of previous observations that glassy systems exhibit a hybrid character, sharing features with both equilibrium and non-equilibrium systems. Finally, we introduce the hard sphere causal graph, a network-based characterization of the dynamical history of a hard sphere system, which encapsulates several useful...</description>

      <title>Prethermalization in Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observation of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) paradox, namely the lack of equipartition in the evolution of a normal mode in a nonlinear chain on unexpectedly long times, is arguably the most famous numerical experiment in the history of physics. Since seventy years after its publication, most studies in FPUT chains still focus on long wavelength initial states similar to the original paper. It is shown here that all characteristic features of the FPUT paradox are rendered even more striking if short(er) wavelength modes are evolved instead. Since not every normal mode leads to equipartition, we also provide a simple technique to predict which modes, and in what order, are excited starting from an initial mode (root) in $\alpha$-FPUT chains. The excitation sequences associated with a root are then shown to spread energy at different speeds, leading to prethermalization regimes that become longer as a function of mode excitation number. This effect is visible in observables such as mode energies and spectral entropies and, surprisingly, also in the time evolution of invariant quantities such as Lyapunov times and Kolmogorov-Sinai entropies. Our findings generalize the original FPUT experiment, provide an original look at the paradox's source, and enrich the vast literature dedicated to studying equipartition in classical many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Scaling regimes in slow quenches within a gapped phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the finite-time quench dynamics in the quantum transverse field Ising model which exhibits a second order phase transition from a paramagnetic to a ferromagnetic phase, as the transverse magnetic field is decreased. These dynamics have been thoroughly investigated in previous studies when the critical point is crossed during the quench; here, we quench the system from deep in the paramagnetic phase to just above the critical field so that the system remains in the gapped phase throughout the quench duration. On linearly quenching the infinitely large system, we find that the behavior of mean longitudinal defect density and mean transverse magnetization at the end of the quench falls into three distinct scaling regimes as the quench time is increased. For sufficiently small quench times, these observables remain roughly constant, but for larger quench times, a crossover occurs from the Kibble-Zurek scaling law to the quadratic quench rate law when the Kibble-Zurek time is of the order of relaxation time at the final quench field. These results are shown analytically using power series and uniform asymptotic expansions of the exact solution of the model, and also compared with an adiabatic perturbation theory in the third regime. We find that the above mentioned scaling regimes hold for quenches within the ferromagnetic phase also, and provide a general scaling argument for crossover from the Kibble-Zurek regime to an adiabatic regime for slow quenches within a gapped phase.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic storage models based on essentially non-Gaussian noise are considered. The stochastic description of physical systems based on stochastic storage models is associated with generalized Poisson (or shot) noise, in which the jump values can be quite large. Stochastic storage models have a direct physical meaning: some elements enter the system and leave it. Storage processes fit into the general scheme of dynamic systems subject to the additive influence of a random process. The main relationships of storage models are described, and the possibilities of applying the mathematical provisions of stochastic storage processes to various physical problems are indicated. A number of examples of applying the stochastic storage model are considered.</description>

      <title>Manipulating phases in many-body interacting systems with subsystem resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stabilizing thermodynamically unstable phases in many-body systems -- such as suppressing pathological neuronal synchronization in Parkinson's disease or maintaining magnetic order across broad temperature ranges -- remains a persistent challenge. In traditional approaches, such phases are stabilized through intervening in the dynamics of all system constituents or introducing additional interactions. Here, we offer a hitherto-unexplored alternative -- subsystem resetting, whereby intervention in the dynamics of only a part of the system, and that too only occasionally in time, is implemented through resetting its state to a reset configuration. Just playing with a few parameters, e.g., the nature of the reset configuration and the size of the reset subsystem, one achieves a remarkable and robust control over the phase diagram of the bare dynamics. We demonstrate that these universal effects span a wide variety of scenarios, including equilibrium and non-equilibrium, mean-field and non-mean-field dynamics, with and without quenched disorder. Despite the challenges posed by memory effects, we obtain explicit analytical predictions, validated by simulations.</description>

      <title>Simple third order operator-splitting schemes for stochastic mechanics and field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method for constructing numerical schemes with up to 3rd strong convergence order for solution of a class of stochastic differential equations, including equations of the Langevin type. The construction proceeds in two stages. In the first stage one approximates the stochastic equation by a differential equation with smooth coefficients randomly sampled at each time step. In the second stage the resulting regular equation is solved with the conventional operator-splitting techniques. This separation renders the approach flexible, allowing one to freely combine the numerical techniques most suitable to the problem at hand. The approach applies to ordinary and partial stochastic differential equations. In the latter case, it naturally gives rise to pseudo-spectral algorithms. We numerically test the strong convergence of several schemes obtained with this method in mechanical examples. Application to partial differential equations is illustrated by real-time simulations of a scalar field with quartic self-interaction coupled to a heat bath. The simulations accurately reproduce the thermodynamic properties of the field and are used to explore dynamics of thermal false vacuum decay in the case of negative quartic coupling.</description>

      <title>How does the entanglement entropy of a many-body quantum system change after a single measurement?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For one-dimensional free Dirac fermions, we compute numerically the probability distribution of the change in the entanglement entropy (EE), after the saturation time, resulting from a single measurement of the occupation number by using different measurement protocols. For the quantum jump and the projective measurement protocols, we observe clear deviations from Gaussianity characterized by broader and asymmetric tails, exponential for positive values of the change, and a peak at zero that increases with the system size and the monitoring strength supporting that in all cases the EE is in the area law phase. Another distinct feature of the distribution is its spatial inhomogeneity. In the weak monitoring limit, the distribution is close to Gaussian with a broad support for boundary point separating the two subsystems defining the EE while for the rest of sites has asymmetric exponential tails and a much narrower support. For a quantum state diffusion protocol, the distribution is Gaussian for weak monitoring. As the monitoring strength increases, it gradually develops symmetric exponential tails. In the strong monitoring limit, the tails are still exponential but the core turns from Gaussian to strongly peaked at zero suggesting the dominance of quantum Zeno effect. For all monitoring strengths, the distribution is size independent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the spin-1/2 Heisenberg model with competing ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions on diamond-decorated lattices. Tuning the exchange interactions to the boundary of the ferromagnetic phase, we analyze the models with two types of diamond units: distorted and ideal diamonds. In the distorted diamond model, flat bands in the magnon spectra indicate the localized states confined to small regions (`trapping cells') of the lattice. Remarkably, these trapping cells can host up to five and seven localized states for square and cubic lattices, respectively, leading to the macroscopic ground state degeneracy and high value of residual entropy. The problem of calculating ground state degeneracy reduces to that of non-interacting spins, whose spin value equal to half the number of localized magnons in the trapping cell. In contrast, ideal diamond models feature ground states composed of randomly distributed isolated diamond diagonal singlets immersed in a ferromagnetic background. Counting the ground state degeneracies here maps onto the percolation problem in 2D and 3D lattices. Our analysis shows that ideal diamond models possess even greater ground state degeneracy than their distorted counterparts. These findings suggest that synthesizing diamond-decorated-type compounds holds great promise for low-temperature cooling applications.</description>

      <title>Maximum entropy for dynamic processes on networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic processes on networks are fundamental to understand modern day phenomena such as information diffusion and opinion polarization on the internet or epidemic spreading. However, they are notoriously difficult to study broadly as small changes in initial conditions, the process or the network can lead to very different evolution trajectories. Here we apply the information-theoretic framework of maximum caliber to study the statistics of such systems analytically in a general way. We verify the dynamics deduced from maximum caliber by using simulations of different processes on different networks, introduce an approximation of the dynamics which significantly simplifies the problem and show that the approximation can be used to recover well-established models of population dynamics that are typically not thought of as taking place on a network. This provides a theoretical tool that allows to study dynamic processes on networks broadly without loosing sight of known results.</description>

      <title>Beyond catastrophic forgetting in associative networks with self-interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin-glass models of associative memories are a cornerstone between statistical physics and theoretical neuroscience. In these networks, stochastic spin-like units interact through a synaptic matrix shaped by local Hebbian learning. In absence of self-interactions (i.e., autapses), the free energy reveals catastrophic forgetting of all stored patterns when their number exceeds a critical memory load. Here, we bridge the gap with biology by considering networks of deterministic, graded units coupled via the same Amari-Hopfield synaptic matrix, while retaining autapses. Contrary to the assumption that self-couplings play a negligible role, we demonstrate that they qualitatively reshape the energy landscape, confining the recurrent dynamics to the subspace hosting the stored patterns. This allows for the derivation of an exact overlap-dependent Lyapunov function, valid even for networks with finite size. Moreover, self-interactions generate an auxiliary internal field aligned with the target memory pattern, widening the repertoire of accessible attractor states. Consequently, pure recall states act as robust associative memories for any memory load, beyond the critical threshold for catastrophic forgetting observed in spin-glass models -- all without requiring nonlocal learning prescriptions or significant reshaping of the Hebbian synaptic matrix.</description>

      <title>Self-alignment and anti-self-alignment suppress motility-induced phase separation in active systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the impact of self-alignment and anti-self-alignment on collective phenomena in dense active matter. These mechanisms correspond to effective torques that align or anti-align a particles orientation with its velocity, as observed in active granular systems. In the context of motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) - a non-equilibrium coexistence between a dense clustered phase and a dilute homogeneous phase - both self- and anti-self-alignment are found to suppress clustering. Specifically, increasing self-alignment strength first leads to flocking within the dense cluster, and eventually to the emergence of a homogeneous flocking phase. In contrast, anti-self-alignment induces a freezing phenomenon, progressively reducing particle speed until MIPS is suppressed and a homogeneous phase is recovered. These results are supported by scaling arguments and are amenable to experimental verification in high-density active granular systems exhibiting self- or anti-self-alignment.</description>

      <title>Unified speed limits in classical and quantum dynamics via temporal Fisher information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The importance of Fisher information is increasing in nonequilibrium thermodynamics, as it has played a fundamental role in trade-off relations such as thermodynamic uncertainty relations and speed limits. In this work, we investigate temporal Fisher information, which measures the temporal information content encoded in probability distributions, for both classical and quantum systems. We establish that temporal Fisher information is bounded from above by physical costs, such as entropy production in classical Langevin and Markov processes, and the variance of interaction Hamiltonians in open quantum systems. Conversely, temporal Fisher information is bounded from below by statistical distances (e.g., the Bhattacharyya arccos distance), leading to classical and quantum speed limits that constrain the minimal time required for state transformations. Our work provides a unified perspective of speed limits from the point of view of temporal Fisher information in both classical and quantum dynamics.</description>

Abstract: A system of exclusive fermions occurs when two fermions of opposite spin are prohibited from occupying the same quantum level. We derive the distribution of exclusive fermions via the employment of the grand canonical ensemble. Salient features of its statistical properties, compared to the free electron gases, include: larger Fermi energy, higher degeneracy pressure, but the same Pauli paramagnetism and Landau diamagnetism. In particular, higher degeneracy pressure leads to an inflation of the Chandrasekhar limit to 1.6 times when applied to white dwarf stars and neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Combining kinetic and thermodynamic uncertainty relations in quantum transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the fluctuations of generic currents in multi-terminal, multi-channel quantum transport settings. In the quantum regime, these fluctuations and the resulting precision differ strongly depending on whether the device is of fermionic or bosonic nature. Using scattering theory, we show that the precision is bounded by constraints set by the entropy production and by the activity in the spirit of thermodynamic or kinetic uncertainty relations, valid for fermionic and bosonic quantum systems and even in the absence of time-reversal symmetry. Furthermore, we derive a combined thermodynamic kinetic uncertainty relation, which is tight over a wide range of parameters and can hence predict the reachable precision of a device.
  Since these constraints can be expressed in terms of observables accessible in transport measurements, such as currents and bandwidth, we foresee that the tight thermodynamic kinetic uncertainty-like bounds are also useful as an inference tool: they can be exploited to estimate entropy production from transport observables, such as the charge current and its noise, which are more easily accessible in experiment.</description>

      <title>Topological transition between gapless phases in quantum walks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological gapless phases of matter have been a recent interest among theoretical and experimental condensed matter physicists. Fermionic chains with extended nearest neighbor couplings have been observed to show unique topological transition at the multicritical points between distinct gapless phases. In this work, we show that such topological gapless phases and the transition between them can be simulated in a quantum walk. We consider a three-step discrete-time quantum walk and identify various critical or gapless phases and multicriticalities from the topological phase diagram along with their distinguished energy dispersions. We reconstruct the scaling theory based on the curvature function to study transition between gapless phases in the quantum walk. We show the interesting features observed in fermionic chains, such as diverging, sign flipping and swapping properties of curvature function, can be simulated in the quantum walk. Moreover, the renormalization group flow and Wannier state correlation functions also identify transition at the multicritical points between gapless phases. We observe the scaling law and overlapping of critical and fixed point properties at the multicritical points of the fermionic chains can also be observed in the quantum walk. Furthermore, we categorize the topological transitions at various multicritical points using the group velocity of the energy eigenstates. Finally, the topological characters of various gapless phases are captured using winding number which allows one to distinguish various gapless phases and also show the transitions at the multicritical points.</description>

      <title>Group-Level Imitation May Stabilize Cooperation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stabilizing cooperation among self-interested individuals presents a fundamental challenge in evolutionary theory and social science. While classical models predict the dominance of defection in social dilemmas, empirical and theoretical studies have identified various mechanisms that promote cooperation, including kin selection, reciprocity, and spatial structure. In this work, we investigate the role of localized imitation in the evolutionary dynamics of cooperation within an optional Public Goods Game (PGG). We introduce a model where individuals belong to distinct groups and adapt their strategies based solely on comparisons within their own group. We identify different dynamical regimes, including stable fixed points, limit cycles, and Rock-Scissors-Paper-type oscillations. Our analysis, grounded in a replicator-type framework, reveals that such group-level imitation can stabilize cooperative behavior, provided that groups are not initially polarized around a single strategy. In other words, restricting imitation to group-level interactions mitigates the destabilizing effects of global competition, providing a potential explanation for the resilience of cooperation in structured populations.</description>

      <title>Topological links and knots of speckled light mediated by coherence singularities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Links and knots are exotic topological structures that have garnered significant interest across multiple branches of natural sciences. Coherent links and knots, such as those constructed by phase or polarization singularities of coherent light, have been observed in various three-dimensional optical settings. However, incoherent links and knots - knotted or connected lines of coherence singularities - arise from a fundamentally different concept. They are hidden in the statistic properties of a randomly fluctuating field, making their presence often elusive or undetectable. Here, we theoretically construct and experimentally demonstrate such topological entities of incoherent light. By leveraging a state-of-the-art incoherent modal-decomposition scheme, we unveil incoherent topological structures from fluctuating light speckles, including Hopf links and Trefoil knots of coherence singularities that are robust against coherence and intensity fluctuations. Our work is applicable to diverse wave systems where incoherence or practical coherence is prevalent, and may pave the way for design and implementation of statistically-shaped topological structures for various applications such as high-dimensional optical information encoding and optical communications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Martensites subjected to quasistatic deformation are known to exhibit power law distributed acoustic emission in a broad range of scales. However, the origin of the observed scaling behavior and the mechanism of self organization towards criticality remains obscure. Here we argue that the power law structure of the fluctuations spectrum can be interpreted as an effect of inertia. The general insight is that inertial dynamics can become a crucial player when the underlying mechanical system is only marginally stable. We first illustrate the possibility of inertia-induced criticality using an elementary example of mass points connected by bi-stable springs. We then explore the effects of inertia in the fully realistic two and three dimensional continuum models of specific elastic phase transitions in crystals.</description>

Abstract: We present efficient and practical protocols to measure the second R\'enyi entropy (RE), whose exponential is known as the purity. We achieve this by establishing a direct connection to a Loschmidt echo (LE) type measurement sequence, applicable to quantum many-body systems. Notably, our approach does not rely on random-noise averaging, a feature that can be extended to protocols to measure out-of-time-order correlation functions (OTOCs), as we demonstrate. By way of example, we show that our protocols can be practically implemented in superconducting qubit-based platforms, as well as in cavity-QED trapped ultra-cold gases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate non-local conserved charges in perturbed two-dimensional conformal field theories from the point of view of the 3d SymTFT of the unperturbed theory. In the SymTFT we state a simple commutation condition which results in a pair of compatible bulk and defect perturbations, such that the perturbed line defects are conserved in the perturbed CFT. In other words, the perturbed defects are rigidly translation invariant, and such defects form a monoidal category which extends the topological symmetries. As examples we study the A-type Virasoro minimal models $M(p,q)$. Our formalism provides one-parameter families of commuting non-local conserved charges for perturbations by a primary bulk field with Kac label $(1,2)$, $(1,3)$, or $(1,5)$, which are the standard integrable perturbations of minimal models. We find solutions to the commutation condition also for other bulk perturbations, such as $(1,7)$, and we contrast this with the existence of local conserved charges. There has been recent interest in the possibility that in certain cases perturbations by fields such as $(1,7)$ can be integrable, and our construction provides a new way in which integrability can be found without the need for local conserved charges.</description>

      <title>Dissecting Quantum Phase Transition in the Transverse Ising Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.12702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the fact that a complete theoretical description of critical phenomena in connection with phase transitions has been well-established through the renormalization group theory, the microscopic nature of the phase transitions remains to be understood in a satisfactory way. For example, how does the interaction between individuals drive a system from one phase to another as a specific parameter varies, and how do the individuals respond to changes in this parameter during the process? Here we take the well-studied quantum phase transition (QPT) in the one-dimensional transverse Ising model (TIM) as an example to exhibit such a microscopic process. We first introduce $2L$ collective structures,referred to as patterns, for the TIM with $L$ ferromagnetically interacting spins, and then analyze the contributions of these patterns to the system's states, e.g., the ground state, the first excited state, and so on, from which the analogue of the QPT process between the disordered phase in the weakly coupling regime and the ferromagnetic phase in the strongly coupling regime is clearly identified around the interaction strength $J_c =1$. We systematically explore this process for small lattice sizes of $L=6, 8, 10, 12$, whose ground state energies are identical to those obtained by direct numerical exact diagonalization. Increasing the system size up to $L=128$, the actual QPT point located at $J_c = 1$ in the thermodynamical limit is gradually approached. Our results show that the pattern picture is not only able to provide a microscopic process of phase transitions, but also of practical interest in analyzing analogues of QPT in diverse quantum simulation platforms.</description>

      <title>Human perceptual decision making of nonequilibrium fluctuations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12692v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To better characterize the statistical processes underlying human decision-making, we performed experiments where human participants visualized fluctuations of physical nonequilibrium stationary states, and we analyzed responses in the context of stochastic thermodynamics. A total of forty five participants viewed hundreds of movies of a particle endowed with drifted Brownian dynamics and were tasked with judging the motion as leftward or rightward in a quick and reliable manner. Overall, the results uncover fundamental performance limits, consistent with recently established thermodynamic trade-offs (uncertainty relations, TURs) involving speed, accuracy, and dissipation; specifically, lower rates of entropy production lead to longer decision times. Moreover, to achieve a given level of observed accuracy, participants require more time than predicted by Wald's optimal sequential probability ratio test, indicating suboptimal integration of available information. In view of such suboptimality, we develop an alternative account equipped with non-Markovian evidence integration with a memory time constant, and find tight fits. Our results suggest that humans adapt their memory relaxation time to the rate of dissipation of the observed phenomenon, favouring memory over momentary evidence for effective decisions in scenarios where stimuli are far from equilibrium. Furthermore, we identify the effects of the environmental stability on decision-making performance and memory by comparing the results of the two sets of experiments: blocked (stationary) versus intermixed (non-stationary) conditions. Our study illustrates that perceptual psychophysics using stimuli rooted in nonequilibrium physical processes provides a robust platform for understanding how the human brain makes decisions on stochastic information inputs.</description>

      <title>Full distribution and large deviations of local observables in an exactly solvable current carrying steady state of a strongly driven XXZ chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10458v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current carrying steady states of interacting spin chains exhibit rich structures generated through an interplay of constraints from the Hamiltonian dynamics and those induced by the current. The XXZ spin chain when coupled to maximally polarizing Lindblad terms (with opposite signs on either ends) admits an exact solution for the steady state in a matrix product state (MPS) form. We use this exact solution to study the correlations and distributions of local spin observables in the non-equilibrium steady state (NESS). We present exact expressions for spin correlators, entropy per site and scaled cumulant generating functions (SCGF) for distributions of local observables in the XX limit (Ising anisotropy $\Delta=0$). Further, we use the exact MPS solution in $\Delta&gt;0$ regime, to calculate numerically exact entropy, correlations, as well as full distributions of spin observables in large systems. In systems where $\Delta$ is a cosine of rational multiple of $\pi$, we can numerically exactly estimate the large system limit of the SCGF and the large deviation/rate functions of local-$z$ magnetization. For these, we show that the deviations of the SCGF, calculated in finite systems, from the asymptotic large system size limit decay exponentially with system size, however the decay rate is a discontinuous function of $\Delta$. The $x$ magnetization density shows a double peak structure at $\Delta\lesssim 1$ suggesting short-range ferromagnetic ordering in the $x$ direction similar to what was reported for the ground state of XXZ chain.</description>

      <title>Learning classical density functionals for ionic fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient theoretical techniques for describing ionic fluids are highly desirable for many applications across the physical, biological and materials sciences. With a rigorous statistical mechanical foundation, classical density functional theory (cDFT) is an appealing approach, but the competition between strong Coulombic interactions and steric repulsion limits the accuracy of current approximate functionals. Here, we extend a recently presented machine learning (ML) approach [Samm\"uller et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 120, e2312484120 (2023)] designed for systems with short-ranged interactions to ionic fluids. By adopting ideas from local molecular field theory, the framework we present amounts to using neural networks to learn the local relationship between the one-body direct correlation functions and inhomogeneous density profiles for a "mimic'' short-ranged system, with effects of long-ranged interactions accounted for in a mean-field, yet well-controlled, manner. By comparing to results from molecular simulations, we show that our approach accurately describes the structure and thermodynamics of prototypical models for electrolyte solutions and ionic liquids, including size-asymmetric and multivalent systems. The framework we present acts as an important step toward extending ML approaches for cDFT to systems with accurate interatomic potentials.</description>

      <title>Physical meaning of principal component analysis for classical lattice systems with translational invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22682v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the physical implications of applying principal component analysis (PCA) to translationally invariant classical systems defined on a $d$-dimensional hypercubic lattice. Using Rayleigh-Schr\"odinger perturbation theory, we demonstrate that the principal components are related to the reciprocal lattice vectors of the hypercubic lattice, and the corresponding eigenvalues are connected to the discrete Fourier transform of the sampled configurations. From a different perspective, we show that the PCA in question can be viewed as a numerical method for computing the ensemble average of the squared moduli of the Fourier transform of physical quantities. Our results also provide a way to determine approximately the principal components of a classical system with translational invariance without the need for matrix diagonalization.</description>

      <title>Self-congruent point in critical matrix product states: An effective field theory for finite-entanglement scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03954v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We set up an effective field theory formulation for the renormalization flow of matrix product states (MPS) with finite bond dimension, focusing on systems exhibiting finite-entanglement scaling close to a conformally invariant critical fixed point. We show that the finite MPS bond dimension $\chi$ is equivalent to introducing a perturbation by a relevant operator to the fixed-point Hamiltonian. The fingerprint of this mechanism is encoded in the $\chi$-independent universal transfer matrix's gap ratios, which are distinct from those predicted by the unperturbed Conformal Field Theory. This phenomenon defines a renormalization group self-congruent point, where the relevant coupling constant ceases to flow due to a balance of two effects; When increasing $\chi$, the infrared scale, set by the correlation length $\xi(\chi)$, increases, while the strength of the perturbation at the lattice scale decreases. The presence of a self-congruent point does not alter the validity of the finite-entanglement scaling hypothesis, since the self-congruent point is located at a finite distance from the critical fixed point, well inside the scaling regime of the CFT. We corroborate this framework with numerical evidences from the exact solution of the Ising model and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations of an effective lattice model.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium steady state of Brownian motion in an intermittent potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the steady state distribution $P_{\text{SSD}}(\boldsymbol{X})$ of the position of a Brownian particle under an intermittent confining potential that switches on and off with a constant rate $\gamma$. We assume the external potential $U(\boldsymbol{x})$ to be smooth and have a unique global minimum at $\boldsymbol{x} = \boldsymbol{x}_0$, and in dimension $d&gt;1$ we additionally assume that $U(\boldsymbol{x})$ is central. We focus on the rapid-switching limit $\gamma \to \infty$. Typical fluctuations follow a Boltzmann distribution $P_{\text{SSD}}(\boldsymbol{X}) \sim e^{- U_{\text{eff}}(\boldsymbol{X}) / D}$, with an effective potential $U_{\text{eff}}(\boldsymbol{X}) = U(\boldsymbol{X})/2$, where $D$ is the diffusion coefficient. However, we also calculate the tails of $P_{\text{SSD}}(\boldsymbol{X})$ which behave very differently. In the far tails $|\boldsymbol{X}| \to \infty$, a universal behavior $P_{\text{SSD}}\left(\boldsymbol{X}\right)\sim e^{-\sqrt{\gamma/D} \, \left|\boldsymbol{X}-\boldsymbol{x}_{0}\right|}$ emerges, that is independent of the trapping potential. The mean first-passage time to reach position $\boldsymbol{X}$ is given, in the leading order, by $\sim 1/P_{\text{SSD}}(\boldsymbol{X})$. This coincides with the Arrhenius law (for the effective potential $U_{\text{eff}}$) for $\boldsymbol{X} \simeq \boldsymbol{x}_0$, but deviates from it elsewhere. We give explicit results for the harmonic potential. Finally, we extend our results to periodic one-dimensional systems. Here we find that in the limit of $\gamma \to \infty$ and $D \to 0$, the logarithm of $P_{\text{SSD}}(X)$ exhibits a singularity which we interpret as a first-order dynamical phase transition (DPT). This DPT occurs in absence of any external drift. We also calculate the nonzero probability current in the steady state that is a result of the nonequilibrium nature of the system.</description>

      <title>Exact Solution of the Frustrated Potts Model with Next-Nearest-Neighbor Interactions in One Dimension: An AI-Aided Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The one-dimensional $J_1$-$J_2$ $q$-state Potts model is solved exactly for arbitrary $q$ by introducing the maximally symmetric subspace (MSS) method to analytically block diagonalize the $q^2\times q^2$ transfer matrix to a simple $2\times 2$ matrix, based on using OpenAI's latest reasoning model o3-mini-high to exactly solve the $q=3$ case. It is found that the model can be mapped to the 1D $q$-state Potts model with $J_2$ acting as the nearest-neighbor interaction and $J_1$ as an effective magnetic field, extending the previous proof for $q=2$, i.e., the Ising model. The exact results provide insights to outstanding physical problems such as the stacking of atomic or electronic orders in layered materials and the formation of a $T_c$-dome-shaped phase often seen in unconventional superconductors. This work is anticipated to fuel both the research in one-dimensional frustrated magnets for recently discovered finite-temperature application potentials and the fast moving topic area of AI for sciences.</description>

      <title>Operads and the Markov Property on the square lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11126v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Markov processes on the lattices with arbitrary dimension are omnipresent in statistical mechanics; however their algebraic description is complete only in dimension 1, for which linear algebra provides many tools complementary to the probabilistic approach: as an example, invariant measures are eigenvectors of the generator. In larger dimension, such algebraic tools are absent due to the more involved structure of boundaries. The present work fills this gap by providing a new and complete algebraic description of these models without any other assumption than the Markov property. In order to handle higher dimensions and higher products, the language of operads is used in order to focus on associativities and the geometric interpretation of the algebraic products. This formalism leads to a new parametrization of boundary conditions of Markov processes, with concrete computations. This parametrization is inspired matrix product states in the physics literature. Among others, a probabilistic application elaborated in this paper is the construction of translation-invariant infinite-volume Gibbs measures on the whole lattice by using Kolmogorov's extension; this provides a new alternative tool to the traditional analytical approaches of large size limits. Various models are considered as illustrations.</description>

      <title>Prediction of defect properties in concentrated solid solutions using a Langmuir-like model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The alleged existence of sluggish diffusion in high entropy alloys has drawn controversy. In high entropy alloys, and in general in all solids, transport properties are controlled by point defect concentration, which must be known before performing atomistic simulations to compute transport coefficients. In this work, we present a general Langmuir-like model for defect concentration in an arbitrarily complex solid solution and apply this model to generate expressions for concentrations of vacancies and small interstitial atoms. We then calculate the vacancy concentration as a function of temperature in the equiatomic CoNiCrFeMn and FeAl alloys with modified embedded-atom-method potentials for various chemical orderings, showing there is no clear correlation between vacancy thermodynamics and chemical ordering in the CoNiCrFeMn alloy but clear systematic patterns for FeAl. We believe this is due to the high stability of disordered, random and ordered, intermetallic phases respectively in the CoNiCrFeMn and FeAl systems. This work provides future avenues to the prediction of thermal interstitials and vacancies in solid solutions, which is necessary for models of non-equilibrium behavior of solid solutions.</description>

      <title>Correlated decoding of logical algorithms with transversal gates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum error correction is believed to be essential for scalable quantum computation, but its implementation is challenging due to its considerable space-time overhead. Motivated by recent experiments demonstrating efficient manipulation of logical qubits using transversal gates (Bluvstein et al., Nature 626, 58-65 (2024)), we show that the performance of logical algorithms can be substantially improved by decoding the qubits jointly to account for error propagation during transversal entangling gates. We find that such correlated decoding improves the performance of both Clifford and non-Clifford transversal entangling gates, and explore two decoders offering different computational runtimes and accuracies. In particular, by leveraging the deterministic propagation of stabilizer measurement errors through transversal Clifford gates, we find that correlated decoding enables the number of noisy syndrome extraction rounds between these gates to be reduced from $O(d)$ to $O(1)$ in Clifford circuits, where $d$ is the code distance. We verify numerically that this approach substantially reduces the space-time cost of deep logical Clifford circuits. These results demonstrate that correlated decoding provides a major advantage in early fault-tolerant computation, as realized in recent experiments, and further indicate it has considerable potential to reduce the space-time cost in large-scale logical algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24143v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a conformal field theory that arises in the infinite-volume limit of a spin chain with $U_q(sl_2)$ global symmetry. Most operators in the theory are defect-ending operators which allows $U_q(sl_2)$ symmetry transformations to act on them in a consistent way. We use Coulomb gas techniques to construct correlation functions and compute all OPE coefficients of the model, as well as to prove that the properties imposed by the quantum group symmetry are indeed satisfied by the correlation functions. In particular, we treat the non-chiral operators present in the theory. Free boson realization elucidates the origin of the defects attached to the operators. We also comment on the role of quantum group in generalized minimal models.</description>

      <title>The Moving Born-Oppenheimer Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17557v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a mixed quantum-classical framework, dubbed the Moving Born-Oppenheimer Approximation (MBOA), to describe the dynamics of slow degrees of freedom (DOFs) coupled to fast ones. As in the Born-Oppenheimer Approximation (BOA), the fast degrees of freedom adiabatically follow a state that depends on the slow ones. Unlike the BOA, this state depends on both the positions and the momenta of the slow DOFs. We study several model systems: a spin-1/2 particle and a spinful molecule moving in a spatially inhomogeneous magnetic field, and a gas of fast particles coupled to a piston. The MBOA reveals rich dynamics for the slow degree of freedom, including reflection, dynamical trapping, and mass renormalization. It also significantly modifies the state of the fast DOFs. For example, the spins in the molecule are entangled and squeezed, while the gas of fast particles develops gradients that are synchronized with the motion of the piston for a long time. The MBOA can be used to describe both classical and quantum systems and has potential applications in molecular dynamics, state preparation, and quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Design of Floppy Modes and Frustrated Loops in Metamaterials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12867v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metamaterials are a promising platform for a range of applications, from shock absorption to mechanical computing. These functionalities typically rely on floppy modes or mechanically frustrated loops, both of which are difficult to design. We introduce a combinatorial approach that allows to create an arbitrarily large number of floppy modes and frustrated loops. The design freedom of the mode shapes enables us to easily introduce kinematic incompatibility to turn them into frustrated loops. We demonstrate that floppy modes can be sequentially buckled by using a specific instance of elastoplastic buckling, and we utilize our combinatorial floppy chains and frustrated loops to achieve matrix-vector multiplication in materia. Our findings bring about new principles for the design and the use of floppiness and geometric frustration in soft matter and metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Deep Neural Nets as Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural networks are complex functions of both their inputs and parameters. Much prior work in deep learning theory analyzes the distribution of network outputs at a fixed a set of inputs (e.g. a training dataset) over random initializations of the network parameters. The purpose of this article is to consider the opposite situation: we view a randomly initialized Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) as a Hamiltonian over its inputs. For typical realizations of the network parameters, we study the properties of the energy landscape induced by this Hamiltonian, focusing on the structure of near-global minimum in the limit of infinite width. Specifically, we use the replica trick to perform an exact analytic calculation giving the entropy (log volume of space) at a given energy. We further derive saddle point equations that describe the overlaps between inputs sampled iid from the Gibbs distribution induced by the random MLP. For linear activations we solve these saddle point equations exactly. But we also solve them numerically for a variety of depths and activation functions, including $\tanh, \sin, \text{ReLU}$, and shaped non-linearities. We find even at infinite width a rich range of behaviors. For some non-linearities, such as $\sin$, for instance, we find that the landscapes of random MLPs exhibit full replica symmetry breaking, while shallow $\tanh$ and ReLU networks or deep shaped MLPs are instead replica symmetric.</description>
