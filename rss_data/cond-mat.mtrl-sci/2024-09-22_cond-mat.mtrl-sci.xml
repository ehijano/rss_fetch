      <title>Impact of grain boundary energy anisotropy on grain growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A threshold dynamics model of grain growth that accounts for the anisotropy in the grain boundary energy has been used to simulate experimentally observed grain growth of polycrystalline Ni. The simulation reproduces several aspects of the observed microstructural evolution that are not found in the results of simulations assuming isotropic properties. For example, the relative areas of the lowest-energy twin boundaries increase as the grains grow and the average grain boundary energy decreases with grain growth. This decrease in energy occurs because the population of higher-energy grain boundaries decreases while the population of lower-energy boundaries increases as the total grain boundary area decreases. This phenomenon emerges from the assumption of anisotropic grain boundary energies without modification of the energy minimizing algorithm. These findings are consistent with the observation that, in addition to the decrease in grain boundary area, additional energy is dissipated during grain growth by a decrease in the average grain boundary energy.</description>

      <title>Strain Effects in SrHfO$_{3}$ Films Grown by Hybrid Molecular Beam Epitaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perovskite oxides hetero-structures are host to a large number of interesting phenomena such as ferroelectricity and 2D-superconductivity. Ferroelectric perovskite oxides have been of significant interest due to their possible use in MOSFETs and FRAM. SrHfO$_3$ (SHO) is a perovskite oxide with pseudo-cubic lattice parameter of 4.1 $\mathring{A}$ that previous DFT calculations suggest can be stabilized in a ferroelectric P4mm phase, similar to STO, when stabilized with sufficient compressive strain. Additionally, it is insulating, possesses a large band gap, and a high dielectric constant, making it an ideal candidate for oxide electronic devices. In this work, SHO films were grown by hybrid molecular beam epitaxy with a tetrakis(ethylmethylamino)hafnium(IV) source on GdScO$_3$ and TbScO$_3$ substrates. Equilibrium and strained SHO phases were characterized using X-ray diffraction, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and scanning transmission electron microscopy to determine the perovskite phase of the strained films, with the results compared to density functional theory models of phase stability versus strain. Contrary to past reports, we find that compressively-strained SrHfO$_3$ undergoes octahedral tilt distortions and most likely takes on the I4/mcm phase with the a$^0$a$^0$c$^-$ tilt pattern.</description>

      <title>Catalogue of Phonon Instabilities in Symmetry Group 191 Kagome MT$_6$Z$_6$ Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kagome materials manifest rich physical properties due to the emergence of abundant electronic phases. Here, we carry out a high-throughput first-principles study of the kagome 1:6:6 family MT$_6$Z$_6$ materials in space group 191, focusing on their phonon instability and electronic flat bands. Different MT$_6$Z$_6$ kagome candidates reveal a remarkable variety of kagome flat bands ranging from unfilled, partially filled, to fully filled. Notably, the Mn/Fe-166 compounds exhibit partially filled flat bands with a pronounced sharp peak in the density of states near the Fermi level, leading to magnetic orders that polarize the bands and stabilize the otherwise unstable phonon. When the flat bands are located away from the Fermi level, we find a large number of phonon instabilities, which can be classified into three types, based on the phonon dispersion and vibrational modes. Type-I instabilities involve the in-plane distortion of kagome nets, while type-II and type-III present out-of-plane distortion of trigonal M and Z atoms. We take MgNi$_6$Ge$_6$ and HfNi$_6$In$_6$ as examples to illustrate the possible CDW structures derived from the emergent type-I and type-II instabilities. The type-I instability in MgNi$_6$Ge$_6$ suggests a nematic phase transition, governed by the local twisting of kagome nets. The type-II instability in HfNi$_6$In$_6$ may result in a hexagonal-to-orthorhombic transition, offering insight into the formation of MT$_6$Z$_6$ in other space groups. Additionally, the predicted ScNb$_6$Sn$_6$ is analyzed as an example of the type-III instability. Our predictions suggest a vast kagome family with rich properties induced by the flat bands, possible CDW transitions, and their interplay with magnetism.</description>

      <title>Dynamical non-linear optical response in time-periodic quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive formalism for calculating the linear and nonlinear optical response of time-periodic (Floquet) quantum systems. Our approach, based on density matrix evolution in the Floquet basis, employs the length gauge and incorporates both intraband and interband contributions of the position operator. This formalism enables the interpretation of optical responses in terms of photon-assisted transitions and reveals a unique, divergent AC response to DC fields in Floquet systems, analogous to a Drude peak at finite frequency. Importantly, our method generalizes to optical tensor conductivity calculations at arbitrary perturbation orders, providing a powerful tool for analyzing driven quantum systems. Additionally, this approach captures various DC photocurrents, including shift current, injection current, gyration current, Berry dipole contributions, and intrinsic Fermi surface effects in certain limits.</description>

      <title>Spin Dynamics in Hybrid Halide Perovskites -- Effect of Dynamical and Permanent Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hybrid organic-inorganic halide perovskite (HOIP), for example MAPbBr3, exhibits extended spin lifetime and apparent spin lifetime anisotropy in experiments. The underlying mechanisms of these phenomena remain illusive. By utilizing our first-principles densitymatrix dynamics approach with quantum scatterings including electron-phonon and electronelectron interactions and self-consistent spinorbit coupling, we present temperature- and magnetic field-dependent spin lifetimes in hybrid perovskites, in agreement with experimental observations. For centrosymmetric hybrid perovskite MAPbBr3, the experimentally observed spin lifetime anisotropy is mainly attributed to the dynamical Rashba effect arising from the interaction between organic and inorganic components and the rotation of the organic cation. For noncentrosymmetric perovskite, such as MPSnBr3, we found persistent spin helix texture at the conduction band minimum, which significantly enhances the spin lifetime anisotropy. Our study provides theoretical insight to spin dynamics in HOIP and strategies for controlling and optimizing spin transport.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic spin Nernst effect in topological Dirac and magnetic Weyl semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the intrinsic spin Nernst effect (SNE), a transverse spin current induced by temperature gradients, in topological Dirac semimetals (TDSMs) and magnetic Weyl semimetals (MWSMs) with Ising spin-orbit coupling. The intrinsic SNE is described by the spin Berry curvature, which reflects the geometric nature of TDSMs and MWSMs. We clarified that the intrinsic SNE becomes significant when the Fermi energy is near, but slightly deviates from, the energy of the point nodes. In this situation, Bloch electrons with strong spin Berry curvature contribute to the SNE while avoiding carrier compensation between electrons and holes. We found that in TDSMs with small Fermi surfaces, the spin Nernst angle, which measures the efficiency of the SNE, is larger than that observed in heavy metals. This suggests that TDSMs with small Fermi surfaces can achieve efficient heat-to-spin current conversion. In MWSMs, variation in the magnitude of the exchange coupling with magnetic moments significantly changes the SNE, affecting both the direction and magnitude of the spin Nernst current. This implies that ferromagnetic transitions can be used to reverse the spin Nernst current. These results provide the fundamentals for future topological spin caloritronics.</description>

      <title>Hybrid-Order Topological Phase And Transition in 1H Transition Metal Compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by recent experimental observations of hybrid topological states [Nature 628, 527 (2024)], we predict hybrid-order topological insulators (HOTIs) in 1H transition metal compounds (TMCs), where both second-order and first-order topological states coexist near the Fermi level. Initially, 1H-TMCs exhibit a second-order topological phase due to the d-orbital band gap. Upon coupling of p- and d- orbitals couple, first-order topological characteristics emerge. This hybrid-order topological phase transition is tunable via crystal field effects. Combined with first-principles calculations, we illustrate the phase transition with WTe2 and NbSe2. In addition, the first-order topological band gap of the HOTI exhibits a strong spin Hall effect. Our finding reveal novel hybrid-order topological phase in 2D electron materials and highlight spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Effects of residual stress on the isothermal tensile behavior of nanocrystalline superelastic NiTi shape memory alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The residual stress greatly affects the mechanical behavior of a material. In this work, the effect of residual stress on the isothermal tensile behavior of a NiTi shape memory alloy is studied. The focused ion beam and digital image correlation are combined to measure the two-dimensional residual stress in nanocrystalline NiTi plates processed with prestrain laser shock peening. A four-point bending experiment verified the accuracy of this measurement method. The FIB-DIC method is an attractive tool for measuring the two-dimensional residual stress in phase transition nanocrystalline materials. The internal residual stress significantly decreases the phase transition stress, and the mechanism is studied via finite element and theoretical analyses. This work implies that the mechanical behavior of NiTi shape memory alloys can be tailored via residual stress engineering.</description>

      <title>Atomistic simulations of athermal irradiation creep and swelling of copper and tungsten in the high dose limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiation creep and swelling are irreversible deformation phenomena occurring in materials irradiated even at low temperatures. On the microscopic scale, energetic particles initiate collision cascades, generating and eliminating defects that then interact and coalesce in the presence of internal and external stress. We investigate how copper and tungsten swell and deform under various applied stress states in the low- and high-energy irradiation limits. Simulations show that the two metals respond in a qualitatively similar manner, in a remarkable deviation from the fundamentally different low-temperature plastic behaviour of bcc and fcc. The deviatoric part of plastic strain is particularly sensitive to applied stress, leading to anisotropic dimensional changes. At the same time, the volume change, vacancy content and dislocation density are almost insensitive to the applied stress. Low- as opposed to high-energy irradiation gives rise to greater swelling, faster creep, and higher defect content for the same dose. Simulations show that even at low temperatures, where thermal creep is absent, irradiation results in a stress-dependent irreversible anisotropic deformation of considerable magnitude, with the orientation aligned with the orientation of applied stress. To model the high dose microstructures, we develop an algorithm that at the cost of about 25% overestimation of the defect content is up to ten times faster than collision cascade simulations. The direct time integration of equations of motion of atoms in cascades is replaced by the minimisation of energy of molten spherical regions; multiple insertion of molten zones and the subsequent relaxation steps simulate the increasing radiation exposure.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen under Pressure as a Benchmark for Machine-Learning Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLPs) are fast, data-driven surrogate models of atomistic systems' potential energy surfaces that can accelerate ab-initio molecular dynamics (MD) simulations by several orders of magnitude. The performance of MLPs is commonly measured as the prediction error in energies and forces on data not used in their training. While low prediction errors on a test set are necessary, they do not guarantee good performance in MD simulations. The latter requires physically motivated performance measures obtained from running accelerated simulations. However, the adoption of such measures has been limited by the effort and domain knowledge required to calculate and interpret them.
  To overcome this limitation, we present a benchmark that automatically quantifies the performance of MLPs in MD simulations of a liquid-liquid phase transition in hydrogen under pressure, a challenging benchmark system. The benchmark's h-llpt-24 dataset provides reference geometries, energies, forces, and stresses from density functional theory MD simulations at different temperatures and mass densities. The benchmark's Python code automatically runs MLP-accelerated MD simulations and calculates, quantitatively compares and visualizes pressures, stable molecular fractions, diffusion coefficients, and radial distribution functions. Employing this benchmark, we show that several state-of-the-art MLPs fail to reproduce the liquid-liquid phase transition.</description>

      <title>Probing Elastic Isotropy in Entropy Stabilized Transition Metal Oxides: Experimental Estimation of Single Crystal Elastic Constants from Polycrystalline Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single Crystal Elastic Constants (SECs) are pivotal for understanding material deformation, validating interatomic potentials, and enabling crucial material simulations. The entropy stabilized oxide showcases intriguing properties, underscoring the necessity for the determination of precise SECs to establish reliable interatomic potential and unlock its full potential using simulations. This study presents an innovative methodology for estimating SECs from polycrystalline materials, requiring only two diffraction elastic constants and isotropic elastic constants for crystals with cubic symmetry. Validation using phase-pure nickel demonstrated good agreement with existing literature values, with a maximum 11.5% deviation for $C_{12}$ values. Extending the methodology to [(MgNiCoCuZn)O], SECs were calculated: 219 GPa for $C_{11}$, 116 GPa for $C_{12}$, and 51 GPa for $C_{44}$. Comparison with literature-reported values from DFT calculations revealed a significant divergence, ranging from 25% to 59% in the bulk and shear modulus calculated using the Voigt-Reuss-Hill average. To comprehend this disparity, we conducted DFT calculations and thoroughly examined the factors influencing these values. This study not only introduces a straightforward and dependable SEC estimation methodology but also provides precise experimental SEC values for [(MgNiCoCuZn)O] entropy stabilized oxides at ambient conditions, crucial for developing accurate interatomic potentials in future research.</description>

      <title>Absence of altermagnetic spin splitting character in rutile oxide RuO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rutile RuO$_2$ has been posited as a potential $d$-wave altermagnetism candidate, with a predicted significant spin splitting up to 1.4 eV. Despite accumulating theoretical predictions and transport measurements, direct spectroscopic observation of spin splitting has remained elusive. Here, we employ spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to investigate the band structures and spin polarization of thin-film and single-crystal RuO$_2$. Contrary to expectations of altermagnetism, our analysis indicates that RuO$_2$'s electronic structure aligns with those predicted under non-magnetic conditions, exhibiting no evidence of the hypothesized spin splitting. Additionally, we observe significant in-plane spin polarization of the low-lying bulk bands, which is antisymmetric about the high-symmetry plane and contrary to the $d$-wave spin texture due to time-reversal symmetry breaking in altermagnetism. These findings definitively challenge the altermagnetic order previously proposed for rutile RuO$_2$, prompting a reevaluation of its magnetic properties.</description>

      <title>Giant Strain Tunability in Polycrystalline Ceramic Films via Helium Implantation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strain engineering is a powerful tool routinely used to control and enhance properties such as ferroelectricity, magnetic ordering, or metal-insulator transitions. Epitaxial strain in thin films allows manipulation of in-plane lattice parameters, achieving strain values generally up to 4\%, and above in some specific cases. In polycrystalline films, which are more suitable for functional applications due to their lower fabrication costs, strains above 1% often cause cracking. This poses challenges for functional property tuning by strain engineering. Helium implantation has been shown to induce negative pressure through interstitial implantation, which increases the unit cell volume and allows for continuous strain tuning with the implanted dose in epitaxial monocrystalline films. However, there have been no studies on the transferability of helium implantation as a strain-engineering technique to polycrystalline films. Here, we demonstrate the technique's applicability for strain engineering beyond epitaxial monocrystalline samples. Helium implantation can trigger an unprecedented lattice parameter expansion of up to 3.2% in polycrystalline BiFeO3 films without causing structural cracks. The film maintains stable ferroelectric properties with doses up to 1E15 He.cm-2. This finding underscores the potential of helium implantation in strain engineering polycrystalline materials, enabling cost-effective and versatile applications.</description>

      <title>Direct spin imaging detector based on freestanding magnetic nanomembranes with electron optical amplification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An analog of the optical polarizer/analyzer for electrons, a spin filter based on freestanding ferromagnetic (FM) nanomembrane covering the entrance of the microchannel plate (MCP) was applied for efficient spin filtering and electron amplification in the 2D field of view. To study the spin dependent transmission, we constructed a spin-triode device (spintron), which consists of a compact proximity focused vacuum tube with the Na2KSb spin-polarized electron source, the FM-MCP and phosphor screen placed to run parallel to each other. Here, we demonstrate the fabrication of FM nanomembranes consisting of a Co/Pt superlattice deposited on a freestanding 3 nm SiO2 layer with a total thickness of 10 nm. The FM-MCP has 10e6 channels with a single-channel Sherman function S=0.6 and a transmission of 1.5x10e-3 in the low electron energy range. The FM-MCP-based device provides a compact optical method for measuring the spin polarization of free electron beams in the imaging mode and is well suited for photoemission spectroscopy and microscopy methods.</description>

      <title>Tunable Anomalous Hall Effect in a Kagome Ferromagnetic Weyl Semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emerging from the intricate interplay of topology and magnetism, the giant anomalous Hall effect (AHE) is the most known topological property of the recently discovered kagome ferromagnetic Weyl semimetal Co_3Sn_2S_2 with the magnetic Co atoms arranged on a kagome lattice. Here we report that the AHE in Co_3Sn_2S_2 can be fine-tuned by an applied magnetic field orientated within ~2 degrees of the kagome plane, while beyond this regime, it stays unchanged. Particularly, it can vanish in magnetic fields parallel to the kagome plane and even decrease in magnetic fields collinear with the spin direction. This tunable AHE can be attributed to local spin switching enabled by the geometrical frustration of the magnetic kagome lattice, revealing that spins in a kagome ferromagnet change their switching behavior as the magnetic field approaches the kagome plane. Our results also suggest a versatile way to tune the properties of a kagome magnet.</description>

      <title>Advancing single-atom catalysts: engineered metal-organic platforms on surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in nanomaterials have pushed the boundaries of nanoscale fabrication to the limit of single atoms (SAs), particularly in heterogeneous catalysis. Single atom catalysts (SACs), comprising minute amounts of transition metals dispersed on inert substrates, have emerged as prominent materials in this domain. However, overcoming the tendency of these SAs to cluster beyond cryogenic temperatures and precisely arranging them on surfaces pose significant challenges. Employing organic templates for orchestrating and modulating the activity of single atoms holds promise. Here, we introduce a novel single atom platform (SAP) wherein atoms are firmly anchored to specific coordination sites distributed along carbon-based polymers, synthesized via on-surface synthesis (OSS). These SAPs exhibit atomiclevel structural precision and stability, even at elevated temperatures. The asymmetry in the electronic states at the active sites anticipates the enhanced reactivity of these precisely defined reactive centers. Upon exposure to CO and CO2 gases at low temperatures, the SAP demonstrates excellent trapping capabilities. Fine-tuning the structure and properties of the coordination sites offers unparalleled flexibility in tailoring functionalities, thus opening avenues for previously untapped potential in catalytic applications.</description>

      <title>Constructions and Applications of Irreducible Representations of Spin-Space Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-space groups (SSGs), including the traditional space groups (SGs) and magnetic space groups (MSGs) as subsets, describe the complete symmetries of magnetic materials with weak spin-orbit coupling (SOC). In the present work, we systematically study the irreducible representations (irreps) of SSGs by focusing on the projective irreps of the little co-group $L(k)$ of any momentum point $\pmb k$. We analysis the factor systems of $L(k)$, and then reduce the projective regular representation of $L(k)$ into direct sum of irreps using the Hamiltonian approach. Especially, for collinear SSGs which contain continuous spin rotation operations, we adopt discrete subgroups to effectively capture their characteristics. Furthermore, we apply the representation theory of SSGs to study the band structure of electrons and magnons in magnetic materials. After identifying the SSG symmetry group, we extract relevant irreps and determine the $k\cdot p$ models. As an example, we illustrate how our approach works for the material \ch{Mn3Sn}. Degeneracies facilitated by SSG symmetry are observed, underscoring the effectiveness of application in material analysis. The SSG recognition and representation code is uploaded to GitHub, the information of irreps of all SSGs is also available in the online Database. Our work provides a practical toolkit for exploring the intricate symmetries of magnetic materials and paves the way for future advances in materials science.</description>

      <title>Universal symmetry-protected persistent spin textures in nonmagnetic solids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The significance of Mendeleev's periodic table extends beyond the classification of elements; it lies in its remarkable predictive power for discovering new elements and properties, revealing the underlying symmetrical patterns of nature that were only fully understood with the advent of quantum mechanics. Fundamental material properties, such as electron transport and magnetism, are also governed by crystal symmetry. In particular, spin transport depends on the spin polarization of electronic states, and recently discovered materials where the electron spin polarization is independent of momentum - a property known as a persistent spin texture (PST) - promise extended spin lifetime and efficient spin accumulation. In this paper, we establish the general conditions for the existence of symmetry-protected PST in bulk crystals. By systematically analyzing all 230 crystallographic space groups, similar to elements in the periodic table, we demonstrate that PST is universally present in all nonmagnetic solids lacking inversion symmetry. Using group theory, we identify the regions within the Brillouin zone that host PST and determine the corresponding directions of spin polarization. Our findings, supported by first-principles calculations of representative materials, open the route for discovering robust spintronic materials based on PST.</description>

      <title>Break-down of the relationship between {\alpha}-relaxation and equilibration in hydrostatically compressed metallic glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is usually assumed that the memory of any thermo-mechanical protocol applied to a glass can be erased by heating the material in the supercooled liquid. While this is true for thermally treated amorphous solids, we show that hydrostatic compression can irreversibly modify the atomic motion, thermodynamic state and structure of a prototypical metallic glass-former, in a way which depends on the degree of ergodicity reached by the material during compression. While enhanced kinetic and thermodynamic stability can be obtained by quenching the dense liquid, high-pressure annealing in the glass leads to thermal rejuvenation and complex structural rearrangements at the level of the short and medium range order. When heated above their glass transition temperature, these compressed glasses do not convert into the pristine supercooled liquid but rather transform into different systems, challenging the generally accepted idea of an equilibrium recovery controlled solely by the microscopic $\alpha$-relaxation process.</description>

      <title>Check-probe spectroscopy of lifetime-limited emitters in bulk-grown silicon carbide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solid-state single-photon emitters provide a versatile platform for exploring quantum technologies such as optically connected quantum networks. A key challenge is to ensure optical coherence and spectral stability of the emitters. Here, we introduce a high-bandwidth `check-probe' scheme to quantitatively measure (laser-induced) spectral diffusion and ionisation rates, as well as homogeneous linewidths. We demonstrate these methods on single V2 centers in commercially available bulk-grown 4H-silicon carbide. Despite observing significant spectral diffusion under laser illumination ($\gtrsim$ GHz/s), the optical transitions are narrow ($\sim$35 MHz), and remain stable in the dark ($\gtrsim$1 s). Through Landau-Zener-St\"uckelberg interferometry, we determine the optical coherence to be near-lifetime limited ($T_2 = 16.4(4)$ ns), hinting at the potential for using bulk-grown materials for developing quantum technologies. These results advance our understanding of spectral diffusion of quantum emitters in semiconductor materials, and may have applications for studying charge dynamics across other platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Through Monte Carlo simulations and the Associating Lattice Gas Model, the phases of a two-dimensional fluid under hydrophilic confinement are evaluated. The model, in its unconfined version, reproduces the anomalous behavior of water regarding its density, diffusion, and solubility, among other dynamic and thermodynamic properties. Extreme confinements suppress phase transitions since fluctuations suppress ordering. The fluid under hydrophilic confinement forms a single wetting layer that gradually wets the wall. From the wetting layer, the low-density liquid structure is formed. The confined fluid presents a first-order liquid-liquid transition, but always at lower temperatures than that observed in the bulk.</description>

      <title>Sparse Optimization of Two-Dimensional Terahertz Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional terahertz spectroscopy (2DTS) is a low-frequency analogue of two-dimensional optical spectroscopy that is rapidly maturing as a probe of a wide variety of condensed matter systems. However, a persistent problem of 2DTS is the long experimental acquisition times, preventing its broader adoption. A potential solution, requiring no increase in experimental complexity, is signal reconstruction via compressive sensing. In this work, we apply the sparse exponential mode analysis (SEMA) technique to 2DTS of a cuprate superconductor. We benchmark the performance of the algorithm in reconstructing the terahertz nonlinearities and find that SEMA reproduces the asymmetric photon echo lineshapes with as low as a 10% sampling rate and reaches the reconstruction noise floor with beyond 20-30% sampling rate. The success of SEMA in reproducing such subtle, asymmetric lineshapes confirms compressive sensing as a general method to accelerate 2DTS and multidimensional spectroscopies more broadly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems, going beyond conventional Hermitian systems, have brought in intriguing concepts such as exceptional points and complex spectral topology as well as exotic phenomena such as non-Hermitian skin effects (NHSEs). However, previous studies on non-Hermitian systems predominantly focus on the properties of eigenstates, with rather limited discussions on non-Hermitian dynamic phenomena. Here, inspired by the celebrated success of the parity-time symmetry in non-Hermitian physics, we theoretically study a one-dimensional non-Hermitian system with glide-time reversal (GT) symmetry. We discover that the GT symmetry leads to unique physical properties and enables rich dynamic phenomena in non-Hermitian systems. Remarkably, we reveal the dynamic NHSEs that exhibit diverse behaviors across distinct dynamic phases, elucidating the richness of non-Hermitian dynamics. We establish the theoretical frameworks for understanding the rich non-Hermitian dynamic phenomena. We further show that the rich dynamic phases in the GT-symmetric systems enable the remarkable tuning of the dynamics in the bulk as well as at the edge boundaries. These include the directional wave propagation and amplification in the bulk, as well as the wave trapping and the dynamic patterns at the edge boundaries. With both the development in the theoretical framework and the study of the rich non-Hermitian dynamic phases, this work serves as a stepstone for future studies on non-Hermitian dynamics with a special emphasize on the pivotal role of the lattice symmetry.</description>

      <title>Design and development of an advanced material for beampipe applications in particle accelerators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present investigation reports the design and development of an advanced material with a high figure of merit (FoM) for beampipe applications in particle accelerators by bringing synergy between computational and experimental approaches. Machine learning algorithms have been used to predict the phase(s), low density, and high radiation length of the designed Al-Ti-V alloys. Al-Ti-V alloys with various compositions for single-phase and dual-phase mixtures, liquidus temperature, and density values are obtained using the Latin hypercube sampling method in TC Python Thermo-Calc software. The obtained dataset is utilized to train the machine-learning algorithms. Classification algorithms such as XGBoost and regression models such as Linear Regression and Random Forest regressor have been used to compute the number of phases, radiation length, and density respectively. The XGBoost algorithms show an accuracy of $98\%$, the Linear regression model shows an accuracy of $94\%$, and the Random Forest regressor model is accurate up to $99\%$. The developed Al-Ti-V alloys exhibit high radiation length as well as a good combination of high elastic modulus and toughness due to the synergistic effect of the presence of hard $Al_3Ti$ phase along with a minor volume fraction of FCC $(Al)_{ss}$ solid solution phase mixture. The comparison of our alloys, alloy-1 ($Al_{75.2}Ti_{22.8}V_{2}$) and alloy-2 ($Al_{89}Ti_{10}V_{1}$) shows an increase in the radiation length by seven-times and a decrease in the density by two to three times as compared to stainless steel 304, the preferred material for constructing beampipes in low-energy particle accelerators. Further, we experimentally verify the elastic modulus of the alloy-1 and compute the FoM equal to 0.416, which is better than other existing materials for beampipes in low-energy experiments.</description>

Abstract: Superconducting circuits provide a versatile and controllable platform for studies of fundamental quantum phenomena as well as for quantum technology applications. A conventional technique to read out the state of a quantum circuit or to characterize its properties is based on rf measurement schemes involving costly and complex instrumentation. Here we demonstrate a simple dc measurement of a thermal spectrometer to investigate properties of a superconducting circuit, in this proof-of-concept experiment a coplanar waveguide resonator. A fraction of the microwave photons in the resonator is absorbed by an on-chip bolometer, resulting in a measurable temperature rise. By monitoring the dc signal of the thermometer due to this process, we are able to determine the resonance frequency and the lineshape (quality factor) of the resonator. The demonstrated scheme, which is a simple dc measurement, has a wide band up to 200 GHz, well exceeding that of the typical rf spectrometer. Moreover, the thermal measurement yields a highly frequency independent reference level of the Lorentzian absorption signal, unlike the conventional rf measurement. In the low power regime, the measurement is fully calibration-free. Our technique thus offers an alternative spectrometer for quantum circuits, which is in many ways superior with respect to conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Entanglement, Spin Squeezing and Quantum Sensing in a Spin-5/2 Heisenberg Molecular Iron(III) Triangle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study provides insights into the static and dynamic quantum properties of the trinuclear high-spin iron(III) molecular complex. Using exact diagonalization of a spin-5/2 Heisenberg triangle in a magnetic field, we model the corresponding quantum behavior of the molecular compound Fe$_3$. Our rigorous analysis employs various key metrics to explore a rich quantum behavior of this molecular compound. At sufficiently low temperatures, the bipartite negativity reveals that the pairwise entanglement between any pair of iron(III) magnetic ions of the molecular complex Fe$_3$ can be significantly enhanced by a small magnetic field. This enhancement is followed by unconventional step-like changes characterized by a sequence of plateaus and sudden downturns as the magnetic field further increases. A qualitatively similar behavior is also observed in the genuine tripartite entanglement among all three iron(III) magnetic ions in the trinuclear complex Fe$_3$. Notably, the bipartite and tripartite entanglement persist in the molecular complex Fe$_3$ up to moderate temperatures of approximately 30~K and 70~K, respectively. We also utilized a spin squeezing parameter to identify parameter regions of coherent, entangled, and squeezed states of the molecular compound Fe$_3$. Our findings demonstrate that the squeezed states, which are relevant for technological applications, can be achieved at temperatures below 15~K and magnetic fields under 25~T. Additionally, we demonstrate the achievement of quantum-enhanced sensitivity by initializing the molecular complex Fe$_3$ in Dicke states. Finally, we investigated a quantum-sensing protocol by applying a local magnetic field specifically to one iron(III) magnetic ion of the molecular compound Fe$_3$ and performing readout sequentially on one of two remaining iron(III) magnetic ions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00371v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In three dimensions, quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) transport has traditionally been associated with systems featuring a Q1D chain structure. Here, based on first-principle calculations, we go beyond this understanding to show that the Q1D transport can also be realized in certain three-dimensional (3D) altermagnetic (AM) metals with a topological nodal net in momentum space but lacking Q1D chain structure in real space, including the existing compounds $\beta$-Fe$_2$(PO$_4$)O, Co$_2$(PO$_4$)O, and LiTi$_2$O$_4$. These materials exhibit an AM ground state and feature an ideal crossed $Z^3$ Weyl nodal line in each spin channel around Fermi level, formed by three straight and flat nodal lines traversing the entire Brillouin zone. These nodal lines eventually lead to an AM $Z^3$ nodal net. Surprisingly, the electronic conductivity $\sigma_{xx}$ in these topological nodal net metals is dozens of times larger than $\sigma_{yy}$ and $\sigma_{zz}$ in the up-spin channel, while $\sigma_{yy}$ dominates transport in the down-spin channel. This suggests a distinctive Q1D transport signature in each spin channel, and the principal moving directions for the two spin channels are orthogonal, resulting in Q1D direction-dependent spin transport. This novel phenomenon cannot be found in both conventional 3D bulk materials and Q1D chain materials. In particular, the Q1D spin transport gradually disappears as the Fermi energy moves away from the nodal net, further confirming its topological origin. Our work not only enhances the comprehension of topological physics in altermagnets but also opens a new direction for the exploration of topological spintronics.</description>

      <title>Flexoelectricity in Amorphous Hafnium Oxide (HfO2)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flexoelectricity, inherent in all materials, offers a promising alternative to piezoelectricity for nanoscale actuation and sensing. However, its widespread application faces significant challenges: differentiating flexoelectric effects from those of piezoelectricity and other phenomena, verifying its universality across all material structures and thicknesses, and establishing a comprehensive database of flexoelectric coefficients across different materials. This work introduces a groundbreaking methodology that accurately isolates flexoelectricity from piezoelectric, electrostrictive and electrostatic effects, with a detection threshold extending below 1 fC/m. The robustness of this method is demonstrated through its application to amorphous hafnium oxide (HfO$_2$), successfully measuring a flexoelectric coefficient of 105 $\pm$ 10 pC/m. This measurement signifies the first measurement of flexoelectricity in hafnia, as well as in any amorphous material. Additionally, the study compiles a list of published flexoelectric coefficients, revealing an important insight. The relationship between the flexoelectric coefficient and the material's relative permittivity is better approximated by a quadratic proportionality. This challenges the traditional linear assumption proposed in Kogan's work and opens new avenues for future research in flexoelectric materials.</description>

      <title>Electron-phonon coupling and mobility modeling in organic semiconductors: method and application to tetracene polymorphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have developed a first-principles method to calculate the electron-phonon coupling for specific modes and q-points in the Brillouin Zone for crystalline organic semiconductors. Using the obtained coupling strengths, we propose an approach to compute the temperature-dependent mobilities of electrons and holes. This methodology is applied to both bulk and thin-film polymorphs of tetracene. To validate our treatment of the electronic structures and vibrational properties, we calculate the Raman spectra in the lattice-phonon region and compare them with experimental data. We then compare the computed mobilities with available data for single crystals, finding good agreement within the experimental range, especially when accounting for possible charged impurities. Finally, we discuss the observed differences between the polymorphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05413v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Floquet engineering with periodic driving as a powerful tool for designing desirable topological states has been the subject of intense recent studies. Here, we present the application of Floquet engineering to investigate evolution of topological triple fermions under irradiation of circularly polarized light (CPL), a phenomenon that currently remains a mystery. By using first-principles calculations and Floquet theorem, we demonstrate that WC-type TiO and its analogues are promising candidates for Floquet engineering of triple fermions. The symmetry analysis reveals that the electric field of CPL can break the specific symmetries, such as the time-reversal symmetry and its combination of spatial symmetries, inducing a transition to a flexibly controllable Weyl semimetallic phase. The survived spatial symmetry, controlled by light, guarantees that the Weyl nodes are located along the high-symmetry line or in high-symmetry planes in momentum space. Our findings focusing on Floquet engineering in realistic materials featured by triple fermions would facilitate both theoretical and experimental interest.</description>

      <title>Computing virtual dark-field X-ray microscopy images of complex discrete dislocation structures from large-scale molecular dynamics simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark-field X-ray Microscopy (DFXM) is a novel diffraction-based imaging technique that non-destructively maps the local deformation from crystalline defects in bulk materials. While studies have demonstrated that DFXM can spatially map 3D defect geometries, it is still challenging to interpret DFXM images of the high dislocation density systems relevant to macroscopic crystal plasticity. This work develops a scalable forward model to calculate virtual DFXM images for complex discrete dislocation (DD) structures obtained from atomistic simulations. Our new DD-DFXM model integrates a non-singular formulation for calculating the local strain from the DD structures and an efficient geometrical optics algorithm for computing the DFXM image from the strain. We apply the model to complex DD structures obtained from a large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of compressive loading on a single-crystal silicon. Simulated DFXM images exhibit prominent feature contrast for dislocations between the multiple slip systems, demonstrating the DFXM's potential to resolve features from dislocation multiplication. The integrated DD-DFXM model provides a toolbox for DFXM experimental design and image interpretation in the context of bulk crystal plasticity for the breadth of measurements across shock plasticity and the broader materials science community.</description>

      <title>Accurate DFT Simulation of Complex Functional Materials: Synergistic Enhancements Achieved by SCAN meta-GGA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex functional materials are characterized by intricate and competing bond orders, making them an excellent platform for evaluating the newly developed Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed (SCAN) density functional. In this study, we explore the effectiveness of SCAN in simulating the electronic properties of displacive ferroelectrics (BaTiO3 and PbTiO3) and magnetoelectric multiferroics (BiFeO3 and YMnO3), which encompass a broad spectrum of bonding characteristics. Due to a significant reduction in self-interaction error, SCAN manifests its improvements over the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) method in three aspects: SCAN produces more compact orbitals, predicts more accurate ionicity, and better captures orbital anisotropy. Particularly, these synergistic enhancements lead to notable phenomena in calculating the bandgap of YMnO3: while the PBE+U simulation may suggest a strong correlation appearance attributed to high Hubbard-like U values (~5 eV), the value is dramatically lower (~1 eV) in the SCAN+U method. Furthermore, we provide an intuitive analysis of SCAN's operational principles by examining the complex electron densities involved. These insights are theoretically intriguing and have practical implications, potentially encouraging wider adoption of SCAN in the computational modeling of complex functional materials.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Reward-Driven Image Segmentation in Automated Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automated experiments in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) require rapid image segmentation to optimize data representation for human interpretation, decision-making, site-selective spectroscopies, and atomic manipulation. Currently, segmentation tasks are typically performed using supervised machine learning methods, which require human-labeled data and are sensitive to out-of-distribution drift effects caused by changes in resolution, sampling, or beam shape. Here, we operationalize and benchmark a recently proposed reward-driven optimization workflow for on-the fly image analysis in STEM. This unsupervised approach is much more robust, as it does not rely on human labels and is fully explainable. The explanatory feedback can help the human to verify the decision making and potentially tune the model by selecting the position along the Pareto frontier of reward functions. We establish the timing and effectiveness of this method, demonstrating its capability for real-time performance in high-throughput and dynamic automated STEM experiments. The reward driven approach allows to construct explainable robust analysis workflows and can be generalized to a broad range of image analysis tasks in electron and scanning probe microscopy and chemical imaging.</description>

      <title>Variable Temperature and Carrier-Resolved Photo-Hall Measurements of High-Performance Selenium Thin-Film Solar Cells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Selenium is an elemental semiconductor with a wide bandgap suitable for a range of optoelectronic and solar energy conversion technologies. However, developing such applications requires an in-depth understanding of the fundamental material properties. Here, we study the properties of the majority and minority charge carriers in selenium using a recently developed carrier-resolved photo-Hall technique, which enables simultaneous mapping of the mobilities and concentrations of both carriers under varying light intensities. Additionally, we perform temperature-dependent Hall measurements to extract information about the acceptor level and ionization efficiency. Our findings are compared to results from other advanced characterization techniques, and the inconsistencies are outlined. Finally, we characterize a high-performance selenium thin-film solar cell and perform device simulations to systematically address each discrepancy and accurately reproduce experimental current-voltage and external quantum efficiency measurements. These results contribute to a deeper understanding of the optoelectronic properties and carrier dynamics in selenium, which may guide future improvements and facilitate the development of higher-efficiency selenium solar cells.</description>

      <title>Cornertronics in Two-Dimensional Second-Order Topological Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08384v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional electronic devices rely on the electron's intrinsic degrees of freedom (d.o.f.) to process information. However, additional d.o.f. like the valley, can emerge in the low-energy states of certain systems. Here, we show that the quantum dots (QDs) constructed from two-dimensional (2D) second-order topological insulators (SOTI) posses a new kind of d.o.f., namely corner freedom, related to the topological corner states that reside at different corners of the systems. Since the corner states are well separated in real space, they can be individually and intuitively manipulated, giving rise to the concept of cornertronics. Via symmetry analysis and material search, we identify the TiSiCO-family monolayers as the first prototype of cornertronics materials, where the corner states can be controlled by both electric and optical fields, due to novel corner-layer coupling (CLC) effect and corner-contrasted linear dichroism. Furthermore, we find that the band gap of the TiSiCO nanodisk lies in the terahertz region and is robust to size reduction. These results indicate that the TiSiCO nanodisks can be used to design terahertz devices with ultrasmall size and electric-field tunable band gap. Besides, the TiSiCO nanodisks are simultaneously sensitive to both the strength and polarization of the terahertz waves. Our findings not only pave the way for cornertronics, but also open a new direction for research in 2D SOTI, QD and terahertz electronics.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian skin effects in open spin systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15792v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), in which eigenstates exhibit localized behaviors at boundaries drastically different from the extended Bloch waves of Hermitian systems, is among the most scrutinized dissipative phenomena. The localization of the eigenstates at a system's edge hints at nonreciprocal transport towards the latter. In several open systems, non-Hermitian Hamiltonians are obtained as an approximation of Liouvillian dynamics by neglecting the quantum jump operators. However this approximation might lose critical information about timescales and conditions required for the nonreciprocal dynamics to manifest. We compare the dynamics governed by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with those described by the corresponding Liouvillians, identifying the conditions under which both approaches predict the skin effect at the same level. Our analyses uncover the consistency and limitation of non-Hermitian approaches and identify the key ingredients underlying the skin effect in open magnetic systems. Also, our results highlight the connection between the NHSE and the classical magnetization dynamics, suggesting that our predictions can be tested in multilayered magnetic structures with interlayer Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions (DMI).</description>

      <title>Data-driven Discovery for Robust Optimization of Semiconductor Nanowire Lasers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12643v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active wavelength-scale optoelectronic components are widely used in photonic integrated circuitry, however coherent sources of light -- namely optical lasers -- remain the most challenging component to integrate. Semiconductor nanowire lasers represent a flexible class of light source where each nanowire is both gain material and cavity; however, strong coupling between these properties and the performance leads to inhomogeneity across the population. While this has been studied and optimized for individual material systems, no architecture-wide insight is available. Here, nine nanowire laser material systems are studied and compared using 55,516 nanowire lasers to provide statistically robust insight into performance. These results demonstrate that, while it may be important to optimise internal quantum efficiency for certain materials, cavity effects are always critical. Our study provides a roadmap to optimize the performance of nanowire lasers made from any material: this can be achieved by ensuring a narrow spread of lengths and end-facet reflectivities.</description>

Abstract: A zero-magnetic-field Josephson diode effect (JDE) is observed in an asymmetric superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) mediated by Dirac semimetal Cd3As2. We argue that a phase coupling between the surface and bulk superconducting channels, a unique phenomenon recently identified in the observations of fractional Josephson effect and Leggett modes in Cd3As2, can break time reversal symmetry and therefore give rise to the zero-field JDE. Our results are anticipated to have important implications in superconducting electronic circuit applications.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Optical Polarization at Deep Microscopic Scales in Crystalline Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nanophotonics, the study of light-matter interaction at scales smaller than the wavelength of radiation, has widespread applications in plasmonic waveguiding, topological photonic crystals, super-lensing, solar absorbers, and infrared imaging. The physical phenomena governing these effects can be described using a macroscopic homogenized refractive index. However, the lattice-level description of optical polarization in a crystalline material using a quantum theory has been unresolved. Inspired by the dynamics of electron waves and their corresponding band structure, we propose a microscopic optical band theory of solids specifically applicable to optical polarization. This framework reveals propagating waves hidden deep within a crystal lattice. These hidden waves arise from crystal-optical-indices, a family of quantum functions obeying crystal symmetries, and cannot be described by the conventional concept of refractive index. We present for the first time - the hidden waves and deep microscopic optical band structure of 14 distinct materials. We choose Si, Ge, InAs, GaAs, CdTe, and others from Group IV, III-V, and II-VI due to their technological relevance but our framework can be extended to a wide range of emerging 2D and 3D materials. In contrast to the macroscopic refractive index of these materials used widely today, this framework shows that hidden waves exist throughout the crystal lattice and have unique optical polarization texture and crowding. We also present an open-source software package, Purdue-Picomax, for the research community to discover hidden waves in new materials like hBN, graphene, and Moire materials. Our work establishes a foundational crystallographic feature to discover novel deep microscopic optical waves in light-matter interaction.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for Analyzing Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) Images Generated from Polymer Blends</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present a new machine learning workflow with unsupervised learning techniques to identify domains within atomic force microscopy images obtained from polymer films. The goal of the workflow is to identify the spatial location of the two types of polymer domains with little to no manual intervention and calculate the domain size distributions which in turn can help qualify the phase separated state of the material as macrophase or microphase ordered or disordered domains. We briefly review existing approaches used in other fields, computer vision and signal processing that can be applicable for the above tasks that happen frequently in the field of polymer science and engineering. We then test these approaches from computer vision and signal processing on the AFM image dataset to identify the strengths and limitations of each of these approaches for our first task. For our first domain segmentation task, we found that the workflow using discrete Fourier transform or discrete cosine transform with variance statistics as the feature works the best. The popular ResNet50 deep learning approach from computer vision field exhibited relatively poorer performance in the domain segmentation task for our AFM images as compared to the DFT and DCT based workflows. For the second task, for each of 144 input AFM images, we then used an existing porespy python package to calculate the domain size distribution from the output of that image from DFT based workflow. The information and open source codes we share in this paper can serve as a guide for researchers in the polymer and soft materials fields who need ML modeling and workflows for automated analyses of AFM images from polymer samples that may have crystalline or amorphous domains, sharp or rough interfaces between domains, or micro or macrophase separated domains.</description>

Abstract: The realisation of an universal quantum computer will require the operation of thousands to millions of qubits. The possibility of using existing industrial semiconductor fabrication techniques and infrastructure for up-scaling and reproducibility makes silicon based spin qubits one of the most promising platforms to achieve this goal. The implementation of the up to now largest semiconductor based quantum processor was realized in a silicon/silicon-germanium heterostructure known for its low charge noise, long qubit coherence times and fast driving speeds, but the high structural complexity creates challenges for industrial implementations. Here we demonstrate quantum dots hosted in a natural Si/SiGe heterostructure fully fabricated by an industrial 300$\,$mm semiconductor wafer process line from heterostructure growth to Co micromagnet monolithic integration. We report charge noise values below 2$\,\mathrm{\mu eV/\sqrt{Hz}}$, spin relaxation times of over 1$\,$s and coherence times $T_2^*$ and $T_2^H$ of 1$\,\mathrm{\mu s}$ and 50$\,\mathrm{\mu s}$ respectively, for quantum wells grown using natural silicon. Further, we achieve Rabi frequencies up to 5$\,$MHz and single qubit gate fidelities above 99$\,\%$. In addition to scalability, the high reproducibility of the 300$\,$mm processes enables the deterministic study of qubit metric dependencies on process parameters, which is essential for optimising qubit quality.</description>
