      <title>Velocity Jumps for Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Velocity Jumps approach, denoted as JUMP, a new class of Molecular dynamics integrators, replacing the Langevin dynamics by a hybrid model combining a classical Langevin diffusion and a piecewise deterministic Markov process, where the expensive computation of long-range pairwise interactions is replaced by a resampling of the velocities at random times. This framework allows for an acceleration in the simulation speed while preserving sampling and dynamical properties such as the diffusion constant. It can also be integrated in classical multi-timestep methods, pushing further the computational speedup, while avoiding some of the resonance issues of the latter thanks to the random nature of jumps. The JUMP, JUMP-RESPA and JUMP-RESPA1 integrators have been implemented in the GPU-accelerated version of the Tinker-HP package and are shown to provide significantly enhanced performances compared to their BAOAB, BAOAB-RESPA and BAOAB-RESPA1 counterparts respectively.</description>

      <title>The impact of strain on the GeV-color center in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Color centers in diamond, such as the GeV center, are promising candidates for quantum-based applications. Here, we investigate the impact of strain on the zero-phonon line (ZPL) position of GeV$^0$. Both hydrostatic and linear strain are modeled using density functional theory for GeV$^0$ concentrations of $1.61$ \% down to $0.10$ \%. We present qualitative and quantitative differences between the two strain types: for hydrostatic tensile and compressive strain, red-and blue-shifted ZPL positions are expected, respectively, with a linear relation between the ZPL shift and the experienced stress. By calculating the ZPL shift for varying GeV$^0$ concentrations, a shift of $0.15$ nm/GPa ($0.38$ meV/GPa) is obtained at experimentally relevant concentrations using a hybrid functional. In contrast, only red-shifted ZPL are found for tensile and compressive linear strain along the $\langle100\rangle$ direction. The calculated ZPL shift exceeds that of hydrostatic strain by at least one order of magnitude, with a significant difference between tensile and compressive strains: $3.2$ and $4.8$ nm/GPa ($8.1$ and $11.7$ meV/GPa), respectively. In addition, a peak broadening is expected due to the lifted degeneracy of the GeV$^0$ $e_g$ state, calculated to be about $6$ meV/GPa. These calculated results are placed in perspective with experimental observations, showing values of ZPL shifts and splittings of comparable magnitude.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Patient-Specific Calibration via Differentiable Hemodynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the goals of personalized medicine is to tailor diagnostics to individual patients. Diagnostics are performed in practice by measuring quantities, called biomarkers, that indicate the existence and progress of a disease. In common cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension, biomarkers that are closely related to the clinical representation of a patient can be predicted using computational models. Personalizing computational models translates to considering patient-specific flow conditions, for example, the compliance of blood vessels that cannot be a priori known and quantities such as the patient geometry that can be measured using imaging. Therefore, a patient is identified by a set of measurable and nonmeasurable parameters needed to well-define a computational model; else, the computational model is not personalized, meaning it is prone to large prediction errors. Therefore, to personalize a computational model, sufficient information needs to be extracted from the data. The current methods by which this is done are either inefficient, due to relying on slow-converging optimization methods, or hard to interpret, due to using `black box` deep-learning algorithms. We propose a personalized diagnostic procedure based on a differentiable 0D-1D Navier-Stokes reduced order model solver and fast parameter inference methods that take advantage of gradients through the solver. By providing a faster method for performing parameter inference and sensitivity analysis through differentiability while maintaining the interpretability of well-understood mathematical models and numerical methods, the best of both worlds is combined. The performance of the proposed solver is validated against a well-established process on different geometries, and different parameter inference processes are successfully performed.</description>

      <title>A Novel Pseudo-Spectral Time-Domain Theory of Magnetic Neutron Scattering Illustrated Using A Uniformly Magnetized Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A universal numerical method is developed for the investigation of magnetic neutron scattering. By applying the pseudospectral-time-domain (PSTD) algorithm to the spinor version of the Schr\"odinger equation, the evolution of the spin-state of the scattered wave can be solved in full space and time. This extra spin degree of freedom brings some unique new features absent in the numerical theory on the scalar wave scatterings [1]. Different numerical stability condition has to be re-derived due to the coupling between the different spin states. As the simplest application, the neutron scattering by the magnetic field of a uniformly magnetized sphere is studied. The PSTD predictions are compared with those from the Born-approximation. This work not only provides a systematic tool for analyzing spin-matter interactions, but also builds the forward model for testing novel neutron imaging methodologies, such as the newly developed thermal neutron Fourier-transform ghost imaging.</description>

      <title>Persistent current in a non-Hermitian Hatano-Nelson ring: Disorder-induced amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal hopping induces a synthetic magnetic flux which leads to the non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm effect. Since non-Hermitian Hamiltonians possess both real and imaginary eigenvalues, this effect allows the observation of real and imaginary persistent currents in a ring threaded by the synthetic flux~\cite{nrh8}. Motivated by this, we investigate the behavior of persistent currents in a disordered Hatano-Nelson ring with anti-Hermitian intradimer hopping. The disorder is diagonal and we explore three distinct models, namely the Aubry-Andr\'{e}-Harper model, the Fibonacci model, both representing correlated disorder, and an uncorrelated (random) model. We conduct a detailed analysis of the energy spectrum and examine the real and imaginary parts of the persistent current under various conditions such as different ring sizes and filling factors. Interestingly, we find that real and imaginary persistent currents exhibit amplification in the presence of correlated disorder. This amplification is also observed in certain individual random configurations but vanishes after configuration averaging. Additionally, we observe both diamagnetic and paramagnetic responses in the current behavior and investigate aspects of persistent currents in the absence of disorder that have not been previously explored. Interestingly, we find that the intradimer bonds host only imaginary currents, while the interdimer bonds carry only real currents.</description>

      <title>Taming Landau level mixing in fractional quantum Hall states with deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong correlation brings a rich array of emergent phenomena, as well as a daunting challenge to theoretical physics study. In condensed matter physics, the fractional quantum Hall effect is a prominent example of strong correlation, with Landau level mixing being one of the most challenging aspects to address using traditional computational methods. Deep learning real-space neural network wavefunction methods have emerged as promising architectures to describe electron correlations in molecules and materials, but their power has not been fully tested for exotic quantum states. In this work, we employ real-space neural network wavefunction techniques to investigate fractional quantum Hall systems. On both $1/3$ and $2/5$ filling systems, we achieve energies consistently lower than exact diagonalization results which only consider the lowest Landau level. We also demonstrate that the real-space neural network wavefunction can naturally capture the extent of Landau level mixing up to a very high level, overcoming the limitations of traditional methods. Our work underscores the potential of neural networks for future studies of strongly correlated systems and opens new avenues for exploring the rich physics of the fractional quantum Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Graph-neural-network predictions of solid-state NMR parameters from spherical tensor decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a powerful spectroscopic technique that is sensitive to the local atomic structure of matter. Computational predictions of NMR parameters can help to interpret experimental data and validate structural models, and machine learning (ML) has emerged as an efficient route to making such predictions. Here, we systematically study graph-neural-network approaches to representing and learning tensor quantities for solid-state NMR -- specifically, the anisotropic magnetic shielding and the electric field gradient. We assess how the numerical accuracy of different ML models translates into prediction quality for experimentally relevant NMR properties: chemical shifts, quadrupolar coupling constants, tensor orientations, and even static 1D spectra. We apply these ML models to a structurally diverse dataset of amorphous SiO$_2$ configurations, spanning a wide range of density and local order, to larger configurations beyond the reach of traditional first-principles methods, and to the dynamics of the $\alpha\unicode{x2013}\beta$ inversion in cristobalite. Our work marks a step toward streamlining ML-driven NMR predictions for both static and dynamic behavior of complex materials, and toward bridging the gap between first-principles modeling and real-world experimental data.</description>

      <title>Multipartite Entanglement Routing as a Hypergraph Immersion Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multipartite entanglement, linking multiple nodes simultaneously, is a higher-order correlation that offers advantages over pairwise connections in quantum networks (QNs). Creating reliable, large-scale multipartite entanglement requires entanglement routing, a process that combines local, short-distance connections into a long-distance connection, which can be considered as a transformation of network topology. Here, we address the question of whether a QN can be topologically transformed into another via entanglement routing. Our key result is an exact mapping from multipartite entanglement routing to Nash-Williams's graph immersion problem, extended to hypergraphs. This generalized hypergraph immersion problem introduces a partial order between QN topologies, permitting certain topological transformations while precluding others, offering discerning insights into the design and manipulation of higher-order network topologies in QNs.</description>

      <title>Latent Ewald summation for machine learning of long-range interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15165v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) often neglect long-range interactions, such as electrostatic and dispersion forces. In this work, we introduce a straightforward and efficient method to account for long-range interactions by learning a latent variable from local atomic descriptors and applying an Ewald summation to this variable. We demonstrate that in systems including charged and polar molecular dimers, bulk water, and water-vapor interface, standard short-ranged MLIPs can lead to unphysical predictions even when employing message passing. The long-range models effectively eliminate these artifacts, with only about twice the computational cost of short-range MLIPs.</description>

      <title>Boundaries of universality of thermal collisions for atom-atom scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermal rate coefficients for some atomic collisions have been observed to be remarkably independent of the details of interatomic interactions at short range. This makes these rate coefficients universal functions of the long-range interaction parameters and masses, which was previously exploited to develop a self-defining atomic sensor for ambient pressure. Here, we employ rigorous quantum scattering calculations to examine the response of thermally averaged rate coefficients for atom-atom collisions to changes in the interaction potentials. We perform a comprehensive analysis of the universality, and the boundaries thereof, by treating the quantum scattering observables as probabilistic predictions determined by a distribution of interaction potentials. We show that there is a characteristic change of the resulting distributions of rate coefficients, separating light, few-electron atoms and heavy, polarizable atoms. We produce diagrams that illustrate the boundaries of the thermal collision universality at different temperatures and provide guidance for future experiments seeking to exploit the universality.</description>

      <title>Conditioned quantum-assisted deep generative surrogate for particle-calorimeter interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22870v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Particle collisions at accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider, recorded and analyzed by experiments such as ATLAS and CMS, enable exquisite measurements of the Standard Model and searches for new phenomena. Simulations of collision events at these detectors have played a pivotal role in shaping the design of future experiments and analyzing ongoing ones. However, the quest for accuracy in Large Hadron Collider (LHC) collisions comes at an imposing computational cost, with projections estimating the need for millions of CPU-years annually during the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) run \cite{collaboration2022atlas}. Simulating a single LHC event with \textsc{Geant4} currently devours around 1000 CPU seconds, with simulations of the calorimeter subdetectors in particular imposing substantial computational demands \cite{rousseau2023experimental}. To address this challenge, we propose a conditioned quantum-assisted deep generative model. Our model integrates a conditioned variational autoencoder (VAE) on the exterior with a conditioned Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) in the latent space, providing enhanced expressiveness compared to conventional VAEs. The RBM nodes and connections are meticulously engineered to enable the use of qubits and couplers on D-Wave's Pegasus-structured \textit{Advantage} quantum annealer (QA) for sampling. We introduce a novel method for conditioning the quantum-assisted RBM using \textit{flux biases}. We further propose a novel adaptive mapping to estimate the effective inverse temperature in quantum annealers. The effectiveness of our framework is illustrated using Dataset 2 of the CaloChallenge \cite{calochallenge}.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional quantum dynamics with explicitly correlated Gaussian wave packets using Rothe's method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a previous publication [J. Chem. Phys., 161, 044105 (2024)], it has been shown that Rothe's method can be used to solve the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation (TDSE) for the hydrogen atom in a strong laser field using time-dependent Gaussian wave packets. Here, we generalize these results, showing that Rothe's method can propagate arbitrary numbers of thawed, complex-valued, explicitly correlated Gaussian functions (ECGs) with dense correlation matrices for systems with varying dimensionality. We consider the multidimensional Henon-Heiles potential, and show that the dynamics can be quantitatively reproduced using only 30 Gaussians in 2D, and that accurate spectra can be obtained using 20 Gaussians in 2D and 30 to 40 Gaussians in 3D and 4D. Thus, the relevant multidimensional dynamics can be described at high quality using only a small number of ECGs that give a very compact representation of the wave function. This efficient representation, along with the demonstrated ability of Rothe's method to propagate Gaussian wave packets in strong fields and ECGs in complex potentials, paves the way for accurate molecular dynamics calculations beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation in strong fields.</description>

      <title>A flexible framework for large-scale FDTD simulations: open-source inverse design for 3D nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an efficient open-source python package for the inverse design of three-dimensional photonic nanostructures using the Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) method. Leveraging a flexible reverse-mode automatic differentiation implementation, our software enables gradient-based optimization over large simulation volumes. Gradient computation is implemented within the JAX framework and based on the property of time reversibility in Maxwell's equations. This approach significantly reduces computational time and memory requirements compared to traditional FDTD methods. Gradient-based optimization facilitates the automatic creation of intricate three-dimensional structures with millions of design parameters, which would be infeasible to design manually. We demonstrate the scalability of the solver from single to multiple GPUs through several inverse design examples, highlighting its robustness and performance in large-scale photonic simulations. In addition, the package features an object-oriented and user-friendly API that simplifies the specification of materials, sources, and constraints. Specifically, it allows for intuitive positioning and sizing of objects in absolute or relative coordinates within the simulation scene. By rapid specification of the desired design properties and rapid optimization within the given user constraints, this open-source framework aims to accelerate innovation in photonic inverse design. It yields a powerful and accessible computational tool for researchers, applicable in a wide range of use cases, including but not limited to photonic waveguides, active devices, and photonic integrated circuits.</description>
