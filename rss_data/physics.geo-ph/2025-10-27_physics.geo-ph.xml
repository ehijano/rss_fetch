      <title>Method for restoring the orientation of ocean bottom seismometers using distant earthquakes records</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A method is presented for determining the vertical direction relative to the axes of seismometers installed in seafloor observatories. The method is based on the linear relationship between the vertical component of seafloor acceleration and pressure variations at the ocean bottom, which follows directly from Newton's second law and holds within the frequency range of forced oscillations. The method's performance was validated using data from ocean bottom seismometers (accelerometers) and pressure gauges of six S-net stations during three seismic events: Gulf of Alaska Mw 7.9 (23.01.2018), Chignik Mw 8.2 (29.07.2021) and Noto Mw 7.5 (01.01.2024). The results were compared with an independent alternative method, showing discrepancies within 1 degree for most stations. A key advantage of the proposed method is its applicability not only to accelerometers but as well to velocimeters.</description>

      <title>Biotic Control of Earth's Climate: An Ecohydrological Perspective on the Phanerozoic Temperature Record</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a unified framework linking silicate weathering feedbacks, ecohydrological optimality and vegetation-climate interactions to explain Earth's Global Average Temperature evolution over the Phanerozoic. The framework integrates two complementary processes: (i) solute-transport-limited weathering, which governs long-term carbon sequestration, and (ii) ecohydrological optimality, which constrains vegetation productivity through the balance between water availability and carbon uptake. Together, these processes establish two emergent climatic thresholds, around 15 {\deg}C and 33 {\deg}C, that define a stable corridor for the Earth system. Below 15 {\deg}C, declining evapotranspiration and rising albedo accelerate cooling; above 33 {\deg}C, heat and water stress suppress vegetation and limit further warming. Analysis of ten independent studies (2019-2024) confirms the recurrent appearance of these thresholds in both modern ecosystems and Phanerozoic temperature reconstructions. Major biological innovations, such as the colonization of land by plants, the rise of forests, and the emergence of $C_4$ photosynthesis, have reorganized these feedbacks, repeatedly shifting the planet between quasi-stable climate states. The resulting picture is one in which the biosphere acts as an active regulator of climate, modulating and at times overriding geochemical feedbacks. This framework unifies climate, tectonics, and life into a single ecohydrological system, offering a coherent explanation for the bounded variability of Earth's temperature across 500 million years and insight into its future resilience. This perspective challenges the view of life as a passive climate responder, positioning the biosphere as an active regulator. Understanding these self-stabilizing mechanisms offers critical insight into how Earth might respond, or fail to respond, to ongoing human-driven climate perturbations.</description>

      <title>Surface layers and linearized water waves: a boundary integral equation framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of surface waves traveling along the boundary of a liquid medium are changed by the presence of floating plates and membranes, contributing to a number of important phenomena in a wide range of applications. Mathematically, if the fluid is only partly covered by a plate or membrane, the order of derivatives of the surface-boundary conditions jump between regions of the surface. In this work, we consider a general class of problems for infinite depth linearized surface waves in which the plate or membrane has a compact hole or multiple holes. For this class of problems, we describe a general integral equation approach, and for two important examples, the partial membrane and the polynya, we analyze the resulting boundary integral equations. In particular, we show that they are Fredholm second kind and discuss key properties of their solutions. We develop flexible and fast algorithms for discretizing and solving these equations, and demonstrate their robustness and scalability in resolving surface wave phenomena through several numerical examples.</description>

      <title>The influence of a stably stratified layer on the hydromagnetic waves in the Earth's core and their electromagnetic torques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evidence from seismic studies, mineral physics, thermal evolution models and geomagnetic observations is inconclusive about the presence of a stably stratified layer at the top of the Earth's fluid outer core. Such a convectively stable layer could have a strong influence on the internal fluid waves propagating underneath the core-mantle boundary (CMB) that are used to probe the outermost region of the core through the wave interaction with the geomagnetic field and the rotation of the mantle. Here, we numerically investigate the effect of a top stable layer on the outer core fluid waves by calculating the eigenmodes in a neutrally stratified sphere permeated by a magnetic field with and without a top stable layer. We use a numerical model, assuming a flow with an m-fold azimuthal symmetry, that allows for radial motions across the lower boundary of the stable layer and angular momentum exchanges across the CMB through viscous and electromagnetic coupling. On interannual time-scales, we find torsional Alfv\'en waves that are only marginally affected by weak to moderate stratification strength in the outer layer. At decadal time-scales similarly weak stable layers promote the appearance of waves that propagate primarily within the stable layer itself and resemble Magneto-Archimedes-Coriolis (MAC) waves, even though they interact with the adiabatic fluid core below. These waves can exert viscous and electromagnetic torques on the mantle that are several orders of magnitude larger than those in the neutrally stratified case.</description>

      <title>Robust acoustic and elastic full waveform inversion by adaptive Tikhonov-TV regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Full Waveform Inversion (FWI) is a powerful wave-based imaging technique, but its inherent ill-posedness and non-convexity lead to local minima and poor convergence. Regularization methods stabilize FWI by incorporating prior information and enforcing structural constraints like smooth variations or piecewise-constant behavior. Among them, Tikhonov regularization promotes smoothness, while total variation (TV) regularization preserves sharp boundaries. However, in the context of FWI, we highlight two key shortcomings of these regularization methods. First, subsurface model parameters (P- and S-wave velocities, density) often exhibit complex geological formations with sharp discontinuities separating distinct layers, while parameters within each layer vary smoothly. Neither Tikhonov nor TV regularization alone can effectively constrain such piecewise-smooth structures. Second, and more critically, when the initial model is far from the true model, these regularization assumptions can lead to a local minimum. To address these issues, we propose adaptive Tikhonov-TV (TT) regularization, which decomposes the model into smooth and blocky components, enabling robust recovery of piecewise-smooth structures. Implemented within the ADMM framework, TT regularization incorporates an automated balancing strategy based on robust statistical analysis. Numerical experiments on acoustic and elastic FWI using benchmark geological models demonstrate that TT regularization significantly improves convergence and reconstruction accuracy compared to Tikhonov and TV regularization when applied separately. We show that for complex models and remote initial models, both Tikhonov and TV regularization tend to converge to local minima, whereas TT regularization effectively mitigates cycle skipping through its adaptive combination of the two regularization strategies.</description>

      <title>DASPack: Controlled Data Compression for Distributed Acoustic Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present DASPack, a high-performance, open-source compression tool specifically designed for distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) data. As DAS becomes a key technology for real-time, high-density, and long-range monitoring in fields such as geophysics, infrastructure surveillance, and environmental sensing, the volume of collected data is rapidly increasing. Large-scale DAS deployments already generate hundreds of terabytes and are expected to increase in the coming years, making long-term storage a major challenge. Despite this urgent need, few compression methods have proven to be both practical and scalable in real-world scenarios. DASPack is a fully operational solution that consistently outperforms existing techniques for DAS data. It enables both controlled lossy and lossless compression by allowing users to choose the maximum absolute difference per datum between the original and compressed data. The compression pipeline combines wavelet transforms, linear predictive coding, and entropy coding to optimise efficiency. Our method achieves up to 3x file size reductions for strain and strain rate data in lossless mode across diverse datasets. In lossy mode, compression improves to 6x with near-perfect signal fidelity, and up to 10x is reached with acceptable signal degradation. It delivers fast throughput (100-200 MB/s using a single-thread and up to 750 MB/s using 8-threads), enabling real-time deployment even under high data rates. We validated its performance on 15 datasets from a variety of acquisition environments, demonstrating its speed, robustness, and broad applicability. DASPack provides a practical foundation for long-term, sustainable DAS data management in large-scale monitoring networks.</description>

      <title>WaveCastNet: Rapid Wavefield Forecasting for Earthquake Early Warning via Deep Sequence to Sequence Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new deep learning model, WaveCastNet, to forecast high-dimensional wavefields. WaveCastNet integrates a convolutional long expressive memory architecture into a sequence-to-sequence forecasting framework, enabling it to model long-term dependencies and multiscale patterns in both space and time. By sharing weights across spatial and temporal dimensions, WaveCastNet requires significantly fewer parameters than more resource-intensive models such as transformers, resulting in faster inference times. Crucially, WaveCastNet also generalizes better than transformers to rare and critical seismic scenarios, such as high-magnitude earthquakes. Here, we show the ability of the model to predict the intensity and timing of destructive ground motions in real time, using simulated data from the San Francisco Bay Area. Furthermore, we demonstrate its zero-shot capabilities by evaluating WaveCastNet on real earthquake data. Our approach does not require estimating earthquake magnitudes and epicenters, steps that are prone to error in conventional methods, nor does it rely on empirical ground-motion models, which often fail to capture strongly heterogeneous wave propagation effects.</description>

      <title>The mantle-inner core gravitational mode of oscillation in a strong magnetic field regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mantle-inner core gravitational (MICG) mode is the free mode axial oscillation between the mantle and inner core sustained by the gravitational torque between their degree 2 order 2 density structures. Here, we investigate how the MICG mode is affected by oscillations of cylindrical surfaces in the fluid outer core in the form of Alfv\'en waves. The latter are triggered by oscillations of the tangent cylinder (TC) moving jointly with the inner core and propagate away from the rotation axis. We show that the MICG mode remains a distinct normal mode of oscillation of the core-mantle system only when the triggered Alfv\'en waves are attenuated before they traverse the width of the fluid core. For an internal magnetic field strength of a few mT, as we expect in Earth's core, Alfv\'en waves can readily traverse the width of the core, and the MICG mode is absorbed into the spectrum of torsional oscillation (TO) modes. The MICG period retains a dynamical influence, acting as a point of resonance for TO modes, and marking the transition from a TO mode in which the motion of the TC (including the inner core) is weakly impacted by gravitational coupling to one in which the oscillating motion of the TC is strongly restricted. Our results imply that the observed 6-year periodic signal in the length of day cannot be interpreted as the signature of the MICG mode and must instead be caused by TO modes, or more generally, by the propagation of Alfv\'en waves.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Modeling and Upscaling of Hydrodynamic Transport in Geological Fractures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Characterizing hydrodynamic transport in fractured rocks is essential for carbon storage and geothermal energy production. Multiscale heterogeneities lead to anomalous solute transport, with breakthrough-curve (BTC) tailing and nonlinear growth of plume moments. We study purely advective transport in synthetic fractures with prescribed relative closure $ \sigma_a/\langle a \rangle $ and correlation length $ L_c $. For each geometry we generate multiple realizations and solve steady, depth-averaged Stokes flow under the lubrication approximation. Flow heterogeneity persists up to $ L_c $. The ensemble-averaged velocity PDFs are insensitive to $ L_c $ but strongly affected by $ \sigma_a/\langle a \rangle $, particularly their low-velocity power-law scaling. A time-domain random walk (TDRW) yields plume moments and outlet BTCs: the mean longitudinal position grows linearly in time, while the variance shows early ballistic scaling and a late-time regime controlled by the low-velocity power law with exponent $ \alpha $, which depends on $ \sigma_a/\langle a \rangle $. BTC properties, including peak broadening and tail scaling, are likewise governed by $ \alpha $. We further model advection with a one-dimensional continuous-time random walk (CTRW) that uses only the velocity PDF, flow tortuosity, and $ L_c $. CTRW results closely match TDRW and enable analytical predictions of asymptotic transport scalings.</description>
