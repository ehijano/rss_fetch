      <title>Selecting ChIP-Seq Normalization Methods from the Perspective of their Technical Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chromatin immunoprecipitation, followed by high throughput sequencing provides vital insights into locations on the genome with differential DNA occupancy between experimental states. However, since ChIP-Seq data is collected experimentally, it must be normalized between samples in order to properly assess which genomic regions have differential DNA occupancy via differential binding analysis. While between-sample normalization is a crucial for downstream differential binding analysis, the technical conditions underlying between-sample ChIP-Seq normalization methods have yet to be specifically examined. We identify three important technical conditions underlying ChIP-Seq between-sample normalization methods: symmetric differential DNA occupancy, equal total DNA occupancy, and equal background binding across experimental states. We categorize popular ChIP-Seq normalization methods based on their technical conditions and simulate ChIP-Seq read count data to exemplify the importance of satisfying a normalization method's technical conditions to downstream differential binding analysis. We assess the similarity between normalization methods in experimental CUT&amp;RUN data to externally verify our simulation findings. Our simulation and experimental results underscore that satisfying the technical conditions underlying the selected between-sample normalization methods is crucial to conducting biologically meaningful downstream differential binding analysis. We suggest that researchers use their understanding of the ChIP-Seq experiment at hand to guide their choice of between-sample normalization method when possible. Researchers could use the intersection of the differentially bound peaksets derived from different normalization methods to determine which regions have differential DNA occupancy between experimental states when there is uncertainty about which technical conditions are met.</description>

      <title>METAGENE-1: Metagenomic Foundation Model for Pandemic Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We pretrain METAGENE-1, a 7-billion-parameter autoregressive transformer model, which we refer to as a metagenomic foundation model, on a novel corpus of diverse metagenomic DNA and RNA sequences comprising over 1.5 trillion base pairs. This dataset is sourced from a large collection of human wastewater samples, processed and sequenced using deep metagenomic (next-generation) sequencing methods. Unlike genomic models that focus on individual genomes or curated sets of specific species, the aim of METAGENE-1 is to capture the full distribution of genomic information present within this wastewater, to aid in tasks relevant to pandemic monitoring and pathogen detection. We carry out byte-pair encoding (BPE) tokenization on our dataset, tailored for metagenomic sequences, and then pretrain our model. In this paper, we first detail the pretraining dataset, tokenization strategy, and model architecture, highlighting the considerations and design choices that enable the effective modeling of metagenomic data. We then show results of pretraining this model on our metagenomic dataset, providing details about our losses, system metrics, and training stability over the course of pretraining. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of METAGENE-1, which achieves state-of-the-art results on a set of genomic benchmarks and new evaluations focused on human-pathogen detection and genomic sequence embedding, showcasing its potential for public health applications in pandemic monitoring, biosurveillance, and early detection of emerging health threats.</description>

      <title>Origin of $\alpha$-satellite repeat arrays from mitochondrial molecular fossils -- sequential insertion, expansion, and evolution in the nuclear genome</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alpha satellite DNA is large tandem arrays of 150-400 bp units, and its origin remains an evolutionary mystery. In this research, we identified 1,545 alpha-satellite-like (SatL) repeat units in the nuclear genome of jewel wasp Nasonia vitripennis. Among them, thirty-nine copies of SatL were organized in two palindromic arrays in mitochondria, resulting in a 50% increase in the genome size. Strikingly, genomic neighborhood analyses of 1,516 nuclear SatL repeats revealed that they are located in NuMT (nuclear mitochondrial DNA) regions, and SatL phylogeny matched perfectly with mitochondrial genes and NuMT pseudogenes. These results support that SatL arrays originated from ten independent mitochondria insertion events into the nuclear genome within the last 500,000 years, after divergence from its sister species N. giraulti. Dramatic repeat GC-percent elevation (from 33.9% to 50.4%) is a hallmark of rapid SatL sequence evolution in mitochondria due to GC-biased gene conversion facilitated by the palindromic sequence pairing of the two mitochondrial SatL arrays. The nuclear SatL repeat arrays underwent substantial copy number expansion, from 12-15 (SatL1) to over 400 copies (SatL4). The oldest SatL4B array consists of four types of repeat units derived from deletions in the AT-rich region of ancestral repeats, and complex high-order structures have evolved through duplications. We also discovered similar repeat insertions into the nuclear genome of Muscidifurax, suggesting this mechanism can be common in insects. This is the first report of the mitochondrial origin of nuclear satellite sequences, and our findings shed new light on the origin and evolution of satellite DNA.</description>

      <title>iTARGET: Interpretable Tailored Age Regression for Grouped Epigenetic Traits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately predicting chronological age from DNA methylation patterns is crucial for advancing biological age estimation. However, this task is made challenging by Epigenetic Correlation Drift (ECD) and Heterogeneity Among CpGs (HAC), which reflect the dynamic relationship between methylation and age across different life stages. To address these issues, we propose a novel two-phase algorithm. The first phase employs similarity searching to cluster methylation profiles by age group, while the second phase uses Explainable Boosting Machines (EBM) for precise, group-specific prediction. Our method not only improves prediction accuracy but also reveals key age-related CpG sites, detects age-specific changes in aging rates, and identifies pairwise interactions between CpG sites. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms traditional epigenetic clocks and machine learning models, offering a more accurate and interpretable solution for biological age estimation with significant implications for aging research.</description>
