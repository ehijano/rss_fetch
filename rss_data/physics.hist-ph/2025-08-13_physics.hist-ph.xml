      <title>One Plus One Equals Two Ones: On Identity, Aggregation, and Counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A childhood observation of Thakur Anukulchandra that "one and one can only be two ones, not simply two" motivates a precise inquiry: what, exactly, is asserted when we pass from two concrete individuals to the numeral "2"? This paper does not challenge the arithmetic theorem 1+1=2, but rather analyzes what this equation means when applied to physical objects. We answer with two complementary, rigorous treatments. Mathematician's proof. We model aggregation by the free commutative monoid of multisets M(U) over a universe of individuals U, so that delta_a + delta_b literally encodes two ones with individuality preserved. Numerals arise only after a declared classification q:U-&gt;T (coarse-graining) via the pushforward q*:M(U)-&gt;M(T) and the unique counting homomorphism to N. The non-injectivity of q* isolates the exact locus of information loss. Physicist's proof. We represent physical systems by worldtubes, states, and observables, and define a composite operation that preserves labelled constituents. We prove the Non-Identity Addition Theorem: A+B = X+X iff A=B=X; hence a pair of distinct objects cannot equal a doubled copy. The numeral "2" appears only as the readout of a typed count observable after an explicit classification, not as a statement of physical identity. Conclusion. In reality, one plus one is two ones; "1+1=2" is the value of a counting map applied after coarse graining. This clarifies the separation between identity-preserving aggregation and counting, reconciles everyday arithmetic with physical non-identity, and makes explicit the modeling choice that every act of counting entails. Our analysis has implications for the philosophy of mathematics, measurement theory, and information theoretic approaches to classification.</description>

      <title>The Birth of Quantum Mechanics: A Historical Study Through the Canonical Papers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13630v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the historical development of the theory of quantum mechanics between 1900 and 1927 by chronological examination of the foundational papers and ideas. Beginning with Planck's introduction of energy quantisation in blackbody radiation, we follow the emergence of Einstein's light quanta hypothesis, Bohr's atomic model, and the statistical implications of indistinguishable particles. Special emphasis is placed on the transition from the Old Quantum Theory to modern quantum mechanics, particularly through Heisenberg's matrix mechanics and Schr\"{o}dinger's wave mechanics. This study aims to provide a structured historical account, offering insights into the conceptual transformations that led to quantum mechanics while making the development accessible to physicists, historians of science, and advanced students interested in the origins of modern quantum theory.</description>
