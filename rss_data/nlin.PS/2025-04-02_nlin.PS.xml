      <title>Tensorial symmetries and optical lattice thermalization</title>

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive and systematic study of the possible connection between thermalization of cubic nonlinear lattices with nearest-neighbor coupling and the structure of the mixing tensor that arises due to the presence of nonlinearities. The approach is based on rewriting the underlying lattice system as a nonlinear evolution equation governing the dynamics of the modal amplitudes (or projection coefficients). In this formulation, the linear coupling become diagonalizable, whereas all cubic nonlinear terms transform into a combinatorial sum over a product of three modal amplitudes weighted by a fourth-order mixing tensor. We have identified the exact structure of several mixing tensors (corresponding to different types of cubic nonlinearities) and tied their symmetry properties (quasi-Hermiticity and permutation symmetries associated with two lattice conservation laws) with thermalization or lack thereof. Furthermore, we have observed through direct numerical simulations that the modal occupancies of lattices preserving these tensorial symmetries approach a Rayleigh-Jeans distribution at thermal equilibrium. In addition, we provided few examples that indicate that cubic lattices with broken tensorial symmetries end up not to equilibrate to a Rayleigh-Jeans distribution. Finally, an inverse approach to the study of thermalization of cubic nonlinear lattices is developed. It establishes a duality property between lattices in local and modal bases. The idea is to establish a trade-off between the type of nonlinearities in local base and their respective interactions in supermode base. With this at hand, we were able to identify a large class of nonlinear lattices that are embedded in the modal space and admit a simple form that can be used to shed more light on the role that localization (or delocalization) of the supermodes play in thermalization processes.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary theory of convective organization</title>

Abstract: The conceptual landscape of convection has two simple gateways: optimal function and random form. Optimal convection adjusts toward a univariate ideal called neutrality. Convection form involves elements (parcels, bubbles, drafts) whose most parsimonious assumption is random. Between these gates lies a wilderness of realizable flow configurations. The only simple principle is natural selection by fitness, a scalar whose gradient is a local direction in an abstract configuration space. Random or high-entropy patterns occupy most of configuration space and occur spontaneously. With time, convection can discover less facile but more efficient (organized) configurations, by sequential selection. Here two data exercises explore that self-organization process, in shallow and deep moist convection. For shallow convection, causal network postulates are explored in a large set of cyclic-domain large-eddy simulations (LES; the Cloud Botany set). When an evolutionary pathway (mainly layer deepening in these simulations) leads to precipitation, mesoscale patterns blossom rapidly. For deep convection, expanding rings of conditional cell probability around prior cells are estimated from satellite imagery over South America and the South Pacific. In a Monte Carlo model iterating such a conditional probability kernel, hundreds of hourly cells take days to discover a self-sustaining squall configuration the kernel affords. Larger-scale implications include overshoots (redefinition of neutrality) and tens-of-hours timescales to both adjustment and noise (indeterminacy). If functional organization can be inferred from horizontal patterns, the abundance of horizontal texture information in satellite cloud imagery could find quantitative value.</description>
