      <title>Nonreciprocity in transmission mode with planar structures for arbitrarily polarized light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Approaching thermodynamic limits in light harvesting requires enabling nonreciprocal thermal emission. The majority of previously reported nonreciprocal thermal emitters operate in reflection mode, following original proposals by M. Green and others. In these proposals, cascaded nonreciprocal junctions that re-direct each junction's emission towards a subsequent one are employed for efficient light-harvesting. Recently, simplified concepts have been proposed in solar photovoltaics and thermophotovoltaics that leverage the concept of tandem junctions to approach thermodynamic limits. In these simplified scenarios, polarization-independent nonreciprocal response in transmission mode is required. We propose a pattern-free heterostructure that enables such functionality, using a magneto-optical material embedded between two dissimilar dielectric layers.</description>

      <title>Extreme electron-photon interaction in perovskite glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction of light with solids can be dramatically enhanced owing to electron-photon momentum matching. This mechanism is driven by either quantum confinement or long-range structural correlations in media with crystal-liquid duality. In this paper, we address a new strategy based on both phenomena for enhancement of the light-matter interaction in a direct bandgap semiconductor - lead halide perovskite CsPbBr$_3$ - by using electric pulse-driven structural disorder. The disordered (glassy) state allows the generation of confined photons, and the formation of an electronic continuum of static/dynamic defect states across the forbidden gap (Urbach bridge). Both mechanisms underlie photon-momentum-enabled electronic Raman scattering (ERS) and single-photon anti-Stokes photoluminescence (PL) under sub-band pump. PL/ERS blinking is discussed to be associated with thermal fluctuations of cross-linked [PbBr$_6$]$^{4-}$ octahedra. Time-delayed synchronization of PL/ERS blinking causes enhanced spontaneous emission at room temperature. Our findings indicate the role of photon momentum in enhanced light-matter interactions in disordered and nanostructured solids.</description>

      <title>Complex Permittivity Characterization of Low-Loss Dielectric Slabs at Sub-THz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This manuscript presents a novel method for characterizing the permittivities of low-loss dielectric slabs in sub-terahertz (sub-THz) frequencies, specifically above 100 GHz using a quasi-optical system. The algorithm is introduced with detailed derivations, and the measurement sensitivity is analyzed through simulations. Subsequently, the method's validity is established via simulations, demonstrating high accuracy (error 0.1% for the loss tangent) for a 30 mm thick plate material and relatively lower accuracy (error &lt;5% for the loss tangent) for a 6 mm thick plate material. Notably, this accuracy surpasses that of the approach presented in [1] when the same window width is used to extract signals. Furthermore, a comparison between the permittivities of plexiglass with a 30 mm thickness characterized by the proposed method and the approach in [1] reveals a maximum difference in the dielectric constant of 0.011 and in loss tangent of 0.00071 from 140 to 220 GHz. Finally, the relative complex permittivities of plexiglass at 142.86 GHz obtained by both methods are compared with the reference values provided in [2], exhibiting differences of 0.06 in the dielectric constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply in simulation a reservoir computer based on evanescently coupled GaAs microrings for real-time compensation of a nonlinear distortion of a 50 Gbaud 16-QAM signal with the launch power up to 12 dBm in a standard single-mode optical fibre. We clearly evidence the crucial role of fast nonlinear response in enabling all-optical signal recovery in real time. With our system we are able to reduce the signal error rate below the forward error correction limit for a 20 km fibre and 12 dBm launch power.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the capabilities of a novel frequency-domain terahertz spectrometer based on a comb-locked frequency synthesizer, which provides absolute frequency calibration. The inherent stability and repeatability of the scans allow for the combination of fast data acquisition with an average time-limited signal-to-noise ratio. We demonstrate kilohertz level frequency resolution in terahertz precision spectroscopy of ultrahigh quality whispering-gallery-mode resonators. Spectra covering multiple free spectral ranges (&gt;36GHz) with sub-20kHz resolution are acquired in 5s. We analyse the coupling behaviour and temperature tuning of single resonances and, for the first time, observe minute red and blue shifts of different mode families. The experimental results are supported with finite element simulations.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium transport and the fluctuation theorem in the thermodynamic behaviors of nonlinear photonic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear multimode optical systems have attracted substantial attention due to their rich physical properties. Complex interplay between the nonlinear effects and mode couplings makes it difficult to understand the collective dynamics of photons. Recent studies show that such collective phenomena can be effectively described by a Rayleigh-Jeans thermodynamics theory which is a powerful tool for the study of nonlinear multimode photonic systems. These systems, in turn, offer a compelling platform for investigating fundamental issues in statistical physics, attributed to their tunability and the ability to access negative temperature regimes. However, to date, a theory for the nonequilibrium transport and fluctuations is yet to be established. Here, we employ the full counting statistics theory to study the nonequilibrium transport of particle and energy in nonlinear multimode photonic systems in both positive and negative temperature regimes. Furthermore, we discover that in situations involving two reservoirs of opposite temperatures and chemical potentials, an intriguing phenomenon known as the loop current effect can arise, wherein the current in the positive energy sector runs counter to that in the negative energy sector. In addition, we numerically confirm that the fluctuation theorem remains applicable in optical thermodynamics systems across all regimes, from positive temperature to negative ones. Our findings closely align with numerical simulations based on first-principles nonlinear wave equations. Our work seeks to deepen the understanding of irreversible non-equilibrium processes and statistical fluctuations in nonlinear many-body photonic systems which will enhance our grasp of collective phenomena of photons and foster a fruitful intersection between optics and statistical physics.</description>

      <title>Hybrid thin-film lithium niobate micro-ring acousto-optic modulator for microwave-to-optical conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Highly efficient acousto-optic modulation plays a vital role in the microwave-to-optical conversion. Herein, we demonstrate a hybrid thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) racetrack micro-ring acousto-optic modulator (AOM) implemented with low-loss chalcogenide (ChG) waveguide. By engineering the electrode configuration of the interdigital transducer, the double-arm micro-ring acousto-optic modulation is experimentally confirmed in nonsuspended ChG loaded TFLN waveguide platform. Varying the position of blue-detuned bias point, the half-wave-voltage-length product VpaiL of the hybrid TFLN micro-ring AOM is as small as 9 mVcm. Accordingly, the acousto-optic coupling strength is estimated to be 0.48 Hz s1/2 at acoustic frequency of 0.84 GHz. By analyzing the generation of phonon number from the piezoelectric transducer, the microwave-to-optical conversion efficiency is calculated to be 0.05%, approximately one order of magnitude larger than that of the state-of-the-art suspended counterpart. Efficient microwave-to-optical conversion thus provides new opportunities for low-power-consumption quantum information transduction using the TFLN-ChG hybrid piezo-optomechanical devices.</description>

      <title>Metasurfaces with Full Control over Asymmetric Transmission of Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of optical systems with asymmetric responses has grown significantly due to their broad application potential in various fields. In particular, Janus metasurfaces are notable for their ability to control light asymmetrically at the pixel level within thin films. However, previous demonstrations were restricted to the partial control of asymmetric transmission for a limited set of input polarizations, focusing primarily on scalar functionalities. Here, we introduce optical metasurfaces consisting of bi-layer silicon nanostructures that can achieve a fully generalized form of asymmetric transmission for any possible input polarization. Their designs owe much to our theoretical model of asymmetric optical transmission in reciprocal systems that explicates the relationship between front- and back-side Jones matrices for general cases, revealing a fundamental correlation between the polarization-direction channels of opposing sides of incidence. To practically circumvent this constraint, we propose a method to partition transmission space, enabling the realization of four distinct vector functionalities within the target volume. As a proof of concept, we experimentally demonstrate polarization-direction-multiplexed Janus vector holograms generating four vector holograms. When integrated with computational vector polarizer arrays, this approach facilitates optical encryption with a high level of obscurity. We anticipate that our mathematical framework and novel material systems for generalized asymmetric transmission may pave the way for applications such as optical computations, sensing, and imaging.</description>

      <title>Photonic Neuromorphic Accelerator for Convolutional Neural Networks based on an Integrated Reconfigurable Mesh</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present and experimentally validate a passive photonic-integrated neuromorphic accelerator that uses a hardware-friendly optical spectrum slicing technique through a reconfigurable silicon photonic mesh. The proposed scheme acts as an analogue convolutional engine, enabling information preprocessing in the optical domain, dimensionality reduction and extraction of spatio-temporal features. Numerical results demonstrate that utilizing only 7 passive photonic nodes, critical modules of a digital convolutional neural network can be replaced. As a result, a 98.6% accuracy on the MNIST dataset was achieved, with a power consumption reduction of at least 26% compared to digital CNNs. Experimental results confirm these findings, achieving 97.7% accuracy with only 3 passive nodes.</description>

      <title>Bridging Rayleigh-Jeans and Bose-Einstein condensation of a guided fluid of light with positive and negative temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the free propagation geometry of a light beam (or fluid of light) in a multimode waveguide. As a result of the effective photon-photon interactions, the photon fluid thermalizes to an equilibrium state during its conservative propagation. In this configuration, Rayleigh-Jeans (RJ) thermalization and condensation of classical light waves have been recently observed experimentally in graded index multimode optical fibers characterized by a 2D parabolic trapping potential. As well-known, the properties of RJ condensation differ substantially from those of Bose-Einstein (BE) condensation: The condensate fraction decreases quadratically with the temperature for BE condensation, while it decreases linearly for RJ condensation. Furthermore, for quantum particles the heat capacity tends to zero at small temperatures, and it takes a constant value in the classical particle limit at high temperatures. This is in contrast with classical RJ waves, where the specific heat takes a constant value at small temperatures, and tends to vanish above the condensation transition in the normal (uncondensed) state. Here, we reconcile the thermodynamic properties of BE and RJ condensation: By introducing a frequency cut-off inherent to light propagation in a waveguide, we derive generalized expressions of the thermodynamic properties that include the RJ and BE limits as particular cases. We extend the approach to encompass negative temperatures. In contrast to positive temperatures, the specific heat does not display a singular behavior at negative temperatures, reflecting the non-critical nature of the transition to a macroscopic population of the highest energy level. Our work contributes to understanding the quantum-to-classical crossover in the equilibrium properties of light, within a versatile experimental platform based on nonlinear optical propagation in multimode waveguides.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study proposes an ultra-thin back side illuminated (BSI) and top-illuminated, Ge on Si photodetector (PD), for 1 to 1.4 microns wavelength range. The Ge thickness of 350 nm allows us to achieve high-speed performance at &gt;60 GHz, while the nanostructure at the bottom of the Ge layer helps to increase the optical absorption efficiency to above 80%. The BSI PD allows the PD or PD array wafer to be stacked with an electronic wafer for signal processing and transmission for optical interconnect applications such as short-reach links in data centers. Nano-microhole parameters in randomized composite formation on the bottom layer are optimized with Monte-Carlo molecular dynamics simulations incorporating charge transport to enable wide-spectral, highly efficient, and ultra-fast PDs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metasurfaces are sub-wavelength patterned layers for controlling waves in physical systems. In optics, meta-surfaces are created by materials with different dielectric constants and are capable of unconventional functionalities. We develop a deep-learning framework for Dirac-material metasurface design for controlling electronic waves. The metasurface is a configuration of circular graphene quantum dots, each created by an electric potential. Employing deep convolutional neural networks, we show that the original scattering wave can be reconstructed with fidelity over 95$\%$, suggesting the feasibility of Dirac electron holography. Additional applications such as plane wave generation, designing broadband, and multi-functionality graphene metasurface systems are illustrated.</description>

      <title>Single-antenna 3D localization with nonseparable toroidal pulses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fundamental principle of satellite/node-based localization involves triangulating the receiver's localization by measuring distances between three or more known satellite/node localizations and receivers. Achieving accurate three-dimensional (3D) localization in free space based on a single transmission antenna remains a challenge requiring breakthroughs in principle. Here, we present such single-antenna 3D localization by applying a novel kind of topologically structured pulses, toroidal electromagnetic pulses, as information carriers. Excited by the recent compact generator of toroidal pulses and their sophisticated topological and nonseparable structures, we show that the space-time nonseparability and skyrmion topology of toroidal pulses can be utilized to achieve microwave 3D localization with super-resolution accuracy and experimentally validate its superior efficacy than the conventional triangulating microwave localization. This work opens up new avenues for exploring the potential applications of topological electromagnetic pulses including but not limited to positioning, imaging, and sensing technologies.</description>

      <title>Strong Dipole-Dipole Interactions via Enhanced Light-Matter Coupling in Composite Nanofiber Waveguides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the interaction of emitters with a composite waveguide formed from two parallel optical nanofibers in currently unexplored regimes of experimental importance for atomic gases or solid-state emitters. Using the exact dyadic Green's function we comprehensively investigate the coupling efficiency and the fiber-induced Lamb shift accounting for variations in emitter positions and fiber configurations. This reveals coupling efficiencies and Purcell factors that are enhanced considerably beyond those using a single fiber waveguide, and robustness in the figures of merit. We finally investigate resonant dipole-dipole interactions and the generation of entanglement between two emitters mediated through the composite waveguide under excitation. We show that the concurrence can be enhanced for two fiber systems, such that entanglement may be present even in cases where it is zero for a single fiber. All-fiber systems are simple in construction and benefit from a wealth of existing telecommunications technologies, whilst enjoying strong couplings to emitters and offering novel light-matter functionalities specific to slot waveguides.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian topological phases and skin effects in kagome lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian physics has added new ingredients to topological physics, leading to the rising frontier of non-Hermitian topological phases. In this study, we investigate Chern insulator phases emerging from non-Hermitian kagome models with non-reciprocal and pure imaginary next-nearest neighbor hoppings. In the presence or absence of $C_3$ rotation symmetry, hybrid topological-skin effects are explored through the identification of distinct corner skin modes in different energy regions within two band gaps. By employing the dynamical analysis, the underlying physics is revealed from the non-Hermitian skin effects associated with the chiral edge states, leading to diverse non-Hermitian bulk-boundary responses. The simplicity of these kagome models and their rich emergent topological phenomena suggest that they are appealing candidates for studying non-Hermitian topological phases. We further discuss the possible realizations of these models in non-Hermitian metamaterials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a near two-octave spanning supercontinuum (SC) from 790 nm to 2900 nm in a nanostructured tellurite graded-index multimode fiber with a nanostructured core. We study the SC dynamics in different dispersion regimes and observe near-single mode spatial intensity distribution at high input energy values. Numerical simulations of the (3+1)D generalized nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation are in good agreement with our experiments. Our results open a new avenue for the generation of high-power mid-infrared SC sources in soft glass fibers.</description>

      <title>Surface plasmon induced quantum interference at meta-material interface</title>

Abstract: In this work we investigate quantum interference in a four-level atom coupled to a negative index meta-material (NIMM) anisotropic plasmonic environment that supports both TE and TM polarized surface plasmons (SP). The analysis confirms the creation of the anisotropic environment and two dipoles can interfere with each other even if they are orthogonal by sharing such SP modes. The NIMM/plasmonic environment provides more options to control SP interaction with emitters and their spontaneous emission decays and spectrum. The spectrum depends critically on structure parameters, mode frequency, frequency dependent electric permittivity and magnetic permeability, and the location of the atom etc. We observe orders of magnitudes enhancement in the plasmonic-modified decays and spectrum compared to free space case.</description>

      <title>Perfect nonradiating electromagnetic source and its self-action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonradiating sources and anapoles are curious objects from the physics of invisibility that illuminate subtle concepts of fundamental electrodynamics and have promising applications in nanophotonics. The present work shows that a perfectly conducting sphere with a hidden magnetic field is a simple nonradiating electromagnetic source with mechanical excitation and complete internal confinement of electromagnetic energy. It does not require external electromagnetic excitation and is excited by rotation, which induces internal charges and currents with a self-compensating external radiation. The constructed source acts on itself through Lorentz forces emerging from the interaction of charges and currents with electromagnetic fields inside the sphere and, when having a freedom of rotation about the fixed center, exhibits regular precession like a gyroscope. This self-action reveals an internal electromagnetic activity of the perfect nonradiating source, externally inactive and invisible. Neutron stars, these nanospheres of space, can be such natural nonradiating sources when their magnetic fields are buried.</description>

      <title>Deep-learning-driven end-to-end metalens imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02669v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in metasurface lenses (metalenses) have shown great potential for opening a new era in compact imaging, photography, light detection and ranging (LiDAR), and virtual reality/augmented reality (VR/AR) applications. However, the fundamental trade-off between broadband focusing efficiency and operating bandwidth limits the performance of broadband metalenses, resulting in chromatic aberration, angular aberration, and a relatively low efficiency. In this study, a deep-learning-based image restoration framework is proposed to overcome these limitations and realize end-to-end metalens imaging, thereby achieving aberration-free full-color imaging for mass-produced metalenses with 10-mm diameter. Neural-network-assisted metalens imaging achieved a high resolution comparable to that of the ground truth image.</description>

      <title>Flat silicon gradient index lens with deep reactive-ion-etched 3-layer anti-reflection structure for millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the design, fabrication, and characterization of a 100 mm diameter, flat, gradient-index (GRIN) lens fabricated with high-resistivity silicon, combined with a three-layer anti-reflection (AR) structure optimized for 160-355 GHz. Multi-depth, deep reactive-ion etching (DRIE) enables patterning of silicon wafers with sub-wavelength structures (posts or holes) to locally change the effective refractive index and thus create anti-reflection layers and a radial index gradient. The structures are non-resonant and, for sufficiently long wavelengths, achromatic. Hexagonal holes varying in size with distance from the optical axis create a parabolic index profile decreasing from 3.15 at the center of the lens to 1.87 at the edge. The AR structure consists of square holes and cross-shaped posts. We have fabricated a lens consisting of a stack of five 525 $\mu$m thick GRIN wafers and one AR wafer on each face. We have characterized the lens over the frequency range 220-330 GHz, obtaining behavior consistent with Gaussian optics down to -14 dB and transmittance between 75% and 100%.</description>

      <title>783-MHz fundamental repetition rate, Er-doped all-fiber ring laser mode-locked by carbon nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have demonstrated 783-MHz, the highest fundamental repetition rate from a mode-locked all-fiber ring laser with a pulse width of 623 fs. By using carbon nanotubes (CNT) saturable absorber (SA), a relatively low self-starting pump threshold of 108 mW is achieved. The laser has a very compact footprint less than 10 cm * 10 cm, benefiting from the all-active-fiber cavity design. The robust mode-locking is confirmed by the low relative intensity noise (RIN) and a long-term stability test. We propose a new scheme for generating high repetition rate femtosecond optical pulses from a compact and stable all-fiber ring laser.</description>

      <title>Generation of multiple bound states in the continuum through doubly degenerate quasi-guided modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a detailed theoretical analysis of a peculiar generation of multiple bound states in the continuum (BICs) in two-dimensional periodic arrays of dielectric spheres. They emerge in high-symmetry lattices with the $C_{6v}$ and $C_{4v}$ point groups and involve doubly degenerate quasi-guided modes at the $\Gamma$ point that can couple to external radiation. By tuning a system parameter, the doubly degenerate modes can exhibit accidental BICs at a critical parameter. In the vicinity of the critical parameter, the two bands originating from the degenerate mode exhibit multiple off-$\Gamma$ BICs. They move and annihilate across the two bands by changing the parameter around the critical one. A ring-like high $Q$ channel pinned with multiple BICs emerges particularly for the $C_{6v}$ case. Across the critical coupling, the total vorticity of the multiple BICs is conserved. The $\vb*{k}\cdot\vb*{p}$ perturbation theory explains some features of the phenomena reasonably well.</description>
