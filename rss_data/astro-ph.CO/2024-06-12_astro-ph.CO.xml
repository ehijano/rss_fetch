      <title>Stellar-Mass Black Holes with Dark Matter Mini-Spikes: Evidence of a Primordial Origin?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations of three nearby black hole low-mass X-ray binaries have suggested possible evidence of dark matter density spikes. It has long been established that cold dark matter should form dense spikes around intermediate-mass and supermassive black holes due to adiabatic compression of the surrounding dark matter halo. Lighter black holes formed from stellar collapse, however, are not expected to develop such spikes, and so it is unclear how the stellar-mass black holes in these binaries could have acquired such features. Given that primordial black holes are expected to form ultra-dense dark matter mini-spikes, in this Letter we explore the possibility that these stellar-mass black holes may actually have a primordial origin.</description>

      <title>Gravitational lensing by a generalised-NFW halo via the Fox $H$-function and its application to the super-NFW</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a particular generalised-NFW (gNFW) mass distribution, we derive analytical expressions for its surface mass density, projected mass, and deflection potential, given in terms of three representations of the Fox $H$-function, for which we provide their corresponding power (logarithmic) series expansions. They are handy in computationally intensive tasks. From these results, we obtain closed-form expressions for the super-NFW (sNFW) in terms of complete elliptic functions, which have not yet been reported in the literature. Additionally, we find that, for a fixed $\kappa_0$ (characteristic convergence), when the number of images is maximal (three for the sNFW), the sum of their signed magnification, named $I_{\text{sNFW}}$, varies with the position of the source $y$ inside the radial caustic $y_{\text{c2}}$. The higher variations occur for $\kappa_0\lesssim 1$, while $I_{\text{sNFW}}$ can be considered as constant when $\kappa_0$ is approximately within the range 2-10. This range can be extended depending on the observational uncertainties, since for higher values of $\kappa_0$, the variations in $I_{\text{sNFW}}$ are relatively small. This behaviour is shared with the NFW and Hernquist lenses.</description>

      <title>Domain Walls and Hubble Constant Tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the idea that replacing the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ in the $\Lambda$CDM model by a distribution of walls, with very low tension compared to what one would expect from new physics, could help explaining the tension in the Hubble constant fits in the Standard Cosmological Model. Using parameters from our model for dark matter as macroscopic pearls, we can get a promising order of magnitude for the correction to the Hubble constant estimated from observations of the cosmic microwave background. Our model is on the borderline of failing by predicting too large extra fluctuations as a function of direction in the cosmological microwave background radiation. However, imagining the bubbles in the voids to have come from more somewhat smaller big bubbles also occurring outside the big voids may help. We estimate that, in order to have big volumes of the new vacuum in intergalactic space, a very high temperature is needed and that such regions would be likely to get cooled, freeze and shrink down to the degenerate form of dark matter if hitting some ordinary matter, as is likely in the denser parts of the Universe. We also review our model for dark matter, and develop the understanding of the stopping of the dark matter particles in the shielding of say the DAMA-LIBRA underground experiment and the counting rate this experiment observes. We manage to obtain a consistent fit with a mass $M = 2 \cdot 10^{-18}$kg = $10^9$GeV and radius $R = 10^{-10}$m for the dark matter pearls, corresponding to a tension in the domain wall of $S= (8 {\rm MeV})^3$.</description>

      <title>The cosmology of $f(R, L_m)$ gravity: constraining the background and perturbed dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper delves into the late-time accelerated expansion of the universe and the evolution of cosmic structures within the context of a specific \( f(R, L_m) \) gravity model, formulated as \( f(R, L_m) = \lambda R + \beta L_m^\alpha + \eta \). To study the cosmological viability of the model, we employed the latest cosmic measurement datasets: i) 57 observational Hubble parameter data points (\texttt{OHD}); ii) 1048 distance moduli data points (\texttt{SNIa}); iii) a combined dataset (\texttt{OHD+SNIa}); and large scale structure datasets, including iv) 14 growth rate data points (\texttt{f}); and v) 30 redshift space distortion data points (\texttt{f}$\sigma_8$). These datasets facilitated the constraint of the \( f(R, L_m) \)-gravity model via MCMC simulations, followed by a comparative analysis with the \(\Lambda\)CDM model. A comprehensive statistical analysis has been conducted to evaluate the \( f(R, L_m) \)-gravity model's efficacy in explaining both the accelerated expansion of the universe and the growth of cosmic structures.</description>

      <title>LOFAR Deep Fields: Probing the sub-mJy regime of polarized extragalactic sources in ELAIS-N1. I. The catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this study is to probe the sub-mJy polarized source population with LOFAR. We present the method used to stack LOFAR polarization datasets, the resulting catalog of polarized sources, and the derived polarized source counts. The ELAIS-N1 field was selected for a polarimetric study at 114.9-177.4 MHz. A total area of 25 deg2 was imaged at 6"- resolution in the Stokes Q and U parameters. Alignment of polarization angles was done both in frequency and in Faraday space before stacking datasets from 19 eight-hour-long epochs. A search for polarized sources was carried out in the final, stacked dataset, and the properties of the detected sources were examined. The depolarization level of sources known to be polarized at 1.4 GHz was quantified. A one-sigma noise level of 19 {\mu}Jy/beam was reached in the central part of the field after stacking. Twenty-five polarized sources were detected above 8\sigma, five of which had not been detected in polarization at any other radio frequencies before. Seven additional polarized components were found by lowering the threshold to 6\sigma at positions corresponding to sources known to be polarized at 1.4 GHz. In two radio galaxies, polarization was detected from both radio lobes, so the final number of associated radio continuum sources is 31. The detected sources are weakly polarized, with a median degree of polarization of 1.75% for the sample of sources detected in polarized emission. The sources previously detected in polarization at 1.4 GHz are significantly depolarized at 150 MHz. The catalog is used to derive the polarized source counts at 150 MHz. This is the deepest and highest-resolution polarization study at 150 MHz to date.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Cosmological Model Selection with Interpretable Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach using neural networks (NNs) to differentiate between cosmological models, especially in the case where they are nested and the additional model parameters are close to zero, making it difficult to discriminate them with traditional approaches. Our method complements Bayesian analyses for cosmological model selection, which heavily depend on the chosen priors and average the unnormalized posterior over potentially large prior volumes. By analyzing simulated realistic data sets of the growth rate of the large scale structure (LSS) of the Universe, based on current galaxy-clustering survey specifications, for the cosmological constant and cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model and the Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ model, we demonstrate the potential of NNs to enhance the extraction of meaningful information from cosmological LSS data. We find that the NN can successfully distinguish between $\Lambda$CDM and the $f(R)$ models, by predicting the correct model with approximately $97\%$ overall accuracy, thus demonstrating that NNs can maximise the potential of current and next generation surveys to probe for deviations from general relativity.</description>

      <title>Consistent Theories for the DESI dark energy fit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We search for physically consistent realizations of evolving dark energy suggested by the cosmological fit of DESI, Planck and Supernovae data. First we note that any lagrangian description of the standard Chevallier-Linder-Polarski (CLP) parametrization for the dark energy equation of state $w_{\rm eff}$, allows for the addition of a cosmological constant. We perform the cosmological fit finding new regions of parameter space that however continue to favour dark energy with $w_{\rm eff}&lt;-1$ at early times that are challenging to realize in theoretically consistent theories. Next, in the spirit of effective field theories, we consider the effect of higher order terms in the Taylor expansion of the equation of state around the present epoch. We find that non-linear corrections of the equation of state are weakly constrained, thus opening the way to scenarios that differ from CLP at early times, possibly with $w_{\rm eff}&gt;-1$ at all times. We present indeed scenarios where evolving dark energy can be realized through quintessence models. We introduce in particular the ramp model where dark energy coincides with CLP at late times and approximates to a cosmological constant at early times. The latter model provides a much better fit than $\Lambda$CDM, and only slightly worse than $w_0w_a$CDM, but with the big advantage of being described by a simple and theoretically consistent lagrangian of a canonical quintessence model.</description>

      <title>Exploiting the diversity of modeling methods to probe systematic biases in strong lensing analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past decade, the diversity of strong lens modeling methods has exploded, from being purely analytical to pixelated and non-parametric, or based on deep learning. We embrace this diversity by selecting different software packages and use them to blindly model independently simulated Hubble Space Telescope imaging data. To overcome the difficulties arising from using different codes and conventions, we use the COde-independent Organized LEns STandard (COOLEST) to store, compare and release all models in a self-consistent and human-readable manner. From an ensemble of six modeling methods, we study the recovery of the lens potential parameters and properties of the reconstructed source. In particular, we simulate and infer parameters of an elliptical power-law mass distribution with external shear for the lens while each modeling method reconstructs the source differently. We find that overall, both lens and source properties are recovered reasonably well, but systematic biases arise in all methods. Interestingly, we do not observe that a single method is significantly more accurate than others, and the amount of bias largely depends on the specific lens or source property of interest. By combining posterior distributions from individual methods using equal weights, the maximal systematic biases on lens model parameters inferred from individual models are reduced by a factor of 5.4 on average. We investigate a selection of modeling effects that partly explain the observed biases, such as the cuspy nature of the background source and the accuracy of the point spread function. This work introduces, for the first time, a generic framework to compare and ease the combination of models obtained from different codes and methods, which will be key to retain accuracy in future strong lensing analyses.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the (in)consistencies among the galaxy stellar mass function, star formation histories, satellite abundances and intracluster light from a semi-empirical perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a hierarchical, dark matter-dominated Universe, stellar mass functions (SMFs), galaxy merger rates, star formation histories (SFHs), satellite abundances, and intracluster light, should all be intimately connected observables. However, the systematics affecting observations still prevent universal and uniform measurements of, for example, the SMF and the SFHs, inevitably preventing theoretical models to compare with multiple data sets robustly and simultaneously. We here present our holistic semi-empirical model DECODE (Discrete statistical sEmi-empiriCal mODEl) that converts via abundance matching dark matter merger trees into galaxy assembly histories, using different SMFs in input and predicting all other observables in output in a fully data-driven and self-consistent fashion with minimal assumptions. We find that: 1) weakly evolving or nearly constant SMFs below the knee ($M_\star \lesssim 10^{11} \, M_\odot$) are the best suited to generate star formation histories aligned with those inferred from MaNGA, SDSS, GAMA, and, more recently, JWST; 2) the evolution of satellites after infall only affects the satellite abundances and star formation histories of massive central galaxies but not their merger histories; 3) the resulting SFR-$M_\star$ relation is lower in normalization by a factor of $\sim 2$ with respect to observations, with a flattening at high masses more pronounced in the presence of mergers; 4) the latest data on intracluster light can be reproduced if mass loss from mergers is included in the models. Our findings are pivotal in acting as pathfinder to test the self-consistency of the high-quality data from, e.g., JWST and Euclid.</description>

      <title>Regularizing infrared divergences in de Sitter spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Correlation functions of light scalars in de Sitter space, computed in standard perturbation theory, are hindered by time-dependent infrared divergences in the form of powers of $\ln a(t)$, where $a(t)$ is the scale factor describing the expansion of space. It has often been pointed out that loop corrections to these correlation functions make their divergence even stronger. In this note, we argue that this is not the case: Loop corrections can be treated systematically with standard perturbative techniques (such as dimensional regularization) without necessarily introducing new $\ln a(t)$ dependencies. To be concrete, we focus on correlation functions represented by diagrams with a single vertex and an arbitrary number of loops. In this case, divergences from loops can be removed systematically with counterterms order by order, and one finds that observable loop-corrected correlation functions are indistinguishable from their tree-level form. By adopting a Wilsonian perspective, we further point out that our results favor the use of physical cutoffs (as opposed to comoving cutoffs) to regularize infrared divergences in general diagrams with an arbitrary number of loops and vertices.</description>

      <title>Optical and near-infrared spectroscopy of quasars at $z&gt;6.5$: public data release and composite spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present optical and near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic observations for a sample of $45$ quasars at $6.50 &lt; z \leq 7.64$ with absolute magnitudes at $1450$ {\AA} in the range $-28.82 \leq M_{1450} \leq -24.13$ and their composite spectrum. The median redshift and $M_{1450}$ of the quasars in the sample are $z_{\rm{median}}=6.71$ and $M_{1450,\rm{median}} \simeq -26.1$, respectively. The NIR spectra are taken with echelle spectrographs, complemented with additional data from optical long slit instruments, and then reduced consistently using the open-source Python-based spectroscopic data reduction pipeline PypeIt. The median value of the mean signal-to-noise ratios of the spectra in J, H, and K band (median $\langle \rm{SNR}_{\lambda} \rangle$) is: median $\langle \rm{SNR}_{J} \rangle=9.7$, median $\langle \rm{SNR}_{H} \rangle=10.3$, and median $\langle \rm{SNR}_{K} \rangle=11.7$; demonstrating the good data quality. This work presents the largest medium/moderate-resolution sample of quasars at $z&gt;6.5$ from ground-based instruments. Its homogeneity and reproducibility make it ideally suited for several scientific goals, i.e., the study of the quasar proximity zones and damping wings, the Ly$\alpha$ forest, the intergalactic medium's metal content, as well as other properties such as the distribution of SMBH masses and Eddington ratios. Our composite spectrum is compared to others at both high and low-$z$ from the literature, showing differences in the strengths of many emission lines, probably due to differences in luminosity among the samples, but a consistent continuum slope, which proves that the same spectral features are preserved in quasars at different redshift ranges.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes from First-Order Phase Transition in the xSM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supercooled first-order phase transition (FOPT) can lead to the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs). This scenario imposes stringent requirements on the profile of the effective potential. In this work, we use the singlet extended Standard Model (xSM) as a benchmark model to investigate this possibility at the electroweak scale. The PBHs formed during a supercooled FOPT have a narrow mass distribution around the mass of Earth. This distribution is closely tied to the temperature at which the PBHs form, corresponding to the FOPT at the electroweak scale. This scenario can be probed with microlensing experiments, space-based gravitational wave detectors, and collider experiments. Remarkably, the future space-based gravitational wave detector LISA will hold the potential to either confirm this PBH scenario in the xSM or completely rule it out for extremely small total dark matter fraction made of PBHs, down to $f_{\rm PBH}&gt; 10^{-300}$. Interestingly, our findings suggest that PBHs within the xSM framework may align with observations of the six ultrashort timescale events reported by the OGLE microlensing experiment.</description>

      <title>Formation of Giant Clumps in High-$z$ Disc Galaxies by Compressive Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the formation of giant clumps in violently unstable gas-rich disc galaxies at cosmic noon. While these are commonly thought to originate from gravitational Toomre instability, cosmological simulations have indicated that clumps form even in regions where the Toomre $Q$ parameter is well above unity, which should be stable according to linear Toomre theory (Inoue et al., 2016). Examining one of these cosmological simulations, we find that it exhibits an excess in compressive modes of turbulence with converging motions. The energy in converging motions within proto-clump regions is $\sim 70\%$ of the total turbulent energy, compared to $\sim 17\%$ expected in equipartition. When averaged over the whole disc, $\sim 32\%$ of the turbulent energy is in converging motions, with a further $\sim 8\%$ in diverging motions. Thus, a total of $\sim 40\%$ of the turbulent energy is in compressive modes, with the rest in solenoidal modes, compared to the $(1/3)-(2/3)$ division expected in equipartition. By contrast, we find that in an isolated-disc simulation with similar properties, resembling high-$z$ star-forming galaxies, the energy in the different turbulence modes are in equipartition, both in proto-clump regions and over the whole disc. We conclude that the origin of the excessive converging motions in proto-clump regions is external to the disc, and propose several mechanisms that can induce them. This is an additional mechanism for clump formation, complementary to and possibly preceding gravitational instability.</description>

      <title>On the Effects of Non-metricity in an Averaged Universe</title>

Abstract: In the covariant averaging scheme of macroscopic gravity, the process of averaging breaks the metricity of geometry. We reinterpret the back-reaction within macroscopic gravity in terms of the non-metricity of averaged geometry. This interpretation extends the effect of back-reaction beyond mere dynamics to kinematics of geodesic bundles. With a 1+3 decomposition of the spacetime, we analyse how geometric flows are modified by deriving the Raychaudhuri and Sachs equations. We also present the modified forms of Gauss and Codazzi equations. Finally, we derive an expression for the angular diameter distance in Friedmann Lema\^itre Robertson Walker universe and show that non-metricity modifies it only through the Hubble parameter. Thus, we caution against overestimating the influence of back-reaction on the distances.</description>

      <title>A Measurement of CO(3-2) Line Emission from eBOSS Galaxies at $z\sim 0.5$ using Planck Data</title>

Abstract: Line intensity mapping (LIM) is a novel observational technique in astrophysics that utilizes the integrated emission from multiple atomic and molecular transition lines from galaxies to probe the complex physics of galaxy formation and evolution, as well as the large-scale structure of the universe. Modeling multiple line luminosities of galaxies with varying masses or their host halo masses poses significant uncertainty due to the lack of observational data across a wide redshift range and the intricate nature of astrophysical processes, making them challenging to model analytically or in simulations. While future experiments aim to measure multiple line intensities up to $z\sim 8$ across a wide volume using tomographic methods, we leverage publicly available datasets from the CMB experiment Planck and the galaxy survey eBOSS to constrain the CO(3-2) emission from galaxies. We correlate galaxies from eBOSS data onto the full-sky CO(2-1) map produced by Planck and report the first measurement of the average CO(3-2) intensity, $I_{CO} = 45.7 \pm 14.2\, \mathrm{Jy/sr}$ at $z\sim 0.5$ with $3.2\sigma$ confidence. Our findings demonstrate that stacking methods are already viable with existing observations from CMB experiments and galaxy surveys, and are complementary to traditional LIM experiments.</description>

      <title>$\texttt{DiffLense}$: A Conditional Diffusion Model for Super-Resolution of Gravitational Lensing Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing data is frequently collected at low resolution due to instrumental limitations and observing conditions. Machine learning-based super-resolution techniques offer a method to enhance the resolution of these images, enabling more precise measurements of lensing effects and a better understanding of the matter distribution in the lensing system. This enhancement can significantly improve our knowledge of the distribution of mass within the lensing galaxy and its environment, as well as the properties of the background source being lensed. Traditional super-resolution techniques typically learn a mapping function from lower-resolution to higher-resolution samples. However, these methods are often constrained by their dependence on optimizing a fixed distance function, which can result in the loss of intricate details crucial for astrophysical analysis. In this work, we introduce $\texttt{DiffLense}$, a novel super-resolution pipeline based on a conditional diffusion model specifically designed to enhance the resolution of gravitational lensing images obtained from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP). Our approach adopts a generative model, leveraging the detailed structural information present in Hubble Space Telescope (HST) counterparts. The diffusion model, trained to generate HST data, is conditioned on HSC data pre-processed with denoising techniques and thresholding to significantly reduce noise and background interference. This process leads to a more distinct and less overlapping conditional distribution during the model's training phase. We demonstrate that $\texttt{DiffLense}$ outperforms existing state-of-the-art single-image super-resolution techniques, particularly in retaining the fine details necessary for astrophysical analyses.</description>

      <title>Extreme Axions Unveiled: a Novel Fluid Approach for Cosmological Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs) are a well-motivated dark matter candidate that solve some of the problems in the clustering of large scale structure in cosmology. ALPs are often described by a simplified quadratic potential to specify the dynamics of the axion field, and are included in cosmological analysis codes using a modified fluid prescription. In this paper we consider the extreme axion: a version of the axion with a high initial field angle that produces an enhancement (rather than a suppression) of structure on small scales around the Jeans length, which can be probed by measurements of clustering such as the eBOSS DR14 Ly-$\alpha$ forest. We present a novel method of modeling the extreme axion as a cosmological fluid, combining the Generalized Dark Matter model with the effective fluid approach presented in the \texttt{axionCAMB} software, as well as implementing a series of computational innovations to efficiently simulate the extreme axions. We find that for axion masses between $10^{-23} \mathrm{\ eV} \lesssim m_\mathrm{ax} \lesssim 10^{-22.5} \mathrm{\ eV}$, constraints on the axion fraction imposed by the eBOSS DR14 Ly-$\alpha$ forest can be significantly weakened by allowing them to be in the form of extreme axions with a starting angle between $\pi - 10^{-1} \lesssim \theta_i \lesssim \pi - 10^{-2}$. This work motivates and enables a more robust hydrodynamical analysis of extreme axions in order to compare them to high-resolution Ly-$\alpha$ forest data in the future.</description>

Abstract: We analyse three interacting vacuum dark energy models with the aim of exploring whether the $H_0$ and $\sigma_8$ tensions can be simultaneously resolved in such models. We present the first ever derivation of the covariant gauge-invariant perturbation formalism for the interacting vacuum scenario, and, for the sub-class of geodesic cold dark matter models, connect the evolution of perturbation variables in this approach to the familiar cosmological observables. We show how $H_0$ and $\sigma_8$ evolve in three interacting vacuum models: firstly, a simple linear coupling between the vacuum and cold dark matter; secondly, a coupling which mimics the behaviour of a Chaplygin gas; and finally a coupling which mimics the Shan--Chen fluid dark energy model. We identify, if any, the regions of parameter space which would correspond to a simultaneous resolution of both tensions in these models. When constraints from observational data are added, we show how all the models described are constrained to be close to their $\Lambda$CDM limits.</description>

      <title>A proposal to improve the accuracy of cosmological observables and address the Hubble tension problem</title>

Abstract: (abridged)Cosmological observational programs often compare their data not only with $\Lambda$CDM, but also with extensions applying dynamical models of dark energy (DDE), with a time-dependent equation of state (EoS) parameter $w$. We found a degeneracy in the customary computational procedure for the expansion history, once DDE models are applied. This degeneracy provides an infinite number of cosmological models reproducing the Planck-measured CMB spectrum. Moreover, this degeneracy biases the comparison of $\Lambda$CDM with DDE extensions. We present a complementary computational approach, which breaks this degeneracy: the ``fixed early densities (EDs) approach'' evolves cosmological models from the early Universe to the present, in contrast to the customary ``fixed $H_0$ approach'' which evolves cosmological models in reverse order. We find the EDs are accurately approximated by the $\Lambda$CDM model. We implement a refined procedure, appyling both approaches, in an amended version of the code CLASS, where we focus on representative DDE models using the CPL parametrization. Our results reveal that the CPL model $w(a)=-0.9 + 0.1(1-a)$ could provide a resolution to the Hubble tension problem. Moreover, we find that combining both approaches, while requesting to yield consistent results and being in agreement with observations across cosmic time, can serve as a kind of consistency check for cosmological models. Moreover, our proposed consistency check applied within current data analysis methods will increase the accuracy of inferred cosmological parameters significantly, in particular for $\Lambda$CDM extensions. We find characteristic signatures in the late expansion histories of cosmological models, allowing a phenomenological discrimination of DE candidates and a possible resolution of the Hubble tension, by ongoing and future observational programs.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Forecast of the Void Size Function Measurement from the CSST Spectroscopic Survey</title>

Abstract: Void size function (VSF) contains information of the cosmic large-scale structure (LSS), and can be used to derive the properties of dark energy and dark matter. We predict the VSFs measured from the spectroscopic galaxy survey operated by the China Space Station Telescope (CSST), and study the strength of cosmological constraint. We employ a high-resolution Jiutian simulation to get CSST galaxy mock samples based on an improved semi-analytical model. We identify voids from this galaxy catalog using the watershed algorithm without assuming a spherical shape, and estimate the VSFs at different redshift bins from $z=0.5$ to 1.1. We propose a void selection method based on the ellipticity, and assume the void linear underdensity threshold $\delta_{\rm v}$ in the theoretical model is redshift-dependent and set it as a free parameter in each redshift bin. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is adopted to implement the constraints on the cosmological and void parameters. We find that the CSST VSF measurement can constrain the cosmological parameters to a few percent level. The best-fit values of $\delta_{\rm v}$ are ranging from $\sim-0.4$ to $-0.1$ as the redshift increases from 0.5 to 1.1, which has a distinct difference from the theoretical calculation with $\delta_{\rm v}\simeq-2.7$ assuming the spherical evolution and using particles as tracer. Our method can provide a good reference for void identification and selection in the VSF analysis of the spectroscopic galaxy surveys.</description>

      <title>Stepping into the Forest: Confronting Interacting Radiation Models for the Hubble Tension with Lyman-$\alpha$ Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Models of interacting dark radiation have been shown to alleviate the Hubble tension. Extensions incorporating a coupling between dark matter and dark radiation (DM-DR) have been proposed as combined solutions to both the Hubble and $S_8$ tensions. A key feature of these extended models is a break in the matter power spectrum (MPS), suppressing power for modes that enter the horizon before the DM-DR interactions turn off. In scenarios with a massless mediator, modes that enter before matter-radiation equality get suppressed, whereas for massive mediators, the break is determined by the mediator mass, a free parameter. In this work, we test these models against probes of LSS: weak lensing, CMB lensing, full-shape galaxy clustering, and eBOSS measurements of the 1D Ly$\alpha\,$ forest flux power spectrum. The latter are the most constraining since they probe small scales where many models predict the largest deviations. In fact, already within $\Lambda{\rm CDM}\,$, the eBOSS Ly$\alpha\,$ data are in significant tension with Planck CMB data, with the Ly$\alpha\,$ data preferring a steeper slope of the MPS at $k \sim h \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. We find that the simplest dark radiation models, which improve the Hubble tension, worsen the fit to the Ly$\alpha\,$ data. However, models with DM-DR interactions can simultaneously address both tensions.</description>

      <title>Dark matter capture in celestial objects: Improved treatment of multiple scattering and updated constraints from white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.04204</link>
      <description>arXiv:1906.04204v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit dark matter (DM) capture in celestial objects, including the impact of multiple scattering, and obtain updated constraints on the DM-proton cross section using observations of white dwarfs. Considering a general form for the energy loss distribution in each scattering, we derive an exact formula for the capture probability through multiple scatterings. We estimate the maximum number of scatterings that $can$ take place, in contrast to the number $required$ to bring a dark matter particle to rest. We employ these results to compute a "dark" luminosity $L_{\rm DM}$, arising solely from the thermalized annihilation products of the captured dark matter. Demanding that $L_{\rm DM}$ not exceed the luminosity of the white dwarfs in the M4 globular cluster, we set a bound on the DM-proton cross section: $\sigma_{p} \lesssim 10^{-44} {\rm cm}^2$, almost independent of the dark matter mass between 100 GeV and 1 PeV and mildly weakening beyond. This is a stronger constraint than those obtained by direct detection experiments in both large mass $\left(M \gtrsim 5 \,\,\rm TeV\right)$ and small mass $\left(M \lesssim 10\,\, \rm GeV\right)$ regimes. For dark matter lighter than 350 MeV, which is beyond the sensitivity of present direct detection experiments, this is the strongest available constraint.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent observations of the high-redshift universe have uncovered a significant number of active galactic nuclei, implying that supermassive black holes (SMBHs) would have to have been formed at much earlier times than expected. Direct collapse of metal-free gas clouds to SMBHs after recombination could help explain the early formation of SMBHs, but this scenario is stymied by the fragmentation of the clouds due to efficient molecular hydrogen cooling. We show that a subdominant population of tiny, evaporating primordial black holes, with significant clustering in some gas clouds, can heat the gas sufficiently so that molecular hydrogen is not formed, and direct collapse to to black holes is possible even at high redshifts.</description>

      <title>Renormalisation of IR divergences and holography in de Sitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate a renormalisation procedure for IR divergences of tree-level in-in late-time de Sitter correlators. These divergences are due to the infinite volume of spacetime and are analogous to the divergences that appear in AdS dealt with by holographic renormalisation. Regulating the theory using dimensional regularisation, we show that one can remove all infinities by adding local counterterms at the future boundary of dS in the Schwinger-Keldysh path integral. The counterterms amount to renormalising the late-time bulk field. We frame the discussion in terms of bulk scalar fields in dS, using tree-level correlators of massless and conformal scalars for illustration. The relation to AdS via analytic continuation is discussed, and we show that different versions of the analytic continuation appearing in the literature are equivalent to each other. In AdS, one needs to add counterterms that are related to conformal anomalies, and also to renormalise the source part of the bulk field. The analytic continuation to dS projects out the traditional AdS counterterms, and links the renormalisation of the sources to the renormalisation of the late-time bulk field. We use these results to establish holographic formulae that relate tree-level dS in-in correlators to CFT correlators at up to four points, and we provide two proofs: one using the connection between the dS wavefunction and the partition function of the dual CFT, and a second by direct evaluation of the in-in correlators using the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism. The renormalisation of the bulk IR divergences is mapped by these formulae to UV renormalisation of the dual CFT via local counterterms, providing structural support for a possible duality. We also recast the regulated holographic formulae in terms of the AdS amplitudes of shadow fields, but show that this relation breaks down when renormalisation is required.</description>

      <title>Robustness of the Galactic Center Excess Morphology Against Masking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Galactic Center Excess (GCE) remains an enduring mystery, with leading explanations being annihilating dark matter or an unresolved population of millisecond pulsars. Analyzing the morphology of the GCE provides critical clues to identify its exact origin. We investigate the robustness of the inferred GCE morphology against the effects of masking, an important step in the analysis where the gamma-ray emission from point sources and the galactic disk are excluded. Using different masks constructed from Fermi point source catalogs and a wavelet method, we find that the GCE morphology, particularly its ellipticity and cuspiness, is relatively independent of the choice of mask for energies above 2-3 GeV. The GCE morphology systematically favors an approximately spherical shape, as expected for dark matter annihilation. Compared to various stellar bulge profiles, a spherical dark matter annihilation profile better fits the data across different masks and galactic diffuse emission backgrounds, except for the stellar bulge profile from Coleman et al. (2020), which provides a similar fit to the data. Modeling the GCE with two components, one from dark matter annihilation and one tracing the Coleman Bulge, we find this two-component model outperforms any single component or combinations of dark matter annihilation and other stellar bulge profiles. Uncertainty remains about the exact fraction contributed by each component across different background models and masks. However, when the Coleman Bulge dominates, its corresponding spectrum lacks characteristics typically associated with millisecond pulsars, suggesting that it mostly models the emission from other sources instead of the GCE that is still present and spherically symmetric.</description>

      <title>A Closer Look in the Mirror: Reflections on the Matter/Dark Matter Coincidence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that the striking similarity between the cosmic abundances of baryons and dark matter, despite their very different astrophysical behavior, strongly motivates the scenario in which dark matter resides within a rich dark sector parallel in structure to that of the standard model. The near cosmic coincidence is then explained by an approximate $\mathbb{Z}_2$ exchange symmetry between the two sectors, where dark matter consists of stable dark neutrons, with matter and dark matter asymmetries arising via parallel WIMP baryogenesis mechanisms. Taking a top-down perspective, we point out that an adequate $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry necessitates solving the electroweak hierarchy problem in each sector, without our committing to a specific implementation. A higher-dimensional realization in the far UV is presented, in which the hierarchical couplings of the two sectors and the requisite $\mathbb{Z}_2$-breaking structure arise naturally from extra-dimensional localization and gauge symmetries. We trace the cosmic history, paying attention to potential pitfalls not fully considered in previous literature. Residual $\mathbb{Z}_2$-breaking can very plausibly give rise to the asymmetric reheating of the two sectors, needed to keep the cosmological abundance of relativistic dark particles below tight bounds. We show that, despite the need to keep inter-sector couplings highly suppressed after asymmetric reheating, there can naturally be order-one couplings mediated by TeV scale particles which can allow experimental probes of the dark sector at high energy colliders. Massive mediators can also induce dark matter direct detection signals, but likely at or below the neutrino floor.</description>
