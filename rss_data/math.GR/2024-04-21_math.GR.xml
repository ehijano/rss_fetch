      <title>Some properties of relative Rota--Baxter operators on groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find connection between relative Rota--Baxter operators and usual Rota--Baxter operators. We prove that any relative Rota--Baxter operator on a group $H$ with respect to $(G, \Psi)$ defines a Rota--Baxter operator on the semi-direct product $H\rtimes_{\Psi} G$. On the other side, we give condition under which a Rota--Baxter operator on the semi-direct product $H\rtimes_{\Psi} G$ defines a relative Rota--Baxter operator on $H$ with respect to $(G, \Psi)$. We introduce homomorphic post-groups and find their connection with $\lambda$-homomorphic skew left braces. Further, we construct post-group on arbitrary group and a family post-groups which depends on integer parameter on any two-step nilpotent group. We find all verbal solutions of the quantum Yang-Baxter equation on two-step nilpotent group.</description>

      <title>On groups whose conjugacy class sizes are not divisible by each other</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group and $N(G)$ be the set of its conjugacy class sizes excluding~$1$. Let us define a directed graph $\Gamma(G)$, the set of vertices of this graph is $N(G)$ and the vertices $x$ and $y$ are connected by a directed edge from $x$ to $y$ if $x$ divides $y$ and $N(G)$ does not contain a number $z$ different from $x$ and $y$ such that $x$ divides $z$ and $z$ divides $y$. We will call the graph $\Gamma(G)$ the conjugate graph of the group $G$. In this work, we will study finite groups whose conjugate graph is a set of points.</description>

      <title>Commuting probability for approximate subgroups of a finite group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For subsets X,Y of a finite group G, we write Pr(X,Y) for the probability that two random elements x in X and y in Y commute. This paper addresses the relation between the structure of an approximate subgroup A of G and the probabilities Pr(A,G) and Pr(A,A).</description>

      <title>Haar graphical representations of finite groups and an application to poset representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a group and let $S$ be a subset of $R$. The Haar graph $\mathrm{Haar}(R,S)$ of $R$ with connection set $S$ is the graph having vertex set $R\times\{-1,1\}$, where two distinct vertices $(x,-1)$ and $(y,1)$ are declared to be adjacent if and only if $yx^{-1}\in S$. The name Haar graph was coined by Toma\v{z} Pisanski in one of the first investigations on this class of graphs.
  For every $g\in R$, the mapping $\rho_g:(x,\varepsilon)\mapsto (xg,\varepsilon)$, $\forall (x,\varepsilon)\in R\times\{-1,1\}$, is an automorphism of $\mathrm{Haar}(R,S)$. In particular, the set $\hat{R}:=\{\rho_g\mid g\in R\}$ is a subgroup of the automorphism group of $\mathrm{Haar}(R,S)$ isomorphic to $R$. In the case that the automorphism group of $\mathrm{Haar}(R,S)$ equals $\hat{R}$, the Haar graph $\mathrm{Haar}(R,S)$ is said to be a Haar graphical representation of the group $R$.
  Answering a question of Feng, Kov\'{a}cs, Wang, and Yang, we classify the finite groups admitting a Haar graphical representation. Specifically, we show that every finite group admits a Haar graphical representation, with abelian groups and ten other small groups as the only exceptions.
  Our work on Haar graphs allows us to improve a 1980 result of Babai concerning representations of groups on posets, achieving the best possible result in this direction. An improvement to Babai's related result on representations of groups on distributive lattices follows.</description>

      <title>Classification of non-free p.m.p. boolean actions of ergodic full groups and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend Dye's reconstruction theorem, which classifies isomorphisms between full groups, to a classification of homomorphisms between full groups. For full groups of ergodic p.m.p. equivalence relations, our result roughly says that such homomorphisms come only from actions of the equivalence relation, or of one of its symmetric powers. This has several rigidity consequences for homomorphisms between full groups. Our main application is a characterization of property (T) for ergodic p.m.p. equivalence relations purely in full group terms, without using their topology: an ergodic p.m.p. equivalence relation has (T) iff all non-free ergodic boolean actions of its full group are strongly ergodic.</description>

      <title>Totally deranged elements of almost simple groups and invariable generating sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By a classical theorem of Jordan, every faithful transitive action of a nontrivial finite group has a derangement (an element with no fixed points). The existence of derangements with additional properties has attracted much attention, especially for faithful primitive actions of almost simple groups. In this paper, we show that an almost simple group can have an element that is a derangement in every faithful primitive action, and we call these elements totally deranged. In fact, we classify the totally deranged elements of all almost simple groups, showing that an almost simple group $G$ contains a totally deranged element only if the socle of $G$ is $\mathrm{Sp}_4(2^f)$ or $\mathrm{P}\Omega^+_n(q)$ with $n=2^l \geqslant 8$. Using this, we classify the invariable generating sets of a finite simple group $G$ of the form $\{ x, x^a \}$ where $x \in G$ and $a \in \mathrm{Aut}(G)$, answering a question of Garzoni. As a final application, we classify the elements of almost simple groups that are contained in a unique maximal subgroup $H$ in the case where $H$ is not core-free, which complements the recent work of Guralnick and Tracey addressing the case where $H$ is core-free.</description>

      <title>Exponent-Critical Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define and investigate the property of being `exponent-critical' for a finite group. A finite group is said to be exponent-critical if its exponent is not the least common multiple of the exponents of its proper non-abelian subgroups. We explore properties of exponent-critical groups and give a characterization of such groups. This characterization generalises a classical result of Miller and Moreno on minimal non-abelian groups; interesting families of $p$-groups appear.</description>
