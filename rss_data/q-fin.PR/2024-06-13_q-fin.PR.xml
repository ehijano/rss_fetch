      <title>Heterogeneous Beliefs Model of Stock Market Predictability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a theory of stock market predictability patterns based on a model of heterogeneous beliefs. In a discrete finite time framework, some agents receive news about an asset's fundamental value through a noisy signal. The investors are heterogeneous in that they have different beliefs about the stochastic supply. A momentum in the stock price arises from those agents who incorrectly underestimate the signal accuracy, dampening the initial price impact of the signal. A reversal in price occurs because the price reverts to the fundamental value in the long run. An extension of the model to multiple assets case predicts co-movement and lead-lag effect, in addition to cross-sectional momentum and reversal. The heterogeneous beliefs of investors about news demonstrate how the main predictability anomalies arise endogenously in a model of bounded rationality.</description>

      <title>No-Arbitrage Pricing, Dynamics and Forward Prices of Collateralized Derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.08746v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the pricing of collateralized derivatives, i.e. contracts where counterparties are not only subject to financial derivatives cash flows but also to collateral cash flows arising from a collateral agreement. We do this along the lines of the brilliant approach of the first part of Moreni and Pallavicini (2017): in particular we extend their framework where underlyings are continuous processes driven by a Brownian vector, to a more general setup where underlyings are semimartingales (and hence jump processes). First of all, we briefly derive from scratch the theoretical foundations of the main subsequent achievements, i.e. the extension of the classical No-Arbitrage theory to dividend paying semimartingale assets, where by dividend we mean any cash flow earned/paid from holding the asset. In this part we merge, in the same treatment and under the same notation, the principal known results with some original ones. Then we extend the approach of Moreni and Pallavicini (2017) in different directions and we derive not only the pricing formulae but also the dynamics and forward prices of collateralized derivatives (extending the achievements of the first part of Gabrielli et al. (2019)). Finally, we study some important applications (Repurchase Agreements, Securities Lending and Futures contracts) of previously established theoretical frameworks, obtaining some results that are commonly used in practitioners literature, but often not well understood.</description>
