      <title>Engineering snags for spatial curvature in weaves: Fabrication, mechanics, and inverse design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weaving as an old craft has extensive applications in modern science and technology such as smart textiles and intelligent soft robots. However, weaving irregular curved surfaces has been difficult, with prior alternatives requiring curved ribbons and triaxial weaving patterns. In this work, we present a simple strategy to achieve complex spatial curvature by purposely introducing 'snags', a traditionally unwanted textile defect, into dense plain weaves consisting of straight ribbons assembled in a straightforward biaxial network. We detail the fabrication methodology where we pull out ribbons of initially smooth two- (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) plain weaves to form local snags. We show that these local defects cause global curvatures through the propagation of geometric frustration. We then use a reduced-order bar &amp; hinge model to simulate the mechanics-guided deformation of snagged plain weaves, and we investigate how the curvature scales with system parameters such as the thickness and Young's modulus of the ribbons. Finally, we introduce an inverse design platform where an evolutionary algorithm is used to inversely compute the optimal snag patterns of smooth plain weaves to approximate arbitrary target surfaces including 2D and 3D woven exoskeletons that fit human legs and elbows, respectively. Engineering snags in plain weaves as a general strategy can pave the way for future design of customizable wearable devices, adaptive soft robots, reconfigurable architecture, and more.</description>

      <title>Models for polymer dynamics from dimensionality reduction techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polymer dynamics is analyzed through the lens of linear dimensionality reduction methods, in particular principal (PCA) and time-lagged independent component analysis (tICA). For a polymer undergoing ideal Rouse dynamics, the slow modes identified by these transformations coincide with the conventional Rouse modes. When applied to the Fourier modes of the segment density, we show that tICA generates dynamics equivalent to dynamic self-consistent field theory (D-SCFT) with a wavevector-dependent Onsager coefficient and a free energy functional subject to the random phase approximation (RPA). We then introduce a hidden variable method and a time-local approach to include temporal memory in the tICA-generated dynamics, and generalize it to construct continuum models for the nonequilibrium case of spinodal decomposition of a symmetric diblock copolymer melt.</description>

      <title>A hinge effect that anomalously decreases the stiffness of slender fiber-reinforced composite structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present experimental evidence for an anomalous decrease in stiffness in a fiber-reinforced polymer composite because of the embedded fiber. A shell with carbon fiber showed about 20% less stiffness and 100% more strength under compressive loading. We ruled out the role of debonding of fiber due to imperfect impregnation by using a fiber-pullout test, which revealed that the fiber-matrix interface is strong in the direction of the fiber. Therefore, we hypothesize that a fiber allows the matrix material to rotate around it as in a hinge. We corroborate this phenomenon, which we call the hinge effect, with analytical modelling and experimental data for small and large deformations of a fiber embedded in slender composite beams. We also demonstrate the design of foldable and deployable sheets with hill and valley folds enabled by the embedded fibers. Moreover, the hinge effect warrants further research into physics of how fibers in slender composite structures give rise to the anomalous flexibility. This effect can be gainfully used in designing novel origami structures and compliant mechanisms should be flexible and strong.</description>

      <title>Interplay of distinct modes of charge regulation on poly-acid ionization and conformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We adapt the Edwards-Muthukumar theoretical framework for a single polymer chain to investigate the interplay between proton binding and counterion condensation for poly-acids. We find that changes to pH enable non-monotonic transitions between anti- and conventional polyelectrolyte behaviors. In the former, the net charge and the overall dimensions increase with increasing salt concentration, while the converse is true for conventional polyelectrolytes. The polymeric nature and local solvent polarization drive significant pKa shifts when compared to the values of reference monoacids. These pKa shifts are enhanced in semi-flexible chains.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Work Fluctuations in Force-induced Melting of a Short B-DNA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A system of a solvated canonical B-DNA of 12 base pairs with the specified sequence is initially equilibrated in a state of zero external force $f$ acting on it. After equilibration, a switching experiment is performed over the system by pulling one end of the DNA while restraining its other end. The finite time pulling process is performed at a constant rate of the applied force until a maximum value of 400 pN. The associated nonequilibrium work done $(W)$ during this process is determined by numerically integrating the force-extension curve as a function of the applied force. An ensemble of the work values, $P(W)$, is obtained by repeating the pulling experiment a large number of times. We determine the free energy difference $(\Delta F)$ between the equilibrium and force-induced melted states of the DNA by employing the Jarzynski equality. The value of $\Delta F$ is found to be in close agreement with the conventional equilibrium methods.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the access conductance of a charged nanopore membrane</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric-field-driven electrolyte transport through nanoporous membranes is important for applications including osmotic power generation, sensing and iontronics. We derive an analytical equation in the Debye--H\"uckel regime and a semi-analytical equation for arbitrary surface potentials for the electric-field-driven electric current through a pore in an ultrathin membrane, which predict scaling with fractional powers of the pore size and Debye length. We show that our theory for arbitrary electric potentials accurately quantifies the ionic conductance through an ultrathin membrane in finite-element method numerical simulations for a wide range of parameters, and generalizes a widely used theory for the access electrical conductance of a membrane nanopore to a broader range of conditions. Our theory predicts that fractional scaling of the ionic conductance with electrolyte concentration at low concentrations is a general property of charged ultrathin membranes and also occurs for thicker membranes for which the access contribution to the conductance dominates, which could explain experimental observations of this widely debated phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Competition between mirror symmetry breaking and translation symmetry breaking in ferroelectric liquid crystals with increasing lateral substitution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently discovered heliconical ferroelectric nematic (NTBF) phase is a unique example of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in a proper ferroelectric fluid. In this study, we investigate four homologous series of mesogenic compounds, differing in the degree of fluorination of the mesogenic core and bearing lateral alkoxy substituents of varying lengths, to understand how molecular architecture influences the formation and stability of the NTBF phase. Increasing the length of the lateral chain lowers the phase transition temperatures and suppresses smectic layer formation, enabling the emergence of the NTBF phase which replaces the orthogonal ferroelectric smectic A (SmAF) phase. This indicates a competition between lamellar and heliconical polar ordering, driven by the interplay of strong molecular dipoles and the self-segregation of chemically incompatible molecular segments that typically favor layered structures. Notably, the NTBF phase in these compounds exhibits exceptionally short helical pitch lengths, on the order of a few hundred nanometers, as revealed by selective light reflection and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Furthermore, for one of the studied compounds AFM imaging of one compound revealed a regular array of screw dislocations within the NTBF phase, suggesting a possible link to more complex modulated or twist-grain-boundary-like structures.</description>

      <title>Optical Measurement of Mass Density of Biological Samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mass density is a vital property for improved biophysical understanding of and within biological samples. It is increasingly attracting active investigation, but still lacks reliable, non-contact techniques to accurately characterize it in biological systems. Contrary to popular belief, refractive index information alone is insufficient to determine a sample's mass density, as we demonstrate here theoretically and experimentally. Instead, we measured the nonlinear gain of stimulated Brillouin scattering to provide additional information for mass density estimation. This all-optical method reduces the estimation error tenfold, offering a more accurate and universal technique for mass density measurements.</description>

      <title>Drag Coefficient in Near-Critical Binary Mixtures: Solving Hydrodynamic Fields with Improved Numerics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the drag coefficient of a spherical particle suspended in a near-critical binary fluid mixture. To capture the scaling behavior associated with critical adsorption in the strong adsorption regime, we employ the framework of local renormalized functional theory. Previous theoretical studies encountered numerical difficulties when attempting to solve the coupled hydrodynamic and chemical potential equations, expressed as integral equations, for systems with large bulk correlation lengths. These difficulties limited direct comparison with experimental results. In this study, we overcome those limitations by reformulating the hydrodynamic equations as a set of ordinary differential equations using a compactified radial coordinate. This approach enables more stable numerical computation and facilitates the implementation of appropriate boundary conditions at large distances from the particle. As a result, we successfully compute the drag coefficient over a broader range of bulk correlation lengths than in previous works and compare our theoretical predictions with available experimental data.</description>

      <title>A catastrophic approach to designing interacting hysterons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a framework for analyzing collections of interacting hysterons through the lens of catastrophe theory. By modeling hysteron dynamics as a gradient system, we show how to construct hysteron transition graphs by characterizing the fold bifurcations of the dynamical system. Transition graphs represent the sequence of hysterons switching states, providing critical insights into the collective behavior of driven disordered media. Extending this analysis to higher codimension bifurcations, such as cusp bifurcations and crossings of fold curves, allows us to map out how the topology of transition graphs changes with variations in system parameters. This approach can suggest strategies for designing metamaterials capable of encoding targeted memory and computational functionalities, but it also highlights the rapid increase of design complexity with system size, further underscoring the computational challenges of controlling large hysteretic systems.</description>

      <title>Depth-Resolved Vibrational SFG/DFG Spectroscopy of the Anisotropic Water Structure at Charged Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The molecular structure of water at charged aqueous interfaces is shaped by interfacial electric fields, which can induce significant anisotropy in the molecular orientations that extends over nanometer-scale distances. Despite great relevance, very little is known about the details of this depth-dependent anisotropic water structure, mainly due to the lack of appropriate experimental techniques. Here, we present a time-domain spectrometer specifically developed to acquire depth-resolved nonlinear vibrational spectra at aqueous interfaces. The approach is based on combining phase-resolved vibrational sum- and difference-frequency spectra and enables the extraction of depth information on the nanometer scale. The analysis of the acquired resonant spectral line shapes meanwhile yields insight into local hydrogen-bond structures and anisotropic molecular orientations across the interfacial region. In measurements with insoluble charged surfactants, we demonstrate that the obtained data allows for a full reconstruction of the nonlinear vibrational responses as function of depth. The results show the presence of two pronounced regions within the interfacial anisotropy with largely deviating degrees of preferential molecular orientations. A spectral analysis of the depth-dependent vibrational responses furthermore reveals that the natural local hydrogen-bond structure of bulk water remains intact throughout the interfacial region, including water in the direct proximity of the surface charges. These findings significantly refine our understanding of the anisotropic water structure at the interface to charged surfactants and showcase the large potential of our depth-resolved spectroscopic technique.</description>

      <title>Experimental evidence for strong emergent correlations between particles in a switching trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We experimentally study a gas of $N = 8$ one-dimensional Brownian particles, each confined in a harmonic trap with identical stiffness. The stiffness switches simultaneously between two values at random Poissonian times. This collective switching drives the system into a non-equilibrium stationary state (NESS) with strong long-range correlations between the positions of the particles. Remarkably, we find that these switching-induced emergent correlations completely overwhelm the hydrodynamic interactions between the particles mediated via the surrounding fluid. Comparing with exact theoretical predictions for noninteracting particles, we observe excellent agreement between theory and experiments for multiple observables, including the correlations between particles, extreme value and order statistics (maxima, minima and ranked positions) and the full counting statistics (i.e., the distribution of the number of particles in a finite interval $[-L, L]$ around the trap center).</description>

      <title>Aging in a two-dimensional swarmalator crystal with delayed interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time delay can have a significant impact on the properties of collective organization of active matter. In the previous paper [1], we discussed delay-induced breathing in a system of swarmalators - a model coupling particles' internal phases to spatial interactions. Here we build on that study to investigate the aging phenomenon in this system. It is the aging of a two-dimensional crystal with defects and inhomogeneous lattice constants, and takes place after the breathing transients subside. We show that aging proceeds through the gradual elimination of five-fold and seven-fold coordination number defects, which merge pairwise or migrate to the cluster boundary, incrementally increasing the hexatic order parameter in the bulk. Despite this process, defects usually do not fully disappear; some residual number of defects remain frozen in the interior. However, we found that it is possible to achieve a nearly total elimination of coordination number defects at sufficiently low delay - when the surface of the cluster develops a sufficeintly thick fluidized ``boiling layer''. This mechanism of boundary-mediated annealing reveals a non-equilibrium pathway to achieving high crystalline order in the bulk, and raises a tantalizing possibility for controlling defects in active matter with free boundaries.</description>

      <title>An effective potential for generative modelling with active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Score-based diffusion models generate samples from a complex underlying data distribution by time-reversal of a diffusion process and represent the state-of-the-art in many generative AI applications such as artificial image synthesis. Here, I show how a generative diffusion model can be implemented based on an underlying active particle process with finite correlation time. In contrast to previous approaches that use a score function acting on the velocity coordinate of the active particle, time reversal is here achieved by imposing an effective time-dependent potential on the position coordinate only. The effective potential is valid to first order in the persistence time and leads to a force field that is fully determined by the standard score function and its derivatives up to 2nd order. Numerical experiments for artificial data distributions confirm the validity of the effective potential.</description>

      <title>Attraction-enhanced emergence of friction in colloidal matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.12703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How frictional effects emerge at the microscopic level in particulate materials remains a challenging question, particularly in systems subject to thermal fluctuations due to the transient nature of interparticle contacts. Here, we directly relate particle-level frictional arrest to local coordination in an attractive colloidal model system. We reveal that the orientational dynamics of particles slows down exponentially with increasing coordination number due to the emergence of frictional interactions, the strength of which can be tuned simply by varying the attraction strength. Using a simple computer simulation model, we uncover how the interparticle interactions govern the formation of frictional contacts between particles. Our results establish quantitative relations between friction, coordination and interparticle interactions. This is a key step towards using interparticle friction to tune the mechanical properties of particulate materials.</description>

      <title>Unified percolation scenario for the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ processes in simple glass formers</title>

Abstract: Given the vast differences in interaction details, describing the dynamics of structurally disordered materials in a unified theoretical framework presents a fundamental challenge to condensed-matter physics and materials science. Here, we numerically investigate a double-percolation scenario for the two most important relaxation processes of supercooled liquids and glasses, the so-called alpha and beta relaxations. For several simple glass formers, we find that when monitoring the dynamic shear modulus as temperature is lowered from the liquid state, percolation of immobile particles takes place at the temperature locating the alpha process. Mirroring this, upon continued cooling into the glass state, the mobile-particle percolation transition pinpoints a beta process whenever the latter is well separated from the main (alpha) process. For two-dimensional systems under the same conditions, percolation of mobile and immobile particles occurs nearly simultaneously and no beta relaxation can be identified. Our findings suggest that a general description of glassy dynamics should be based on a percolation perspective.</description>

      <title>Shear-Rate Dependent Surface Tension of Glass-Forming Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the interface of a glass-forming fluid showing non-Newtonian rheology. By applying shear flow in the interface, we detect that the surface tension depends on the shear rate. Importantly, the standard way of determining surface tension from the pressure drop across the interface gives rise to an effective surface tension in the non-Newtonian fluid that mixes bulk and interface properties. We show how the pressure anisotropy can be used to clearly define the bulk and interface regions and extract a genuine shear-rate dependent surface tension. The results have implications for measurement techniques related to interfacial rheology of complex fluids.</description>

      <title>Evolving transport properties of dynamic hydrogels enable self-tuning of short- and long-term cargo delivery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14915v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hydrogels are crosslinked polymer networks with high water content, widely employed in biomedical applications such as drug delivery, tissue engineering, and regenerative medicine. Injectable, depot-forming hydrogels enable sustained release of therapeutic agents by modulating macromolecular diffusion through dynamic polymer networks. However, achieving reliable control over release kinetics remains a challenge, as the injection process induces shear-mediated disruption of transient crosslinks, leading to an initial burst release that can cause local toxicity and compromise therapeutic efficacy. Here, we present a hydrogel formulation strategy designed to restore network structure post-injection through rapid reformation of dynamic crosslinks, enabling time-dependent regulation of diffusion properties. By tuning viscoelastic parameters, including stress relaxation time and network recovery rate, we reduced the extent of burst release without compromising sustained delivery. Using model protein cargo, we demonstrate in both $in~vitro$ and $in~vivo$ settings that hydrogels with faster crosslink reformation kinetics exhibit significantly lower early-phase release while maintaining long-term delivery comparable to unmodified formulations. These results establish a mechanistic framework for decoupling short- and long-term release behavior, offering a broadly applicable strategy for precise drug delivery in soft tissue environments.</description>

Abstract: In recent years the Swap Monte Carlo algorithm has led to remarkable progress in equilibrating supercooled model liquids at low temperatures. Applications have so far been limited to systems composed of spherical particles, however, whereas most real-world supercooled liquids are molecular. We here introduce a simple size-polydisperse molecular model that allows for efficient thermal equilibration in silico with the Swap Monte Carlo method, resulting in an estimated speedup of 1,000-1,000,000 at moderate polydispersity (5-10%). The model exhibits little difference between size-resolved orientational time-autocorrelation functions.</description>

      <title>Braided mixing in confined chiral active matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient mixing of fluids is essential in many practical applications to achieve homogeneity. For microscopic systems, however, both diffusion and turbulence are ineffective methods to achieve chaotic mixing due to the low Reynolds number, hence either active stirring or inducing turbulence through geometric boundary effects are generally implemented. Here, we study a modified chiral Vicsek model, where active microswimmers act as moving rods, stirring the surrounding substrate. We study the degree of mixing in the patterns formed by interplay between confinement, chiral motion and alignment interactions. This mixing is computed by considering the entanglement of spacetime trajectories of the particles, which forms a braid. Optimising the finite-time braiding exponent of this braid then yields a set of constituent parameters of the system, showing that a pattern consisting of a local stable vortex droplet and an ordered oscillating phase achieves the highest degree of mixing.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, the tunneling mechanism of cavitation in liquid helium for 3He and 4He is considered on the basis of the Schr\"odinger-like equation. It is assumed that the pairwise interactions of helium atoms are determined by the Lennard-Jones potential. The kinetics of nucleation and the mechanism that limits the growth of cavitation bubbles in liquid helium are considered, taking into account their growth in a negative pressure field.</description>

      <title>Comparative molecular dynamics simulations of charged solid-liquid interfaces with different water models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aqueous solid-liquid interfaces (SLI) are ubiquitous in nature and technology, often hosting molecular-level processes with macroscopic consequences. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations offer a tool of choice to investigate interfacial phenomena with atomistic precision, but there exists a large number of water models, each optimised for a different purpose. Here we compare the ability of common water models to accurately simulate the interface between a charged silica surface and an aqueous solution containing NaCl. We first compare the bulk dielectric constant of water and its dependence on salt concentration for SPC/Fw, SPC/e, TIPS3p, H2O/DC, TIP3P-Fw, OPC3, TIP3P, TIP3P-FB, TIP3P-ST, FBA/e, and TIPS3p-PPPM, revealing large variations between models. Simulating the interface with silica for the most suitable water models (SPC/Fw, H2O/DC, TIP3-ST and TIPS3p-PPPM) show some intrinsic consistency with continuum predictions (Poisson-Boltzmann) whereby the free energy minima obtained from MD and the analytical model are in agreement, provided the latter includes the MD-determined total charge of ions in the Stern layer and dielectric constant. This consistency stands even for water models with a dielectric constant off by 100%. For salt concentrations higher than 0.21 M NaCl, the formation of random ion-ion pairs limits the reproducibility of the MD results and the applicability of the analytical method. The results highlight the applicability of the analytical model down to the nanoscale, provided a priory knowledge of the Stern layer charge is available. The findings could have significant implications for MD simulations of SLIs, especially at charged or electrified interfaces.</description>

      <title>Odd elasticity in disordered chiral active materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chiral active materials are abundant in nature, including the cytoskeleton with attached motor proteins, rotary clusters of bacteria flagella, and self-spinning starfish embryos. These materials break both time reversal and mirror-image (parity) symmetries due to injection of torques at the microscale. Recently, it was found that chiral active materials may show a new type of elastic response termed `odd' elasticity. Currently, odd elasticity is understood microscopically only in ordered structures, e.g., lattice designs of metamaterials. It still remains to explore how odd elasticity can emerge in natural or biological systems, which are usually disordered. To address this, we propose a minimal generic model for disordered `odd solids', using micropolar (Cosserat) elasticity in the presence of local active torques. We find that odd elasticity naturally emerges as a nonlinear effect of internal particle rotations. Exploring the viscoelasticity of this solid, when immersed in active self-spinning solvent (`odd fluid'), we discover both dynamically unstable regions and regions in which bulk waves can propagate even in an overdamped solid.</description>

      <title>Unexpectedly large entropic barrier controls bond rearrangements in vitrimers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vitrimers are a relatively new class of polymeric materials containing associative covalent dynamic bonds that make them recyclable by design. However, the fundamental mechanisms controlling their viscoelastic properties remain poorly understood. Our detailed studies of relaxation dynamics and viscoelastic behavior of model vitrimers revealed that the density of dynamic covalent crosslinks has no influence on chain dynamics (beyond a weak change in the glass transition temperature), yet it strongly affects the linear viscoelasticity of vitrimers. Increasing the crosslink density induces a sol-gel transition consistent with predictions of classical gelation theory, demonstrating its applicability to vitrimers. Remarkably, the temperature-dependent analysis of the bond rearrangement time reveals an unexpectedly large negative activation entropy in the transition state that strongly slows down the bond exchange process despite its relatively low activation enthalpy. This insight explains the unusual long timescale for bond rearrangement in vitrimers and highlights the significance of entropy in controlling the viscoelasticity of dynamic covalent networks.</description>

      <title>Anomalous size effects with fixed criticality in bistable flexible mechanical metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00187v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When the structure deformation is dominated by the low-energy deformation mode, the structure hardens with the increase in the size (number of units) at small sizes. This anomalous behavior will eventually disappear with the decay length of the finite structure converging to a size-independent characteristic quantity, but the specific critical point at which the anomalous behavior disappears still cannot be accurately and concisely described. Here, under two steady states of the bistable chain, we observed anomalous size effects with constant and oscillating criticality (the proportion of inhomogeneous deformation), two criticalities exactly separate the increasing and decreasing intervals of stiffness variation. They are interrelated due to the implied symmetries between the two steady states. On the other hand, they are distinguished because of the opposite superposition modes under the two steady states. Specifically, the constant criticality corresponds to the anomalous size effect achieved by the competition mechanism, while the oscillating criticality reveals an anomalous size effect achieved by the new mechanism (cancellation mechanism). In the anomalous size effect achieved by the cancellation mechanism, the singular characteristics generated by the completely cancelled deformation make it very robust. This robustness reflects in that the anomalous effect is no longer limited to linear small deformation, but it can still be observed stably in nonlinear large deformation. Our study reinterprets the anomalous size effect at a quantitative level, and the proposed cancellation mechanism expands the possible application range of this anomalous effect.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a model in which cells belonging to two species proliferate with volume exclusion on an expanding surface. If the surface expands uniformly, we show that the domains formed by the two species present a critical behavior. We compute the critical exponents characterizing the decay of interfaces and the size distribution of domains using a mean-field theory. These mean-field exponents agree very accurately with those fitted in numerical simulations, suggesting that the theory is exact.</description>

      <title>Costs and benefits of phytoplankton motility</title>

Abstract: The motility skills of phytoplankton have evolved and persisted over millions of years, primarily in response to factors such as nutrient and light availability, temperature and viscosity gradients, turbulence, and predation pressure. Phytoplankton motility is broadly categorized into swimming and buoyancy regulation. Despite studies in the literature exploring the motility costs and benefits of phytoplankton, there remains a gap in our integrative understanding of direct and indirect energy expenditures, starting from when an organism initiates movement due to any biophysical motive, to when the organism encounters intracellular and environmental challenges. Here we gather available pieces of this puzzle from literature in biology, physics, and oceanography to paint an overarching picture of our current knowledge. The characterization of sinking and rising behavior as passive motility has resulted in the concept of sinking and rising internal efficiency being overlooked. We define this efficiency based on any energy dissipation associated with processes of mass density adjustment, as exemplified in structures like frustules and vacuoles. We propose that sinking and rising are active motility processes involving non-visible mechanisms, as species demonstrate active and rapid strategies in response to turbulence, predation risk, and gradients of nutrients, light, temperature, and viscosity. Identifying intracellular buoyancy-regulating dissipative processes offers deeper insight into the motility costs relative to the organism's total metabolic rate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The electro-hydrodynamics near conducting walls is revisited. Attention is focused on the impact of an explicit diffuse Stern layer, which permittivity and viscosity differ from the bulk values, on the velocity of an electro-osmotic plug flow. To solve this problem we propose an approach of mapping the flow in the Stern layer to the surface dividing the Stern and diffuse layer, where an effective electro-hydrodynamic slip boundary condition is imposed. The latter implies that an effective surface charge is responding to the applied field and characterized by a mobility parameter $\mu \geq 1$. We derive analytic equations for $\mu$ and demonstrate that it is determined only by electrostatic properties of the electric double layer. These equations are then used to calculate electrokinetic (zeta) potentials of surfaces. We show that the zeta potential generally exceeds the surface one, which implies an amplification of the electro-osmotic flow. This effect is most pronounced if the hydrodynamic slip length is large and/or in concentrated solutions.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive Darcy-type law for viscoplastic fluids: I. Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06184v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A comprehensive Darcy-type law for viscoplastic fluids is proposed. Different regimes of yield-stress fluid flow in porous media can be categorised based on the Bingham number (i.e. the ratio of the yield stress to the characteristic viscous stress). In a recent study (Chaparian, J. Fluid Mech., vol. 980, A14, 2024), we addressed the yield/plastic limit (infinitely large Bingham number), namely, the onset of flow when the applied pressure gradient is just sufficient to overcome the yield stress resistance and initiate the flow. A purely geometrical universal scale was derived for the non-dimensional critical pressure gradient, which was thoroughly validated against computational data. In the present work, we investigate the Newtonian limit (infinitely large pressure difference compared to the yield stress of the fluid - ultra low Bingham number) both theoretically and computationally. We then propose a Darcy-type law applicable across the entire range of Bingham numbers by combining the mathematical models of the yield/plastic and Newtonian limits. Exhaustive computational data generated in this study (using augmented Lagrangian method coupled with anisotropic adaptive mesh at the pore scale) confirm the validity of the theoretical proposed law.</description>
