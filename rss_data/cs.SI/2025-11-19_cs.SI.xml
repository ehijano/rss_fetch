      <title>Opinion formation at Ising social networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the process of opinion formation in an Ising social network of scientific collaborations. The network is undirected. An Ising spin is associated with each network node being oriented up (red) or down (blue). Certain nodes carry fixed, opposite opinions whose influence propagates over the other spins, which are flipped according to the majority-influence opinion of neighbors of a given spin during the asynchronous Monte Carlo process. The amplitude influence of each spin is self-consistently adapted, and a flip occurs only if this majority influence exceeds a certain conviction threshold. All non-fixed spins are initially randomly distributed, with half of them oriented up and half down. Such a system can be viewed as a model of elite influence, coming from the fixed spins, on the opinions of the crowd of non-fixed spins. We show that a phase transition occurs as the amplitude influence of the crowd spins increases: the dominant opinion shifts from that of the elite nodes to a phase in which the crowd spins' opinion becomes dominant and the elite can no longer impose their views.</description>

      <title>PRITES: An integrative framework for investigating and assessing web-scraped HTTP-response datasets for research applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to programmatically retrieve vast quantities of data from online sources has given rise to increasing usage of web-scraped datasets for various purposes across government, industry and academia. Contemporaneously, there has also been growing discussion about the statistical qualities and limitations of collecting from online data sources and analysing web-scraped datasets. However, literature on web-scraping is distributed across computer science, statistical methodology and application domains, with distinct and occasionally conflicting definitions of web-scraping and conceptualisations of web-scraped data quality. This work synthesises technical and statistical concepts, best practices and insights across these relevant disciplines to inform documentation during web-scraping processes, and quality assessment of the resultant web-scraped datasets.
  We propose an integrated framework to cover multiple processes during the creation of web-scraped datasets including 'Plan', 'Retrieve', 'Investigate', 'Transform', 'Evaluate' and 'Summarise' (PRITES). The framework groups related quality factors which should be monitored during the collection of new web-scraped data, and/or investigated when assessing potential applications of existing web-scraped datasets. We connect each stage to existing discussions of technical and statistical challenges in collecting and analysing web-scraped data. We then apply the framework to describe related work by the co-authors to adapt web-scraped retail prices for alcoholic beverages collected by an industry data partner into analysis-ready datasets for public health policy research. The case study illustrates how the framework supports accurate and comprehensive scientific reporting of studies using web-scraped datasets.</description>

      <title>Complex-Weighted Convolutional Networks: Provable Expressiveness via Complex Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse applications, yet they remain limited by oversmoothing and poor performance on heterophilic graphs. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework that equips graphs with a complex-weighted structure, assigning each edge a complex number to drive a diffusion process that extends random walks into the complex domain. We prove that this diffusion is highly expressive: with appropriately chosen complex weights, any node-classification task can be solved in the steady state of a complex random walk. Building on this insight, we propose the Complex-Weighted Convolutional Network (CWCN), which learns suitable complex-weighted structures directly from data while enriching diffusion with learnable matrices and nonlinear activations. CWCN is simple to implement, requires no additional hyperparameters beyond those of standard GNNs, and achieves competitive performance on benchmark datasets. Our results demonstrate that complex-weighted diffusion provides a principled and general mechanism for enhancing GNN expressiveness, opening new avenues for models that are both theoretically grounded and practically effective.</description>

      <title>Collaborative QA using Interacting LLMs. Impact of Network Structure, Node Capability and Distributed Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we model and analyze how a network of interacting LLMs performs collaborative question-answering (CQA) in order to estimate a ground truth given a distributed set of documents. This problem is interesting because LLMs often hallucinate when direct evidence to answer a question is lacking, and these effects become more pronounced in a network of interacting LLMs. The hallucination spreads, causing previously accurate LLMs to hallucinate. We study interacting LLMs and their hallucination by combining novel ideas of mean-field dynamics (MFD) from network science and the randomized utility model from economics to construct a useful generative model. We model the LLM with a latent state that indicates if it is truthful or not with respect to the ground truth, and extend a tractable analytical model considering an MFD to model the diffusion of information in a directed network of LLMs. To specify the probabilities that govern the dynamics of the MFD, we propose a randomized utility model. For a network of LLMs, where each LLM has two possible latent states, we posit sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of a fixed point and analyze the behavior of the fixed point in terms of the incentive (e.g., test-time compute) given to individual LLMs. We experimentally study and analyze the behavior of a network of $100$ open-source LLMs with respect to data heterogeneity, node capability, network structure, and sensitivity to framing on multiple semi-synthetic datasets.</description>

      <title>Beyond Trivial Edges: A Fractional Approach to Cohesive Subgraph Detection in Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hypergraphs serve as a powerful tool for modeling complex relationships across domains like social networks, transactions, and recommendation systems. The (k,g)-core model effectively identifies cohesive subgraphs by assessing internal connections and co-occurrence patterns, but it is susceptible to inflated cohesiveness due to trivial hyperedges. To address this, we propose the $(k,g,p)$-core model, which incorporates the relative importance of hyperedges for more accurate subgraph detection. We develop both Na\"ive and Advanced pruning algorithms, demonstrating through extensive experiments that our approach reduces the execution frequency of costly operations by 51.9% on real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Quantifying community evolution in temporal networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10632v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When we detect communities in temporal networks it is important to ask questions about how they change in time. Normalised Mutual Information (NMI) has been used to measure the similarity of communities when the nodes on a network do not change. We propose two extensions namely Union-Normalised Mutual Information (UNMI) and Intersection-Normalised Mutual Information (INMI). UNMI and INMI evaluate the similarity of community structure under the condition of node variation. Experiments show that these methods are effective in dealing with temporal networks with the changes in the set of nodes, and can capture the dynamic evolution of community structure in both synthetic and real temporal networks. This study not only provides a new similarity measurement method for network analysis but also helps to deepen the understanding of community change in complex temporal networks.</description>

      <title>GTENN: A Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Framework for Community Discovery in Dynamic Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Community discovery is one of the key issues in the study of dynamic social networks. Traditional community discovery algorithms mainly focus on the formation and dissolution of links between nodes, and thus fail to capture richer spatial and temporal patterns underlying network evolution. To address this limitation, we propose GTENN, a spatiotemporal graph neural framework for community discovery in dynamic social networks. GTENN integrates spatial structure and temporal dynamics within a unified embedding architecture. First, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) are employed to aggregate latent spatial information and learn expressive node representations at each snapshot. Next, Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) are used to model temporal evolutions of node embeddings, effectively capturing node dynamism and relationship propagation across time. Finally, a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) is applied to the learned spatiotemporal embeddings to cluster nodes and infer their community affiliations. We conduct experiments on four types of dynamic networks, and the results show that GTENN consistently outperforms traditional community discovery algorithms in terms of purity, normalized mutual information, homogeneity, and completeness. These findings demonstrate the superior ability of GTENN to accurately uncover evolving community structures hidden in dynamic social networks.</description>

      <title>Topic and Sentiment Trends in Semaglutide Discussions on X: Subpopulation-Based Longitudinal Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: User experience strongly influences pharmaceutical drug effectiveness. Social media platforms like X have become major spaces where people share medication-related experiences, especially for widely marketed drugs such as semaglutide. Despite high activity online, how different user groups engage in semaglutide discussions remains unclear.
  Objective: This study examines how semaglutide is perceived and discussed across X user groups by analyzing (1) changes in sentiment over time and (2) key discussion topics.
  Methods: We collected 859,751 posts about semaglutide from July 2021 to April 2024, along with metadata. We performed sentiment analysis and topic modeling to evaluate patterns across user subpopulations and time periods.
  Results: The overall mean sentiment was -0.24, with all groups showing declines over time. Discussions focused on weight loss, side effects, costs, and celebrity or political influence. Organizational accounts expressed less negative sentiment (mean = -0.04) than individuals (mean = -0.28), a statistically significant difference (P &lt; .001). An interrupted time-series analysis showed a sentiment drop between Nov 2022 and Jan 2023, coinciding with regulatory announcements. We also found gender differences: posts by female users contained more discussions of celebrities and politicians (21 percent) compared to male users (17 percent), while male users expressed more positive sentiment.
  Conclusions: This study highlights how diverse user groups perceive and discuss semaglutide. Although sentiment was broadly negative, important differences emerged across subpopulations. These findings have implications for health communication and pharmacovigilance.</description>

      <title>A local eigenvector centrality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03608v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Eigenvector centrality is an established measure of global connectivity, from which the importance and influence of nodes can be inferred. We introduce a local eigenvector centrality that incorporates both local and global connectivity. This new measure references prominent eigengaps and combines their associated eigenspectrum, via the Euclidean norm, to detect centrality that reflects the influence of prominent community structures. In contact networks, with clearly defined community structures, local eigenvector centrality is shown to identify similar but distinct distributions to eigenvector centrality applied on each community in isolation and PageRank. Discrepancies between the two eigenvector measures highlight nodes and communities that do not conform to their defined local structures, e.g. nodes with more connections outside of their defined community than within it. While reference to PageRank's centrality assessment enables a mitigation strategy for localisation effects inherent in eigenvector-based measures. In networks without clearly defined communities, such as city road networks, local eigenvector centrality is shown to identify both locally prominent and globally connected hubs.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Sanctions on decentralised Privacy Tools: A Case Study of Tornado Cash</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09443v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of sanctions on Tornado Cash, a smart contract protocol designed to enhance transaction privacy. Following the U.S. Department of the Treasury's sanctions against Tornado Cash in August 2022, platform activity declined sharply. We document a significant and sustained reduction in transaction volume, user diversity, and overall protocol utilization after the sanctions were imposed. Our analysis draws on transaction data from three major blockchains: Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain, and Polygon. We further examine developments following the partial lifting and eventual removal of sanctions by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in March 2025. Although activity partially recovered, the rebound remained limited. The Tornado Cash case illustrates how regulatory interventions can affect decentralized protocols, while also highlighting the challenges of fully enforcing such measures in decentralized environments.</description>

      <title>Leveraging LLM-based agents for social science research: insights from citation network simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03758v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrates their potential to encapsulate the logic and patterns inherent in human behavior simulation by leveraging extensive web data pre-training. However, the boundaries of LLM capabilities in social simulation remain unclear. To further explore the social attributes of LLMs, we introduce the CiteAgent framework, designed to generate citation networks based on human-behavior simulation with LLM-based agents. CiteAgent successfully captures predominant phenomena in real-world citation networks, including power-law distribution, citational distortion, and shrinking diameter. Building on this realistic simulation, we establish two LLM-based research paradigms in social science: LLM-SE (LLM-based Survey Experiment) and LLM-LE (LLM-based Laboratory Experiment). These paradigms facilitate rigorous analyses of citation network phenomena, allowing us to validate and challenge existing theories. Additionally, we extend the research scope of traditional science of science studies through idealized social experiments, with the simulation experiment results providing valuable insights for real-world academic environments. Our work demonstrates the potential of LLMs for advancing science of science research in social science.</description>
