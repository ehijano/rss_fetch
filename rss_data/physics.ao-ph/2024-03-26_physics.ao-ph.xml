      <title>HEAL-ViT: Vision Transformers on a spherical mesh for medium-range weather forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, a variety of ML architectures and techniques have seen success in producing skillful medium range weather forecasts. In particular, Vision Transformer (ViT)-based models (e.g. Pangu-Weather, FuXi) have shown strong performance, working nearly "out-of-the-box" by treating weather data as a multi-channel image on a rectilinear grid. While a rectilinear grid is appropriate for 2D images, weather data is inherently spherical and thus heavily distorted at the poles on a rectilinear grid, leading to disproportionate compute being used to model data near the poles. Graph-based methods (e.g. GraphCast) do not suffer from this problem, as they map the longitude-latitude grid to a spherical mesh, but are generally more memory intensive and tend to need more compute resources for training and inference. While spatially homogeneous, the spherical mesh does not lend itself readily to be modeled by ViT-based models that implicitly rely on the rectilinear grid structure. We present HEAL-ViT, a novel architecture that uses ViT models on a spherical mesh, thus benefiting from both the spatial homogeneity enjoyed by graph-based models and efficient attention-based mechanisms exploited by transformers. HEAL-ViT produces weather forecasts that outperform the ECMWF IFS on key metrics, and demonstrate better bias accumulation and blurring than other ML weather prediction models. Further, the lowered compute footprint of HEAL-ViT makes it attractive for operational use as well, where other models in addition to a 6-hourly prediction model may be needed to produce the full set of operational forecasts required.</description>

      <title>Assessment of Climate Change Impacts on the Precipitation and Temperature: A Case Study on Krishna River Basin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09311</link>

Abstract: In this study, the statistical downscaling model (SDSM) is employed for downscaling the precipitation (PREC), maximum temperature (T max ) and minimum temperature (T min ) over Krishna River Basin (KRB). The Canadian Earth System Model, version 2 (CanESM2) General Circulation Model (GCM) outputs were considered as predictor variables. First, the SDSM is calibrated using 30-years (1961-1990) of data and subsequently validated for 15-years (1991-2005). Upon perceiving the satisfactory performance, the SDSM is further used for projecting the predictand variables (PRECP, T max and T min ) for the 21 st century considering three Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios viz. RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. The future period is divided into three 30-year time slices named epoch-1 (2011-2040), epoch-2 (2041-2070) and epoch-3 (2071-2100) respectively. Further, 1976-2005 is considered as baseline period and all the future results are compared with this data. The results were analysed at various temporal scales, i.e., monthly, seasonal and annual. The study reveals that the KRB is going to become wetter during all the seasons. The results are discussed for the worst-case scenario i.e., RCP8.5 epoch-3. The average annual maximum and minimum temperature is expected to increase. The extreme event analysis is also carried out considering the 90 th and 95 th percentile values. It is noticed that the extreme (90 th and 95 th percentiles) are going to increase. There are events more than extreme values. The outcome of this study can be used in flood modelling for the KRB and also for the modelling of future irrigation demands along with the planning of optimal irrigation in the KRB culturable command area.</description>

      <title>A Novel Hybrid Machine Learning Model for Rapid Assessment of Wave and Storm Surge Responses Over an Extended Coastal Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Storm surge and waves are responsible for a substantial portion of tropical and extratropical cyclones-related damages. While high-fidelity numerical models have significantly advanced the simulation accuracy of storm surge and waves, they are not practical to be employed for probabilistic analysis, risk assessment or rapid prediction due to their high computational demands. In this study, a novel hybrid model combining dimensionality reduction and data-driven techniques is developed for rapid assessment of waves and storm surge responses over an extended coastal region. Specifically, the hybrid model simultaneously identifies a low-dimensional representation of the high-dimensional spatial system based on a deep autoencoder (DAE) while mapping the storm parameters to the obtained low-dimensional latent space using a deep neural network (DNN). To train the hybrid model, a combined weighted loss function is designed to encourage a balance between DAE and DNN training and achieve the best accuracy. The performance of the hybrid model is evaluated through a case study using the synthetic data from the North Atlantic Comprehensive Coastal Study (NACCS) covering critical regions within New York and New Jersey. In addition, the proposed approach is compared with two decoupled models where the regression model is based on DNN and the reduction techniques are either principal component analysis (PCA) or DAE which are trained separately from the DNN model. High accuracy and computational efficiency are observed for the hybrid model which could be readily implemented as part of early warning systems or probabilistic risk assessment of waves and storm surge.</description>

      <title>Performance-based ice engineering: a data-driven multi-scale approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ice storms are one of the most devastating natural hazards which have the potential to inflict significant damage to the built environment. The multi-hazard nature of ice events complicates the analysis of their induced risk due to their inherent nonlinear interactions. In addition, the concurrent and interacting hazards are often responsible for several aerodynamical/dynamical instabilities such as the galloping mechanism. Moreover, the existing risk approaches are usually not suited for large-scale risk evaluation over extended geographical regions due to the involved high-computational costs. Therefore, in this study, a novel data-driven multi-scale performance-based ice engineering (PBIE) framework is developed to support the design of new structures subjected to ice storms or the rehabilitation of existing ones. In addition, the proposed PBIE is capable of rapidly estimating the real-time risk over an extended region due to an ice event. Specifically, it leverages the superior capabilities of state-of-the-art data-driven techniques (e.g., machine learning) to efficiently generate the corresponding risk maps and identify the high-risk areas. The proposed PBIE framework is applied to a simplified example in which the galloping-induced risk on iced conductors, in terms of the galloping amplitude, is evaluated for both local and regional scales. The resulting PBIE framework can be readily applied for design or retrofitting purposes or integrated within an emergency response management system to inform preventive actions that can mitigate the ice storm-induced damages and save lives.</description>
