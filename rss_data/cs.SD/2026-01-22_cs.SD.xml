      <title>Single-step Controllable Music Bandwidth Extension With Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio restoration consists in inverting degradations of a digital audio signal to recover what would have been the pristine quality signal before the degradation occurred. This is valuable in contexts such as archives of music recordings, particularly those of precious historical value, for which a clean version may have been lost or simply does not exist. Recent work applied generative models to audio restoration, showing promising improvement over previous methods, and opening the door to the ability to perform restoration operations that were not possible before. However, making these models finely controllable remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose an extension of FLowHigh and introduce the Dynamic Spectral Contour (DSC) as a control signal for bandwidth extension via classifier-free guidance. Our experiments show competitive model performance, and indicate that DSC is a promising feature to support fine-grained conditioning.</description>

      <title>Prosody-Guided Harmonic Attention for Phase-Coherent Neural Vocoding in the Complex Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural vocoders are central to speech synthesis; despite their success, most still suffer from limited prosody modeling and inaccurate phase reconstruction. We propose a vocoder that introduces prosody-guided harmonic attention to enhance voiced segment encoding and directly predicts complex spectral components for waveform synthesis via inverse STFT. Unlike mel-spectrogram-based approaches, our design jointly models magnitude and phase, ensuring phase coherence and improved pitch fidelity. To further align with perceptual quality, we adopt a multi-objective training strategy that integrates adversarial, spectral, and phase-aware losses. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate consistent gains over HiFi-GAN and AutoVocoder: F0 RMSE reduced by 22 percent, voiced/unvoiced error lowered by 18 percent, and MOS scores improved by 0.15. These results show that prosody-guided attention combined with direct complex spectrum modeling yields more natural, pitch-accurate, and robust synthetic speech, setting a strong foundation for expressive neural vocoding.</description>

      <title>Dissecting Performance Degradation in Audio Source Separation under Sampling Frequency Mismatch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio processing methods based on deep neural networks are typically trained at a single sampling frequency (SF). To handle untrained SFs, signal resampling is commonly employed, but it can degrade performance, particularly when the input SF is lower than the trained SF. This paper investigates the causes of this degradation through two hypotheses: (i) the lack of high-frequency components introduced by up-sampling, and (ii) the greater importance of their presence than their precise representation. To examine these hypotheses, we compare conventional resampling with three alternatives: post-resampling noise addition, which adds Gaussian noise to the resampled signal; noisy-kernel resampling, which perturbs the kernel with Gaussian noise to enrich high-frequency components; and trainable-kernel resampling, which adapts the interpolation kernel through training. Experiments on music source separation show that noisy-kernel and trainable-kernel resampling alleviate the degradation observed with conventional resampling. We further demonstrate that noisy-kernel resampling is effective across diverse models, highlighting it as a simple yet practical option.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Large Audio-Language Models for Interactive Language Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving pronunciation proficiency in a second language (L2) remains a challenge, despite the development of Computer-Assisted Pronunciation Training (CAPT) systems. Traditional CAPT systems often provide unintuitive feedback that lacks actionable guidance, limiting its effectiveness. Recent advancements in audio-language models (ALMs) offer the potential to enhance these systems by providing more user-friendly feedback. In this work, we investigate ALMs for chat-based pronunciation training by introducing L2-Arctic-plus, an English dataset with detailed error explanations and actionable suggestions for improvement. We benchmark cascaded ASR+LLMs and existing ALMs on this dataset, specifically in detecting mispronunciation and generating actionable feedback. To improve the performance, we further propose to instruction-tune ALMs on L2-Arctic-plus. Experimental results demonstrate that our instruction-tuned models significantly outperform existing baselines on mispronunciation detection and suggestion generation in terms of both objective and human evaluation, highlighting the value of the proposed dataset.</description>

      <title>Training-Efficient Text-to-Music Generation with State-Space Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-music generation (TTM) have yielded high-quality results, but often at the cost of extensive compute and the use of large proprietary internal data. To improve the affordability and openness of TTM training, an open-source generative model backbone that is more training- and data-efficient is needed. In this paper, we constrain the number of trainable parameters in the generative model to match that of the MusicGen-small benchmark (with about 300M parameters), and replace its Transformer backbone with the emerging class of state-space models (SSMs). Specifically, we explore different SSM variants for sequence modeling, and compare a single-stage SSM-based design with a decomposable two-stage SSM/diffusion hybrid design. All proposed models are trained from scratch on a purely public dataset comprising 457 hours of CC-licensed music, ensuring full openness. Our experimental findings are three-fold. First, we show that SSMs exhibit superior training efficiency compared to the Transformer counterpart. Second, despite using only 9% of the FLOPs and 2% of the training data size compared to the MusicGen-small benchmark, our model achieves competitive performance in both objective metrics and subjective listening tests based on MusicCaps captions. Finally, our scaling-down experiment demonstrates that SSMs can maintain competitive performance relative to the Transformer baseline even at the same training budget (measured in iterations), when the model size is reduced to four times smaller. To facilitate the democratization of TTM research, the processed captions, model checkpoints, and source code are available on GitHub via the project page: https://lonian6.github.io/ssmttm/.</description>

      <title>Multi-Task Transformer for Explainable Speech Deepfake Detection via Formant Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14850v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a multi-task transformer for speech deepfake detection, capable of predicting formant trajectories and voicing patterns over time, ultimately classifying speech as real or fake, and highlighting whether its decisions rely more on voiced or unvoiced regions. Building on a prior speaker-formant transformer architecture, we streamline the model with an improved input segmentation strategy, redesign the decoding process, and integrate built-in explainability. Compared to the baseline, our model requires fewer parameters, trains faster, and provides better interpretability, without sacrificing prediction performance.</description>

      <title>Generative Artificial Intelligence, Musical Heritage and the Construction of Peace Narratives: A Case Study in Mali</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the capacity of generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI) to contribute to the construction of peace narratives and the revitalization of musical heritage in Mali. The study has been made in a political and social context where inter-community tensions and social fractures motivate a search for new symbolic frameworks for reconciliation. The study empirically explores three questions: (1) how Gen AI can be used as a tool for musical creation rooted in national languages and traditions; (2) to what extent Gen AI systems enable a balanced hybridization between technological innovation and cultural authenticity; and (3) how AI-assisted musical co-creation can strengthen social cohesion and cultural sovereignty. The experimental results suggest that Gen AI, embedded in a culturally conscious participatory framework, can act as a catalyst for symbolic diplomacy, amplifying local voices instead of standardizing them. However, challenges persist regarding the availability of linguistic corpora, algorithmic censorship, and the ethics of generating compositions derived from copyrighted sources.</description>

      <title>VCNAC: A Variable-Channel Neural Audio Codec for Mono, Stereo, and Surround Sound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present VCNAC, a variable channel neural audio codec. Our approach features a single encoder and decoder parametrization that enables native inference for different channel setups, from mono speech to cinematic 5.1 channel surround audio. Channel compatibility objectives ensure that multi-channel content maintains perceptual quality when decoded to fewer channels. The shared representation enables training of generative language models on a single set of codebooks while supporting inference-time scalability across modalities and channel configurations. Evaluation using objective spatial audio metrics and subjective listening tests demonstrates that our unified approach maintains high reconstruction quality across mono, stereo, and surround audio configurations.</description>

      <title>Bangla Music Genre Classification Using Bidirectional LSTMS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bangla music is enrich in its own music cultures. Now a days music genre classification is very significant because of the exponential increase in available music, both in digital and physical formats. It is necessary to index them accordingly to facilitate improved retrieval. Automatically classifying Bangla music by genre is essential for efficiently locating specific pieces within a vast and diverse music library. Prevailing methods for genre classification predominantly employ conventional machine learning or deep learning approaches. This work introduces a novel music dataset comprising ten distinct genres of Bangla music. For the task of audio classification, we utilize a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture. Specifically, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network is implemented to train the model and perform the classification. Feature extraction represents a foundational stage in audio data processing. This study utilizes Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) to transform raw audio waveforms into a compact and representative set of features. The proposed framework facilitates music genre classification by leveraging these extracted features. Experimental results demonstrate a classification accuracy of 78%, indicating the system's strong potential to enhance and streamline the organization of Bangla music genres.</description>

      <title>WavLink: Compact Audio-Text Embeddings with a Global Whisper Token</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15118v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whisper has become the de-facto encoder for extracting general-purpose audio features in large audio-language models, where a 30-second clip is typically represented by 1500 frame features projected into an LLM. In contrast, audio-text embedding models like CLAP-based models have largely relied on alternative audio encoders (e.g., HTS-AT, PaSST), and have not leveraged Whisper effectively. We present WavLink, a compact audio-text embedding model that augments Whisper encoder with a learnable global token, trained jointly with a text encoder. Through a systematic study of design choices, including pretrained text encoders, loss functions, training modes, and data mixtures, we identify configurations that yield state-of-the-art retrieval performance. Our two-stage training recipe across three model sizes, combined with Matryoshka-style supervision, improves scalability, enabling 8x smaller embeddings with minimal performance drop. WavLink also demonstrates competitive performance on AIR-Bench with MCQs and zero-shot classification.</description>

      <title>WeDefense: A Toolkit to Defend Against Fake Audio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advances in generative AI have enabled the creation of synthetic audio which is perceptually indistinguishable from real, genuine audio. Although this stellar progress enables many positive applications, it also raises risks of misuse, such as for impersonation, disinformation and fraud. Despite a growing number of open-source fake audio detection codes released through numerous challenges and initiatives, most are tailored to specific competitions, datasets or models. A standardized and unified toolkit that supports the fair benchmarking and comparison of competing solutions with not just common databases, protocols, metrics, but also a shared codebase, is missing. To address this, we propose WeDefense, the first open-source toolkit to support both fake audio detection and localization. Beyond model training, WeDefense emphasizes critical yet often overlooked components: flexible input and augmentation, calibration, score fusion, standardized evaluation metrics, and analysis tools for deeper understanding and interpretation. The toolkit is publicly available at https://github.com/zlin0/wedefense with interactive demos for fake audio detection and localization.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Singers: A Review of Deep-Learning-based Singing Voice Synthesis Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in singing voice synthesis (SVS) have attracted substantial attention from both academia and industry. With the advent of large language models and novel generative paradigms, producing controllable, high-fidelity singing voices has become an attainable goal. Yet the field still lacks a comprehensive survey that systematically analyzes deep-learning-based singing voice synthesis systems and their enabling technologies. To address the aforementioned issue, this survey first categorizes existing systems by task type and then organizes current architectures into two major paradigms: cascaded and end-to-end approaches. Moreover, we provide an in-depth analysis of core technologies, covering singing modeling and control techniques. Finally, we review relevant datasets, annotation tools, and evaluation benchmarks that support training and assessment. In appendix, we introduce training strategies and further discussion of SVS. This survey provides an up-to-date review of the literature on SVS models, which would be a useful reference for both researchers and engineers.

      <title>A Cloud-Based Cross-Modal Transformer for Emotion Recognition and Adaptive Human-Computer Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emotion recognition is a fundamental component of next-generation human-computer interaction (HCI), enabling machines to perceive, understand, and respond to users' affective states. However, existing systems often rely on single-modality analysis such as facial expressions, speech tone, or textual sentiment, resulting in limited robustness and poor generalization in real-world environments. To address these challenges, this study proposes a Cloud-Based Cross-Modal Transformer (CMT) framework for multimodal emotion recognition and adaptive human-computer interaction. The proposed model integrates visual, auditory, and textual signals using pretrained encoders (Vision Transformer, Wav2Vec2, and BERT) and employs a cross-modal attention mechanism to capture complex interdependencies among heterogeneous features. By leveraging cloud computing infrastructure with distributed training on Kubernetes and TensorFlow Serving, the system enables scalable, low-latency emotion recognition for large-scale user interactions. Experiments conducted on benchmark datasets including IEMOCAP, MELD, and AffectNet demonstrate that the CMT achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving the F1-score by 3.0 percent and reducing cross-entropy loss by 12.9 percent compared to strong multimodal baselines. Additionally, cloud deployment evaluations show an average response latency of 128 ms, representing a 35 percent reduction compared with conventional transformer-based fusion systems. These results confirm that the proposed framework enables efficient, real-time emotion recognition and adaptive feedback in applications such as intelligent customer service, virtual tutoring systems, and affective computing interfaces, marking an important step toward cloud-native affective computing and emotionally intelligent interactive systems.</description>

      <title>Call2Instruct: Automated Pipeline for Generating Q&amp;A Datasets from Call Center Recordings for LLM Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The adaptation of Large-Scale Language Models (LLMs) to specific domains depends on high-quality fine-tuning datasets, particularly in instructional format (e.g., Question-Answer - Q&amp;A). However, generating these datasets, particularly from unstructured sources such as call center audio recordings, poses a significant challenge due to the noisy and disorganized nature of the data. This paper presents a solution to this challenge by offering an end-to-end automated pipeline for generating Q&amp;A instructional datasets from such recordings. The methodology developed comprises sequential steps of audio processing (including diarization, noise removal and automatic transcription), textual processing (cleaning, normalization, and anonymization), semantic extraction of customer demands and attendant responses using vector embeddings, and matching via semantic search to form the final Q&amp;A pairs. As a result, the complete pipeline was successfully implemented, generating a dataset specifically formatted for Instruct Fine Tuning. The practical value and feasibility of the generated dataset were substantiated and functionally demonstrated through the successful fine-tuning of an LLM model (based on Llama 2 7B). The conclusion of the paper states that the proposed approach is viable for converting unstructured conversational data from call centers into valuable resources for training LLMs. This development has the potential to open up avenues for creating more effective AI systems for Q&amp;A tasks in the customer service domain. The developed codes have been made publicly available to promote reproducibility and future research.</description>

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models excel at generating temporally coherent audio by producing tokens sequentially, yet they often falter in faithfully following complex textual prompts, especially those describing complex sound events. We uncover a surprising capability in AR audio generators: their early prefix tokens implicitly encode global semantic attributes of the final output, such as event count and sound-object category, revealing a form of implicit planning. Building on this insight, we propose Plan-Critic, a lightweight auxiliary model trained with a Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE)-inspired objective to predict final instruction-following quality from partial generations. At inference time, Plan-Critic enables guided exploration: it evaluates candidate prefixes early, prunes low-fidelity trajectories, and reallocates computation to high-potential planning seeds. Our Plan-Critic-guided sampling achieves up to a 10-point improvement in CLAP score over the AR baseline-establishing a new state of the art in AR text-to-audio generation-while maintaining computational parity with standard best-of-N decoding. This work bridges the gap between causal generation and global semantic alignment, demonstrating that even strictly autoregressive models can plan ahead.</description>

      <title>Towards noise-robust speech inversion through multi-task learning with speech enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies demonstrate the effectiveness of Self Supervised Learning (SSL) speech representations for Speech Inversion (SI). However, applying SI in real-world scenarios remains challenging due to the pervasive presence of background noise. We propose a unified framework that integrates Speech Enhancement (SE) and SI models through shared SSL-based speech representations. In this framework, the SSL model is trained not only to support the SE module in suppressing noise but also to produce representations that are more informative for the SI task, allowing both modules to benefit from joint training. At a Signal-to-Noise Ratio of -5 db, our method for the SI task achieves relative improvements over the baseline of 80.95% under babble noise and 38.98% under non-babble noise, as measured by the average Pearson product-moment correlation across all estimated parameters.</description>

      <title>Scaling Ambiguity: Augmenting Human Annotation in Speech Emotion Recognition with Audio-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition models typically use single categorical labels, overlooking the inherent ambiguity of human emotions. Ambiguous Emotion Recognition addresses this by representing emotions as probability distributions, but progress is limited by unreliable ground-truth distributions inferred from sparse human annotations. This paper explores whether Large Audio-Language Models (ALMs) can mitigate the annotation bottleneck by generating high-quality synthetic annotations. We introduce a framework leveraging ALMs to create Synthetic Perceptual Proxies, augmenting human annotations to improve ground-truth distribution reliability. We validate these proxies through statistical analysis of their alignment with human distributions and evaluate their impact by fine-tuning ALMs with the augmented emotion distributions. Furthermore, to address class imbalance and enable unbiased evaluation, we propose DiME-Aug, a Distribution-aware Multimodal Emotion Augmentation strategy. Experiments on IEMOCAP and MSP-Podcast show that synthetic annotations enhance emotion distribution, especially in low-ambiguity regions where annotation agreement is high. However, benefits diminish for highly ambiguous emotions with greater human disagreement. This work provides the first evidence that ALMs could address annotation scarcity in ambiguous emotion recognition, but highlights the need for more advanced prompting or generation strategies to handle highly ambiguous cases.</description>

      <title>READ-Net: Clarifying Emotional Ambiguity via Adaptive Feature Recalibration for Audio-Visual Depression Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Depression is a severe global mental health issue that impairs daily functioning and overall quality of life. Although recent audio-visual approaches have improved automatic depression detection, methods that ignore emotional cues often fail to capture subtle depressive signals hidden within emotional expressions. Conversely, those incorporating emotions frequently confuse transient emotional expressions with stable depressive symptoms in feature representations, a phenomenon termed \emph{Emotional Ambiguity}, thereby leading to detection errors. To address this critical issue, we propose READ-Net, the first audio-visual depression detection framework explicitly designed to resolve Emotional Ambiguity through Adaptive Feature Recalibration (AFR). The core insight of AFR is to dynamically adjust the weights of emotional features to enhance depression-related signals. Rather than merely overlooking or naively combining emotional information, READ-Net innovatively identifies and preserves depressive-relevant cues within emotional features, while adaptively filtering out irrelevant emotional noise. This recalibration strategy significantly clarifies feature representations, and effectively mitigates the persistent challenge of emotional interference. Additionally, READ-Net can be easily integrated into existing frameworks for improved performance. Extensive evaluations on three publicly available datasets show that READ-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with average gains of 4.55\% in accuracy and 1.26\% in F1-score, demonstrating its robustness to emotional disturbances and improving audio-visual depression detection.</description>

      <title>AQAScore: Evaluating Semantic Alignment in Text-to-Audio Generation via Audio Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although text-to-audio generation has made remarkable progress in realism and diversity, the development of evaluation metrics has not kept pace. Widely-adopted approaches, typically based on embedding similarity like CLAPScore, effectively measure general relevance but remain limited in fine-grained semantic alignment and compositional reasoning. To address this, we introduce AQAScore, a backbone-agnostic evaluation framework that leverages the reasoning capabilities of audio-aware large language models (ALLMs). AQAScore reformulates assessment as a probabilistic semantic verification task; rather than relying on open-ended text generation, it estimates alignment by computing the exact log-probability of a "Yes" answer to targeted semantic queries. We evaluate AQAScore across multiple benchmarks, including human-rated relevance, pairwise comparison, and compositional reasoning tasks. Experimental results show that AQAScore consistently achieves higher correlation with human judgments than similarity-based metrics and generative prompting baselines, showing its effectiveness in capturing subtle semantic inconsistencies and scaling with the capability of underlying ALLMs.</description>

      <title>Neural Tracking of Sustained Attention, Attention Switching, and Natural Conversation in Audiovisual Environments using Mobile EEG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Everyday communication is dynamic and multisensory, often involving shifting attention, overlapping speech and visual cues. Yet, most neural attention tracking studies are still limited to highly controlled lab settings, using clean, often audio-only stimuli and requiring sustained attention to a single talker. This work addresses that gap by introducing a novel dataset from 24 normal-hearing participants. We used a mobile electroencephalography (EEG) system (44 scalp electrodes and 20 cEEGrid electrodes) in an audiovisual (AV) paradigm with three conditions: sustained attention to a single talker in a two-talker environment, attention switching between two talkers, and unscripted two-talker conversations with a competing single talker. Analysis included temporal response functions (TRFs) modeling, optimal lag analysis, selective attention classification with decision windows ranging from 1.1s to 35s, and comparisons of TRFs for attention to AV conversations versus side audio-only talkers. Key findings show significant differences in the attention-related P2-peak between attended and ignored speech across conditions for scalp EEG. No significant change in performance between switching and sustained attention suggests robustness for attention switches. Optimal lag analysis revealed narrower peak for conversation compared to single-talker AV stimuli, reflecting the additional complexity of multi-talker processing. Classification of selective attention was consistently above chance (55-70% accuracy) for scalp EEG, while cEEGrid data yielded lower correlations, highlighting the need for further methodological improvements. These results demonstrate that mobile EEG can reliably track selective attention in dynamic, multisensory listening scenarios and provide guidance for designing future AV paradigms and real-world attention tracking applications.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Evaluation of Deep Learning Models for Speech Enhancement in Real-World Noisy Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Speech enhancement, particularly denoising, is vital in improving the intelligibility and quality of speech signals for real-world applications, especially in noisy environments. While prior research has introduced various deep learning models for this purpose, many struggle to balance noise suppression, perceptual quality, and speaker-specific feature preservation, leaving a critical research gap in their comparative performance evaluation. This study benchmarks three state-of-the-art models Wave-U-Net, CMGAN, and U-Net, on diverse datasets such as SpEAR, VPQAD, and Clarkson datasets. These models were chosen due to their relevance in the literature and code accessibility. The evaluation reveals that U-Net achieves high noise suppression with SNR improvements of +71.96% on SpEAR, +64.83% on VPQAD, and +364.2% on the Clarkson dataset. CMGAN outperforms in perceptual quality, attaining the highest PESQ scores of 4.04 on SpEAR and 1.46 on VPQAD, making it well-suited for applications prioritizing natural and intelligible speech. Wave-U-Net balances these attributes with improvements in speaker-specific feature retention, evidenced by VeriSpeak score gains of +10.84% on SpEAR and +27.38% on VPQAD. This research indicates how advanced methods can optimize trade-offs between noise suppression, perceptual quality, and speaker recognition. The findings may contribute to advancing voice biometrics, forensic audio analysis, telecommunication, and speaker verification in challenging acoustic conditions.</description>

      <title>MambAttention: Mamba with Multi-Head Attention for Generalizable Single-Channel Speech Enhancement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00966v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With new sequence models like Mamba and xLSTM, several studies have shown that these models match or outperform the state-of-the-art in single-channel speech enhancement and audio representation learning. However, prior research has demonstrated that sequence models like LSTM and Mamba tend to overfit to the training set. To address this, previous works have shown that adding self-attention to LSTMs substantially improves generalization performance for single-channel speech enhancement. Nevertheless, neither the concept of hybrid Mamba and time-frequency attention models nor their generalization performance have been explored for speech enhancement. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid architecture, MambAttention, which combines Mamba and shared time- and frequency-multi-head attention modules for generalizable single-channel speech enhancement. To train our model, we introduce VB-DemandEx, a dataset inspired by VoiceBank+Demand but with more challenging noise types and lower signal-to-noise ratios. Trained on VB-DemandEx, MambAttention significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art discriminative LSTM-, xLSTM-, Mamba-, and Conformer-based systems of similar complexity across all reported metrics on two out-of-domain datasets: DNS 2020 without reverberation and EARS-WHAM_v2. MambAttention also matches or outperforms generative diffusion models in generalization performance while being competitive with language model baselines. Ablation studies highlight the importance of weight sharing between time- and frequency-multi-head attention modules for generalization performance. Finally, we explore integrating the shared time- and frequency-multi-head attention modules with LSTM and xLSTM, which yields a notable performance improvement on the out-of-domain datasets. Yet, MambAttention remains superior for cross-corpus generalization across all reported evaluation metrics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07526v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed NLP, yet their integration with audio remains underexplored despite audio's centrality to human communication. We introduce Falcon3-Audio, a family of Audio-Language Models (ALMs) built on instruction-tuned LLMs and Whisper encoders. Using a remarkably small amount of public audio data, less than 30K hours (5K unique), Falcon3-Audio-7B matches the best reported performance among open-weight models on the MMAU benchmark, with a score of 64.14, matching R1-AQA, while distinguishing itself through superior data and parameter efficiency, single-stage training, and transparency. Notably, our smallest 1B model remains competitive with larger open models ranging from 2B to 13B parameters. Through extensive ablations, we find that common complexities such as curriculum learning, multiple audio encoders, and intricate cross-attention connectors are not required for strong performance, even compared to models trained on over 500K hours of data.</description>

      <title>Exploring Fine-Tuning of Large Audio Language Models for Spoken Language Understanding under Limited Speech Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) have emerged as powerful tools for speech-related tasks but remain underexplored for fine-tuning, especially with limited speech data. To bridge this gap, we systematically examine how different fine-tuning schemes including text-only, direct mixing, and curriculum learning affect spoken language understanding (SLU), focusing on scenarios where text-label pairs are abundant while paired speech-label data are limited. Results show that LALMs already achieve competitive performance with text-only fine-tuning, highlighting their strong generalization ability. Adding even small amounts of speech data (2-5%) yields substantial further gains, with curriculum learning particularly effective under scarce data. In cross-lingual SLU, combining source-language speech data with target-language text and minimal target-language speech data enables effective adaptation. Overall, this study provides practical insights into the LALM fine-tuning under realistic data constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in speech enhancement have shown that models combining Mamba and attention mechanisms yield superior cross-corpus generalization performance. At the same time, integrating Mamba in a U-Net structure has yielded state-of-the-art enhancement performance, while reducing both model size and computational complexity. Inspired by these insights, we propose RWSA-MambaUNet, a novel and efficient hybrid model combining Mamba and multi-head attention in a U-Net structure for improved cross-corpus performance. Resolution-wise shared attention (RWSA) refers to layerwise attention-sharing across corresponding time- and frequency resolutions. Our best-performing RWSA-MambaUNet model achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance on two out-of-domain test sets. Notably, our smallest model surpasses all baselines on the out-of-domain DNS 2020 test set in terms of PESQ, SSNR, and ESTOI, and on the out-of-domain EARS-WHAM_v2 test set in terms of SSNR, ESTOI, and SI-SDR, while using less than half the model parameters and a fraction of the FLOPs.</description>

      <title>End-to-end Contrastive Language-Speech Pretraining Model For Long-form Spoken Question Answering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Significant progress has been made in spoken question answering (SQA) in recent years. However, many existing methods, including large audio language models, struggle with processing long audio. Follow the success of retrieval augmented generation, a speech-related retriever shows promising in help preprocessing long-form speech. But the performance of existing speech-related retrievers is lacking. To address this challenge, we propose CLSR, an end-to-end contrastive language-speech retriever that efficiently extracts question-relevant segments from long audio recordings for downstream SQA task. Unlike conventional speech-text contrastive models, CLSR incorporates an intermediate step that converts acoustic features into text-like representations prior to alignment, thereby more effectively bridging the gap between modalities. Experimental results across four cross-modal retrieval datasets demonstrate that CLSR surpasses both end-to-end speech related retrievers and pipeline approaches combining speech recognition with text retrieval, providing a robust foundation for advancing practical long-form SQA applications.</description>

      <title>ESDD2: Environment-Aware Speech and Sound Deepfake Detection Challenge Evaluation Plan</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07303v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Audio recorded in real-world environments often contains a mixture of foreground speech and background environmental sounds. With rapid advances in text-to-speech, voice conversion, and other generation models, either component can now be modified independently. Such component-level manipulations are harder to detect, as the remaining unaltered component can mislead the systems designed for whole deepfake audio, and they often sound more natural to human listeners. To address this gap, we have proposed CompSpoofV2 dataset and a separation-enhanced joint learning framework. CompSpoofV2 is a large-scale curated dataset designed for component-level audio anti-spoofing, which contains over 250k audio samples, with a total duration of approximately 283 hours. Based on the CompSpoofV2 and the separation-enhanced joint learning framework, we launch the Environment-Aware Speech and Sound Deepfake Detection Challenge (ESDD2), focusing on component-level spoofing, where both speech and environmental sounds may be manipulated or synthesized, creating a more challenging and realistic detection scenario. The challenge will be held in conjunction with the IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo 2026 (ICME 2026).</description>

      <title>Performance and Complexity Trade-off Optimization of Speech Models During Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In speech machine learning, neural network models are typically designed by choosing an architecture with fixed layer sizes and structure. These models are then trained to maximize performance on metrics aligned with the task's objective. While the overall architecture is usually guided by prior knowledge of the task, the sizes of individual layers are often chosen heuristically. However, this approach does not guarantee an optimal trade-off between performance and computational complexity; consequently, post hoc methods such as weight quantization or model pruning are typically employed to reduce computational cost. This occurs because stochastic gradient descent (SGD) methods can only optimize differentiable functions, while factors influencing computational complexity, such as layer sizes and floating-point operations per second (FLOP/s), are non-differentiable and require modifying the model structure during training. We propose a reparameterization technique based on feature noise injection that enables joint optimization of performance and computational complexity during training using SGD-based methods. Unlike traditional pruning methods, our approach allows the model size to be dynamically optimized for a target performance-complexity trade-off, without relying on heuristic criteria to select which weights or structures to remove. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through three case studies, including a synthetic example and two practical real-world applications: voice activity detection and audio anti-spoofing. The code related to our work is publicly available to encourage further research.</description>

      <title>E-BATS: Efficient Backpropagation-Free Test-Time Adaptation for Speech Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07078v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speech Foundation Models encounter significant performance degradation when deployed in real-world scenarios involving acoustic domain shifts, such as background noise and speaker accents. Test-time adaptation (TTA) has recently emerged as a viable strategy to address such domain shifts at inference time without requiring access to source data or labels. However, existing TTA approaches, particularly those relying on backpropagation, are memory-intensive, limiting their applicability in speech tasks and resource-constrained settings. Although backpropagation-free methods offer improved efficiency, existing ones exhibit poor accuracy. This is because they are predominantly developed for vision tasks, which fundamentally differ from speech task formulations, noise characteristics, and model architecture, posing unique transferability challenges. In this paper, we introduce E-BATS, the first Efficient BAckpropagation-free TTA framework designed explicitly for speech foundation models. E-BATS achieves a balance between adaptation effectiveness and memory efficiency through three key components: (i) lightweight prompt adaptation for a forward-pass-based feature alignment, (ii) a multi-scale loss to capture both global (utterance-level) and local distribution shifts (token-level) and (iii) a test-time exponential moving average mechanism for stable adaptation across utterances. Experiments conducted on four noisy speech datasets spanning sixteen acoustic conditions demonstrate consistent improvements, with 4.1%-13.5% accuracy gains over backpropagation-free baselines and 2.0-6.4 times GPU memory savings compared to backpropagation-based methods. By enabling scalable and robust adaptation under acoustic variability, this work paves the way for developing more efficient adaptation approaches for practical speech processing systems in real-world environments.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Self-Supervised Representation Learning for Depression Detection from Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speech-based depression detection (SDD) has emerged as a non-invasive and scalable alternative to conventional clinical assessments. However, existing methods still struggle to capture robust depression-related speech characteristics, which are sparse and heterogeneous. Although pretrained self-supervised learning (SSL) models provide rich representations, most recent SDD studies extract features from a single layer of the pretrained SSL model for the downstream classifier. This practice overlooks the complementary roles of low-level acoustic features and high-level semantic information inherently encoded in different SSL model layers. To explicitly model interactions between acoustic and semantic representations within an utterance, we propose a hierarchical adaptive representation encoder with prior knowledge that disengages and re-aligns acoustic and semantic information through asymmetric cross-attention, enabling fine-grained acoustic patterns to be interpreted in semantic context. In addition, a Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) objective is applied as auxiliary supervision to handle the irregular temporal distribution of depressive characteristics without requiring frame-level annotations. Experiments on DAIC-WOZ and MODMA demonstrate that HAREN-CTC consistently outperforms existing methods under both performance upper-bound evaluation and generalization evaluation settings, achieving Macro F1 scores of 0.81 and 0.82 respectively in upper-bound evaluation, and maintaining superior performance with statistically significant improvements in precision and AUC under rigorous cross-validation. These findings suggest that modeling hierarchical acoustic-semantic interactions better reflects how depressive characteristics manifest in natural speech, enabling scalable and objective depression assessment.</description>

      <title>Extending Audio Context for Long-Form Understanding in Large Audio-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) are often constrained by short audio context windows, even when their text backbones support long contexts, limiting long-form audio understanding. Prior work has introduced context-extension methods (e.g. YaRN) on unimodal LLMs, yet their application to LALMs remains unexplored. First, building on RoPE-based context extension, we introduce Partial YaRN, a training-free, modality-decoupled extension method that modifies only audio token positions, leaving text positions intact to preserve the base LLM's text capabilities. Second, we propose Virtual Longform Audio Training (VLAT), a training strategy that extends Partial YaRN into a training-time positional augmentation. VLAT simulates diverse audio lengths during training, enabling generalization to inputs far longer than those seen in training. Our experiments on SALMONN and Qwen2-Audio confirm that Partial YaRN outperforms the original models across wide range of settings, and VLAT provides substantial performance improvement on long audio of unseen lengths.</description>

      <title>Omni-AVSR: Towards Unified Multimodal Speech Recognition with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved impressive results in speech recognition across multiple modalities, including Auditory Speech Recognition (ASR), Visual Speech Recognition (VSR), and Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR). Despite this progress, current LLM-based approaches typically address each task independently, training separate models that raise computational and deployment resource use while missing potential cross-task synergies. They also rely on fixed-rate token compression, which restricts flexibility in balancing accuracy with efficiency. These limitations highlight the need for a unified framework that can support ASR, VSR, and AVSR while enabling elastic inference. To this end, we present Omni-AVSR, a unified audio-visual LLM that combines efficient multi-granularity training with parameter-efficient adaptation. Specifically, we adapt the matryoshka representation learning paradigm to efficiently train across multiple audio and visual granularities, reducing its inherent training resource use. Furthermore, we explore three LoRA-based strategies for adapting the backbone LLM, balancing shared and task-specific specialization. Experiments on LRS2 and LRS3 show that Omni-AVSR achieves comparable or superior accuracy to state-of-the-art baselines while training a single model at substantially lower training and deployment resource use. The model also remains robust under acoustic noise, and we analyze its scaling behavior as LLM size increases, providing insights into the trade-off between performance and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Sound2Hap: Learning Audio-to-Vibrotactile Haptic Generation from Human Ratings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Environmental sounds like footsteps, keyboard typing, or dog barking carry rich information and emotional context, making them valuable for designing haptics in user applications. Existing audio-to-vibration methods, however, rely on signal-processing rules tuned for music or games and often fail to generalize across diverse sounds. To address this, we first investigated user perception of four existing audio-to-haptic algorithms, then created a data-driven model for environmental sounds. In Study 1, 34 participants rated vibrations generated by the four algorithms for 1,000 sounds, revealing no consistent algorithm preferences. Using this dataset, we trained Sound2Hap, a CNN-based autoencoder, to generate perceptually meaningful vibrations from diverse sounds with low latency. In Study 2, 15 participants rated its output higher than signal-processing baselines on both audio-vibration match and Haptic Experience Index (HXI), finding it more harmonious with diverse sounds. This work demonstrates a perceptually validated approach to audio-haptic translation, broadening the reach of sound-driven haptics.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Rotary Steering with Joint Autoregression for Robust Extraction of Closely Moving Speakers in Dynamic Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12345v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Latest advances in deep spatial filtering for Ambisonics demonstrate strong performance in stationary multi-speaker scenarios by rotating the sound field toward a target speaker prior to multi-channel enhancement. For applicability in dynamic acoustic conditions with moving speakers, we propose to automate this rotary steering using an interleaved tracking algorithm conditioned on the target's initial direction. However, for nearby or crossing speakers, robust tracking becomes difficult and spatial cues less effective for enhancement. By incorporating the processed recording as additional guide into both algorithms, our novel joint autoregressive framework leverages temporal-spectral correlations of speech to resolve spatially challenging speaker constellations. Consequently, our proposed method significantly improves tracking and enhancement of closely spaced speakers, consistently outperforming comparable non-autoregressive methods on a synthetic dataset. Real-world recordings complement these findings in complex scenarios with multiple speaker crossings and varying speaker-to-array distances.</description>
