      <title>Quantum Geometric Unconventional Superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coulomb repulsion can, counterintuitively, mediate Cooper pairing via the Kohn-Luttinger mechanism. However, it is commonly believed that observability of the effect requires special circumstances -- e.g., vicinity of the Fermi level to van Hove singularities, significant lattice-induced band distortions, or non-trivial Fermi surface topologies. Here we establish that quantum geometric properties of the constituent electrons can dramatically promote pairing from repulsion via dependence of screening on the quantum metric. We demonstrate quantum-geometry-enhanced superconductivity in two microscopic models with tunable quantum geometry, highlighting the crucial roles of quantum metric anisotropy and inhomogeneity. Our analysis provides an experimentally accessible figure of merit for the importance of quantum geometry to inducing unconventional superconductivity, indicating its relevance to graphene multilayers.</description>

      <title>Effects of doping on polar order in SrTiO$_{3}$ from first-principles modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SrTiO$_{3}$ is an incipient ferroelectric and an exceptionally dilute superconductor with a dome-like dependence on carrier concentration. Stabilization of a polar phase through chemical substitution or strain significantly enhances the superconducting critical temperature, suggesting a possible connection between the polar instability and unconventional Cooper pairing. To investigate the effects of doping on the polar order in SrTiO$_{3}$, we develop a simplified free energy model which includes only the degrees of freedom necessary to capture the relevant physics of a doped, biaxially compressively strained system. We simulate the polar and antiferrodistortive thermal phase transitions using Monte Carlo methods for different doping levels and comment on the doping dependence of the transition temperatures and the formation of polar nanodomains. In addition, the temperature-dependent phonon spectral function is calculated using Langevin simulations to investigate the lattice dynamics of the doped system. We also examine the effects of doping on the electronic structure within the polar phase, including the density of states and band splitting. Finally, we compute the polarization dependence of the Rashba parameter and the doping dependence of the Midgal ratio, and place our results in the broader context of proposed pairing mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Influence of superconductor dirtiness on the SNSPD sensitivity-bandwidth trade-off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Practical superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs) demonstrate a strong trade-off between detection sensitivity and the reset time. Often, there are wide variations in sensitivity and response times from SNSPDs of the same superconducting material. Here, using detailed physical models, we show that the dirtiness in a superconductor enforces a sensitivity and bandwidth trade-off in all practical devices. More importantly, a certain degree of dirtiness is a necessary requirement for achieving single photon detection. Under typical bias conditions close to the transition setpoints, the minimum number of photons required to register a voltage pulse decreases by the dirtiness parameter (Ioffe-Regel parameter) and the reset time of SNSPD increases by the same dirtiness parameter, thereby giving a constant value for the sensitivity-bandwidth product. The constant is weakly modified by biasing current and the temperature. Since dirtiness in the superconducting nanowire is a physically controllable parameter with an important bearing on the final response of an SNSPD, this work opens new opportunities to develop SNSPD devices with engineered sensitivity-bandwidth setpoint as dictated by an application.</description>

      <title>Collective Pinning and Vortex Dynamics in type 2 superconducting thin films with Varying Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A perpendicular magnetic field penetrating a thin type-II superconductor slab produces vortices, with one vortex per flux quantum, h/2e. The vortices interact repulsively and form an ordered array (Abrikosov lattice) in clean systems, while strong disorder changes the lattice into a vortex glass. Here we investigate type-II superconducting films (PbBi2 and NbSe2) with surface acoustic waves (SAWs) at mK temperature. When sweeping the magnetic field at an extremely slow rate, we observe a series of spikes in the attenuation and velocity of the SAW, on average separated in field by approximately Hc1. We suspect the following scenario: The vortex-free region at the edges of the film produces an edge barrier across which the vortices can enter or leave. When the applied field changes, the induced supercurrents flowing along this edge region lowers this barrier until there is an instability. At that point, vortices avalanche into (or out of) the bulk and change the vortex crystal, suggested by the sharp jump in each such spike. The vortices then gradually relax to a new stable pinned configuration, leading to a ~30s relaxation after the jump. Our observation enriches the limited experimental evidence on the important topic of real-time vortex dynamics in superconductors.</description>

      <title>Superconducting Energy Gap Structure of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ from Magnetic Penetration Depth Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experimental determination of the structure of the superconducting order parameter in the kagome lattice compound CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ is an essential step towards understanding the nature of the superconducting pairing in this material. Here we report measurements of the temperature dependence of the in-plane magnetic penetration depth, $\lambda(T)$, in crystals of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ down to $\sim 60\,\mathrm{mK}$. We find that $\lambda(T)$ is consistent with a fully-gapped state but with significant gap anisotropy. The magnitude of the gap minima are in the range $\sim 0.2 - 0.3 T_\mathrm{c}$ for the measured samples, markedly smaller than previous estimates. We discuss different forms of potential anisotropy and how these can be linked to the V and Sb Fermi surface sheets. We highlight a significant discrepancy between the calculated and measured values of $\lambda(T=0)$ which we suggest is caused by spatially suppressed superconductivity.</description>

      <title>High-field superconductivity from atomic-scale confinement and spin-orbit coupling at (111)$\mathrm{LaAlO_3/KTaO_3}$ interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the superconducting critical fields of two-dimensional electron systems at (111)$\mathrm{LaAlO_3/KTaO_3}$ interfaces as a function of electrostatic back-gating. Our work reveals inplane critical fields of unprecedented magnitudes at oxide interfaces. By comparing the critical fields in-plane and out-of-plane we discover an extremely anisotropic superconductor with an effective thickness below 1 nm and a 12-fold violation of the Chandrasekhar-Clogston paramagnetic limit. The analysis of magneto-transport indicates that the enhancement of the critical fields is due to an exceptionally thin superconducting layer and to a paramagnetic susceptibility suppressed by spin-orbit scattering.</description>

      <title>Selection rules of topological solitons from non-invertible symmetries in axion electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a relation between non-invertible symmetries and selection rules of topological solitons such as axionic domain walls and magnetic strings in the $(3+1)$-dimensional axion electrodynamics with a massive axion or a massive photon. In the low-energy limit of the phases where either the axion or the photon is massive, we identify non-invertible 0- or 1-form symmetry generators as axionic domain walls or magnetic strings, respectively. By non-invertible transformations on magnetic monopoles or axionic strings, we give constraints on possible configurations of topological solitons in the presence of the monopoles or axionic strings. Our results are consistent with a solution to the axionic domain wall problem by the magnetic monopole. Further, we give a new constraint on a linked configuration of the magnetic and axionic strings.</description>

      <title>Pressure-dependent Electronic Superlattice in the Kagome-Superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14790v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a high-resolution single crystal x-ray diffraction study of kagome-superconductor \cvs, exploring its response to variations in pressure and temperature. We discover that at low temperatures, the structural modulations of the electronic superlattice, commonly associated with charge-density-wave order, undergo a transformation around $p \sim$ 0.7 GPa from the familiar $2\times2$ pattern to a long-range-ordered modulation at wavevector $q=(0, 3/8, 1/2)$. Our observations align with inferred changes in the CDW pattern from prior transport and nuclear-magnetic-resonance studies, providing new insights into these transitions. Interestingly, the pressure-induced variations in the electronic superlattice correlate with two peaks in the superconducting transition temperature as pressure changes, hinting that fluctuations within the electronic superlattice could be key to stabilizing superconductivity. However, our findings contrast with the minimal pressure dependency anticipated by ab initio calculations of the electronic structure. They also challenge prevailing scenarios based on a Peierls-like nesting mechanism involving van Hove singularities.</description>

      <title>High-Tc superconductor candidates proposed by machine learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We cast the relation between the chemical composition of a solid-state material and its superconducting critical temperature (Tc) as a statistical learning problem with reduced complexity. Training of query-aware similarity-based ridge regression models on experimental SuperCon data achieve average Tc prediction errors of ~5 K for unseen out-of-sample materials. Two models were trained with one excluding high pressure data in training ("ambient" model) and a second also including high pressure data ("implicit" model). Subsequent utilization of the approach to scan ~153k materials in the Materials Project enables the ranking of candidates by Tc while accounting for thermodynamic stability and small band gap. The ambient model is used to predict stable top three high-Tc candidate materials that include those with large band gaps of LiCuF4 (316 K), Ag2H12S(NO)4 (316 K), and Na2H6PtO6 (315 K). Filtering these candidates for those with small band gaps correspondingly yields LiCuF4 (316 K), Cu2P2O7 (311 K), and Cu3P2H2O9 (307 K).</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in twisted transition metal dichalcogenide homobilayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19348v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the first time, robust superconductivity has been independently observed in twisted WSe$_2$ bilayers by two separate groups [Y. Xia et al., arXiv:2405.14784; Y. Guo et al., arXiv:2406.03418.]. In light of this, we explore the possibility of a universal superconducting pairing mechanism in twisted WSe$_2$ bilayers. Using a continuum band structure model and a phenomenological boson-mediated effective electron-electron attraction, we find that intervalley intralayer pairing predominates over interlayer pairing. Notably, despite different experimental conditions, both twisted WSe$_2$ samples exhibit a comparable effective attraction strength. This consistency suggests that the dominant pairing glue is likely independent of the twist angle and layer polarization, pointing to a universal underlying boson-induced pairing mechanism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02105v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical study of interacting and disordered topological phases of coupled Kitaev wires, which may support further realistic applications of Majorana fermions. We develop a variety of analytical, mathematical and numerical methods for one and two-coupled wires, associated with a topological marker accessible from real-space correlation functions on the wire(s). We verify the stability of the topological superconducting phase and quantify disorder effects close to the quantum phase transitions, e.g. through two-point correlation functions or using a renormalization group (RG) analysis of disorder. We show for the first time that the double critical Ising (DCI) phase -- a fractional Majorana liquid characterized by a pair of half central charges and topological numbers -- is stabilized by strong interactions against disorder which respects the inversion symmetry between the wires (ie. parity conservation on each wire). In the presence of an inter-wire hopping term, the DCI phase turns into a protected topological phase with a bulk gap. We study the localization physics developing along the critical line for weaker interactions.</description>

      <title>Probing enhanced superconductivity in van der Waals polytypes of V$_x$TaS$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) stabilize in multiple structural forms with profoundly distinct and exotic electronic phases. Interfacing different layer types is a promising route to manipulate TMDs' properties, not only as a means to engineer quantum devices, but also as a route to explore fundamental physics in complex matter. Here we use angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES) to investigate a strong layering-dependent enhancement of superconductivity in TaS$_2$, in which the superconducting transition temperature, $T_c$, of its $2H$ structural phase is nearly tripled when insulating $1T$ layers are inserted into the system. The study is facilitated by a novel vanadium-intercalation approach to synthesizing various TaS$_2$ polytypes, which improves the quality of ARPES data while leaving key aspects of the electronic structure and properties intact. The spectra show the clear opening of the charge density wave gap in the pure $2H$ phase and its suppression when $1T$ layers are introduced to the system. Moreover, in the mixed-layer $4Hb$ system, we observe a strongly momentum-anisotropic increase in electron-phonon coupling near the Fermi level relative to the $2H$ phase. Both phenomena help to account for the increased $T_c$ in mixed $2H$/$1T$ layer structures.</description>

      <title>Pressure-Induced Superconductivity at 18.2 K in CuIr2S4</title>

Abstract: Attaining superconducting critical temperatures (Tc) beyond the limit around 14 K observed thus far in spinel compounds AB2X4 (A, B = transition metals, X = O/chalcogen) could elucidate interaction intricacies and inform materials design. This work spotlights CuIr2S4, which exhibits a distinct metal-insulator transition below 230 K, as an unconventional candidate for activation under high pressure. Through transport, diffraction, and spectroscopy experiments conducted at pressures up to 224 GPa, we unveil pressure-tuning that suppressed CuIr2S4's transition, yielding two superconducting phases with an un-precedented Tc for spinels. Initially, 3.8 K onset rose monotonically, reaching 18.2 K at 133 GPa. Unexpectedly, a distinct phase with Tc = 2.2 K distinctly emerged at higher pressures, intimating unconventional couplings. Our findings suggest that both geometric frustration and electron-electron interactions play crucial roles in the superconductivity observed in CuIr2S4. The findings stretch perceived temperature limits in spinels and provide structure-property insights to guide the optimiza-tion of quantum materials interactions for tailored targeted functionalities.</description>

      <title>Evidence for $\pi$-shifted Cooper quartets and few-mode transport in PbTe nanowire three-terminal Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17703v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Josephson junctions are typically characterized by a single phase difference across two superconductors. This conventional two-terminal Josephson junction can be generalized to a multi-terminal device where the Josephson energy contains terms with contributions from multiple independent phase variables. Such multi-terminal Josephson junctions (MTJJs) are being considered as platforms for engineering effective Hamiltonians with non-trivial topologies, such as Weyl crossings and higher-order Chern numbers. These prospects rely on the ability to create MTJJs with non-classical multi-terminal couplings in which only a few quantum modes are populated. Here, we demonstrate these requirements in a three-terminal Josephson junction fabricated on selective-area-grown (SAG) PbTe nanowires. We observe signatures of a $\pi$-shifted Josephson effect, consistent with inter-terminal couplings mediated by four-particle quantum states called Cooper quartets. We further observe supercurrent co-existent with a non-monotonic evolution of the conductance with gate voltage, indicating transport mediated by a few quantum modes in both two- and three-terminal devices.</description>

      <title>Exact formula with two dynamically screened electron-phonon couplings for positive phonon-linewidths approximations</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we present an exact formula for the phonon linewidths involving only dressed electron-phonon couplings and ensuring the positivity property. The formula is designed to account for both nonadiabatic and correlation effects, and it provides an alternative proof that Density Functional Perturbation Theory calculations of phonon linewidths are not affected by a double counting of screening diagrams. Furthermore, we extend the treatment to nonequilibrium scenarios and offer a rigorous justification for employing the phononic Boltzmann equation.</description>

      <title>Of gyrators and anyons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20835v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years there have emerged various ideas to create and control topological excitations in superconducting devices. Notably, nontrivial Chern bands were predicted to exist in conventional multiterminal Josephson junctions, but the Chern number is yet to be experimentally verified, and the pathway towards feasible quantum hardware applications is unclear. Here we show how generic multiterminal circuits can be expressed as gyrator networks with quantized gyration conductance, giving rise to anyonic excitations carrying $q/p$ fractional fluxes ($q,p$ integer), measurable via a fractional Aharonov-Casher phase. The magnitude of interactions between the anyons depends on the flatness of the topological bands, prompting us to investigate circuit-specific band-engineering techniques. Circular scattering in three-terminal quantum dot chains gives rise to a flat topological ground state, where disorder mitigates Chern number fluctuations and the quasiparticle continuum provides a work-around for known limitations to create nontrivial flat bands. Further band-engineering strategies are presented where the superconducting phase is scrambled either via parallelization or dissipative phase transitions. We provide concepts for error correction protocols, and quantum simulations of interacting fermionic (or generally anyonic) many-body systems -- notably, introducing the possibility to mimic fractional quantum Hall physics or to implement local fermionic models that explicitly break the Wigner superselection rule. The latter indicates that a full understanding of multiterminal circuits will require grappling with a virtually unexplored class of parity-breaking quantum field theories.</description>
