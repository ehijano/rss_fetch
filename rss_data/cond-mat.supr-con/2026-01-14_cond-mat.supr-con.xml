      <title>Nodal Superconductivity of UTe$_2$ Probed by Field-Angle-Resolved Specific Heat on a Crystal with $T_{\rm c}=2.1$ K</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Field-angle-resolved specific-heat measurements were performed on a clean single crystal of a spin-triplet superconductor UTe$_2$ with $T_{\rm c}=2.1$ K and a low residual electronic specific heat. At low temperatures, the specific heat exhibits a linear dependence on the magnetic field when the field is applied precisely along the $b$ axis, in stark contrast to its rapid increase at low fields for other orientations. This pronounced anisotropy suggests the presence of nodal quasiparticle excitations with the Fermi velocity predominantly aligned along the $b$ axis. Considering the characteristic field-angle dependences of both the specific heat and the upper critical field, these observations are broadly compatible with theoretical models that assume a superconducting gap structure featuring either point nodes consistent with $B_{\rm 2u}$ symmetry, allowed in the infinitely strong spin-orbit coupling scheme, or line nodes confined to flat regions of the quasi-two-dimensional Fermi surface, consistent with $^3B_{\rm 3u}$ symmetry in the finite spin-orbit classification scheme. These results yield crucial hints for resolving the pairing symmetry of UTe$_2$, paving the way for a deeper understanding of its spin-triplet superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Blockade and Filamentary Pair Density Waves in Strain-Engineered Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate superconductivity in strain-engineered graphene using a self-consistent Bogoliubov-de Gennes approach. Challenging the paradigm that the high density of states in flat bands universally enhances pairing, we identify a "kinetic blockade" mechanism: strain-induced sublattice polarization segregates electronic states, rendering these singularities inert. Instead, superconductivity emerges as robust filaments at geometric nodes, forming a pair density wave. This state features a sign-reversing order parameter, detectable via impurity-induced zero-energy modes. Our findings reveal a unique geometric origin for filamentary superconductivity, offering new perspectives on strain-tuned quantum phases in Dirac materials.</description>

      <title>Coupling of Klein-Andreev Resonant States in Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$-graphene-Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ Devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum devices require coherent coupling over macroscopic distances. Recently, resonances due to Klein tunneling and Andreev reflection states (KARS) have been observed in a naturally occurring p-n junction at the interface between Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ (BSCCO), a high-Tc superconductor (HTS), and graphene. The resonances appear as conductance oscillations with gating. Here, we show coupling between the KARS in BSCCO-graphene-BSCCO devices of varying separation (L). The coupling is evidenced by a power-law decay of resonance period as L increases from tens of nanometers to single microns. These results demonstrate the long-distance coupling of KARS cavities in graphene-HTS junctions. The length dependence seen in experiments is supported by single-particle spectral functions which show KARS are coupled by transport modes in graphene. The strong coupling between KARS in BSCCO-graphene-BSCCO junctions showcases the novelty of HTS-graphene junctions for quantum circuits and unconventional Josephson junctions.</description>

      <title>Vacuum-dressed superconductivity in NbN observed in a high-$Q$ terahertz cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emerging theoretical frameworks suggest that physical properties of matter can be altered within an optical cavity by harnessing quantum vacuum electromagnetic fluctuations, even in the total absence of external driving fields. Among the most intriguing predictions is the potential to noninvasively manipulate superconductivity. Here, we experimentally observe modified superconductivity in niobium nitride (NbN) thin films within high-quality-factor ($Q$) terahertz cavities. Using terahertz time-domain spectroscopy, we characterize the NbN response both in free space and within a high-$Q$ photonic-crystal cavity. Our analysis reveals significant cavity-induced modifications to the optical conductivity. A theoretical model indicates that these changes originate from a substantial ($\sim13\,\%$) reduction in the superfluid density and a minor ($\sim2\,\%$) reduction in the superconducting gap, driven by cavity vacuum fluctuations. These results demonstrate a platform for engineering ground states via vacuum--matter coupling, opening frontiers in cavity materials science.</description>

      <title>A Preparation Nonstationarity Loophole in Superconducting-Qubit Bell Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bell or Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) tests on superconducting quantum processors are commonly interpreted under the assumption that repeated circuit executions sample a single, stationary preparation ensemble. Here we show that this assumption can be violated on contemporary hardware, with direct implications for the interpretation of observed Bell violations. We introduce an ensemble-divergence framework in which slow temporal drift of the preparation process induces context-dependent effective ensembles, even when measurement independence and locality are preserved. This leads to a relaxed Bell bound $|S| \le 2 + 6\delta_{\mathrm{ens}}$, where $\delta_{\mathrm{ens}}$ quantifies preparation nonstationarity. Because $\delta_{\mathrm{ens}}$ is not directly observable, we develop an operational witness $\delta_{\mathrm{op}}$ based on bin-resolved outcome statistics for fixed measurement channels. Using Pauli-axis measurements on IBM superconducting processors, we observe statistically significant operational drift that persists after full two-qubit readout mitigation, ruling out measurement artifacts. In contrast, drift extracted from CHSH-optimal measurements is eliminated by mitigation, demonstrating that such settings are unsuitable for diagnosing preparation nonstationarity. We further show that the observed Bell violations imply only modest ensemble divergences, comparable in scale to those required in Hall-type measurement-dependence models, but arising here solely from preparation drift combined with experimental scheduling. Our results identify a preparation-dependent loophole relevant to Bell tests on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices and highlight the necessity of drift-aware protocols for reliable quantum certification.</description>

      <title>Interferometric evidence of non-volatile anomalous phase shifts in exchange-spin-split Josephson supercurrent diodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent realization of zero-field, polarity-reversible supercurrent rectification in proximity-magnetized Rashba-type Pt Josephson junctions (JJs) enables the development of superconducting logic circuits and cryogenic memory applications. Here, we demonstrate a non-volatile anomalous phase shift {\phi}_0 directly probed via superconducting quantum interferometry, providing phase-sensitive evidence of spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking in these Rashba-type systems. By replacing the Pt barrier with 5d or 4d element layers exhibiting different (para-)magnetic susceptibilities, spin-orbit coupling strengths, and electronic band structures, we elucidate the role of proximity effects in governing zero-field diode behavior. Ta (W) JJs exhibit zero-field diode efficiencies of ~17% (~5%) at 2 K, which are slightly (significantly) lower than those of Pt JJs. Notably, the diode polarity in Ta and W JJs is reversed relative to Pt JJs. Combined with the large zero-field diode efficiency (~15% at 2 K) observed in highly magnetic-susceptible Pd JJs, these results show that non-volatile {\phi}_0 and, consequently, zero-field diode performance can be tuned through proximity engineering of interfacial magnetic ordering and Rashba spin-orbit interaction.</description>

      <title>Screened superexchange mechanism for superconductivity applied to cuprates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1965, Kohn and Luttinger published a note revealing that dynamical screening of the repulsive Coulomb interaction leads under certain conditions to an effective attraction necessary for the formation of Cooper pairs. We propose such a formalism adapted to the cuprates where the screening arises from the superexchange dynamics of virtual holes in the oxygen orbitals of the $Cu O_2$ plane. Using an adequate Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, the basic Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) method and the {\it ab initio} data on orbitals (energy, hopping, interaction), we derive some predictions for the temperature-doping phase diagram (pseudo-gap, strange metal, antiferromagnetism, superconducting and normal states) and for the doping dependant band energy spectrum in semi-quantitative agreement with observations.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field decouples nodeless surface and nodal bulk orders in PdTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Selective spectroscopic disentanglement of surface and bulk quantum orders remains an outstanding challenge in condensed matter physics. The candidate topological superconductor PdTe has recently been proposed to host a nodeless surface gap on top of a nodal bulk state, but their direct identification and mutual coupling remained experimentally elusive. Here, we employ magnetic-field-dependent Andreev reflection spectroscopy to spectroscopically disentangle these components. At zero magnetic field, the spectra exhibit a BCS-like gap structure, consistent with dominant transport through a fully gapped surface superconducting state. Strikingly, even a weak magnetic field leads to an abrupt suppression of the Andreev-enhanced conductance (AEC), while a residual AEC, attributable to the nodal bulk state, persists to much higher magnetic fields. The transition is accompanied by pronounced magnetic hysteresis pointing to the existence of vortex dynamics at low fields. Our findings suggest that the nodal bulk gap facilitates early vortex entry, which in turn disrupts the fragile surface superconductivity. These results establish a field-tunable decoupling of surface and bulk superconductivity and illustrate how distinct gap topologies can shape the global superconducting order in multichannel systems.</description>

      <title>Chiral superconductivity from parent Chern band and its non-Abelian generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05384v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a minimal model starting from a parent Chern band with quartic dispersion that can describe the spin-valley polarized electrons in rhombohedral tetralayer graphene. The interplay between repulsive and attractive interactions on top of that parent Chern band is studied. We conduct standard self-consistent mean-field calculations, and find a rich phase diagram that consists of metal, quantum anomalous Hall crystal, chiral topological superconductor, as well as trivial gapped Bose--Einstein condensate. In particular, there exists a topological phase transition from the chiral superconductor to the Bose--Einstein condensate at zero temperature. Motivated by the recent experimental and theoretical studies of composite Fermi liquid in rhombohedral stacked multilayer graphene, we further generalize the physical electron model to its composite fermion counterpart based on a field theory analysis. The chiral superconductor phase of the composite fermion becomes the nonabelian Moore--Read quantum Hall phase. We argue that a chiral (pseudo-)spin liquid phase can emerge in the vicinity of this Moore--Read quantum Hall phase. Our work suggests rhombohedral multilayer graphene as a potential platform for rich correlated topological phases.</description>

      <title>Revealing Superconducting Chiral Edge Modes via Resistance Distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11456v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inducing superconducting correlations in quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) states offers a promising route to realize topological superconductivity with chiral Majorana edge modes. However, the definitive identification of these modes is challenging. Here we propose detecting superconducting chiral edge modes via the probability distribution of the resistance, or equivalently the charge transmission of QAH-superconductor heterojunctions. Remarkably, the distribution for coherent edge exhibits distinct characteristics for different topological superconducting phases in sufficiently long junctions, and this difference remains robust against weak decoherence. These findings provide insights into transport phenomena beyond the clean limit and highlight the resistance distribution as a compelling signature for distinguishing topological superconducting phases.</description>

      <title>Universal scaling of microwave dissipation in superconducting circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08953v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Improving the coherence of superconducting qubits is essential for advancing quantum technologies. While superconductors are theoretically perfect conductors, they consistently exhibit residual energy dissipation when driven by microwave currents, limiting coherence times. Here, we report a universal scaling between microwave dissipation and the superfluid density, a bulk property of superconductors related to charge carrier density and disorder. Our analysis spans a wide range of superconducting materials and device geometries, from highly disordered amorphous films to ultra-clean systems with record-high quality factors, including resonators, 3D cavities, and transmon qubits. This scaling reveals an intrinsic bulk dissipation channel, independent of surface dielectric losses, that originates from a universal density of nonequilibrium quasiparticles trapped within disorder-induced spatial variations of the superconducting gap. Our findings identify an empirical coherence limit associated with intrinsic material properties and provide a data-driven basis for materials selection in future superconducting quantum circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the superconducting phase and perpendicular Josephson supercurrent in twisted three-dimensional (3D) superconductors, where two layered 3D materials are stacked with a relative twist. We formulate the Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian and develop a self-consistent method to calculate the superconducting order parameter and the resulting supercurrent. Applying this framework to a toy model with Fermi surfaces located near the Brillouin zone corners, we demonstrate a phase discontinuity at the twisted interface, indicating that a Josephson junction is formed purely by the twist. Our calculations reveal that the interface supports a finite critical current even when the Fermi surfaces of the two superconductors are completely separated, unlike in the case of a twisted normal-metal interface. We further show that the critical current can be effectively controlled by the twist angle, transitioning from a high-transparency regime at small angles to a low-transparency regime at larger angles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23962v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two of the iconic phases of the hole-doped cuprate materials are the intermediate temperature pseudogap metal and the lower temperature $d$-wave superconductor. Following the prescient suggestion of P.~W.~Anderson, there were numerous early theories of these phases as doped quantum spin liquids. However, these theories have had difficulties with two prominent observations:
  (i) angle-dependent magnetoresistance measurements (ADMR) in the pseudogap metal, including observation of the Yamaji effect, present convincing evidence of small hole pockets which can tunnel coherently between square lattice layers (Fang et al., Nature Physics 18, 558 (2022); Chan et al., Nature Physics 21, 1753 (2025)) and
  (ii) the velocities of the nodal Bogoliubov quasiparticles in the $d$-wave superconductor are highly anisotropic, with $v_F \gg v_\Delta$ (Chiao et al., Phys. Rev. B 62, 3554 (2000)).
  These lecture notes review how the fractionalized Fermi Liquid (FL*) state, which dopes quantum spin liquids with gauge-neutral electron-like quasiparticles, resolves both difficulties. Theories of insulating quantum spin liquids employing fractionalization of the electron spin into bosonic or fermionic partons are discussed. Doping the bosonic parton theory leads to a holon metal theory: while not appropriate for the cuprate pseudogap, this theory is argued to apply to the Lieb lattice. Doping the fermionic parton theory leads to a $d$-wave superconductor with nearly isotropic quasiparticle velocities. The construction of the FL* state in a single band Hubbard-type model is described using a quantum dimer model, followed by a more realistic description using the Ancilla Layer Model (ALM), which is then used to obtain the theory of the pseudogap and the $d$-wave superconductor.</description>
