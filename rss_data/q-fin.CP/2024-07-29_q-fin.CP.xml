      <title>Multilevel Monte Carlo in Sample Average Approximation: Convergence, Complexity and Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the Sample Average Approximation (SAA) procedure within a framework where the Monte Carlo estimator of the expectation is biased. We also introduce Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) in the SAA setup to enhance the computational efficiency of solving optimization problems. In this context, we conduct a thorough analysis, exploiting Cram\'er's large deviation theory, to establish uniform convergence, quantify the convergence rate, and determine the sample complexity for both standard Monte Carlo and MLMC paradigms. Additionally, we perform a root-mean-squared error analysis utilizing tools from empirical process theory to derive sample complexity without relying on the finite moment condition typically required for uniform convergence results. Finally, we validate our findings and demonstrate the advantages of the MLMC estimator through numerical examples, estimating Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) in the Geometric Brownian Motion and nested expectation framework.</description>

      <title>CVA Sensitivities, Hedging and Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified framework for computing CVA sensitivities, hedging the CVA, and assessing CVA risk, using probabilistic machine learning meant as refined regression tools on simulated data, validatable by low-cost companion Monte Carlo procedures. Various notions of sensitivities  are introduced  and benchmarked numerically.  We identify the sensitivities representing the best practical trade-offs in downstream tasks including CVA hedging and risk assessment.</description>

      <title>AMA-LSTM: Pioneering Robust and Fair Financial Audio Analysis for Stock Volatility Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stock volatility prediction is an important task in the financial industry. Recent advancements in multimodal methodologies, which integrate both textual and auditory data, have demonstrated significant improvements in this domain, such as earnings calls (Earnings calls are public available and often involve the management team of a public company and interested parties to discuss the company's earnings). However, these multimodal methods have faced two drawbacks. First, they often fail to yield reliable models and overfit the data due to their absorption of stochastic information from the stock market. Moreover, using multimodal models to predict stock volatility suffers from gender bias and lacks an efficient way to eliminate such bias. To address these aforementioned problems, we use adversarial training to generate perturbations that simulate the inherent stochasticity and bias, by creating areas resistant to random information around the input space to improve model robustness and fairness. Our comprehensive experiments on two real-world financial audio datasets reveal that this method exceeds the performance of current state-of-the-art solution. This confirms the value of adversarial training in reducing stochasticity and bias for stock volatility prediction tasks.</description>

      <title>The Structure of Financial Equity Research Reports -- Identification of the Most Frequently Asked Questions in Financial Analyst Reports to Automate Equity Research Using Llama 3 and GPT-4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research dissects financial equity research reports (ERRs) by mapping their content into categories.
  There is insufficient empirical analysis of the questions answered in ERRs. In particular, it is not understood how frequently certain information appears, what information is considered essential, and what information requires human judgment to distill into an ERR.
  The study analyzes 72 ERRs sentence-by-sentence, classifying their 4940 sentences into 169 unique question archetypes. We did not predefine the questions but derived them solely from the statements in the ERRs. This approach provides an unbiased view of the content of the observed ERRs. Subsequently, we used public corporate reports to classify the questions' potential for automation. Answers were labeled "text-extractable" if the answers to the question were accessible in corporate reports.
  78.7% of the questions in ERRs can be automated. Those automatable question consist of 48.2% text-extractable (suited to processing by large language models, LLMs) and 30.5% database-extractable questions. Only 21.3% of questions require human judgment to answer.
  We empirically validate using Llama-3-70B and GPT-4-turbo-2024-04-09 that recent advances in language generation and information extraction enable the automation of approximately 80% of the statements in ERRs. Surprisingly, the models complement each other's strengths and weaknesses well.
  The research confirms that the current writing process of ERRs can likely benefit from additional automation, improving quality and efficiency. The research thus allows us to quantify the potential impacts of introducing large language models in the ERR writing process.
  The full question list, including the archetypes and their frequency, will be made available online after peer review.</description>

      <title>Finite Difference Solution Ansatz approach in Least-Squares Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09166v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article presents a simple but effective and efficient approach to improve the accuracy and stability of Least-Squares Monte Carlo for American-style option pricing as well as expected exposure calculation in valuation adjustments. The key idea is to construct the ansatz of conditional expected continuation payoff using the finite difference solution from one dimension, to be used in linear regression. This approach bridges between solving backward partial differential equations and Monte Carlo simulation, aiming at achieving the best of both worlds. Independent of model settings, the ansatz is proved to serve as a control variate to reduce the least-squares errors. We illustrate the technique with realistic examples including Bermudan options, worst of issuer callable notes and expected positive exposure on European options. The method can be considered as a generic numerical scheme across various asset classes, in particular, as an accurate method for pricing and risk-managing American-style derivatives under arbitrary dimensions.</description>
