      <title>Evaluating recognition and recall formats of social network surveys in physics education research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An increasing number of studies in physics education research use social network analysis to quantify interactions among students. These studies typically gather data through online surveys using one of two different survey formats: recognition, where students select peers' names from a provided course roster, and recall, where students type their peers' names from memory as an open response. These survey formats, however, may be subject to two possible systematic errors. First, students may report more peers' names on a recognition survey than a recall survey because the course roster facilitates their memory of their interactions, whereas they may only remember a subset of their interactions on the recall format. Second, recognition surveys may be subject to name order effects, where students are more likely to select peers' names that appear early on in the roster than those that appear later on (e.g., due to survey fatigue). Here we report the results of two methodological studies of these possible errors in the context of introductory physics courses: one directly comparing 65 student responses to recognition and recall versions of the same network survey prompt, and the other measuring name order effects on 54 recognition surveys from 27 different courses. We find that students may report more peer interactions on a recognition survey than a recall survey and that most recognition surveys are not subject to significant name order effects. These results help to inform survey design for future network studies in physics education research.</description>

      <title>Multi-institutional assessment of Peer Instruction implementation and impacts using the Framework for Interactive Learning in Lectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Substantial research indicates that active learning methods improve student learning more than traditional lecturing. Accordingly, current studies aim to characterize and evaluate different instructors' implementations of active learning methods. Peer Instruction is one of the most commonly used active learning methods in undergraduate physics instruction and typically involves the use of classroom response systems (e.g., clickers) where instructors pose conceptual questions that students answer individually and/or in collaboration with nearby peers. Several research studies have identified that different instructors vary in the ways they implement Peer Instruction (e.g., the time they give students to answer a question and the time they spend explaining the correct answer); however, these studies only take place at a single institution and do not relate the implementation of Peer Instruction to student learning. In this study, we analyze variation in both the implementation and impacts of Peer Instruction. We use classroom video observations and conceptual inventory data from seven introductory physics instructors across six U.S. institutions. We characterize implementation using the Framework for Interactive Learning in Lectures (FILL+), which classifies classroom activities as interactive (e.g., clicker questions), vicarious interactive (e.g., individual students asking a question), or non-interactive (e.g., instructor lecturing). Our preliminary results suggest that instructors who use both interactive and vicarious interactive strategies may exhibit larger student learning gains than instructors who predominantly use only one of the two strategies.</description>

      <title>Coupled Oscillators, Frequency Transfer and the Higgs Mechanism's Teaching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a simple model for teaching the Higgs mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking in Particle Physics. The basic idea is associated with analyzing the motion of two particles subjected to specific potentials in certain situations, which will reproduce the movements of harmonic oscillators with the effect of frequency transfer."</description>

      <title>The Boiling-Frog Problem of Physics Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is astonishing how rapidly general-purpose AI has crossed familiar thresholds in introductory physics. Comparing outputs from successive models, GPT-5 Thinking moves far beyond the plug-and-chug tendencies seen earlier: on a classic elevator problem it works symbolically, notes when variables cancel, and verifies results; attempts to prompt novice-like behavior mainly affect tone, not method. On representation translation, the model scores 24/26 (92.3%) on TUG-Kv4.0. In a card-sorting proxy using two of my comprehensive finals (60 items), its categories reflect solution method rather than surface features. Solving those same exams, it attains 27/30 and 25/30, with most misses in ruler-based ray tracing and circuit interpretation. On epistemology, five independent CLASS runs yield 100\% favorable, indicating a simulated expert-like stance. Framed as a "boiling frog" problem, the paper argues for a decisive jump: retire credit-bearing unsupervised closed-response online assessments; grade process evidence; use paper, whiteboarding; shift weight to modeling, data, and authentic labs; require transparent, citable AI use; rebuild problem types; and lean on research-based instruction and peer learning. The opportunity is to foreground what AI cannot substitute for: modeling the world, arguing from evidence, and making principled approximations.</description>
