      <title>Monodromy and vanishing cycles for complete intersection curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the topological monodromy of every family of complete intersection curves. Like in the case of plane curves previously treated by the second-named author, we find the answer is given by the $r$-spin mapping class group associated to the maximal root of the adjoint line bundle. Our main innovation is a suite of tools for studying the monodromy of sections of a tensor product of very ample line bundles in terms of the monodromy of sections of the factors, allowing for an induction on (multi-)degree.</description>

      <title>Effective Fujita-type theorems for surfaces in arbitrary characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fujita's conjecture is known to be false in positive characteristic. However, if $X$ is a smooth projective variety over a field of positive characteristic and $L$ is an ample divisor on $X$, it is an open question whether linear systems of the form $\lvert K_X+aK_X+bL \rvert$ can be made basepoint-free or very ample with $a$ and $b$ only depending on the dimension of $X$. We conjecture that such $a$ and $b$ exist and prove a strong version of this conjecture for basepoint-freeness, very ampleness, and jet ampleness on smooth projective surfaces in arbitrary characteristic. We do not use the classification of surfaces. In positive characteristic, we prove these positivity properties hold for Schwede's canonical linear system $S^0(X,\omega_X \otimes \mathcal{O}_X(aK_X+bL))$. To prove these results, we prove new results on Seshadri constants, moving Seshadri constants, and Frobenius-Seshadri constants, which in the singular case are new even over the complex numbers.</description>

      <title>Gromov-Witten invariants in family and quantum cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A moduli space of stable maps to the fibers of a fiber bundle is constructed. The new moduli space is a family version of the classical moduli space of stable maps to a non-singular complex projective variety. The virtual cycle for this moduli space is also constructed, and an analogue of Gromov-Witten invariants is defined. As an application, we recover the formula for the number of rational degree d curves in P3, whose image lies in a plane in P3 (known as planar curves in P3), intersecting r general lines while passing through given s general points, where r + 2s = 3d + 2, firstly proved by R. Mukherjee, R. Kumar Singh and the fourth named author.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For different cohomology theories (including the Hochschild homology, Hodge cohomology, and Chow groups), we identify the cohomology of moduli space of rank 1 perverse coherent sheaves on the blow-up of a surface by Nakajima-Yoshioka as the tensor product of cohomology of Hilbert schemes with a Fermionic Fock space. As the stable limit, we identify the cohomology of Hilbert schemes of blow-up of a surface as the tensor product of cohomology of Hilbert schemes on the surface with a Bosonic Fock space. The actions of the infinite-dimensional Clifford algebra and Heisenberg algebra are all given by geometric correspondences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study the notion of universally defined cycles of smooth varieties of dimension $d$, and prove that they are given by polynomials in the Chern classes. A similar result is proved for universally defined cycles on products of smooth varieties. We also state a conjectural explicit form for universally defined cycles on powers of smooth varieties, and provide some steps towards establishing it.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $m\geq3$ be an integer. We show that every torsor of the Jacobian of the universal family of degree-$m$ Fermat curve is necessarily a connected component of the Picard scheme. We show that the Jacobian of the generic degree-$m$ Fermat curve has uncountably many non-isomorphic torsors. We give some results towards the Franchetta type problem for torsors of the Jacobian of the universal family of genus-$g$ curves over $\mathcal{M}_g$.</description>

      <title>Symplectic actions of groups of order 4 on K3$^{[2]}$-type manifolds, and standard involutions on Nikulin-type orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a K3^[2]-type manifold X with a symplectic involution i, the quotient X/i admits a Nikulin orbifold Y as terminalization. We study the symplectic action on X of a group G of order 4 that contains i, and the natural involution induced on Y (the two groups give two different results). We classify the irreducible components of the moduli space of X and Y in the projective case, giving some explicit examples. We give lattice-theoretic criteria that a Nikulin-type orbifold N has to satisfy to admit a symplectic involution that deforms to an induced one.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a collection of Hessenberg varieties in the type A flag variety associated to a nonzero semisimple matrix whose conjugacy class has minimal dimension. We prove each such minimal semisimple Hessenberg variety is a union Richardson varieties and compute this set of Richardson varieties explicitly. Our methods leverage the notion of matrix Hessenberg schemes to answer questions about the geometry of minimal semisimple Hessenberg varieties using commutative algebra and known results on Schubert determinantal ideals. In particular, we show that all type A minimal semisimple matrix Hessenberg schemes are reduced.</description>

      <title>Tropical Weil's reciprocity law and Weil's pairing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Weil reciprocity law asserts that given two meromorphic functions $f, g$ on a compact complex curve, the product of the values of $f$ over the roots and poles of $g$ is equal to the product of the values of $g$ over the roots and poles of $f$. We state and prove a tropical version of this reciprocity; the tropical ideas lead to yet another transparent ``combinatorial'' proof of the classical Weil reciprocity law. Then, we construct a tropical Weil pairing on the set of divisors of degree zero.</description>

      <title>Faster Lattice Basis Computation -- The Generalization of the Euclidean Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Euclidean algorithm the oldest algorithms known to mankind. Given two integral numbers $a_1$ and $a_2$, it computes the greatest common divisor (gcd) of $a_1$ and $a_2$ in a very elegant way. From a lattice perspective, it computes a basis of the sum of two one-dimensional lattices $a_1 \mathbb{Z}$ and $a_2 \mathbb{Z}$ as $\gcd(a_1,a_2) \mathbb{Z} = a_1 \mathbb{Z} + a_2 \mathbb{Z}$. In this paper, we show that the classical Euclidean algorithm can be adapted in a very natural way to compute a basis of a general lattice $L (A_1, \ldots , A_n)$ given vectors $A_1, \ldots , A_n \in \mathbb{Z}^d$ with $n&gt; \mathrm{rank}(a_1, \ldots ,a_d)$. Similar to the Euclidean algorithm, our algorithm is very easy to describe and implement and can be written within 12 lines of pseudocode.
  Our generalized version of the Euclidean algorithm allows for several degrees of freedom in the pivoting process. Hence, in a second step, we show that this freedom can be exploited to make the algorithm perform more efficiently. As our main result, we obtain an algorithm to compute a lattice basis for given vectors $A_1, \ldots , A_n \in \mathbb{Z}^d$ in time (counting bit operations) $LS + \tilde O ((n-d)d^2 \cdot \log(||A||)$, where $LS$ is the time required to obtain the exact fractional solution of a certain system of linear equalities. The analysis of the running time of our algorithms relies on fundamental statements on the fractionality of solutions of linear systems of equations.
  So far, the fastest algorithm for lattice basis computation was due to Storjohann and Labhan [SL96] having a running time of $\tilde O (nd^\omega\log ||A||)$. For current upper bounds of $LS$, our algorithm has a running time improvement of a factor of at least $d^{0.12}$ over [SL96]. Our algorithm is therefore the first general algorithmic improvement to this classical problem in nearly 30 years.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the dual fine Selmer group of an abelian variety over the unramified $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$-extension of a function field is finitely generated over $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$. This is a function field version of a conjecture of Coates--Sujatha. We further prove that the fine Selmer group is finite (respectively zero) if the separable $p$-primary torsion of the abelian variety is finite (respectively zero).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2008.04458v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive a simple recursion formula for the Weil-Petersson volumes of moduli spaces of hyperbolic surfaces with boundaries. This formula demonstrates the polynomiality of the volume functions. By constructing the Laplace transform for both the original and our alternative formulas, we show that they are directly equivalent. By considering the top and lowest degree terms of these formulas, we recover the DVV identity and cohomology class identities for $\mathcal{M}_{g,n}$. Similar conclusions are drawn for the super-analog of these results.</description>

      <title>On regular but non-smooth integral curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.16962v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $C$ be a regular geometrically integral curve over an imperfect field $K$ and assume that it admits a non-smooth point $\mathfrak{p}$ which -- seen as a prime of the separable function field $K(C)|K$ -- is non-decomposed in the base field extension $\overline{K} \otimes_K K(C)|\overline{K}$. In this paper we establish a bound for the number of iterated Frobenius pullbacks needed in order to transform $\mathfrak{p}$ into a rational point. This provides an algorithm to compute geometric $\delta$-invariants of non-smooth points and a procedure to construct fibrations with moving singularities of prescribed $\delta$-invariants. We show that the bound is sharp in characteristic 2. We further study the geometry of a pencil of plane projective rational quartics in characteristic 2 whose generic fibre attains our bound. On our way, we prove several results on separable and non-decomposed points that might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Rationality and Parametrizations of Algebraic Curves under Specializations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.04933v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rational algebraic curves have been intensively studied in the last decades, both from the theoretical and applied point of view. In applications (e.g. level curves, linear homotopy deformation, geometric constructions in computer aided design, etc.), there often appear unknown parameters. It is possible to adjoin these parameters to the coefficient field as transcendental elements. In some particular cases, however, the curve has a different behavior than in the generic situation treated in this way. In this paper, we show when the singularities and thus the (geometric) genus of the curves might change. More precisely, we give a partition of the affine space, where the parameters take values, so that in each subset of the partition the specialized curve is either reducible or its genus is invariant. In particular, we give a Zariski-closed set in the space of parameter values where the genus of the curve under specialization might decrease or the specialized curve gets reducible. For the genus zero case, and for a given rational parametrization, a better description is possible such that the set of parameters where Hilbert's irreducibility theorem does not hold can be isolated, and such that the specialization of the parametrization parametrizes the specialized curve. We conclude the paper by illustrating these results by some concrete applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00046v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of enumerating maps $f$ of degree $d$ from a fixed general curve $C$ of genus $g$ to $\mathbb{P}^r$ satisfying incidence conditions of the form $f(p_i)\in X_i$, where $p_i\in C$ are general points and $X_i\subset\mathbb{P}^r$ are general linear spaces. We give a complete answer in the case where the $X_i$ are points, where the counts, the ``Tevelev degrees'' of $\mathbb{P}^r$, were previously known only when $r=1$, when $d$ is large compared to $r,g$, or virtually in Gromov-Witten theory. We also give a complete answer in the case $r=2$ with arbitrary incidence conditions. Our main approach studies the behavior of complete collineations under various degenerations. We expect the technique to have further applications.</description>

      <title>On higher Pythagoras numbers of polynomial rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the higher Pythagoras numbers for the polynomial ring are infinite $p_{2s}(K[x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n])=\infty$ provided that $K$ is a formally real field, $n\geq2$ and $s\geq 1$. This almost fully solves an old question \cite[Problem 8]{cldr1982}. The remaining open cases are precisely $n=1$ and $s&gt;1$. Moreover, we study in detail the cone of binary octics that are sums of fourth powers of quadratic forms. We determine its facial structure as well as its algebraic boundary. This can also be seen as sums of fourth powers of linear forms on the second Veronese of $\mathbb{P}^1$. As a result, we disprove a conjecture of Reznick \cite[Conjecture 7.1]{reznick2011} which states that if a binary form $f$ is a sum of fourth powers, then it can be written as $f=f_1^2+f_2^2$ for some nonnegative forms $f_1,f_2$.</description>

As an application, in the regular full-flag case, we demonstrate a similar result for the cohomology ring of the moduli spaces of parabolic and strongly parabolic Higgs bundles.</description>

Abstract: Our work examines $t$-structures in derived categories related to Noetherian schemes, establishing both classification and nonexistence results for compactly generated $t$-structures that satisfy a tensor compatibility condition. First, we classify which $t$-structures on the derived category of quasi-coherent sheaves can be restricted to the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves. This significantly generalizes Takahashi's results for CM-excellent rings of finite Krull dimension, and its sharpness is illustrated using an example of Nagata. Second, we show that there are no non-trivial tensor $t$-structures on the category of perfect complexes with cohomology supported on an irreducible closed subset if that subset is not contained in the regular locus of the scheme, which generalizes a result of Smith in the affine setting concerning a conjecture of Antieau, Gepner, and Heller.</description>

      <title>Effective generic freeness and applications to local cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.08196v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $A$ be a Noetherian domain and $R$ be a finitely generated $A$-algebra. We study several features regarding the generic freeness over $A$ of an $R$-module. For an ideal $I \subset R$, we show that the local cohomology modules ${\rm H}_I^i(R)$ are generically free over $A$ under certain settings where $R$ is a smooth $A$-algebra. By utilizing the theory of Gr\"obner bases over arbitrary Noetherian rings, we provide an effective method to make explicit the generic freeness over $A$ of a finitely generated $R$-module.</description>

      <title>On local divisor class groups of complete intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.05270v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Samuel conjectured in 1961 that a (Noetherian) local complete intersection ring that is a UFD in codimension at most three is itself a UFD. It is said that Grothendieck invented local cohomology to prove this fact. Following the philosophy that a UFD is nothing else than a Krull domain (that is, a normal domain, in the Noetherian case) with trivial divisor class group, we take a closer look at the Samuel--Grothendieck Theorem and prove the following generalization: Let $A$ be a local Cohen--Macaulay ring.
  (i) $A$ is a normal domain if and only if $A$ is a normal domain in codimension at most $1$.
  (ii) Suppose that $A$ is a normal domain and a complete intersection. Then the divisor class group of $A$ is a subgroup of the projective limit of the divisor class groups of the localizations $A_p$, where $p$ runs through all prime ideals of height at most $3$ in $A$.
  We use this fact to describe for an integral Noetherian locally complete intersection scheme $X$ the gap between the groups of Weil and Cartier divisors, generalizing in this case the classical result that these two concepts coincide if $X$ is locally a UFD.</description>

      <title>On rational points on classifying stacks and Malle's conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10355v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this expository article, we compare Malle's conjecture on counting number fields of bounded discriminant with recent conjectures of Ellenberg--Satriano--Zureick-Brown and Darda--Yasuda on counting points of bounded height on classifying stacks. We illustrate the comparisons via the classifying stacks $B(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})$ and $B{\mu_n}$.</description>

      <title>Root polytopes, flow polytopes, and order polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the class of polytopes which can be obtained by taking the convex hull of some subset of the points $\{e_i-e_j \ \vert \ i \neq j\} \cup \{\pm e_i\}$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$, where $e_1,\dots,e_n$ is the standard basis of $\mathbb{R}^n$. Such a polytope can be encoded by a quiver $Q$ with vertices $V \subseteq \{v_1,\dots,v_n\} \cup \{\star\}$, where each edge $v_j\to v_i$ or $\star \to v_i$ or $v_i\to \star$ gives rise to the point $e_i-e_j$ or $e_i$ or $-e_i$, respectively; we denote the corresponding polytope as $\operatorname{Root}(Q)$. These polytopes have been studied extensively under names such as edge polytope and root polytope. We show that if the quiver $Q$ is strongly-connected then the root polytope $\operatorname{Root}(Q)$ is reflexive and terminal; we moreover give a combinatorial description of the facets of $\operatorname{Root}(Q)$. We also show that if $Q$ is planar, then $\operatorname{Root}(Q)$ is (integrally equivalent to the) polar dual of the flow polytope of the dual quiver. Finally we consider the case that $Q$ comes from a ranked poset $P$, and show that $\operatorname{Root}(Q)$ is polar dual to (a translation of) a marked poset polytope. We then study the toric variety $Y(\mathcal{F}_Q)$ associated to the face fan $\mathcal{F}_Q$ of $\operatorname{Root}(Q)$. If $Q$ comes from a ranked poset $P$ we give a combinatorial description of the Picard group of $Y(\mathcal{F}_Q)$, and we show that $Y(\mathcal{F}_Q)$ is a small partial desingularisation of the Hibi toric variety $Y_{\mathcal{O}(P)}$ of the order polytope $\mathcal{O}(P)$. We show that $Y(\mathcal{F}_Q)$ has a small crepant toric resolution of singularities $Y(\widehat{\mathcal{F}}_Q)$, and as a consequence that the Hibi toric variety $Y_{\mathcal{O}(P)}$ has a small resolution of singularities for any ranked poset $P$. These results have applications to mirror symmetry.</description>
