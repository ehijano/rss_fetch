      <title>Recurrence Relations for k-Fold Nested Power Sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the $k$-nested sum of integer powers, $F(n,m,k)$, defined as repeated partial sums of the classical Faulhaber polynomials. We provide an explicit recurrence relation relating $F(n,m,k)$ to sums of lower power $m-1$ and higher nesting level $k+1$. This identity is derived from a core algebraic relation on the binomial coefficients that form the kernel of the nested sum's representation. We discuss the relevance to the 2010 paper by S.~Butler and P.~Karasik, ``A Note on Nested Sums'' (JIS, Vol.~13, Article~10.4.4), which studies nested sums of powers of integers that generalize Faulhaber-type sums. We also discuss the equivalence to a related recurrence previously established in the context of hypersums of powers of integers by J.~L.~Cereceda.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of p-polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In addition to general considerations, the present work includes the enumeration of the equivalence-classes of p-polygons with p vertices for p bigger than 3 with certain symmetry properties: 1. We count the equivalence-classes of p-polygons with p symmetry axes, the so called regular polygons. 2. We count the equivalence-classes of p-polygons with exactly one axis of symmetry. 3. We count the equivalence-classes of p-polygons with no axis of symmetry, the so called asymmetrical p-polygons. For p = 5 and p = 7 we show in all three cases a set of representatifs of the equivalenceclasses.</description>

      <title>Generalized ovals, 2.5-dimensional additive codes, and multispreads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present constructions and bounds for additive codes over a finite field in terms of their geometric counterpart, i.e.\ projective systems. It is known that the maximum number of $(l-1)$-spaces in $\operatorname{PG}(2,q)$, such that no hyperplane contains three, is given by $q^l+1$ if $q$ is odd. Those geometric objects are called generalized ovals. We show that cardinality $q^l+2$ is possible if we decrease the dimension a bit. We completely determine the minimum possible lengths of additive codes over $\mathbb{F}_9$ of dimension $2.5$ and give improved constructions for other small parameters. As an application, we consider multispreads in $\operatorname{PG}(4,q)$, in particular, completing the characterization of parameters of $\mathbb{F}_4$-linear $64$-ary one-weight codes.</description>

      <title>Cutting a Pancake with an Exotic Knife</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the first chapter of their classic book "Concrete Mathematics", Graham, Knuth, and Patashnik consider the maximum number of pieces that can be obtained from a pancake by making n cuts with a knife blade that is straight, or bent into a V, or bent twice into a Z. We extend their work by considering knives, or "cookie-cutters", of even more exotic shapes, including a k-armed V, a chain of k connected line segments, a long-legged version of one of the letters A, E, L, M, T, W, or X, a convex polygon, a circle, a figure 8, a pentagram, a hexagram, or a lollipop. In many cases a counting argument combined with Euler's formula produces an explicit expression for the maximum number of pieces. ``Strict'' versions of the letters A and T are also considered, for which we have only conjectural formulas.</description>

      <title>On fractional triangle decompositions of random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that with high probability $G(n,p)$ with $p \geq n^{-4/11 + o(1)}$ admits a fractional triangle decomposition (FTD), i.e., a nonnegative weighting of its triangles such that for each edge, the total weight of the triangles containing it equals one. This improves on the state of the art, due to Delcourt, Kelly, and Postle, that $p \geq n^{-1/3+o(1)}$ suffices.
  The proof is algorithmic: Given $G \sim G(n,p)$, we first construct an approximate FTD by taking a uniform weighting of the triangles. We then use specialized gadgets to iteratively shift weights and obtain successively better approximations of an FTD.</description>

      <title>Schubert Polynomials and Elementary Symmetric Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the factorization of Schubert polynomials into elementary symmetric polynomials. We conjecture that this occurs when the permutation corresponding to the Schubert polynomial does not contain the patterns $1432$, $1423$, $4132$, and $3142$. We prove one direction of this and provide progress towards the second direction, including obstructions arising from permutations with a rectangular array of crosses in their bottom pipe dream. This characterization helps us identify new ties between elementary symmetric polynomials and Schubert polynomials. It contributes to the broader understanding of pattern avoidance phenomena in algebraic combinatorics.</description>

      <title>Generalizing the Multiple Exchange Property for Matroid Bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multiple exchange property for matroid bases states that for any bases $A$ and $B$ of a matroid and any subset $X\subseteq A\setminus B$, there exists a subset $Y\subseteq B\setminus A$ such that both $A-X+Y$ and $B+X-Y$ are bases. This classical result has not only found applications in matroid theory, but also in the analysis and design of various algorithms. In our work, we prove a common generalization of this and other known basis exchange properties by showing that for any subsets $X \subseteq A \setminus B$ and $Y \subseteq B \setminus A$, there exist subsets $U \subseteq A \setminus B$ and $V \subseteq B \setminus A$ such that $X\subseteq U$, $Y\subseteq V$, $A-U+V$ and $B+U-V$ are bases, and $|U|=|V|$ is at most the rank of $X+Y$. As an application, we prove the robustness of the local search algorithm for finding maximum weight matroid bases. For matroids representable over a field of characteristic zero, we further generalize our exchange property to include the very recent Equitability Theorem (SODA 2026), by establishing a far-reaching generalization of the Grassmann-Pl\"ucker identity.</description>

      <title>Extending two results on hamiltonian graphs involving the bipartite-hole-number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bipartite-hole-number of a graph $G$, denoted by $\widetilde{\alpha}(G)$, is the minimum number $k$ such that there exist positive integers $s$ and $t$ with $s+t=k+1$ with the property that for any two disjoint sets $A,B\subseteq V(G)$ with $|A|=s$ and $|B|=t$, there is an edge between $A$ and $B$. In this paper, we first prove that any $2$-connected graph $G$ satisfying $d_G(x)+d_G(y)\ge 2\widetilde{\alpha}(G)-2$ for every pair of non-adjacent vertices $x,y$ is hamiltonian except for a special family of graphs, thereby extending results of Li and Liu (2025), and Ellingham, Huang and Wei (2025). We then establish a stability version of a theorem by McDiarmid and Yolov (2017): every graph whose minimum degree is at least its bipartite-hole-number minus one is hamiltonian except for a special family of graphs.</description>

      <title>Zero forcing propagation time intervals and graphs with fixed propagation time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero forcing in a graph refers to the evolution of vertex states under repeated application of a color change rule. Typically the states are chosen to be blue and white, and a forcing set is an initial set of blue vertices such that all of the vertices are blue at the end of the process. In this context, the propagation time of a set in a graph is the number of iterations of the color change rule required to have all vertices blue, performing independent color changes simultaneously. Different minimal forcing sets need not have the same propagation time, and we study the realizability of specific integers as propagation times of minimal forcing sets in graphs for two of the most well-studied color change rules (standard and positive semidefinite). Particular attention is paid to the case where all minimal forcing sets have the same propagation time, and we term this phenomenon fixed propagation time. For each of the two variants, we present a general form of graphs all of which have fixed propagation time equal to one. We conjecture that these are the only such graphs and prove the conjectures for joins of graphs. Families of graphs with longer fixed propagation time for standard forcing are exhibited, and it is shown that such graphs do not exist for positive semidefinite forcing.</description>

      <title>Block-Separated Overpartitions and Their Fibonacci-Type Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study a new restricted family of overpartitions, called block-separated overpartitions, in which no two consecutive distinct part-size blocks may both be overlined. Using a two-state transfer-matrix automaton, we derive a closed matrix-product expression for the ordinary generating function, establish an Euler-type factorization, and obtain an explicit normalized recurrence suitable for computation of arbitrary coefficients. We further prove that the possible overlining patterns on the distinct blocks are counted by Fibonacci numbers, giving natural bijections with independent sets on paths, pattern-avoiding binary words, and Fibonacci tilings.</description>

      <title>Subdivisions of lower Eulerian posets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a natural notion of a subdivision of a lower Eulerian poset called a strong formal subdivision, which abstracts the notion of a polyhedral subdivision of a polytope, or a proper, surjective morphism of fans. We show that there is a canonical bijection between strong formal subdivisions and triples consisting of a lower Eulerian poset, a corresponding rank function, and a non-minimal element such that the join with any other element exists. The bijection uses the non-Hausdorff mapping cylinder construction introduced by Barmak and Minian. A corresponding bijection for $CW$-posets is given, as well as an application to computing the $cd$-index of an Eulerian poset. A companion paper explores applications to Kazhdan-Lusztig-Stanley theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a companion paper, a canonical bijection was established between strong formal subdivisions of lower Eulerian posets and triples consisting of a lower Eulerian poset, a corresponding rank function, and a non-minimal element such that the join with any other element exists. The main goal of this paper is to relate the local $h$-polynomials of a strong formal subdivision to the Kazhdan-Lusztig-Stanley (KLS) invariants associated to its corresponding lower Eulerian poset under this bijection. As an application, we show that Braden and MacPherson's relative $g$-polynomials are alternative encodings of corresponding local $h$-polynomials. We also further develop equivariant KLS theory and give equivariant generalizations of our main results, as well as an application to equivariant Ehrhart theory.</description>

      <title>Riesz products and the Lonely Runner Conjecture: A wider gap of loneliness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lonely runner conjecture of Wills and Cusick asserts that if $n$ runners with distinct constant speeds run around a a circular unit length track, starting at a common time and place, then each runner will at some time be separated by a distance of at least $\frac{1}{n}$ from all other runners. A weaker lower bound of $\frac{1}{2n-2}$ follows from the so-called trivial union bound, and subsequent work upgraded this to bounds of the form $\frac{1}{2n}+\frac{c}{n^2}$ for various constants $c&gt;0$. Tao strengthened this to $\frac{1}{2n}+\frac{(\log n)^{1-o(1)}}{n^2}$. In this paper, we obtain a polynomial improvement of the form $$\frac{1}{2n}+\frac{1}{n^{5/3+o(1)}}.$$</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we determine the $r$-colour size Ramsey number of the path $P_k$, up to constants. In particular, for every fixed $r \geq 2$ and $k \geq 100\log r$, we have
  \[ \widehat{R}_r(P_k)=\Theta((r^2 \log r) \, k).\] Perhaps surprisingly, we do this by improving the lower bound on $\widehat{R}_r(P_k)$.</description>

      <title>A Dirichlet Generating Function for the Coefficients of Euler's Pentagonal Number Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish an integral representation for the Dirichlet generating function of the coefficients of Euler's pentagonal number theorem. The Bromwich-type integral enables analytic continuation to the entire complex plane, filling a gap in the literature and providing a new framework for studying the sequence's analytic structure. Furthermore, we derive the asymptotic behavior as the variable tends to negative infinity, and give integral representations for the Euler function $\phi(q)$ and the Dedekind eta function $\eta(\tau)$. Moreover, we obtain an explicit formula for the Dirichlet generating function at each positive integer, expressed as a finite sum.</description>

      <title>On the gradient of a monomial ideal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a field of characteristic zero, let $I \subset S = K[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ be a homogeneous ideal, and let $\partial(I)$ be its gradient ideal. We study the relationship between $\mathrm{reg}\,I$ and $\mathrm{reg}\,\partial(I)$. While earlier work by Bus\'e, Dimca, Schenck, and Sticlaru showed these regularities are generally incomparable for hypersurface ideals, we prove they remain incomparable even for monomial ideals with linear resolution, answering a question of J. Herzog. In fact, for any integers $a \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $b \ge - 1$, we construct monomial ideals $I$ and $J$ such that $\mathrm{reg}\,I - \mathrm{reg}\,\partial(I) = a$, $\mathrm{reg}\,\partial(J) - \mathrm{reg}\,J = b$ and $J$ has linear resolution. We introduce monomial ideals with differential linear resolution as those monomial ideals whose all iterated gradient ideals have linear resolution. We prove that polymatroidal ideals, equigenerated (strongly) stable ideals, powers of edge ideals with linear resolution, complementary edge ideals with linear resolution, and certain equigenerated squarefree monomial ideals with many generators satisfy this property.</description>

Abstract: We use recent advances in the theory of Furstenberg sets to prove new incidence results of Szemer\'edi--Trotter strength for $\delta$-discretized structures with Cartesian product flavor. We use these results to make progress on a number of problems that include energy estimates and Fourier decay of fractal measures supported on curves, as well as various sum-product-like results governed by fractal dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We survey the known group properties that a sequence of finite groups or group actions needs to satisfy to admit subsets of bounded cardinality producing expander Cayley or Schreier graphs. We prove that an infinite amenable group and solvable groups of bounded derived length do not produce expander Schreier graphs, generalizing with easier proofs results of Lubotzky and Weiss for Cayley graphs. In particular, the poor expansion properties of a group action cannot in general be detected by looking at the abelian sections or at the representations above the stabilizer of a point.</description>

      <title>Simplicity and irreducibility in circular automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the conditions under which a given circular (synchronizing) DFA is \emph{simple} (sometimes referred to as \emph{primitive}) and when it is \emph{irreducible}. Our notion of irreducibility slightly differs from the classical one, since we are considering our monoid representations to be over $\mathbb{C}$ instead of $\mathbb{Q}$; nevertheless, several well-known results remain valid-for instance, the fact that every irreducible automaton is necessarily simple. We provide a complete characterization of simplicity in the circular case by means of the \emph{weak contracting property}. Furthermore, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for a circular \emph{contracting automaton} (a stronger condition than the weakly contracting one) to be irreducible, and we present examples illustrating our results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Maximal Entropy Random Walk (MERW) is a natural process on a finite graph, introduced a few years ago with motivations from theoretical physics. The construction of this process relies on Perron-Frobenius theory for adjacency matrices. Generalizing to infinite graphs is rather delicate, and in this article, we treat in a fairly exhaustive manner the case of the MERW on Z with loops, for both random and nonrandom loops. Thanks to an explicit combinatorial representation of the corresponding Perron-Frobenius eigenvectors, we are able to precisely determine the asymptotic behavior of these walks. We show, in particular, that essentially all MERWs on Z with loops have positive speed.</description>

Abstract: We show that every non-hamiltonian polyhedron contains the Herschel graph as a minor, implying that the Herschel graph is the unique minor-minimal non-hamiltonian polyhedron. Our approach unifies many previously known results on minors of non-hamiltonian polyhedra, while strengthening them with significantly shorter, non-computer-assisted proofs. As an application, we characterize non-hamiltonian polyhedra with no $K_{2,6}$ minor, resolving a conjecture of Ellingham, Marshall, Ozeki, Royle, and Tsuchiya.</description>

Abstract: Basis partitions are minimal partitions corresponding to successive rank vectors. We show combinatorially how basis partitions can be generated from primary partitions which are equivalent to the Rogers-Ramanujan partitions. This leads to the definition of a signature of a basis partition that we use to explain certain parity results. We then study a special class of basis partitions which we term as complete. Finally we discuss basis partitions and minimal basis partitions among partitions with non-repeating odd parts by representing them using 2-modular graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a directed multigraph $D$ that is balanced (i.e., at each vertex, the indegree equals the outdegree). Let $A$ be its set of arcs. Fix an integer $k$. Let $s$ be a vertex of $D$. We show that the number of $k$-element subsets $B$ of $A$ that contain no cycles but contain a path from each vertex to $s$ (we call them "$s$-convergences") is independent on $s$. This generalizes known facts about spanning arborescences, acyclic orientations and maximal acyclic subdigraphs (or, equivalently, minimum feedback arc sets). Moreover, this result can be generalized even further, replacing "contain no cycles" with "have a given set of cycles".</description>

      <title>On the second largest eigenvalue of certain graphs in the perfect matching association scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The perfect matching association scheme is a set of relations on the perfect matchings of the complete graph on $2n$ vertices. The relations between perfect matchings are defined by the cycle structure of the union of any two perfect matchings, and each relation can be represented as a matrix. Each matrix is labeled by an integer partition whose parts correspond to the size do the cycles in the union. Since these matrices form an association scheme, they are simultaneously diagonalizable. Further, it is well-known that the common eigenspaces correspond to the irreducible representations of $S_{2n}$ indexed by the even partitions of $2n$. In this paper, we conjecture that the second largest eigenvalue of the matrices in the perfect matching association scheme labeled by a partition containing at least two parts of size 1 always occurs on the eigenspace corresponding to the representation indexed by $[2n-2, 2]$. We confirm this conjecture for matrices labeled by the partitions $[2, 1^{n-2}], [3, 1^{n-3}], [2, 2, 1^{n-4}], [4, 1^{n-4}], [3, 2, 1^{n-5}]$, and $[5, 1^{n-5}]$, as well as any partition in which the first part is sufficiently large.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Chow classes of arbitrary matroids in the Grassmannian. We develop a new combinatorial approach for computing them, by first focusing on snake matroids and then extending our results via valuativity to any matroid. Our main contribution identifies the Poincar\'e dual of the Chow class of a snake matroid with a specific ribbon Schur function, providing an explicit formula for its coefficients in the Schubert basis as the number of standard Young tableaux of a given shape with a prescribed descent set. This agrees with a formula by Klyachko for the uniform matroid. As consequences, we recover and simplify classical results such as Gessel and Viennot's enumeration of permutations with fixed descent sets, and formulas for the volume of lattice path matroids. Furthermore, we demonstrate the power of our findings by proving that certain Schubert coefficients are positive for all connected paving matroids.</description>

      <title>Steiner systems $S(2,6,226)$ and $S(2,6,441)$ do exist!</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Steiner system $S(2,k,v)$ is a set $X$ of cardinality $v$ endowed with a family $\mathcal L$ of $k$-element subsets of $X$ such that any two distinct points of $X$ belong to a unique set of the family $\mathcal L$. If a Steiner system $S(2,k,v)$ exists, then $k-1$ divides $v-1$ and $k(k-1)$ divides $v(v-1)$. Those divisibility conditions are necessary but not sufficient for the existence of a Steiner system $S(2,k,v)$. For instance, the Bruck--Ryser Theorem implies that no Steiner system $S(2,6,36)$ exists, despite $5$ divides $35$ and $6\cdot 5$ divides $36\cdot 35$. On the other hand, Wilson showed that for every natural number $k\ge 2$, a Steiner system $S(2,k,v)$ exists for all but finitely many natural numbers $v$ satisfying the above divisibility conditions. The Handbook of Combinatorial Designs lists 29 numbers $v$ for which the existence of a Steiner system $S(2,6,v)$ is not known: 51, 61, 81, 166, 226, 231, 256, 261, 286, 316, 321, 346, 351, 376, 406, 411, 436, 441, 471, 501, 561, 591, 616, 646, 651, 676, 771, 796, 801. In this paper we present seven Steiner systems $S(2,6,226)$ and six Steiner systems $S(2,6,441)$ thus resolving two of those 29 undecided cases. The discovered Steiner systems $S(2,6,226)$ and $S(2,6,441)$ were found by computer search, as $1$-rotational difference families and difference families for the groups $(\mathbb Z_5\times\mathbb Z_5\times\mathbb Z_3)\rtimes\mathbb Z_3$ and $(\mathbb Z_7\rtimes\mathbb Z_3)\times(\mathbb Z_7\rtimes\mathbb Z_3)$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Growing Avoiders from the Right: An Operator-Theoretic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Marcus and Tardos \cite{MarcusTardos2004} proved the Stanley-Wilf conjecture by reducing pattern avoidance to an extremal problem on $0$-$1$ matrices. We give a parallel proof that stays in the ``grow from the right'' world of enumerative combinatorics. A $v$-avoiding permutation is built by right insertion, we keep a pruned family of forbidden ranks (the \emph{frontier}), and the insertion step becomes a nonnegative transfer operator on a doubly weighted $\ell^\infty$ space. A length-quadratic penalty makes this operator a finite-rank perturbation of a contraction, so a standard core/tail argument \cite{IonescuTulceaMarinescu1950,Hennion1993} yields quasi-compactness and analyticity of the growth series, hence finite exponential growth for Av$(v)$.
  The same operator skeleton applies, with the same bounded-frontier check, to two natural extensions that are visible to right-to-left growth: (i) right-anchored vincular patterns \cite{BabsonSteingrimsson2000}, and (ii) mesh patterns \cite{BrandenClaesson2011} whose shaded cells lie in a fixed right strip. This appears to give the first general Stanley-Wilf type statements for these two subclasses. Our formulation is completely internal -- we never pass to $0$-$1$ matrices -- and it isolates the single pattern-dependent step (a bounded frontier increment) from the rest of the operator-theoretic machinery.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that for $2\le d\le 4$, every finite geometric simplicial complex $\Delta$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with vertices on the moment curve can be extended to a triangulation $T$ of the cyclic polytope $C$ where $\Delta, T$ and $C$ all have the same vertex set. Further, for $d\ge 5$ we construct for every $n\ge d+3$ complexes $\Delta$ on $n$ vertices for which no such triangulations $T$ exist.
  Our result for $d=4$ has the following novel algebraic application, due to a correspondence by Oppermann and Thomas (JEMS, 2012): every maximal rigid object in $\mathcal{O}_{A_n^{2}}$ is cluster tilting, where $\mathcal{O}_{A_n^{\delta}}$ denotes a higher dimensional cluster category introduced by Oppermann and Thomas for $A_n^\delta$, where $A_n^\delta$ denotes a higher Auslander algebra of linearly oriented type $A$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A family $\mathcal{G}$ of sets is a copy of a poset $(P,\leqslant)$ if $(\mathcal{G},\subseteq)$ is isomorphic to $(P,\leqslant)$. The forbidden subposet problem asks for determining $La^*(n,P)$, the maximum size of a family $\mathcal{F}\subseteq 2^{[n]}$ that does not contain any copy of $P$. We study the rainbow version of this problem: what is the maximum size $La_R^*(n,P)$ of a family $\mathcal{F}=\cup_{i=1}^mA^i$ such that all $A^i$ are antichains and there is no copy of $P$ with all sets coming from distinct $A^i$ or equivalently $\mathcal{F}$ admits a proper coloring (sets $F\subset F'$ must receive different colors) with no rainbow copy of $P$.
  A poset $(Q,\leqslant')$ rainbow forces $(P,\leqslant)$ if any proper coloring $c$ of $Q$ ($q\leqslant' q'$ or $q'\leqslant' q$ implies $c(q)\neq c(q')$) admits a rainbow copy of $P$. We establish connection between the $La^*$ and the $La^*_R$ functions via poset rainbow forcing, determine the asymptotics of $La_R^*(n,T)$ for all tree posets and obtain further exact or asymptotic results for antichains and complete bipartite posets.</description>

      <title>Representative set statements for delta-matroids and the Mader delta-matroid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03605v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present representative sets-style statements for linear delta-matroids, which are set systems that generalize matroids, with important connections to matching theory and graph embeddings. Furthermore, our proof uses a new approach of sieving polynomial families, which generalizes the linear algebra approach of the representative sets lemma to a setting of bounded-degree polynomials. The representative sets statements for linear delta-matroids then follow by analyzing the Pfaffian of the skew-symmetric matrix representing the delta-matroid. Applying the same framework to the determinant instead of the Pfaffian recovers the representative sets lemma for linear matroids. Altogether, this significantly extends the toolbox available for kernelization.
  As an application, we show an exact sparsification result for Mader networks: Let $G=(V,E)$ be a graph and $\mathcal{T}$ a partition of a set of terminals $T \subseteq V(G)$, $|T|=k$. A $\mathcal{T}$-path in $G$ is a path with endpoints in distinct parts of $\mathcal{T}$ and internal vertices disjoint from $T$. In polynomial time, we can derive a graph $G'=(V',E')$ with $T \subseteq V(G')$, such that for every subset $S \subseteq T$ there is a packing of $\mathcal{T}$-paths with endpoints $S$ in $G$ if and only if there is one in $G'$, and $|V(G')|=O(k^3)$. This generalizes the (undirected version of the) cut-covering lemma, which corresponds to the case that $\mathcal{T}$ contains only two blocks.
  To prove the Mader network sparsification result, we furthermore define the class of Mader delta-matroids, and show that they have linear representations. This should be of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: We introduce and study a model of plane random trees generalizing the famous Bienaym\'e--Galton--Watson model but where births and deaths are locally correlated. More precisely, given a random variable $(B,H)$ with values in $\{1,2,3, \dots\}^2$, given the state of the tree at some generation, the next generation is obtained (informally) by successively deleting $B$ individuals side-by-side and replacing them with $H$ new particles where the samplings are i.i.d. We prove that, in the critical case $\mathbb{E}[B]=\mathbb{E}[H]$, and under a third moment condition on $B$ and $H$, the random trees coding the genealogy of the population model converges towards the Brownian Continuum Random Tree. Interestingly, our proof does not use the classical height process or the {\L}ukasiewicz exploration, but rather the stochastic flow point of view introduced by Bertoin and Le Gall.</description>

      <title>Permuton limits for some permutations avoiding a single pattern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Permutons are probability measures on the unit square with uniform marginals that provide a natural way to describe limits of permutations. We are interested in the permuton limits for permutations sampled uniformly from certain pattern-avoiding classes that are in bijection with the class of permutations avoiding the increasing pattern of length $d+1$. In particular, we will look at a family of permutations whose permuton limit collapses to the unique permuton supported on the line $x + y = 1$ in the unit square, informally known as the anti-diagonal. We prove some general properties about permutons to aid our efforts, which may be useful for proving permuton limits that converge to the anti-diagonal for a broader range of permutation classes.</description>

      <title>A robot that unknots knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider a robot that remembers only the starting position and walks along a knot once on a knot diagram, switching every undercrossing it meets until it returns to the starting position. We observe that the robot produces an ascending diagram, and we provide a new combinatorial proof that every ascending or descending knot diagram can be transformed into the zero-crossing unknot diagram. Using the machinery developed from the combinatorial proof, we show that the minimal number of Reidemeister moves required for such a transformation is bounded above by (7C+1)C if the diagram has C crossings. Moreover, we provide a new alternative proof that there exist sequences of Reidemeister moves that do not increase the number of crossings and transform ascending or descending knot diagrams into zero-crossing unknot diagrams.</description>

      <title>Support-2 monomial ideals that are Simis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A monomial ideal $I\subseteq \mathbb{K}[x_1,\ldots , x_n]$ is called a Simis ideal if $I^{(s)}=I^s$ for all $s\geq 1$, where $I^{(s)}$ denotes the $s$-th symbolic power of $I$. Let $I$ be a support-2 monomial ideal such that its irreducible primary decomposition is minimal. We prove that $I$ is a Simis ideal if and only if $\sqrt{I}$ is Simis and $I$ has standard linear weights. This result thereby proves a recent conjecture for the class of support-2 monomial ideals proposed by Mendez, Pinto, and Villarreal. Furthermore, we give a complete characterization of the Cohen-Macaulay property for support-2 monomial ideals whose radical is the edge ideal of a whiskered graph. Finally, we classify when these ideals are Simis in degree 2.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00414v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1984, Ditor asked two questions: (1) For each $n\in\omega$ and infinite cardinal $\kappa$, is there a join-semilattice of breadth $n+1$ and cardinality $\kappa^{+n}$ whose principal ideals have cardinality $&lt; \kappa$? (2) For each $n \in \omega$, is there a lower-finite lattice of cardinality $\aleph_{n}$ whose elements have at most $n+1$ lower covers? We show that both questions have positive answers under the axiom of constructibility, and hence consistently with $\mathsf{ZFC}$. More specifically, we derive the positive answers from assuming that $\square_\kappa$ holds for enough $\kappa$'s.</description>

      <title>Further Applications of Cubic $q$-Binomial Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider \begin{align*} G(N,M;\alpha,\beta,K,q) = \sum\limits_{j\in\mathbb{Z}}(-1)^jq^{\frac{1}{2}Kj((\alpha+\beta)j+\alpha-\beta)}\left[\begin{matrix}M+N\\N-Kj\end{matrix}\right]_{q}. \end{align*} In this paper, we prove the non-negativity of coefficients of some cases of $G(N,M;\alpha,\beta,K,q)$. For instance, for non-negative integers $n$ and $t$, we prove that\\ \begin{align*} G\left(n,n;\frac{4}{3}+\frac{3(3^t-1)}{2},\frac{5}{3}+\frac{3(3^t-1)}{2},3^{t+1},q\right) \end{align*} and \begin{align*} G\left(n-\frac{3^t-1}{2},n+\frac{3^t+1}{2};\frac{8}{3}+2(3^t-1),\frac{4}{3}-(3^t-1),3^{t+1},q\right)\\ \end{align*} are polynomials in $q$ with non-negative coefficients. Using cubic positivity preserving transformations of Berkovich and Warnaar and some known formulae arising from Rogers-Szeg\"{o} polynomials, we establish new identities such as\\ \begin{align*} \sum\limits_{0\le 3j\le n}\dfrac{(q^3;q^3)_{n-j-1}(1-q^{2n})q^{3j^2}}{(q;q)_{n-3j}(q^6;q^6)_{j}} = \sum\limits_{j=-\infty}^{\infty}(-1)^jq^{6j^2}{2n\brack n-3j}_q. \end{align*}</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Guarantees to Explicit Constructions: Local Properties of Linear Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06185v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a general framework for derandomizing random linear codes with respect to a broad class of properties, known as local properties, which encompass several standard notions such as distance, list-decoding, list-recovery, and perfect hashing. Our approach extends the classical Alon-Edmonds-Luby (AEL) construction through a modified formalism of local coordinate-wise linear (LCL) properties, introduced by Levi, Mosheiff, and Shagrithaya (2025). The main theorem demonstrates that if random linear codes satisfy the complement of an LCL property $\mathcal{P}$ with high probability, then one can construct explicit codes satisfying the complement of $\mathcal{P}$ as well, with an enlarged yet constant alphabet size. This gives the first explicit constructions for list recovery, as well as special cases (e.g., list recovery with erasures, zero-error list recovery, perfect hash matrices), with parameters matching those of random linear codes. More broadly, our constructions realize the full range of parameters associated with these properties at the same level of optimality as in the random setting, thereby offering a systematic pathway from probabilistic guarantees to explicit codes that attain them. Furthermore, our derandomization of random linear codes also admits efficient (list) decoding via recently developed expander-based decoders.</description>

      <title>On the irrationality exponent of real numbers with low complexity expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\xi$ be a real number and $b \ge 2$ an integer. We study the relationship between the irrationality exponent of $\xi$ and the subword complexity $p(n, \mathbf{x})$ of the $b$-ary expansion $\mathbf{x}$ of $\xi$, where $p(n, \mathbf{x})$ counts the number of distinct blocks of length $n$ in $\mathbf{x}$, for $n \ge 1$. If the irrationality exponent of $\xi$ is equal to $2$, which is the case for almost all real numbers $\xi$, we show that the limit superior of the sequence $(p(n, \mathbf{x}) / n)_{n \ge 1}$ is at least equal to 4/3. The proof is based on a careful study of the evolution of the Rauzy graphs of infinite words of low complexity.</description>
