      <title>Advancing Multi-grained Alignment for Contrastive Language-Audio Pre-training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances have been witnessed in audio-language joint learning, such as CLAP, that shows much success in multi-modal understanding tasks. These models usually aggregate uni-modal local representations, namely frame or word features, into global ones, on which the contrastive loss is employed to reach coarse-grained cross-modal alignment. However, frame-level correspondence with texts may be ignored, making it ill-posed on explainability and fine-grained challenges which may also undermine performances on coarse-grained tasks. In this work, we aim to improve both coarse- and fine-grained audio-language alignment in large-scale contrastive pre-training. To unify the granularity and latent distribution of two modalities, a shared codebook is adopted to represent multi-modal global features with common bases, and each codeword is regularized to encode modality-shared semantics, bridging the gap between frame and word features. Based on it, a locality-aware block is involved to purify local patterns, and a hard-negative guided loss is devised to boost alignment. Experiments on eleven zero-shot coarse- and fine-grained tasks suggest that our model not only surpasses the baseline CLAP significantly but also yields superior or competitive results compared to current SOTA works.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Large Language Model-based Speech Recognition by Contextualization for Rare and Ambiguous Words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a large language model (LLM) based automatic speech recognition (ASR) system that can be contextualized by providing keywords as prior information in text prompts. We adopt decoder-only architecture and use our in-house LLM, PLaMo-100B, pre-trained from scratch using datasets dominated by Japanese and English texts as the decoder. We adopt a pre-trained Whisper encoder as an audio encoder, and the audio embeddings from the audio encoder are projected to the text embedding space by an adapter layer and concatenated with text embeddings converted from text prompts to form inputs to the decoder. By providing keywords as prior information in the text prompts, we can contextualize our LLM-based ASR system without modifying the model architecture to transcribe ambiguous words in the input audio accurately. Experimental results demonstrate that providing keywords to the decoder can significantly improve the recognition performance of rare and ambiguous words.</description>

      <title>Accelerating High-Fidelity Waveform Generation via Adversarial Flow Matching Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces PeriodWave-Turbo, a high-fidelity and high-efficient waveform generation model via adversarial flow matching optimization. Recently, conditional flow matching (CFM) generative models have been successfully adopted for waveform generation tasks, leveraging a single vector field estimation objective for training. Although these models can generate high-fidelity waveform signals, they require significantly more ODE steps compared to GAN-based models, which only need a single generation step. Additionally, the generated samples often lack high-frequency information due to noisy vector field estimation, which fails to ensure high-frequency reproduction. To address this limitation, we enhance pre-trained CFM-based generative models by incorporating a fixed-step generator modification. We utilized reconstruction losses and adversarial feedback to accelerate high-fidelity waveform generation. Through adversarial flow matching optimization, it only requires 1,000 steps of fine-tuning to achieve state-of-the-art performance across various objective metrics. Moreover, we significantly reduce inference speed from 16 steps to 2 or 4 steps. Additionally, by scaling up the backbone of PeriodWave from 29M to 70M parameters for improved generalization, PeriodWave-Turbo achieves unprecedented performance, with a perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) score of 4.454 on the LibriTTS dataset. Audio samples, source code and checkpoints will be available at https://github.com/sh-lee-prml/PeriodWave.</description>

      <title>Hearing Your Blood Sugar: Non-Invasive Glucose Measurement Through Simple Vocal Signals, Transforming any Speech into a Sensor with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective diabetes management relies heavily on the continuous monitoring of blood glucose levels, traditionally achieved through invasive and uncomfortable methods. While various non-invasive techniques have been explored, such as optical, microwave, and electrochemical approaches, none have effectively supplanted these invasive technologies due to issues related to complexity, accuracy, and cost. In this study, we present a transformative and straightforward method that utilizes voice analysis to predict blood glucose levels. Our research investigates the relationship between fluctuations in blood glucose and vocal characteristics, highlighting the influence of blood vessel dynamics during voice production. By applying advanced machine learning algorithms, we analyzed vocal signal variations and established a significant correlation with blood glucose levels. We developed a predictive model using artificial intelligence, based on voice recordings and corresponding glucose measurements from participants, utilizing logistic regression and Ridge regularization. Our findings indicate that voice analysis may serve as a viable non-invasive alternative for glucose monitoring. This innovative approach not only has the potential to streamline and reduce the costs associated with diabetes management but also aims to enhance the quality of life for individuals living with diabetes by providing a painless and user-friendly method for monitoring blood sugar levels.</description>

      <title>The evolution of inharmonicity and noisiness in contemporary popular music</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Much of Western classical music uses instruments based on acoustic resonance. Such instruments produce harmonic or quasi-harmonic sounds. On the other hand, since the early 1970s, popular music has largely been produced in the recording studio. As a result, popular music is not bound to be based on harmonic or quasi-harmonic sounds. In this study, we use modified MPEG-7 features to explore and characterise the way in which the use of noise and inharmonicity has evolved in popular music since 1961. We set this evolution in the context of other broad categories of music, including Western classical piano music, Western classical orchestral music, and musique concr\`ete. We propose new features that allow us to distinguish between inharmonicity resulting from noise and inharmonicity resulting from interactions between relatively discrete partials. When the history of contemporary popular music is viewed through the lens of these new features, we find that the period since 1961 can be divided into three phases. From 1961 to 1972, there was a steady increase in inharmonicity but no significant increase in noise. From 1972 to 1986, both inharmonicity and noise increased. Then, since 1986, there has been a steady decrease in both inharmonicity and noise to today's popular music which is significantly less noisy but more inharmonic than the music of the sixties. We relate these observed trends to the development of music production practice over the period and illustrate them with focused analyses of certain key artists and tracks.</description>

      <title>Voice-Driven Mortality Prediction in Hospitalized Heart Failure Patients: A Machine Learning Approach Enhanced with Diagnostic Biomarkers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Addressing heart failure (HF) as a prevalent global health concern poses difficulties in implementing innovative approaches for enhanced patient care. Predicting mortality rates in HF patients, in particular, is difficult yet critical, necessitating individualized care, proactive management, and enabling educated decision-making to enhance outcomes. Recently, the significance of voice biomarkers coupled with Machine Learning (ML) has surged, demonstrating remarkable efficacy, particularly in predicting heart failure. The synergy of voice analysis and ML algorithms provides a non-invasive and easily accessible means to evaluate patients' health. However, there is a lack of voice biomarkers for predicting mortality rates among heart failure patients with standardized speech protocols. Here, we demonstrate a powerful and effective ML model for predicting mortality rates in hospitalized HF patients through the utilization of voice biomarkers. By seamlessly integrating voice biomarkers into routine patient monitoring, this strategy has the potential to improve patient outcomes, optimize resource allocation, and advance patient-centered HF management. In this study, a Machine Learning system, specifically a logistic regression model, is trained to predict patients' 5-year mortality rates using their speech as input. The model performs admirably and consistently, as demonstrated by cross-validation and statistical approaches (p-value &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, integrating NT-proBNP, a diagnostic biomarker in HF, improves the model's predictive accuracy substantially.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Stream Fusion Approach with One-Class Learning for Audio-Visual Deepfake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of developing a robust audio-visual deepfake detection model. In practical use cases, new generation algorithms are continually emerging, and these algorithms are not encountered during the development of detection methods. This calls for the generalization ability of the method. Additionally, to ensure the credibility of detection methods, it is beneficial for the model to interpret which cues from the video indicate it is fake. Motivated by these considerations, we then propose a multi-stream fusion approach with one-class learning as a representation-level regularization technique. We study the generalization problem of audio-visual deepfake detection by creating a new benchmark by extending and re-splitting the existing FakeAVCeleb dataset. The benchmark contains four categories of fake videos (Real Audio-Fake Visual, Fake Audio-Fake Visual, Fake Audio-Real Visual, and Unsynchronized videos). The experimental results demonstrate that our approach surpasses the previous models by a large margin. Furthermore, our proposed framework offers interpretability, indicating which modality the model identifies as more likely to be fake.

      <title>Sound-VECaps: Improving Audio Generation with Visual Enhanced Captions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04416v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative models have shown significant achievements in audio generation tasks. However, existing models struggle with complex and detailed prompts, leading to potential performance degradation. We hypothesize that this problem stems from the simplicity and scarcity of the training data. This work aims to create a large-scale audio dataset with rich captions for improving audio generation models. We first develop an automated pipeline to generate detailed captions by transforming predicted visual captions, audio captions, and tagging labels into comprehensive descriptions using a Large Language Model (LLM). The resulting dataset, Sound-VECaps, comprises 1.66M high-quality audio-caption pairs with enriched details including audio event orders, occurred places and environment information. We then demonstrate that training the text-to-audio generation models with Sound-VECaps significantly improves the performance on complex prompts. Furthermore, we conduct ablation studies of the models on several downstream audio-language tasks, showing the potential of Sound-VECaps in advancing audio-text representation learning. Our dataset and models are available online.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Emotion Recognition using Audio-Video Transformer Fusion with Cross Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding emotions is a fundamental aspect of human communication. Integrating audio and video signals offers a more comprehensive understanding of emotional states compared to traditional methods that rely on a single data source, such as speech or facial expressions. Despite its potential, multimodal emotion recognition faces significant challenges, particularly in synchronization, feature extraction, and fusion of diverse data sources. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel transformer-based model named Audio-Video Transformer Fusion with Cross Attention (AVT-CA). The AVT-CA model employs a transformer fusion approach to effectively capture and synchronize interlinked features from both audio and video inputs, thereby resolving synchronization problems. Additionally, the Cross Attention mechanism within AVT-CA selectively extracts and emphasizes critical features while discarding irrelevant ones from both modalities, addressing feature extraction and fusion challenges. Extensive experimental analysis conducted on the CMU-MOSEI, RAVDESS and CREMA-D datasets demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed model. The results underscore the importance of AVT-CA in developing precise and reliable multimodal emotion recognition systems for practical applications.</description>
