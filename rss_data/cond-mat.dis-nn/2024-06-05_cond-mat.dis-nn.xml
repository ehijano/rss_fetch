      <title>Counting and Hardness-of-Finding Fixed Points in Cellular Automata on Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the fixed points of outer-totalistic cellular automata on sparse random regular graphs. These can be seen as constraint satisfaction problems, where each variable must adhere to the same local constraint, which depends solely on its state and the total number of its neighbors in each possible state. Examples of this setting include classical problems such as independent sets or assortative/dissasortative partitions. We analyse the existence and number of fixed points in the large system limit using the cavity method, under both the replica symmetric (RS) and one-step replica symmetry breaking (1RSB) assumption. This method allows us to characterize the structure of the space of solutions, in particular, if the solutions are clustered and whether the clusters contain frozen variables. This last property is conjectured to be linked to the typical algorithmic hardness of the problem. We bring experimental evidence for this claim by studying the performance of the belief-propagation reinforcement algorithm, a message-passing-based solver for these constraint satisfaction problems.</description>

      <title>Infection fronts in randomly varying transmission-rate media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the geometry and transport properties of infection fronts within the spatial SIR model in two dimensions. The model incorporates short-range correlated quenched random transmission rates. Our findings reveal that the critical average transmission rate for the steady-state propagation of the infection is overestimated by the naive mean-field homogenization. Furthermore, we observe that the velocity, profile, and harmfulness of the fronts, given a specific average transmission, are sensitive to the details of randomness. In particular, we find that the harmfulness of the front is larger the more uniform the transmission-rate is, suggesting potential optimization in vaccination strategies under constraints like fixed average-transmission-rates or limited vaccine resources. The large-scale geometry of the advancing fronts presents nevertheless robust universal features and, for a statistically isotropic and short-range correlated disorder, we get a roughness exponent $\alpha\approx 0.42 \pm 0.10$ and a dynamical exponent $z\approx 1.6 \pm 0.10$, which are roughly compatible with the one-dimensional Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. We find that the KPZ term and the disorder-induced effective noise are present and have a kinematic origin.</description>

      <title>Unified one-parameter scaling function for Anderson localization transitions in non-reciprocal non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By using dimensionless conductances as scaling variables, the conventional one-parameter scaling theory of localization fails for non-reciprocal non-Hermitian systems such as the Hanato-Nelson model. Here, we propose a one-parameter scaling function using the participation ratio as the scaling variable. Employing a highly accurate numerical procedure based on exact diagonalization, we demonstrate that this one-parameter scaling function can describe Anderson localization transitions of non-reciprocal non-Hermitian systems in one and two dimensions of symmetry classes AI and A. The critical exponents of correlation lengths depend on symmetries and dimensionality only, a typical feature of universality. Moreover, we derive a complex-gap equation based on the self-consistent Born approximation that can determine the disorder at which the point gap closes. The obtained disorders match perfectly the critical disorders of Anderson localization transitions from the one-parameter scaling function. Finally, we show that the one-parameter scaling function is also valid for Anderson localization transitions in reciprocal non-Hermitian systems such as two-dimensional class AII$^\dagger$ and can, thus, serve as a unified scaling function for disordered non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Prethermal Time-Crystalline Corner Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of prethermal discrete time crystals whose sub-harmonic response is entirely localized to zero-dimensional corner modes. Within the exponentially long prethermal regime, we show that the robustness of these corner modes arises from two related, yet distinct mechanisms: the presence of a higher-order symmetry-protected topological phase in the effective Hamiltonian, or the emergence of a dynamical constraint that prevents the decay of the corner mode. While the first mechanism ensures the stability of the sub-harmonic response throughout the entirety of the prethermal regime, it is restricted to initial states in the ground state manifold of the effective Hamiltonian. By contrast, the second mechanism enables the observation of the prethermal time-crystalline order for arbitrary initial states, albeit with a time scale that is not only determined by the frequency of the drive, but also the relative energy scale across the system's sublattices. We characterize these two mechanisms by simulating the dynamics of a periodically driven two-dimensional spin model, and discuss natural extensions of our model to all other dimensions.</description>

      <title>Spectral Flow for the Riemann zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, with Mussardo we defined a quantum mechanical problem of a single particle scattering with impurities wherein the quantized energy levels $E_n (\sigma)$ are exactly equal to the zeros of the Riemann $\zeta (s)$ where $\sigma = \Re (s)$ in the limit $\sigma \to 1/2$. The S-matrix is based on the Euler product and is unitary by construction, thus the underlying hamiltonian is hermitian and all eigenvalues must be real. Motivated by the Hilbert-P\'olya idea we study the spectral flows for $\{ E_n (\sigma) \}$. This leads to a simple criterion for the validity of the Riemann Hypothesis. The spectral flow arguments are simple enough that we present analogous results for the Generalized and Grand Riemann Hypotheses. We also illustrate our results for a counter example where the Riemann Hypothesis is violated since there is no underlying unitary S-matrix due to the lack of an Euler product.</description>

      <title>Short-range order and local distortions in entropy stabilized oxides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An idealized high entropy oxide is characterized by perfect chemical disorder and perfect positional order. In this work, we investigate the extent to which short-range order (SRO) and local structural distortions impede that idealized scenario. Working in the entropy stabilized $\alpha$-PbO$_2$ structure, we compare a two-component system, (Ti,Zr)O$_2$, with a four-component system, (Ti,Zr,Hf,Sn)O$_2$, using a combination of experimental and computational approaches. Special quasi-random structures are used in conjunction with density functional theory calculations to investigate the local distortions around specific elements revealing significant local distortions that are relatively insensitive to the number of chemical constituents. Using finite temperature Monte Carlo simulations, we are able to reproduce the previously experimentally observed SRO and transition temperature for the two-component system. However, ideal configurational entropy is never reached, so SRO is expected even at synthesis temperatures. On the other hand, the order-disorder transition temperature is dramatically lower and experimentally inaccessible for the four-component system, while the configurational entropy is closer to ideal and less sensitive to temperature. Total scattering measurements and pair distribution function analysis of slow-cooled and quenched samples support this view. In general, we demonstrate that SRO effects in high entropy materials are less prevalent as more components are added in, provided the pairwise interaction strengths remain comparable, while local distortions are less affected by the number of components.</description>

      <title>Timescale bridging in atomistic simulations of epoxy polymer mechanics using non-affine deformation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing a deep understanding of macroscopic mechanical properties of amorphous systems which lack structural periodicity, has posed a key challenge, not only at the level of theory but also in molecular simulations. Despite significant advancements in computational resources, there is a vast timescale disparity, more than 6 orders of magnitude, between mechanical properties probed in simulations compared to experiments. Using the theoretical framework of non-affine lattice dynamics (NALD), based on the instantaneous normal modes analysis determined through the dynamical matrix of the system, we study the viscoelastic response of a cross-linked epoxy system of diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA) and poly(oxypropylene) diamine, over many orders of magnitude in deformation frequency, below the glass transition temperature. Predictions of the elastic modulus are satisfactorily validated against the non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations in the high-frequency regime, and against experimental data from dynamic mechanical analysis at frequencies $ \sim 1 {\rm Hz}$, hence successfully bridging the timescale gap. The comparison shows that non-affine displacements at the atomic level account for nearly two orders of magnitude reduction in the low-frequency elastic modulus of the polymer glass, compared to affine elasticity estimates. The analysis also reveals the role of internal stresses (as reflected in the instantaneous normal modes), which act as to strengthen the mechanical response.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks Do Not Always Oversmooth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for processing relational data in applications. However, GNNs suffer from the problem of oversmoothing, the property that the features of all nodes exponentially converge to the same vector over layers, prohibiting the design of deep GNNs. In this work we study oversmoothing in graph convolutional networks (GCNs) by using their Gaussian process (GP) equivalence in the limit of infinitely many hidden features. By generalizing methods from conventional deep neural networks (DNNs), we can describe the distribution of features at the output layer of deep GCNs in terms of a GP: as expected, we find that typical parameter choices from the literature lead to oversmoothing. The theory, however, allows us to identify a new, nonoversmoothing phase: if the initial weights of the network have sufficiently large variance, GCNs do not oversmooth, and node features remain informative even at large depth. We demonstrate the validity of this prediction in finite-size GCNs by training a linear classifier on their output. Moreover, using the linearization of the GCN GP, we generalize the concept of propagation depth of information from DNNs to GCNs. This propagation depth diverges at the transition between the oversmoothing and non-oversmoothing phase. We test the predictions of our approach and find good agreement with finite-size GCNs. Initializing GCNs near the transition to the non-oversmoothing phase, we obtain networks which are both deep and expressive.</description>

      <title>Laplacian Renormalization Group: An introduction to heterogeneous coarse-graining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The renormalization group (RG) constitutes a fundamental framework in modern theoretical physics. It allows the study of many systems showing states with large-scale correlations and their classification in a relatively small set of universality classes. RG is the most powerful tool for investigating organizational scales within dynamic systems. However, the application of RG techniques to complex networks has presented significant challenges, primarily due to the intricate interplay of correlations on multiple scales. Existing approaches have relied on hypotheses involving hidden geometries and based on embedding complex networks into hidden metric spaces. Here, we present a practical overview of the recently introduced Laplacian Renormalization Group for heterogeneous networks. First, we present a brief overview that justifies the use of the Laplacian as a natural extension for well-known field theories to analyze spatial disorder. We then draw an analogy to traditional real-space renormalization group procedures, explaining how the LRG generalizes the concept of "Kadanoff supernodes" as block nodes that span multiple scales. These supernodes help mitigate the effects of cross-scale correlations due to small-world properties. Additionally, we rigorously define the LRG procedure in momentum space in the spirit of Wilson RG. Finally, we show different analyses for the evolution of network properties along the LRG flow following structural changes when the network is properly reduced.</description>

      <title>Learning to grok: Emergence of in-context learning and skill composition in modular arithmetic tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models can solve tasks that were not present in the training set. This capability is believed to be due to in-context learning and skill composition. In this work, we study the emergence of in-context learning and skill composition in a collection of modular arithmetic tasks. Specifically, we consider a finite collection of linear modular functions $z = a \, x + b \, y \;\mathrm{mod}\; p$ labeled by the vector $(a, b) \in \mathbb{Z}_p^2$. We use some of these tasks for pre-training and the rest for out-of-distribution testing. We empirically show that a GPT-style transformer exhibits a transition from in-distribution to out-of-distribution generalization as the number of pre-training tasks increases. We find that the smallest model capable of out-of-distribution generalization requires two transformer blocks, while for deeper models, the out-of-distribution generalization phase is \emph{transient}, necessitating early stopping. Finally, we perform an interpretability study of the pre-trained models, revealing the highly structured representations in both phases; and discuss the learnt algorithm.</description>

      <title>Machine learning stochastic differential equations for the evolution of order parameters of classical many-body systems in and out of equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03913v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a machine learning algorithm to infer the emergent stochastic equation governing the evolution of an order parameter of a many-body system. We train our neural network to independently learn the directed force acting on the order parameter as well as an effective diffusive noise. We illustrate our approach using the classical Ising model endowed with Glauber dynamics, and the contact process as test cases. For both models, which represent paradigmatic equilibrium and nonequilibrium scenarios, the directed force and noise can be efficiently inferred. The directed force term of the Ising model allows us to reconstruct an effective potential for the order parameter which develops the characteristic double-well shape below the critical temperature. Despite its genuine nonequilibrium nature, such an effective potential can also be obtained for the contact process and its shape signals a phase transition into an absorbing state. Also, in contrast to the equilibrium Ising model, the presence of an absorbing state renders the noise term dependent on the value of the order parameter itself.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of feature learning in two-layer networks after one gradient-step</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04980v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we investigate the problem of how two-layer neural networks learn features from data, and improve over the kernel regime, after being trained with a single gradient descent step. Leveraging the insight from (Ba et al., 2022), we model the trained network by a spiked Random Features (sRF) model. Further building on recent progress on Gaussian universality (Dandi et al., 2023), we provide an exact asymptotic description of the generalization error of the sRF in the high-dimensional limit where the number of samples, the width, and the input dimension grow at a proportional rate. The resulting characterization for sRFs also captures closely the learning curves of the original network model. This enables us to understand how adapting to the data is crucial for the network to efficiently learn non-linear functions in the direction of the gradient -- where at initialization it can only express linear functions in this regime.</description>
