      <title>Preference Models assume Proportional Hazards of Utilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Approaches for estimating preferences from human annotated data typically involves inducing a distribution over a ranked list of choices such as the Plackett-Luce model. Indeed, modern AI alignment tools such as Reward Modelling and Direct Preference Optimization are based on the statistical assumptions posed by the Plackett-Luce model. In this paper, I will connect the Plackett-Luce model to another classical and well known statistical model, the Cox Proportional Hazards model and attempt to shed some light on the implications of the connection therein.</description>

      <title>Structural Foundations for Leading Digit Laws: Beyond Probabilistic Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a modern deterministic framework for the study of leading significant digit distributions in numerical data. Rather than relying on traditional probabilistic or mixture-based explanations, we demonstrate that the observed frequencies of leading digits are determined by the underlying arithmetic, algorithmic, and structural properties of the data-generating process. Our approach centers on a shift-invariant functional equation, whose general solution is given by explicit affine-plus-periodic formulas. This structural formulation explains the diversity of digit distributions encountered in both empirical and mathematical datasets, including cases with pronounced deviations from logarithmic or scale-invariant profiles.
  We systematically analyze digit distributions in finite and infinite datasets, address deterministic sequences such as prime numbers and recurrence relations, and highlight the emergence of block-structured and fractal features. The article provides critical examination of probabilistic models, explicit examples and counterexamples, and discusses limitations and open problems for further research. Overall, this work establishes a unified mathematical foundation for digital phenomena and offers a versatile toolset for modeling and analyzing digit patterns in applied and theoretical contexts.</description>

      <title>Flow Matching-Based Generative Modeling for Efficient and Scalable Data Assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) is the problem of sequentially estimating the state of a dynamical system from noisy observations. Recent advances in generative modeling have inspired new approaches to DA in high-dimensional nonlinear settings, especially the ensemble score filter (EnSF). However, these come at a significant computational burden due to slow sampling. In this paper, we introduce a new filtering framework based on flow matching (FM) -- called the ensemble flow filter (EnFF) -- to accelerate sampling and enable flexible design of probability paths. EnFF -- a training-free DA approach -- integrates MC estimators for the marginal FM vector field (VF) and a localized guidance to assimilate observations. EnFF has faster sampling and more flexibility in VF design compared to existing generative modeling for DA. Theoretically, we show that EnFF encompasses classical filtering methods such as the bootstrap particle filter and the ensemble Kalman filter as special cases. Experiments on high-dimensional filtering benchmarks demonstrate improved cost-accuracy tradeoffs and the ability to leverage larger ensembles than prior methods. Our results highlight the promise of FM as a scalable tool for filtering in high-dimensional applications that enable the use of large ensembles.</description>

      <title>Smooth Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Functional data, i.e., smooth random functions observed over a continuous domain, are increasingly available in areas such as biomedical research, health informatics, and epidemiology. However, effective statistical analysis for functional data is often hindered by challenges such as privacy constraints, sparse and irregular sampling, infinite dimensionality, and non-Gaussian structures. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework named Smooth Flow Matching (SFM), tailored for generative modeling of functional data to enable statistical analysis without exposing sensitive real data. Built upon flow-matching ideas, SFM constructs a semiparametric copula flow to generate infinite-dimensional functional data, free from Gaussianity or low-rank assumptions. It is computationally efficient, handles irregular observations, and guarantees the smoothness of the generated functions, offering a practical and flexible solution in scenarios where existing deep generative methods are not applicable. Through extensive simulation studies, we demonstrate the advantages of SFM in terms of both synthetic data quality and computational efficiency. We then apply SFM to generate clinical trajectory data from the MIMIC-IV patient electronic health records (EHR) longitudinal database. Our analysis showcases the ability of SFM to produce high-quality surrogate data for downstream statistical tasks, highlighting its potential to boost the utility of EHR data for clinical applications.</description>

      <title>Online Conformal Selection with Accept-to-Reject Changes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Selecting a subset of promising candidates from a large pool is crucial across various scientific and real-world applications. Conformal selection offers a distribution-free and model-agnostic framework for candidate selection with uncertainty quantification. While effective in offline settings, its application to online scenarios, where data arrives sequentially, poses challenges. Notably, conformal selection permits the deselection of previously selected candidates, which is incompatible with applications requiring irreversible selection decisions. This limitation is particularly evident in resource-intensive sequential processes, such as drug discovery, where advancing a compound to subsequent stages renders reversal impractical. To address this issue, we extend conformal selection to an online Accept-to-Reject Changes (ARC) procedure: non-selected data points can be reconsidered for selection later, and once a candidate is selected, the decision is irreversible. Specifically, we propose a novel conformal selection method, Online Conformal Selection with Accept-to-Reject Changes (dubbed OCS-ARC), which incorporates online Benjamini-Hochberg procedure into the candidate selection process. We provide theoretical guarantees that OCS-ARC controls the false discovery rate (FDR) at or below the nominal level at any timestep under both i.i.d. and exchangeable data assumptions. Additionally, we theoretically show that our approach naturally extends to multivariate response settings. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that OCS-ARC significantly improves selection power over the baseline while maintaining valid FDR control across all examined timesteps.</description>

      <title>Generalisation and benign over-fitting for linear regression onto random functional covariates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study theoretical predictive performance of ridge and ridge-less least-squares regression when covariate vectors arise from evaluating $p$ random, means-square continuous functions over a latent metric space at $n$ random and unobserved locations, subject to additive noise. This leads us away from the standard assumption of i.i.d. data to a setting in which the $n$ covariate vectors are exchangeable but not independent in general. Under an assumption of independence across dimensions, $4$-th order moment, and other regularity conditions, we obtain probabilistic bounds on a notion of predictive excess risk adapted to our random functional covariate setting, making use of recent results of Barzilai and Shamir. We derive convergence rates in regimes where $p$ grows suitably fast relative to $n$, illustrating interplay between ingredients of the model in determining convergence behaviour and the role of additive covariate noise in benign-overfitting.</description>

      <title>A PC Algorithm for Max-Linear Bayesian Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Max-linear Bayesian networks (MLBNs) are a relatively recent class of structural equation models which arise when the random variables involved have heavy-tailed distributions. Unlike most directed graphical models, MLBNs are typically not faithful to d-separation and thus classical causal discovery algorithms such as the PC algorithm or greedy equivalence search can not be used to accurately recover the true graph structure. In this paper, we begin the study of constraint-based discovery algorithms for MLBNs given an oracle for testing conditional independence in the true, unknown graph. We show that if the oracle is given by the $\ast$-separation criteria in the true graph, then the PC algorithm remains consistent despite the presence of additional CI statements implied by $\ast$-separation. We also introduce a new causal discovery algorithm named "PCstar" which assumes faithfulness to $C^\ast$-separation and is able to orient additional edges which cannot be oriented with only d- or $\ast$-separation.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware PCA for Arbitrarily Distributed Data Modeled by Gaussian Mixture Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multidimensional data is often associated with uncertainties that are not well-described by normal distributions. In this work, we describe how such distributions can be projected to a low-dimensional space using uncertainty-aware principal component analysis (UAPCA). We propose to model multidimensional distributions using Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and derive the projection from a general formulation that allows projecting arbitrary probability density functions. The low-dimensional projections of the densities exhibit more details about the distributions and represent them more faithfully compared to UAPCA mappings. Further, we support including user-defined weights between the different distributions, which allows for varying the importance of the multidimensional distributions. We evaluate our approach by comparing the distributions in low-dimensional space obtained by our method and UAPCA to those obtained by sample-based projections.</description>

      <title>AlphaEval: A Comprehensive and Efficient Evaluation Framework for Formula Alpha Mining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Formula alpha mining, which generates predictive signals from financial data, is critical for quantitative investment. Although various algorithmic approaches-such as genetic programming, reinforcement learning, and large language models-have significantly expanded the capacity for alpha discovery, systematic evaluation remains a key challenge. Existing evaluation metrics predominantly include backtesting and correlation-based measures. Backtesting is computationally intensive, inherently sequential, and sensitive to specific strategy parameters. Correlation-based metrics, though efficient, assess only predictive ability and overlook other crucial properties such as temporal stability, robustness, diversity, and interpretability. Additionally, the closed-source nature of most existing alpha mining models hinders reproducibility and slows progress in this field. To address these issues, we propose AlphaEval, a unified, parallelizable, and backtest-free evaluation framework for automated alpha mining models. AlphaEval assesses the overall quality of generated alphas along five complementary dimensions: predictive power, stability, robustness to market perturbations, financial logic, and diversity. Extensive experiments across representative alpha mining algorithms demonstrate that AlphaEval achieves evaluation consistency comparable to comprehensive backtesting, while providing more comprehensive insights and higher efficiency. Furthermore, AlphaEval effectively identifies superior alphas compared to traditional single-metric screening approaches. All implementations and evaluation tools are open-sourced to promote reproducibility and community engagement.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Conformal Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) is a powerful framework for quantifying uncertainty in machine learning models, offering reliable predictions with finite-sample coverage guarantees. When applied to classification, CP produces a prediction set of possible labels that is guaranteed to contain the true label with high probability, regardless of the underlying classifier. However, standard CP treats classes as flat and unstructured, ignoring domain knowledge such as semantic relationships or hierarchical structure among class labels. This paper presents hierarchical conformal classification (HCC), an extension of CP that incorporates class hierarchies into both the structure and semantics of prediction sets. We formulate HCC as a constrained optimization problem whose solutions yield prediction sets composed of nodes at different levels of the hierarchy, while maintaining coverage guarantees. To address the combinatorial nature of the problem, we formally show that a much smaller, well-structured subset of candidate solutions suffices to ensure coverage while upholding optimality. An empirical evaluation on three new benchmarks consisting of audio, image, and text data highlights the advantages of our approach, and a user study shows that annotators significantly prefer hierarchical over flat prediction sets.</description>

      <title>Minimizing the Weighted Number of Tardy Jobs: Data-Driven Heuristic for Single-Machine Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing research on single-machine scheduling is largely focused on exact algorithms, which perform well on typical instances but can significantly deteriorate on certain regions of the problem space. In contrast, data-driven approaches provide strong and scalable performance when tailored to the structure of specific datasets. Leveraging this idea, we focus on a single-machine scheduling problem where each job is defined by its weight, duration, due date, and deadline, aiming to minimize the total weight of tardy jobs. We introduce a novel data-driven scheduling heuristic that combines machine learning with problem-specific characteristics, ensuring feasible solutions, which is a common challenge for ML-based algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of optimality gap, number of optimal solutions, and adaptability across varied data scenarios, highlighting its flexibility for practical applications. In addition, we conduct a systematic exploration of ML models, addressing a common gap in similar studies by offering a detailed model selection process and providing insights into why the chosen model is the best fit.</description>

      <title>Disentangled Deep Smoothed Bootstrap for Fair Imbalanced Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imbalanced distribution learning is a common and significant challenge in predictive modeling, often reducing the performance of standard algorithms. Although various approaches address this issue, most are tailored to classification problems, with a limited focus on regression. This paper introduces a novel method to improve learning on tabular data within the Imbalanced Regression (IR) framework, which is a critical problem. We propose using Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to model and define a latent representation of data distributions. However, VAEs can be inefficient with imbalanced data like other standard approaches. To address this, we develop an innovative data generation method that combines a disentangled VAE with a Smoothed Bootstrap applied in the latent space. We evaluate the efficiency of this method through numerical comparisons with competitors on benchmark datasets for IR.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-Driven High-Dimensional Variable Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variable selection for high-dimensional, highly correlated data has long been a challenging problem, often yielding unstable and unreliable models. We propose a resample-aggregate framework that exploits diffusion models' ability to generate high-fidelity synthetic data. Specifically, we draw multiple pseudo-data sets from a diffusion model fitted to the original data, apply any off-the-shelf selector (e.g., lasso or SCAD), and store the resulting inclusion indicators and coefficients. Aggregating across replicas produces a stable subset of predictors with calibrated stability scores for variable selection. Theoretically, we show that the proposed method is selection consistent under mild assumptions. Because the generative model imports knowledge from large pre-trained weights, the procedure naturally benefits from transfer learning, boosting power when the observed sample is small or noisy. We also extend the framework of aggregating synthetic data to other model selection problems, including graphical model selection, and statistical inference that supports valid confidence intervals and hypothesis tests. Extensive simulations show consistent gains over the lasso, stability selection, and knockoff baselines, especially when predictors are strongly correlated, achieving higher true-positive rates and lower false-discovery proportions. By coupling diffusion-based data augmentation with principled aggregation, our method advances variable selection methodology and broadens the toolkit for interpretable, statistically rigorous analysis in complex scientific applications.</description>

      <title>Multi-User Contextual Cascading Bandits for Personalized Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a Multi-User Contextual Cascading Bandit model, a new combinatorial bandit framework that captures realistic online advertising scenarios where multiple users interact with sequentially displayed items simultaneously. Unlike classical contextual bandits, MCCB integrates three key structural elements: (i) cascading feedback based on sequential arm exposure, (ii) parallel context sessions enabling selective exploration, and (iii) heterogeneous arm-level rewards. We first propose Upper Confidence Bound with Backward Planning (UCBBP), a UCB-style algorithm tailored to this setting, and prove that it achieves a regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{THN})$ over $T$ episodes, $H$ session steps, and $N$ contexts per episode. Motivated by the fact that many users interact with the system simultaneously, we introduce a second algorithm, termed Active Upper Confidence Bound with Backward Planning (AUCBBP), which shows a strict efficiency improvement in context scaling, i.e., user scaling, with a regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T+HN})$. We validate our theoretical findings via numerical experiments, demonstrating the empirical effectiveness of both algorithms under various settings.</description>

      <title>Contrastive Learning on Multimodal Analysis of Electronic Health Records</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electronic health record (EHR) systems contain a wealth of multimodal clinical data including structured data like clinical codes and unstructured data such as clinical notes. However, many existing EHR-focused studies has traditionally either concentrated on an individual modality or merged different modalities in a rather rudimentary fashion. This approach often results in the perception of structured and unstructured data as separate entities, neglecting the inherent synergy between them. Specifically, the two important modalities contain clinically relevant, inextricably linked and complementary health information. A more complete picture of a patient's medical history is captured by the joint analysis of the two modalities of data. Despite the great success of multimodal contrastive learning on vision-language, its potential remains under-explored in the realm of multimodal EHR, particularly in terms of its theoretical understanding. To accommodate the statistical analysis of multimodal EHR data, in this paper, we propose a novel multimodal feature embedding generative model and design a multimodal contrastive loss to obtain the multimodal EHR feature representation. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of multimodal learning compared to single-modality learning and connects the solution of the loss function to the singular value decomposition of a pointwise mutual information matrix. This connection paves the way for a privacy-preserving algorithm tailored for multimodal EHR feature representation learning. Simulation studies show that the proposed algorithm performs well under a variety of configurations. We further validate the clinical utility of the proposed algorithm in real-world EHR data.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Approximation and Multiplier Bootstrap for Stochastic Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the non-asymptotic validity of the multiplier bootstrap procedure for constructing the confidence sets using the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm. Under appropriate regularity conditions, our approach avoids the need to approximate the limiting covariance of Polyak-Ruppert SGD iterates, which allows us to derive approximation rates in convex distance of order up to $1/\sqrt{n}$. Notably, this rate can be faster than the one that can be proven in the Polyak-Juditsky central limit theorem. To our knowledge, this provides the first fully non-asymptotic bound on the accuracy of bootstrap approximations in SGD algorithms. Our analysis builds on the Gaussian approximation results for nonlinear statistics of independent random variables.</description>

      <title>Rectifying Conformity Scores for Better Conditional Coverage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new method for generating confidence sets within the split conformal prediction framework. Our method performs a trainable transformation of any given conformity score to improve conditional coverage while ensuring exact marginal coverage. The transformation is based on an estimate of the conditional quantile of conformity scores. The resulting method is particularly beneficial for constructing adaptive confidence sets in multi-output problems where standard conformal quantile regression approaches have limited applicability. We develop a theoretical bound that captures the influence of the accuracy of the quantile estimate on the approximate conditional validity, unlike classical bounds for conformal prediction methods that only offer marginal coverage. We experimentally show that our method is highly adaptive to the local data structure and outperforms existing methods in terms of conditional coverage, improving the reliability of statistical inference in various applications.</description>

      <title>Robustly estimating heterogeneity in factorial data using Rashomon Partitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02141v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In both observational data and randomized control trials, researchers select statistical models to articulate how the outcome of interest varies with combinations of observable covariates. Choosing a model that is too simple can obfuscate important heterogeneity in outcomes between covariate groups, while too much complexity risks identifying spurious patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel Bayesian framework for model uncertainty called Rashomon Partition Sets (RPSs). The RPS consists of all models that have posterior density close to the maximum a posteriori (MAP) model. We construct the RPS by enumeration, rather than sampling, which ensures that we explore all models models with high evidence in the data, even if they offer dramatically different substantive explanations. We use a l0 prior, which allows the allows us to capture complex heterogeneity without imposing strong assumptions about the associations between effects, showing this prior is minimax optimal from an information-theoretic perspective. We characterize the approximation error of (functions of) parameters computed conditional on being in the RPS relative to the entire posterior. We propose an algorithm to enumerate the RPS from the class of models that are interpretable and unique, then provide bounds on the size of the RPS. We give simulation evidence along with three empirical examples: price effects on charitable giving, heterogeneity in chromosomal structure, and the introduction of microfinance.</description>

      <title>Disciplined Geodesically Convex Programming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Convex programming plays a fundamental role in machine learning, data science, and engineering. Testing convexity structure in nonlinear programs relies on verifying the convexity of objectives and constraints. Grant et al. (2006) introduced a framework, Disciplined Convex Programming (DCP), for automating this verification task for a wide range of convex functions that can be decomposed into basic convex functions (atoms) using convexity-preserving compositions and transformations (rules). Here, we extend this framework to functions defined on manifolds with non-positive curvature (Hadamard manifolds) by introducing Disciplined Geodesically Convex Programming (DGCP). In particular, this allows for verifying a broader range of convexity notions. For instance, many notable instances of statistical estimators and matrix-valued (sub)routines in machine learning applications are Euclidean non-convex, but exhibit geodesic convexity through a more general Riemannian lens. To define the DGCP framework, we determine convexity-preserving compositions and transformations for geodesically convex functions on general Hadamard manifolds, as well as for the special case of symmetric positive definite matrices, a common setting in matrix-valued optimization. For the latter, we also define a basic set of atoms. Our paper is accompanied by a Julia package SymbolicAnalysis.jl, which provides functionality for testing and certifying DGCP-compliant expressions. Our library interfaces with manifold optimization software, which allows for directly solving verified geodesically convex programs.</description>

      <title>Disentangled Representation Learning with the Gromov-Monge Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07829v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning disentangled representations from unlabelled data is a fundamental challenge in machine learning. Solving it may unlock other problems, such as generalization, interpretability, or fairness. Although remarkably challenging to solve in theory, disentanglement is often achieved in practice through prior matching. Furthermore, recent works have shown that prior matching approaches can be enhanced by leveraging geometrical considerations, e.g., by learning representations that preserve geometric features of the data, such as distances or angles between points. However, matching the prior while preserving geometric features is challenging, as a mapping that fully preserves these features while aligning the data distribution with the prior does not exist in general. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel approach to disentangled representation learning based on quadratic optimal transport. We formulate the problem using Gromov-Monge maps that transport one distribution onto another with minimal distortion of predefined geometric features, preserving them as much as can be achieved. To compute such maps, we propose the Gromov-Monge-Gap (GMG), a regularizer quantifying whether a map moves a reference distribution with minimal geometry distortion. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for disentanglement across four standard benchmarks, outperforming other methods leveraging geometric considerations.</description>

      <title>FDR-SVM: A Federated Distributionally Robust Support Vector Machine via a Mixture of Wasserstein Balls Ambiguity Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03877v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a federated classification problem over a network of multiple clients and a central server, in which each client's local data remains private and is subject to uncertainty in both the features and labels. To address these uncertainties, we develop a novel Federated Distributionally Robust Support Vector Machine (FDR-SVM), robustifying the classification boundary against perturbations in local data distributions. Specifically, the data at each client is governed by a unique true distribution that is unknown. To handle this heterogeneity, we develop a novel Mixture of Wasserstein Balls (MoWB) ambiguity set, naturally extending the classical Wasserstein ball to the federated setting. We then establish theoretical guarantees for our proposed MoWB, deriving an out-of-sample performance bound and showing that its design preserves the separability of the FDR-SVM optimization problem. Next, we rigorously derive two algorithms that solve the FDR-SVM problem and analyze their convergence behavior as well as their worst-case time complexity. We evaluate our algorithms on industrial data and various UCI datasets, whereby we demonstrate that they frequently outperform existing state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing large-scale latent networks from observed dynamics is crucial for understanding complex systems. However, the existing methods based on compressive sensing are often rendered infeasible in practice by prohibitive computational and memory costs. To address this challenge, we introduce a new distributed computing framework for efficient large-scale network reconstruction with parallel computing, namely PALMS (Parallel Adaptive Lasso with Multi-directional Signals). The core idea of PALMS is to decompose the complex global problem by partitioning network nodes, enabling the parallel estimation of sub-networks across multiple computing units. This strategy substantially reduces the computational complexity and storage requirements of classic methods. By using the adaptive multi-directional regularization on each computing unit, we also establish the consistency of PALMS estimator theoretically. Extensive simulation studies and empirical analyses on several large-scale real-world networks validate the computational efficiency and robust reconstruction accuracy of our approach.</description>

      <title>LEARNER: A Transfer Learning Method for Low-Rank Matrix Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20605v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-rank matrix estimation is a fundamental problem in statistics and machine learning with applications across biomedical sciences, including genetics, medical imaging, drug discovery, and electronic health record data analysis. In the context of heterogeneous data generated from diverse sources, a key challenge lies in leveraging data from a source population to enhance the estimation of a low-rank matrix in a target population of interest. We propose an approach that leverages similarity in the latent row and column spaces between the source and target populations to improve estimation in the target population, which we refer to as LatEnt spAce-based tRaNsfer lEaRning (LEARNER). LEARNER is based on performing a low-rank approximation of the target population data which penalizes differences between the latent row and column spaces between the source and target populations. We present a cross-validation approach that allows the method to adapt to the degree of heterogeneity across populations. We conducted extensive simulations which found that LEARNER often outperforms the benchmark approach that only uses the target population data, especially as the signal-to-noise ratio in the source population increases. We also performed an illustrative application and empirical comparison of LEARNER and benchmark approaches in a re-analysis of summary statistics from a genome-wide association study in the BioBank Japan cohort. LEARNER is implemented in the R package learner and the Python package learner-py.</description>

      <title>Closed-Form Feedback-Free Learning with Forward Projection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art methods for backpropagation-free learning employ local error feedback to direct iterative optimisation via gradient descent. In this study, we examine the more restrictive setting where retrograde communication from neuronal outputs is unavailable for pre-synaptic weight optimisation. To address this challenge, we propose Forward Projection (FP). This novel randomised closed-form training method requires only a single forward pass over the entire dataset for model fitting, without retrograde communication. Target values for pre-activation membrane potentials are generated layer-wise via nonlinear projections of pre-synaptic inputs and the labels. Local loss functions are optimised over pre-synaptic inputs using closed-form regression, without feedback from neuronal outputs or downstream layers. Interpretability is a key advantage of FP training; membrane potentials of hidden neurons in FP-trained networks encode information which is interpretable layer-wise as label predictions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of FP across four biomedical datasets. In few-shot learning tasks, FP yielded more generalisable models than those optimised via backpropagation. In large-sample tasks, FP-based models achieve generalisation comparable to gradient descent-based local learning methods while requiring only a single forward propagation step, achieving significant speed up for training. Interpretation functions defined on local neuronal activity in FP-based models successfully identified clinically salient features for diagnosis in two biomedical datasets. Forward Projection is a computationally efficient machine learning approach that yields interpretable neural network models without retrograde communication of neuronal activity during training.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18528v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Energy-based models (EBMs) offer a flexible framework for parameterizing probability distributions using neural networks. However, learning EBMs by exact maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is generally intractable, due to the need to compute the partition function (normalization constant). In this paper, we propose a novel formulation for approximately learning probabilistic EBMs in combinatorially-large discrete spaces, such as sets or permutations. Our key idea is to jointly learn both an energy model and its log-partition, both parameterized as a neural network. Our approach not only provides a novel tractable objective criterion to learn EBMs by stochastic gradient descent (without relying on MCMC), but also a novel means to estimate the log-partition function on unseen data points. On the theoretical side, we show that our approach recovers the optimal MLE solution when optimizing in the space of continuous functions. Furthermore, we show that our approach naturally extends to the broader family of Fenchel-Young losses, allowing us to obtain the first tractable method for optimizing the sparsemax loss in combinatorially-large spaces. We demonstrate our approach on multilabel classification and label ranking.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a physics-based regularization technique for function learning, inspired by statistical mechanics. By drawing an analogy between optimizing the parameters of an interpolator and minimizing the energy of a system, we introduce corrections that impose constraints on the lower-order moments of the data distribution. This minimizes the discrepancy between the discrete and continuum representations of the data, in turn allowing to access more favorable energy landscapes, thus improving the accuracy of the interpolator. Our approach improves performance in both interpolation and regression tasks, even in high-dimensional spaces. Unlike traditional methods, it does not require empirical parameter tuning, making it particularly effective for handling noisy data. We also show that thanks to its local nature, the method offers computational and memory efficiency advantages over Radial Basis Function interpolators, especially for large datasets.</description>

      <title>Performance Comparisons of Reinforcement Learning Algorithms for Sequential Experimental Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in sequential experimental design look to construct a policy that can efficiently navigate the design space, in a way that maximises the expected information gain. Whilst there is work on achieving tractable policies for experimental design problems, there is significantly less work on obtaining policies that are able to generalise well - i.e. able to give good performance despite a change in the underlying statistical properties of the experiments. Conducting experiments sequentially has recently brought about the use of reinforcement learning, where an agent is trained to navigate the design space to select the most informative designs for experimentation. However, there is still a lack of understanding about the benefits and drawbacks of using certain reinforcement learning algorithms to train these agents. In our work, we investigate several reinforcement learning algorithms and their efficacy in producing agents that take maximally informative design decisions in sequential experimental design scenarios. We find that agent performance is impacted depending on the algorithm used for training, and that particular algorithms, using dropout or ensemble approaches, empirically showcase attractive generalisation properties.</description>

      <title>Good Things Come in Pairs: Paired Autoencoders for Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this book chapter, we discuss recent advances in data-driven approaches for inverse problems. In particular, we focus on the \emph{paired autoencoder} framework, which has proven to be a powerful tool for solving inverse problems in scientific computing. The paired autoencoder framework is a novel approach that leverages the strengths of both data-driven and model-based methods by projecting both the data and the quantity of interest into a latent space and mapping these latent spaces to provide surrogate forward and inverse mappings. We illustrate the advantages of this approach through numerical experiments, including seismic imaging and classical inpainting: nonlinear and linear inverse problems, respectively. Although the paired autoencoder framework is likelihood-free, it generates multiple data- and model-based reconstruction metrics that help assess whether examples are in or out of distribution. In addition to direct model estimates from data, the paired autoencoder enables latent-space refinement to fit the observed data accurately. Numerical experiments show that this procedure, combined with the latent-space initial guess, is essential for high-quality estimates, even when data noise exceeds the training regime. We also introduce two novel variants that combine variational and paired autoencoder ideas, maintaining the original benefits while enabling sampling for uncertainty analysis.</description>

      <title>Sample Complexity of Diffusion Model Training Without Empirical Risk Minimizer Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18344v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance across vision, language, and scientific domains. Despite their empirical success, prior theoretical analyses of the sample complexity suffer from poor scaling with input data dimension or rely on unrealistic assumptions such as access to exact empirical risk minimizers. In this work, we provide a principled analysis of score estimation, establishing a sample complexity bound of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-6})$. Our approach leverages a structured decomposition of the score estimation error into statistical, approximation, and optimization errors, enabling us to eliminate the exponential dependence on neural network parameters that arises in prior analyses. It is the first such result which achieves sample complexity bounds without assuming access to the empirical risk minimizer of score function estimation loss.</description>

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress, their proficiency in graph-related tasks remains notably limited, hindering the development of truly general-purpose models. Previous attempts, including pretraining graph foundation models or employing supervised fine-tuning, often face challenges such as the scarcity of large-scale, universally represented graph data. We introduce G1, a simple yet effective approach demonstrating that Reinforcement Learning (RL) on synthetic graph-theoretic tasks can significantly scale LLMs' graph reasoning abilities. To enable RL training, we curate Erd\~os, the largest graph reasoning dataset to date comprising 50 diverse graph-theoretic tasks of varying difficulty levels, 100k training data and 5k test data, all drived from real-world graphs. With RL on Erd\~os, G1 obtains substantial improvements in graph reasoning, where our finetuned 3B model even outperforms Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct (24x size). RL-trained models also show strong zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks, domains, and graph encoding schemes, including other graph-theoretic benchmarks as well as real-world node classification and link prediction tasks, without compromising general reasoning abilities. Our findings offer an efficient, scalable path for building strong graph reasoners by finetuning LLMs with RL on graph-theoretic tasks, which combines the strengths of pretrained LLM capabilities with abundant, automatically generated synthetic data, suggesting that LLMs possess graph understanding abilities that RL can elicit successfully. Our implementation is open-sourced at https://github.com/PKU-ML/G1, with models and datasets hosted on Hugging Face collections https://huggingface.co/collections/PKU-ML/g1-683d659e992794fc99618cf2 for broader accessibility.</description>

      <title>Efficient Network Automatic Relevance Determination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose Network Automatic Relevance Determination (NARD), an extension of ARD for linearly probabilistic models, to simultaneously model sparse relationships between inputs $X \in \mathbb R^{d \times N}$ and outputs $Y \in \mathbb R^{m \times N}$, while capturing the correlation structure among the $Y$. NARD employs a matrix normal prior which contains a sparsity-inducing parameter to identify and discard irrelevant features, thereby promoting sparsity in the model. Algorithmically, it iteratively updates both the precision matrix and the relationship between $Y$ and the refined inputs. To mitigate the computational inefficiencies of the $\mathcal O(m^3 + d^3)$ cost per iteration, we introduce Sequential NARD, which evaluates features sequentially, and a Surrogate Function Method, leveraging an efficient approximation of the marginal likelihood and simplifying the calculation of determinant and inverse of an intermediate matrix. Combining the Sequential update with the Surrogate Function method further reduces computational costs. The computational complexity per iteration for these three methods is reduced to $\mathcal O(m^3+p^3)$, $\mathcal O(m^3 + d^2)$, $\mathcal O(m^3+p^2)$, respectively, where $p \ll d$ is the final number of features in the model. Our methods demonstrate significant improvements in computational efficiency with comparable performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets.</description>
