      <title>Upstream flow geometries can be uniquely learnt from single-point turbulence signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We test the hypothesis that the microscopic temporal structure of near-field turbulence downstream of a sudden contraction contains geometry-identifiable information pertaining to the shape of the upstream obstruction. We measure a set of spatially sparse velocity time-series data downstream of differently-shaped orifices. We then train random forest multiclass classifier models on a vector of invariants derived from this time-series. We test the above hypothesis with 25 somewhat similar orifice shapes to push the model to its extreme limits. Remarkably, the algorithm was able to identify the orifice shape with 100% accuracy and 100% precision. This outcome is enabled by the uniqueness in the downstream temporal evolution of turbulence structures in the flow past orifices, combined with the random forests' ability to learn subtle yet discerning features in the turbulence microstructure. We are also able to explain the underlying flow physics that enables such classification by listing the invariant measures in the order of increasing information entropy. We show that the temporal autocorrelation coefficients of the time-series are most sensitive to orifice shape and are therefore informative. The ability to identify changes in system geometry without the need for physical disassembly offers tremendous potential for flow control and system identification. Furthermore, the proposed approach could potentially have significant applications in other unrelated fields as well, by deploying the core methodology of training random forest classifiers on vectors of invariant measures obtained from time-series data.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of cavitation bubbles inside a small corner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cavitation is a ubiquitous phenomenon in nature and bubble dynamics in open spaces have been widely studied, but the effects of the wall on the dynamics of cavitation bubbles in confined spaces are still unclear. Here, the dynamics of cavitation bubbles in small corners is studied experimentally, focusing on the interaction of the bubble with the wall. High-speed photography is used to visualize the temporal development of laser-induced cavitation bubbles in a small corner formed by two rigid walls, and the bubble spreading on the corner walls and the bubble migration is analyzed via digital image processing. We identify three distinct modes of bubble collapse, namely, collapse dominated by annular shrinkage, collapse dominated by wall attraction, and collapse governed by a combination of both annular shrinkage and wall attraction. The distribution of different collapse modes at different opening angles of the corner is also analyzed. The displacement and shrinkage of different parts of the bubble surface, as well as the direction and amount of bubble migration, are determined. The results show that the asymmetric structure of the corner leads to asymmetric bubble dynamics, including asymmetric bubble expansion, spreading, contraction, and migration.</description>

      <title>Turbulent/non-turbulent interface in high Reynolds number pressure gradient boundary layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report two-dimensional particle image velocimetry experiments in high Reynolds number turbulent boundary layers imposed with a moderately strong streamwise pressure gradient. The unique aspect of these data are the highly resolved measurements across the outer region of a physically thick boundary layer, enabling accurate detection of turbulent/non-turbulent interfaces (TNTI). The present dataset is used to detect the TNTI of an adverse pressure gradient turbulent boundary layer and compare its characteristics with that for a zero-pressure gradient boundary layer, at a nominally similar friction Reynolds number. It is found that the TNTI exists across a broader range of wall-normal distance in presence of an adverse pressure gradient, as compared to the zero-pressure gradient case. Implications on conditionally averaged turbulence statistics are discussed based on detection of the TNTI.</description>

      <title>Irradiation-driven Evaporation of Micro Droplets in an Optical Trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small droplets are irradiated with visible and infrared light in many natural and industrial environments. One of the simplest ways to describe their evaporation is the D$^2$-Law. It states that the evaporation rate is proportional to $t^{-1/2}$, and $R^{-1}$. However, models like the D$^2$-Law do not account for the volumetric heating of light and the effect of strong irradiation on individual droplets is not fully understood. Here we show the effects of IR irradiation on optically levitated water droplets. We find that, under strong irradiation of up to $10^8 W/m^2$, the droplet evaporation is initially driven by the heat from the laser following the power law $dR / dt \sim R$, i.e. the inverse of the D$^2$-Law. Then, when the droplets shrink to 2 - 3 $\mu$m in radius a turnover occurs from irradiation-driven back to diffusion-driven evaporation. Our findings support the understanding of droplet evaporation in cases such as rocket engines or internal combustion, where the radiation from the flame will heat water and fuel droplets.</description>

      <title>Symmetric instability in a Boussinesq fluid on a rotating planet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetric instability has broad applications in geophysical fluid dynamics. It plays a crucial role in the formation of mesoscale rainbands at mid-latitudes on Earth, instability in the ocean's mixed layer, and slantwise convection on gas giants and in the oceans of icy moons. Here, we apply linear instability analysis to an arbitrary zonally symmetric Boussinesq flow on a rotating spherical planet, with applicability to planetary atmospheres and icy moon oceans. We characterize the instabilities into three types: (1) gravitational instability, occurring when stratification is unstable along angular momentum surfaces, (2) inertial instability, occurring when angular momentum shear is unstable along buoyancy surfaces, and (3) a mixed ``PV'' instability, occurring when the potential vorticity has the opposite sign as planetary rotation. We note that $N^2&gt;0$, where $N$ is the Brunt-V\"ais\"al\"a frequency, is neither necessary nor sufficient for stability. Instead, $b_z \sin{\theta}&gt;0$, where $b_z$ is the stratification along the planetary rotation axis and $\theta$ is latitude, is always necessary for stability and also sufficient in the low Rossby number limit. In the low Rossby number limit, applicable to convection in the oceans of icy moons and in the atmospheres of gas giants, the most unstable mode is slantwise convection parallel to the planetary rotation axis.</description>

      <title>A Closed-Form Nonlinear Data Assimilation Algorithm for Multi-Layer Flow Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State estimation in multi-layer turbulent flow fields with only a single layer of partial observation remains a challenging yet practically important task. Applications include inferring the state of the deep ocean by exploiting surface observations. Directly implementing an ensemble Kalman filter based on the full forecast model is usually expensive. One widely used method in practice projects the information of the observed layer to other layers via linear regression. However, when nonlinearity in the highly turbulent flow field becomes dominant, the regression solution will suffer from large uncertainty errors. In this paper, we develop a multi-step nonlinear data assimilation method. A sequence of nonlinear assimilation steps is applied from layer to layer recurrently. Fundamentally different from the traditional linear regression approaches, a conditional Gaussian nonlinear system is adopted as the approximate forecast model to characterize the nonlinear dependence between adjacent layers. The estimated posterior is a Gaussian mixture, which can be highly non-Gaussian. Therefore, the multi-step nonlinear data assimilation method can capture strongly turbulent features, especially intermittency and extreme events, and better quantify the inherent uncertainty. Another notable advantage of the multi-step data assimilation method is that the posterior distribution can be solved using closed-form formulae under the conditional Gaussian framework. Applications to the two-layer quasi-geostrophic system with Lagrangian data assimilation show that the multi-step method outperforms the one-step method with linear stochastic flow models, especially as the tracer number and ensemble size increase.</description>

      <title>Bayesian inference of mean velocity fields and turbulence models from flow MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We solve a Bayesian inverse Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) problem that assimilates mean flow data by jointly reconstructing the mean flow field and learning its unknown RANS parameters. We devise an algorithm that learns the most likely parameters of an algebraic effective viscosity model, and estimates their uncertainties, from mean flow data of a turbulent flow. We conduct a flow MRI experiment to obtain mean flow data of a confined turbulent jet in an idealized medical device known as the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) nozzle. The algorithm successfully reconstructs the mean flow field and learns the most likely turbulence model parameters without overfitting. The methodology accepts any turbulence model, be it algebraic (explicit) or multi-equation (implicit), as long as the model is differentiable, and naturally extends to unsteady turbulent flows.</description>

      <title>Calculating Spectra by Sequential High-Pass Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We expand on the method of sequential filtering for calculating spectra of inhomogeneous fields. Sadek &amp; Aluie [Phys. Rev. Fluids, 3, 124610 (2018)] showed that the kernel has to have at least $p$ vanishing moments to extract a power-law spectrum $k^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha&lt;p+2$ by low-pass filtering. Here, we show that sequential high-pass filtering allows for extracting steeper spectra with $\alpha&lt;2p+3$ using the same $p$-th order kernel. For example, any spectrum of a field that is shallower than $k^{-5}$ can be extracted by sequential high-pass filtering using any 1st order kernel such as a Gaussian or top-hat. Finally, we demonstrate how second-order structure functions fail to capture spectral peaks because they cannot detect scaling that is too shallow.</description>

      <title>Coalescence of viscoelastic drops on a solid substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigated the coalescence of polymer solution drops on the solid substrates. When two drops meet at their contact line on a substrate, the liquid bridge connecting the two drops increases in size with time. The height and radius of the liquid bridge have a power law dependence on time. In the early stage of drop coalescence, the exponents $\alpha$ and $\beta$ of the power law are influenced by the properties of the polymer solution. We argued that the balance between capillarity and viscoelasticity controls the process, where viscoelasticity must be considered in its full time and shear-rate dependency. As a simple proxy for the processes involved, the ratio of the polymer relaxation time to the viscous time of the drop, the elastocapillary ($Ec$), is instructive. In the vicinity of $Ec= 1$ the exponents showed a minimum and increased to lower and higher values of $Ec$. A similar dependency is observed for the damping timescales of the capillary waves. For high elastocapillary numbers, i.e. high polymer relaxation time, drop coalescence on short timescales behaved as in the low viscosity case. In addition, the bridge profile is influenced by a combination of factors including surface tension, viscosity and polymer stress. In summary, we have shown that drop coalescence is strongly influenced by the viscoelasticity of the drops.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Reduced-Order Modeling of Compressible Flow Fields Using Deep Learning and Manifold Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a nonlinear reduced-order modeling (ROM) framework that leverages deep learning and manifold learning to predict compressible flow fields with complex nonlinear features, including shock waves. The proposed DeepManifold (DM)-ROM methodology is computationally efficient, avoids pixelation or interpolation of flow field data, and is adaptable to various grids and geometries. The framework consists of four main steps: First, a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based parameterization network extracts nonlinear shape modes directly from aerodynamic geometries. Next, manifold learning is applied to reduce the dimensionality of the high-fidelity output flow fields. A multilayer perceptron (MLP)-based regression network is then trained to map the nonlinear input and output modes. Finally, a back-mapping process reconstructs the full flow field from the predicted low-dimensional output modes. DM-ROM is rigorously tested on a transonic RAE2822 airfoil test case, which includes shock waves of varying strengths and locations. Metrics are introduced to quantify the model's accuracy in predicting shock wave strength and location. The results demonstrate that DM-ROM achieves a field prediction error of approximately 3.5% and significantly outperforms reference ROM techniques, such as POD-ROM and ISOMAP-ROM, across various training sample sizes.</description>

      <title>A Pioneering Neural Network Method for Efficient and Robust Fuel Sloshing Simulation in Aircraft</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating fuel sloshing within aircraft tanks during flight is crucial for aircraft safety research. Traditional methods based on Navier-Stokes equations are computationally expensive. In this paper, we treat fluid motion as point cloud transformation and propose the first neural network method specifically designed for simulating fuel sloshing in aircraft. This model is also the deep learning model that is the first to be capable of stably modeling fluid particle dynamics in such complex scenarios. Our triangle feature fusion design achieves an optimal balance among fluid dynamics modeling, momentum conservation constraints, and global stability control. Additionally, we constructed the Fueltank dataset, the first dataset for aircraft fuel surface sloshing. It comprises 320,000 frames across four typical tank types and covers a wide range of flight maneuvers, including multi-directional rotations. We conducted comprehensive experiments on both our dataset and the take-off scenario of the aircraft. Compared to existing neural network-based fluid simulation algorithms, we significantly enhanced accuracy while maintaining high computational speed. Compared to traditional SPH methods, our speed improved approximately 10 times. Furthermore, compared to traditional fluid simulation software such as Flow3D, our computation speed increased by more than 300 times.</description>

      <title>Solitary wave formation in the compressible Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the behavior of perturbations in a compressible one-dimensional inviscid gas with an ambient state consisting of constant pressure and periodically-varying density. We show through asymptotic analysis that long-wavelength perturbations approximately obey a system of dispersive nonlinear wave equations. Computational experiments demonstrate that solutions of the 1D Euler equations agree well with this dispersive model, with solutions consisting mainly of solitary waves. Shock formation seems to be avoided for moderate-amplitude initial data, while shock formation occurs for larger initial data. We investigate the threshold for transition between these behaviors, validating a previously-proposed criterion based on further computational experiments. These results support the existence of large-time non-breaking solutions to the 1D compressible Euler equations, as hypothesized in previous works.</description>

      <title>A Note on Hyperbolic Relaxation of the Navier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard system for incompressible two-phase flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the two-phase dynamics of two incompressible and immiscible fluids. As a mathematical model we rely on the Navier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard system that belongs to the class of diffuse-interface models. Solutions of the Navier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard system exhibit strong non-local effects due to the velocity divergence constraint and the fourth-order Cahn-Hilliard operator. We suggest a new first-order approximative system for the inviscid sub-system. It relies on the artificial-compressibility ansatz for the Navier-Stokes equations, a friction-type approximation for the Cahn-Hilliard equation and a relaxation of a third-order capillarity term. We show under reasonable assumptions that the first-order operator within the approximative system is hyperbolic; precisely we prove for the spatially one-dimensional case that it is equipped with an entropy-entropy flux pair with convex (mathematical) entropy. For specific states we present a numerical characteristic analysis. Thanks to the hyperbolicity of the system, we can employ all standard numerical methods from the field of hyperbolic conservation laws. We conclude the paper with preliminary numerical results in one spatial dimension.</description>

      <title>Fully convolutional networks for velocity-field predictions based on the wall heat flux in turbulent boundary layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.06024v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fully-convolutional neural networks (FCN) were proven to be effective for predicting the instantaneous state of a fully-developed turbulent flow at different wall-normal locations using quantities measured at the wall. In Guastoni et al. [J. Fluid Mech. 928, A27 (2021)], we focused on wall-shear-stress distributions as input, which are difficult to measure in experiments. In order to overcome this limitation, we introduce a model that can take as input the heat-flux field at the wall from a passive scalar. Four different Prandtl numbers $Pr = \nu/\alpha = (1,2,4,6)$ are considered (where $\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity and $\alpha$ is the thermal diffusivity of the scalar quantity). A turbulent boundary layer is simulated since accurate heat-flux measurements can be performed in experimental settings: first we train the network on aptly-modified DNS data and then we fine-tune it on the experimental data. Finally, we test our network on experimental data sampled in a water tunnel. These predictions represent the first application of transfer learning on experimental data of neural networks trained on simulations. This paves the way for the implementation of a non-intrusive sensing approach for the flow in practical applications.</description>

      <title>A Momentum Balance Correction to the Non-Conservative One-Fluid Formulation in Boiling Flows using Volume-of-Fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A proven methodology to solve multiphase flows is based on the one-fluid formulation of the governing equations, which treats the phase transition across the interface as a single fluid with varying properties and adds additional source terms to satisfy interface jump conditions, e.g., surface tension and mass transfer. Used interchangeably in the limit of non-evaporative flows, recent literature has formalized the inconsistencies that arise in the momentum balance of the non-conservative one-fluid formulation compared to its conservative counterpart when phase change is involved. This translates into an increased sensitivity of the numerical solution to the choice of formulation. Motivated by the fact that many legacy codes using the non-conservative one-fluid formulation have been extended to phase-change simulations, the inclusion of two corrective forces at the interface and a modification of the pressure-velocity solver with an additional predictor-projection step are shown to recover the exact momentum balance in the evaporative non-conservative one-fluid framework for low-viscosity incompressible flows. This has direct implications for obtaining a physically meaningful pressure jump across the interface and is seen to affect the dynamics of two-phase flows. In the high-viscosity domain, the discretization of the viscous term introduces a momentum imbalance which is highly dependent on the chosen method to model the phase transition. In the context of film boiling, this imbalance affects the time scales for the instability growth. Lastly, the need to develop sub-models for heat and mass transfer and for surface tension becomes evident since typical grid resolutions defined as ``resolved" in the literature may not be enough to capture interfacial phenomena.</description>

      <title>A geometrical Green-Naghdi type system for dispersive-like waves in prismatic channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider 2D free surface gravity waves in prismatic channels with bathymetric variations uniquely in the transverse direction. Starting from the Saint-Venant equations (shallow water equations) we derive a 1D transverse averaged model describing dispersive effects solely related to variations of the channel topography. These effects have been demonstrated in Chassagne et al. JFM 2019 to be predominant in the propagation of bores with Froude numbers below a critical value of about 1.15. The model proposed is fully nonlinear, Galilean invariant, and admits a variational formulation under natural assumptions about the channel geometry. It is endowed with an exact energy conservation law, and admits exact travelling wave solutions. Our model generalizes and improves the linear equations proposed by Chassagne et al. JFM 2019, as well as Quezada de Luna and Ketcheson JFM 2021. The system is recast in two useful forms appropriate for its numerical approximations, whose properties are discussed. Numerical results allow to verify against analytical solutions the implementation of these formulations, and validate our model against fully 2D nonlinear shallow water simulations, as well as the famous experiments by Treske J. Hyd. Res. 1994.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic instabilities of propagating interfaces under Darcy's law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hydrodynamic instabilities of propagating interfaces in Hele-Shaw channels or porous media under the influence of an imposed flow and gravitational acceleration are investigated within the framework of Darcy's law. The stability analysis pertains to an interface between two fluids with different densities, viscosities, and permeabilities, which can be susceptible to Darrieus-Landau, Saffman-Taylor, and Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities. A theoretical analysis, treating the interface as a hydrodynamic discontinuity, yields a simple dispersion relation between the perturbation growth rate $s$ and its wavenumber $k$ in the form $s=(ak - bk^2)/(1+ck)$, where $a$, $b$ and $c$ are constants determined by problem parameters. The constant $a$ characterises all three hydrodynamic instabilities, which are long-wave in nature. In contrast, $b$ and $c$, which characterize the influences of local curvature and flow strain on interface propagation speed, typically provide stabilisation at short wavelengths comparable to interface's diffusive thickness. The theoretical findings for Darcy's law are compared with a generalisation of the classical work by Joulin &amp; Sivashinsky, which is based on an Euler-Darcy model. The comparison provides a conceptual bridge between predictions based on Darcy's law and those on Euler's equation and offers valuable insights into the role of confinement on interface instabilities in Hele-Shaw channels. Numerical analyses of the instabilities are carried out for premixed flames using a simplified chemistry model and Darcy's law. The numerical results corroborate with the explicit formula with a reasonable accuracy. Time-dependent numerical simulations of unstable premixed flames are carried out to gain insights into the nonlinear development of these instabilities.</description>

      <title>An extended analytical wake model and applications to yawed wind turbines in atmospheric boundary layers with different levels of stratification and veer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analytical wake models provide a computationally efficient means to predict velocity distributions in wind turbine wakes in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). Most existing models are developed for neutral atmospheric conditions and correspondingly neglect the effects of buoyancy and Coriolis forces that lead to veer, i.e. changes in the wind direction with height. Both veer and changes in thermal stratification lead to lateral shearing of the wake behind a wind turbine, which affects the power output of downstream turbines. Here we develop an analytical engineering wake model for a wind turbine in yaw in ABL flows including Coriolis and thermal stratification effects. The model combines the new analytical representation of ABL vertical structure based on coupling Ekman and surface layer descriptions (Narasimhan, Gayme, and Meneveau, 2024a) with the vortex sheet-based wake model for yawed turbines (Bastankhah et al., 2022), as well as a new method to predict the wake expansion rate based on the Townsend-Perry logarithmic scaling of streamwise velocity variance. The proposed wake model's predictions show good agreement with Large Eddy Simulation (LES) results, capturing the effects of wind veer and yawing including the curled and sheared wake structures across various states of the ABL, ranging from neutrally to strongly stably stratified atmospheric conditions. The model significantly improves power loss predictions from wake interactions, especially in strongly stably stratified conditions where wind veer effects dominate.</description>

      <title>Dual Euler--Poincar\'e/Lie--Poisson formulation of subinertial stratified thermal ocean flow with identification of Casimirs as Noether quantities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the geometric structure of a quasigeostrophic approximation to a recently introduced reduced-gravity thermal rotating shallow-water model that accounts for stratification. Specifically, it considers a low-frequency approximation of a model for flow above the ocean thermocline, governed by primitive equations with buoyancy variations in both horizontal and vertical directions. Like the thermal model, the stratified variant generates circulation patterns reminiscent of submesoscale instabilities visible in satellite images. An improvement is its ability to model mixed-layer restratification due to baroclinic instability.
  The primary contribution of this paper is to demonstrate that the model is derived from an Euler--Poincar\'e variational principle, culminating in a Kelvin--Noether theorem, previously established solely for the primitive-equation parent model. The model's Lie--Poisson Hamiltonian structure, earlier obtained through direct calculation, is shown to result from a Legendre transform with the associated geometry elucidated by identifying the relevant momentum map.
  Another significant contribution of this paper is the identification of the Casimirs of the Lie--Poisson system, including a newly found weaker Casimir family forming the kernel of the Lie--Poisson bracket, which results in potential vorticity evolution independent of buoyancy details as it advects under the flow. These conservation laws related to particle relabeling symmetry are explicitly linked to Noether quantities from the Euler--Poincar\'e principle when variations are not constrained to vanish at integration endpoints.
  The dual Euler--Poincar\'e/Lie--Poisson formalism provides a unified framework for describing quasigeostrophic reduced-gravity stratified thermal flow, mirroring the approach used in the primitive-equation setting.</description>
