      <title>Quasitopological Lifshitz dilaton black brane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a new class of $(n+1)$-dimensional Lifshitz dilaton black brane solutions in the presence of the cubic quasitopological gravity for a flat boundary. The related action supports asymptotically Lifshitz solutions by applying some conditions which are used throughout the paper. We have to add a new boundary term and some new counterterms to the bulk action to have finite solutions. Then we define a finite stress tensor complex by which we can calculate the energy density of the quasitopological Lifshitz dilaton black brane. It is not possible to obtain analytical solutions, and so we use some expantions to probe the functions behaviors near the horizon and at the infinity. Combining the equations, we can attain a total constant along the coordinate $r$. At the horizon, this constant is proportional to the product of the temperature and the entropy and at the infinity, the total constant shows the energ density of the quasitopological Lifshitz dilaton black brane. Therefore, we can reach to a relation between the conserved quantities temperature, entropy and the energy density and get a smarr-type formula. Using the first law of thermodynamics, we can find a relation between the entropy and the temperature and then ontain the heat capacity. Our results show that the quasitopological Lifshitz dilaton black brane solutions are thermally stable for each positive values of the dynamical critiacl exponent, $z$.</description>

      <title>Generalized symmetry constraints on deformed 4d (S)CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the consequence of generalized symmetries in four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal field theories. First, we classify all possible supersymmetric gauge theories with a simple gauge group that have a nontrivial one-form symmetry and flows to a superconformal field theory. Upon identifying unbroken discrete zero-form symmetries from the ABJ anomaly, we find that many of these theories have mixed zero-form/one-form 't Hooft anomalies. Then we classify the relevant deformations of these SCFTs that preserve the anomaly. From this mixed anomaly together with the anomalies of the discrete zero-form symmetries, we find obstructions for the relevant deformations of these SCFTs to flow to a trivially gapped phase. We also study non-Lagrangian SCFTs formed by gauging copies of Argyres-Douglas theories and constrain their deformations. In particular, we explore a new duality between the diagonal gauging of two $\mathcal{D}_3(SU(N))$ theories and $SU(N)$ gauge theory with two adjoints. We also repeat our analysis for a host of non-supersymmetric gauge theories having nontrivial one-form symmetry including examples that appear to flow to Bank-Zaks type CFTs.</description>

      <title>Kasner eons with matter: holographic excursions to the black hole singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work has shown that introducing higher-curvature terms to the Einstein-Hilbert action causes the approach to a space-like singularity to unfold as a sequence of Kasner eons. Each eon is dominated by emergent physics at an energy scale controlled by higher-curvature terms of a given order, transitioning to higher-order eons as the singularity is approached. The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, we demonstrate that the inclusion of matter dramatically modifies the physics of eons compared to the vacuum case. We illustrate this by considering a family of quasi-topological gravities of arbitrary order minimally coupled to a scalar field. Second, we investigate Kasner eons in the interior of black holes with field theory duals and analyze their imprints on holographic observables. We show that the behavior of the thermal $a$-function, two-point functions of heavy operators, and holographic complexity can capture distinct signatures of the eons, making them promising tools for diagnosing stringy effects near black hole singularities.</description>

      <title>$U(1)$ $R$-Symmetry Topological Operators from Branes in Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study $U(1)$ symmetry generators from wrapped branes in Type IIB string theory and M-theory. Specifically, we construct topological defects for the $R$-symmetry in 4d $\mathcal{N}=1$ and 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ quantum field theories holographically dual to Sasaki-Einstein compactifications. These are studied using a universal consistent truncation to the gravity multiplet in the bulk theory. We furthermore check these constructions by identifying the objects charged under them, and understanding their origin in the bulk theory.</description>

      <title>An Exceptional Cluster Algebra for Higgs plus Jet Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent evaluation of three-loop nonplanar Feynman integrals contributing to Higgs plus jet production has established their dependence on two novel symbol letters. We show that the resulting alphabet is described by a $G_2$ cluster algebra, enlarging the $C_2$ cluster algebra found to cover all previously known integrals relevant for this process. The cluster algebra connection we find reveals new adjacency relations, which significantly reduce the function space dimension of the non-planar triple ladder integral. These adjacencies may be understood in part by embedding $G_2$ inside higher-rank cluster algebras.</description>

      <title>Non-invertible defects on the worldsheet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider codimension-one defects in the theory of $d$ compact scalars on a two-dimensional worldsheet, acting linearly by mixing the scalars and their duals. By requiring that the defects are topological, we find that they correspond to a non-Abelian zero-form symmetry acting on the fields as elements of $\text{O}(d;\mathbb{R}) \times \text{O}(d;\mathbb{R})$, and on momentum and winding charges as elements of $\text{O}(d,d;\mathbb{R})$. When the latter action is rational, we prove that it can be realized by combining gauging of non-anomalous discrete subgroups of the momentum and winding $\text{U}(1)$ symmetries, and elements of the $\text{O}(d,d;\mathbb{Z})$ duality group, such that the couplings of the theory are left invariant. Generically, these defects map local operators into non-genuine operators attached to lines, thus corresponding to a non-invertible symmetry. We confirm our results within a Lagrangian description of the non-invertible topological defects associated to the $\text{O}(d,d;\mathbb{Q})$ action on charges, giving a natural explanation of the rationality conditions. Finally, we apply our findings to toroidal compactifications of bosonic string theory. In the simplest non-trivial case, we discuss the selection rules of these non-invertible symmetries, verifying explicitly that they are satisfied on a worldsheet of higher genus.</description>

      <title>Strings in AdS$_3$: one-loop partition function and near-extremal BTZ thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the computation of the string partition function in AdS$_3$ focussing on the appearance of spacetime (super) symmetries. We show how the asymptotic symmetries of the AdS$_3$ spacetime, which generate the boundary (super) Virasoro currents, are captured by the one-loop partition sum. We use this to argue that the recent understanding of near-extremal black hole thermodynamics based on the gravitational path integral continues to hold for finite string length. Along the way we clarify some aspects of the AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ duality and, in particular, deduce which bulk gauge fields lead to boundary currents. We also explain how one can interpolate between supersymmetric and thermal (Atick-Witten) fermion boundary conditions in the target space by suitably tuning rotational chemical potentials in the string partition function.</description>

      <title>Resurgence in Liouville Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liouville conformal field theory is a prototypical example of an exactly solvable quantum field theory, in the sense that the correlation functions in an arbitrary background can be determined exactly using only the constraints of unitarity and crossing symmetry. For example, the three point correlation functions are given by the famous formula of Dorn-Otto-Zamolodchikov-Zamolodchikov (DOZZ). Unlike many other exactly solvable theories, Liouville theory has a continuously tunable parameter -- essentially $\hbar$ -- which is related to the central charge of the theory. Here we investigate the nature of the perturbative expansion in powers of $\hbar$, which is the loop expansion around a semi-classical solution. We show that the perturbative coefficients grow factorially, as expected of a Feynman diagram expansion, and take the form of an asymptotic series. We identify the singularities in the Borel plane, and show that they are associated with complex instanton solutions of Liouville theory; they correspond precisely to the complex solutions described by Harlow, Maltz, and Witten. Both single- and multi-valued solutions of Liouville appear. We show that the perturbative loop expansions around these different saddle points mix in the way expected for a trans-series expansion. Thus Liouville theory provides a calculable example of a quantum field theory where perturbative and instanton contributions can be summed up and assembled into a finite answer.</description>

Abstract: We formulate scalar electrodynamics in the braided $L_\infty$-algebra formalism and study its perturbative expansion in the algebraic framework of Batalin-Vilkovisky quantization. We confirm that UV/IR mixing is absent at one-loop order in this noncommutative field theory, and that the non-anomalous Ward-Takahashi identities for the braided gauge symmetry are satisfied.</description>

      <title>Supergravity without gravity and its BV formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generalised-geometric formulation of 10-dimensional supergravity suggests a particular simple "limit", which results in a theory whose only dynamical degrees of freedom are the dilaton and the dilatino. The theory is still invariant both under generalised diffeomorphisms and a local supersymmetry and in many aspects is structurally similar to the original supergravity, which makes it a convenient playground for understanding more subtle aspects of the full physical setup. In particular, the simplicity and the geometric nature of the dilatonic theory allow us to build a full BV extension to all orders in the fermionic variables.</description>

      <title>Manifestly Covariant Worldline Actions from Coadjoint Orbits. Part II: Twistorial Descriptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Worldline actions for various twistor particles in AdS spacetimes are constructed from the coadjoint orbits of $Sp(4,\mathbb R)$, $SU(2,2)$ and $O^*(8)$ as constrained Hamiltonian systems. The constraints are associated with the coadjoint orbits of the dual groups, respectively identified as $O(p,M-p)$, $U(p, M-p)$ and $Sp(p, M-p)$. These actions are presented in a universal form by making use of the twistor variables taking value in $\mathbb R$, $\mathbb C$ and $\mathbb H$, respectively. We find that the massless, massive and the conformal particles (namely the singletons) of any spins appear for the compact dual groups with $p=0$ reproducing many of the results in earlier literature, whereas more exotic particle species, such as various tachyons, continuous spin particles and BdS particles appear for the non-compact dual groups.</description>

      <title>A dynamical Einstein-Born-Infeld-dilaton model and holographic quarkonium melting in a magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the potential reconstruction method to set up a dynamical Einstein-Born-Infeld-dilaton model, which we then use to study holographic quarkonium melting in an external magnetic field. The non-linear nature of the model allows to couple the magnetic field to the quarkonium inner structure without having to introduce back-reacting charged flavour degrees of freedom. The magnetic field dependent melting temperature is computed from the spectral functions and suggests a switch from magnetic to inverse magnetic catalysis when the magnetic field increases. We also discuss the differences due to the anisotropy brought in by the external field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrable $su(2\vert2)_{c}$ symmetric models have integrable boundaries with $osp(2\vert2)$ symmetries, which can be embedded into $su(2\vert2)_{c}$ in two different ways. We dualize the previously obtained asymptotic overlap formulas for one of the embeddings to describe the other embedding and apply the results to describe the asymptotic expectation values of local operators in the presence of a 't Hooft line in N=4 SYM. A peculiar feature of the setting is that in certain gradings only descendant states have non-vanishing overlaps with the boundary state and the overlap formula is not factorized for the Bethe roots.</description>

      <title>Beltrami fields, dispersive electromagnetic waves and gravitational spheromaks from chiral anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we focus on the backreaction effects due to the chiral anomaly. The chiral anomaly gives rise to certain modifications in the conserved currents. In the case of the Maxwell gauge fields there appears a new contribution to the electric current proportional to the background magnetic field. This phenomenon is known as the chiral magnetic effect and it is widely discussed in the current literature. In the case of the gravitational field, the anomaly, as we show here, induces a new contribution to the stress-energy tensor. We analyze the possible manifestations of these modifications in the gravitational field and in hydrodynamics in the chiral media. We also make some comments regarding the backreaction effects in the electrodynamics in the chiral media. In each of these directions we observe the systematical appearance of the Beltrami type fields. In electrodynamics or in hydrodynamics the Beltrami field (e.g., magnetic field or fluid velocity) is a vector that is parallel to its own curl. We suggest a generalization of the Beltrami fields for the tensorial gravitational perturbations. The respective solutions to the gravitational equations we call gravitational spheromaks by analogy with a similar phenomenon in electrodynamics. In the modified hydrodynamics in the chiral media the vorticity is asymptotically a Beltrami vector field in a generalized Gromeka-Beltrami flow.</description>

      <title>Page transition as a phase transition in approximate quantum error correction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, there is a huge progress in understanding the black hole information problem, and the key is that the black hole entropy of radiation should be calculated by the island formula, which describes the Page curve to ensure the unitarity of black hole evaporation. In the paper, we find that the black hole evaporation interpreted by the island formula can be understood in the language of approximate quantum error correction. Furthermore, the Page transition, as a special property of the Page curve, should be understood as the property of approximate quantum error correction itself, i.e. a general class of quantum systems under certain conditions from approximate quantum error correction can also exhibit phenomenon similar to the Page transition.</description>

      <title>Matching the Vilkovisky-DeWitt Effective Action of Quantum Gravity to String Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we discuss the matching of the Vilkovisky-DeWitt effective action of quantum gravity to an example of an ultra-violet complete theory of quantum gravity. We show how this matching enables a calculation of the local Wilson coefficients of the effective action. We provide several examples in string theory. Moreover, we discuss the matching conditions within the context of the swampland program.</description>

Abstract: We prove special cases of a general conjecture: If an invertible field theory admits a projectively topological boundary theory, then it has finite order in the abelian group of invertible field theories. One can substitute `gapped' for `projectively topological'. Our proofs use evaluations of a field theory in parametrized families.</description>

      <title>Black hole-de Sitter model, a proposal for the de Sitter phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We expand on the braneworld-black hole de Sitter model introduced in \cite{Rasulian} which is a proposal for constructing an effective de Sitter spacetime with no explicit dependence on brane tension or bulk cosmological constant. In this model the 4D de Sitter space emerges on a brane near the horizon of a 5D black hole. We study the effective gravity on the brane non-perturbatively, with an approximate Z2 symmetry assumption, up to a conformal factor, and find that the evolution of the effective cosmological constant on the brane depends on the flux of energy towards and away from the black hole in the bulk. In this setup the presence of the black hole horizon sets the initial condition for the brane's evolution and the brane approaches its null configuration with de Sitter length $l\lesssim l_5$, where $l_5$ is the 5D Planck's length, as soon as the horizon forms. During the last stages of collapse following this phase (or further flux of matter in the bulk after the horizon is formed), the effective de Sitter length on the brane increases due to the in-falling flux relatively fast. This phase is tentatively the transition between a low scale inflationary phase and the late dark energy phase. Also we observe that the increase in the de Sitter length is accompanied with a flux of energy entering the brane due to the jump in the bulk flux across the brane. Considering the initial state of the brane to be in the $l_5$ neighborhood of the horizon, the configuration which is slightly below the horizon is Euclidean AdS with AdS radius $l\lesssim l_5$. This can be interpreted as a boundary proposal for the resulting cosmology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate here the deformations of Berglund H\"ubsch loop and chain mirrors where the original manifolds are defined in the same weighted projective space. We show that the deformations are equivalent by two methods. First, we map directly the two models to each other and show that the deformations are the same for $79$ "Good" models, but not for the $77$ "Bad" ones. We then investigate the orbifold of the mirror pair by the maximal symmetry group and show that the number of deformations is the same and that they are almost the same, i.e., the first four exponents of the deformations are identical.</description>

      <title>Can Baby Universe Absorption Explain Dark Energy?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been proposed that the accelerated expansion of the universe can be explained by the merging of our universe with baby universes, resulting in dark energy with a phantom-like equation of state. However, the evidence in favor of it did not include the full set of cosmological observables. Here we examine the implications of this model for both early and late universe cosmology using data from Planck collaboration, DESI 2024 and other experiments. We find that the pure baby universe model gives a poor fit to current data. Extending it to include a contribution from the cosmological constant, we find two allowed regions of parameter space: one close to $\Lambda$CDM, and another with $\Lambda &lt;0$ plus the exotic dark energy component. The two regions can be significantly favored over $\Lambda$CDM, depending on the choice of supernova datasets, and they can ameliorate the Hubble tension to the level of $2\sigma$, depending on the supernova dataset. The model with $\Lambda&lt;0$ features an equation of state $w(a)$ with a pole singularity at early times.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the cosmological dynamics of a homogeneous scalar field non-minimally coupled to torsion gravity, which also interacts with cold dark matter through energy and momentum transfer. The matter and radiation perfect fluids are modeled using the Sorkin-Schutz formalism. We identify scaling regimes of the field during both the radiation and matter eras. Additionally, we discovered a field-dominated scaling attractor; however, it does not exhibit accelerated expansion, making it unsuitable for describing dark energy. Nevertheless, we find two attractor solutions that do exhibit accelerated expansion: one is a quintessence-like fixed point, and the other is a de Sitter fixed point.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous branes formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a study of brane formation in six-dimensional space. There is no a priori assumption of the brane(s) existence. However, the analysis of the generalized Einstein equations reveals that there are a set of metrics describing two static branes even in the absence of matter fields. The trapping of massive particles on branes is a consequence of the metric structure, which prevents these particles from moving between branes.
  It is shown that the communication between charged particles located on different branes provides by photons. Such positron-electron annihilation could be experimentaly study at the LHC collider.
  The Higgs field is distributed between the branes in such a way that it can serve as a Higgs portal connecting two worlds located on different branes. The values of the 4D physical parameters depend on the extra metric structure near the branes. A particular metric of the extra space was found to provide the observed value of the Higgs vacuum average.
  We also found a non-trivial effect of decompactification of the extra space when the Hubble parameter is varied.</description>

      <title>MEET-U project II: Curvature perturbations from kinetic preheating after $\alpha$-attractor inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Preheating at the end of inflation is a violent nonlinear process that efficiently transfers the energy of the inflaton to a second field, the preheat field. When the preheat field is light during inflation and its background value modulates the preheating process, the superhorizon isocurvature perturbations of the preheat field may be converted to curvature perturbations that leave an imprint on the cosmic microwave background and the large-scale structure of the universe. We use high-precision lattice simulations to study kinetic preheating after $\alpha$-attractor inflation, a case where the effective mass of the preheat field is naturally suppressed during inflation. By comparing the expansion e-folds between different Hubble patches, we find that the conversion from isocurvature perturbations to curvature perturbations is very inefficient and can hardly be detected by cosmological observations.</description>

Abstract: We study cluster structures on spinor helicity and momentum twistor varieties which describe the kinematic spaces of massless scattering (with or without dual conformal symmetry). Both are instances of partial flag varieties. We exhibit embeddings of the corresponding cluster algebras into cluster algebras of sufficiently large Grassmannians and show how the former is obtained from the latter by freezing certain cluster variables and specializing some cluster variables to one.</description>

      <title>Feynman 1947 letter on path integral for the Dirac equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1947, four months before the famous Shelter Island conference, Richard Feynman wrote a lengthy letter to his former MIT classmate Theodore Welton, reporting on his efforts to develop a path integral describing the propagation of a Dirac particle. While these efforts never came to fruition, and were shortly abandoned in favor of a very different method of dealing with the electron propagator appearing in in QED, the letter is interesting both from the historical viewpoint of revealing what Feynman was thinking about during that period just before the development of QED, and for its scientific ideas. It also contains at the end some philosophical remarks, which Feynman wraps up with the comment, ``Well enough for the baloney.'' In this article I present a transcription of the letter along with editorial notes, and a facsimile of the original handwritten document. I also briefly comment on Feynman's efforts and discuss their relation to some later work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An exact derivation of relativistic hydrodynamics from an underlying microscopic theory has been shown to be an all-order theory. From the relativistic transport equation of kinetic theory, the full expressions of hydrodynamic viscous fluxes have been derived which turn out to include all orders of out-of-equilibrium derivative corrections. It has been shown, that for maintaining causality, it is imperative that the temporal derivatives must include all orders, which can be resummed in non-local, relaxation operator-like forms and finally `integrated in' introducing newer degrees of freedom. The theory can of course be truncated at any higher spatial orders, but the power over the the infinite temporal sum increases correspondingly such that the causality is respected. As a result, the theory truncated at any higher order of spatial gradient, requires newer degrees of freedom for each increasing order.</description>

Abstract: We argue that some supersymmetric multiplets can naturally be equipped with the structure of an open-closed homotopy algebra. This structure is readily described through the pure spinor superfield formalism, which in particular associates a canonical multiplet for each choice of supersymmetry algebra. We study the open-closed homotopy algebra associated to (twists of) (resolutions of) the canonical multiplet, and show that it fits into a span of open-closed homotopy algebras, extending results of Cederwall et al. arXiv:2304.01258.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a discussion of the periodicity in imaginary time of maximally extended black hole spacetimes without reference to Euclidean manifolds. As motivation, we first demonstrate our approach for the Rindler geometry in flat space before then applying it for the case of Schwarzschild time in the maximally extended Kruskal geometry. One notable advantage of our approach is that it can be utilized in the Kerr case, again without reference to a Euclidean manifold, and without complexifying the angular momentum parameter, $a$. One unusual feature of our application in the Kerr case is that, even for the purely Lorentzian geometry, it is developed in terms of explicitly complex coordinates which are associated with distinct families of $\alpha-$surfaces. Moreover, coordinatization of these gives a single set of coordinates which cover the entire geometry outside the inner horizon.</description>

Abstract: We study correlation functions for extremal supersymmetric black holes. It is necessary to take into account the strongly coupled nature of the boundary supergraviton mode. We consider the case with ${\cal N}=2$ supercharges which is the minimal amount of supersymmetry needed to give a large ground state degeneracy, separated from the continuum. Using the exact solution for this theory we derive formulas for the two point function and we also give integral expressions for any $n$-point correlator. These correlators are time independent at large times and approach constant values that depend on the masses and couplings of the bulk theory. We also explain that in the non-supersymmetric case, the correlators develop a universal time dependence at long times. This paper is the longer companion paper of arXiv:2207.00407.</description>

      <title>Extremal Black Hole Decay in de Sitter Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The decay of extremal charged black holes has been a useful guidance to derive consistency conditions in quantum gravity. In de Sitter space it has been argued that requiring (extremal) charged Nariai black holes to decay without forming a big crunch singularity yields the Festina Lente (FL) bound: particles with mass $m_s$ and charge $q$ should satisfy $m_s^2 \gg M_pHq$, where $M_p$ is the Planck mass and $H$ the Hubble parameter. Using a tunneling approach we show that the decay probability of charged black holes in de Sitter space in the s-wave sector is $P\sim \exp(\Delta S_b)$, where~$\Delta S_b$ is the change in the black hole entropy. We find that the FL bound corresponds to $\Delta S_b \leq -1$ in the Nariai and probe limit. However, taking into account backreaction we identify unsuppressed decay channels, which might be subdominant, that violate this bound but nonetheless do not result in a big crunch for every observer.</description>

      <title>Renormalisation of postquantum-classical gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the obstacles to reconciling quantum theory with general relativity, is constructing a theory which is both consistent with observation, and and gives finite answers at high energy, so that the theory holds at arbitrarily short distances. Quantum field theory achieves this through the process of renormalisation, but famously, perturbative quantum gravity fails to be renormalisable, even without coupling to matter. Recently, an alternative to quantum gravity has been proposed, in which the geometry of spacetime is taken to be classical rather than quantum, while still being coupled to quantum matter fields [1, 2]. This can be done consistently, provided the dynamics is fundamentally stochastic. Here, we find that the pure gravity theory is formally renormalisable. We do so via the path integral formulation by relating the classical-quantum action to that of quadratic gravity which is renormalisable. Because the action induces stochastic dynamics of space-time, rather than deterministic evolution of a quantum field, the classical-quantum theory is free of tachyons and negative norm ghosts. The key remaining question is whether the renormalisation prescription retains completely positive (CP) dynamics. This consideration appears to single out the scale invariant and asymptotically free theory. We give further evidence that the theory is CP, by showing that the two-point function of the scalar mode is positive. To support the use of precision accelerometers in testing the quantum nature of spacetime, we also compute the power spectral density of the acceleration. The results presented here have a number of implications for inflation, CMB data, and experiments to test the quantum nature of spacetime. They may also provide a way to compute probabilities in the regime of quantum gravity where spacetime can be treated as effectively classical.</description>

      <title>Quantum 2D Liouville Path-Integral Is a Sum over Geometries in AdS$_3$ Einstein Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is a renowned solution of the modular bootstrap that defines the UV complete quantum Liouville theory. We triangulate the path-integral of this Liouville CFT on any 2D surface $\mathcal{M}$, by proposing a shrinkable boundary condition for this special CFT that allows small holes to close, analogous to the proposal in rational CFTs [1-3]. This is essentially a tensor network that admits an interpretation of a state-sum of a 3D topological theory constructed with quantum 6j symbols of $\mathcal{U}_q(SL(2,\mathbb{R}))$ with non-trivial boundary conditions, and it reduces to a sum over 3D geometries weighted by the Einstein-Hilbert action to leading order in large $c$. The boundary conditions of quantum Liouville theory specifies a very special sum over bulk geometries to faithfully reproduce the CFT path-integral. The triangulation coincides with producing a network of geodesics in the AdS bulk, which can be changed making use of the pentagon identity and orthogonality condition satisfied by the 6j symbols, and arranged into a precise holographic tensor network.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fermion gaps are classified into order gap or Mott gap depending on the presence/absence of the order parameter. We construct the holographic model of the Mott gap using the field that is supported by the density only without introducing any order parameter. We then classify the Mott gap, depending on the shape of the gap in the density of states and whether the Fermi surface is touching the valence bond or not, into three classes: i) Symmetric gap, ii) Asymmetric gap with isolated Fermi sea. iii) Asymmetric gap with Fermi sea touching the valence band. Finally, we identify possible non-minimal gauge interactions that produce a flatband without symmetry breaking.</description>

Abstract: We present a non-geometric derivation of $\mathcal{N}$=1 Super Yang-Mills by focusing on the consistency of interactions that extend the free vector supermultiplet rather than assuming gauge invariance under extended symmetries. By utilizing a superspace first-order description, the theory is given in closed form as a third-order polynomial which includes a single cubic interaction term instead of an infinite series, thus eliminating the need for a special gauge. The geometrical interpretation of the theory emerges, as opposed to being presupposed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this essay, we argue that certain aspects of the measurement require revision in Quantum Gravity. Using entropic arguments, we propose that the number of measurement outcomes and the accuracy (or the range) of the measurement are limited by the entropy of the black hole associated with the observer scale. This also implies the necessity of modifying the algebra of commutation relationships to ensure a finite representation of observables, changing the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle in this manner.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In six dimensions there exists a unique one-parameter family of non-linear conformal electrodynamics for a chiral 2-form gauge field which includes (in a free-field limit) the linear chiral 2-form theory and is related, by dimensional reduction, to the four-dimensional ModMax electrodynamics. In this work, we present the first exact solutions of this theory in presence of gravity. In particular, we will consider plane-wave, Robinson-Trautman, and self-dual dyonic string configurations, generalizing well-known solutions of this type in six-dimensional supergravities with linear chiral 2-form multiplets.</description>

      <title>Partial entanglement entropy threads in island phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of AdS/CFT, it was recently proposed that the boundary partial entanglement entropy structure can be represented by the so-called partial entanglement entropy (PEE) threads in the AdS bulk, which are bulk geodesics with the density determined by the boundary PEE structure \cite{Lin:2023rbd,Lin:2024dho}. In Poincar\'e AdS space, it was shown that the PEE threads cover the AdS space uniformly, such that the number of intersections between any bulk surface and the bulk PEE threads is always given by the area of the surface divided by 4G.
  In this paper, we investigate the configurations of PEE threads when the boundary state is in island phase. The island phase was studied in the context of the holographic Weyl transformed CFT$_2$, which has been shown to capture all the main features of AdS/BCFT. Compared with AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, in island phase instead of modifying the distribution of the bulk PEE threads, we should replace the boundary points with the corresponding cutoff spheres. Then the two-point and four-point functions of twist operators can be reproduced by identifying the bulk homologous surfaces anchored on the corresponding cutoff spheres that has the minimal number of intersections with the bulk PEE threads. This gives us a better understanding about the PEE structure in island phase and reproduces the island formula for entanglement entropy by allowing homologous surfaces to anchor on any cutoff surfaces. Furthermore, it gives a demonstration for the two basic proposals and a better understanding for the entanglement contribution that makes the foundation to compute the balanced partial entanglement entropy (BPE) \cite{Basu:2023wmv} which reproduces the entanglement wedge cross-section in island phase.</description>

      <title>On Yang-Mills Stability Bounds and Plaquette Field Generating Function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.07376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Yang-Mills (YM) QFT with group $U(N)$. We take a finite lattice regularization $\Lambda\subset a\mathbb Z^d$, $d = 2,3,4$, with $a\in (0,1]$ and $L$ (even) sites on a side. Each bond has a gauge variable $U\in U(N)$. The Wilson partition function is used and the action is a sum of gauge-invariant plaquette (minimal square) actions times $a^{d-4}/g^2$, $g^2\in(0,g_0^2]$, $0&lt;g_0^2&lt;\infty$. A plaquette action has the product of its four variables and the partition function is the integral of the Boltzmann factor with a product of $U(N)$ Haar measures. Formally, when $a\searrow 0$ our action gives the usual YM continuum action. For free and periodic b.c., we show thermodynamic and stability bounds for a normalized partition function of any YM model defined as before, with bound constants independent of $L,a,g$. The subsequential thermodynamic and ultraviolet limit of the free energy exist. To get our bounds, the Weyl integration formula is used and, to obtain the lower bound, a new quadratic global upper bound on the action is derived. We define gauge-invariant physical and scaled plaquette fields. Using periodic b.c. and the multi-reflection method, we bound the generating function of $r-$scaled plaquette correlations. A normalized generating function for the correlations of $r$ scaled fields is absolutely bounded, for any $L,a,g$, and location of the external fields. From the joint analyticity on the field sources, correlations are bounded. The bounds are new and we get $a^{-d}$ for the physical two-plaquette correlation at coincident points. Comparing with the $a\searrow 0$ singularity of the physical derivative massless scalar free field two-point correlation, this is a measure of ultraviolet asymptotic freedom in the context of a lattice QFT. Our methods are an alternative and complete the more traditional ones.</description>

Abstract: We study transverse equivariant Hilbert schemes of affine hypertoric varieties equipped with a symplectic action of a Weyl group. In particular, we show that the Coulomb branches of Braverman, Finkelberg, and Nakajima can be obtained either as such Hilbert schemes or Hamiltonian reductions thereof. Furthermore, we propose that the Coulomb branches for representations of non-cotangent type are also obtained in this way. We also investigate the putative complete hyperk\"ahler metrics on these objects. We describe their twistor spaces and, in the case when the symplectic quotient construction of the hypertoric variety is $W$-equivariant (which includes Coulomb branches of cotangent type), we show that the hyperk\"ahler metric can be described as the natural $L^2$-metric on a moduli space of solutions to modified Nahm's equations on an interval with poles at both ends and a discontinuity in the middle, with the latter described by a new object: a hyperspherical variety canonically associated to a hypertoric variety.</description>

      <title>Noise-aware variational eigensolvers: a dissipative route for lattice gauge theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03618v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel variational ansatz for the ground-state preparation of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory (LGT) in quantum simulators. It combines dissipative and unitary operations in a completely deterministic scheme with a circuit depth that does not scale with the size of the considered lattice. We find that, with very few variational parameters, the ansatz can achieve $&gt;\!99\%$ precision in energy in both the confined and deconfined phase of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT. We benchmark our proposal against the unitary Hamiltonian variational ansatz showing a reduction in the required number of variational layers to achieve a target precision. After performing a finite-size scaling analysis, we show that our dissipative variational ansatz can predict accurate critical exponents without requiring a number of layers that scale with the system size, which is the standard situation for unitary ans\"{a}tze. Furthermore, we investigate the performance of this variational eigensolver subject to circuit-level noise, determining variational error thresholds that fix the error rate below which it would be beneficial to increase the number of layers. In light of these quantities and for typical gate errors $p$ in current quantum processors, we provide a detailed assessment of the prospects of our scheme to explore the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT on near-term devices.</description>

      <title>Collapsing scenarios of K-essence generalized Vaidya spacetime under $f(\bar{R},\bar{T})$ gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper investigates the collapse of the generalized emergent Vaidya spacetime in the setting of $f(\bar{R}, \bar{T})$ gravity, specifically in K-essence theory. In this study, the Dirac-Born-Infeld type non-standard Lagrangian is used to calculate the emergent metric $\bar{G}_{\mu\nu}$, which is not conformally equivalent to the conventional gravitational metric. We use the function $f(\bar{R}, \bar{T})$ to reflect the additive nature of the emergent Ricci scalar ($\bar{R}$) and the trace of the emergent energy-momentum tensor ($\bar{T}$). Our study demonstrates that certain choices of $f(\bar{R}, \bar{T})$ may result in the existence of a naked singularity caused by gravitational collapse. The alternative $f(\bar{R}, \bar{T})$ values resulted in an accelerating universe dominated by dark energy. Moreover, the investigation showed the presence of both positive and negative masses, which might suggest the coexistence of dark matter and dark energy. Furthermore, for a given quantity of kinetic part of the K-essence scalar field, mass is completely changed into energy, meaning that spacetime is Minkowskian. The K-essence theory may also be employed as a dark energy framework and a basic gravitational theory, making it possible for researchers to investigate a wide ranges of cosmic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Exploring Axions through the Photon Ring of a Spherically Symmetric Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we examine the phenomenon of photon axion conversion occurring in the spacetime surrounding a black hole. Specifically, we focus on the potential existence of a magnetic field around the supermassive black hole M87*, which could facilitate the conversion of photons into axions in close proximity to the photon sphere. While photons traverse through the curved spacetime, they spend time near the photon sphere, where conversion of these photons into axions takes place. Consequently, this process leads to a decrease in the intensity of the black hole's photon ring. To explore the possibilities of detecting these hypothetical axion particles, we propose observing the photon sphere using higher resolution telescopes. By doing so, we can gain valuable insights into the conversion mechanism as well as the nature of the spherically symmetric black hole geometry. Moreover, we also investigate how the photon ring luminosities are affected if the black hole possesses a charge parameter. For instance apart from U(1) electric charge, the presence of extra dimension may induce a {\em tidal charge} with a characteristic signature. It is important to note that the success of the conversion mechanism relies on the axion-photon coupling and mass. As a result, the modified luminosity of the black hole's photon ring offers a valuable means of constraining the axion's mass and coupling parameter within a certain range. Thus our findings contribute to a better understanding of photon axion conversion in the environment of a black hole spacetime and helps us explore the possible existence of extra spatial dimension.</description>

      <title>Post-Minkowskian Theory Meets the Spinning Effective-One-Body Approach for Two-Body Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12342v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective-one-body (EOB) waveforms employed by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration have primarily been developed by resumming the post-Newtonian expansion of the relativistic two-body problem. Given the recent significant advancements in post-Minkowskian (PM) theory and gravitational self-force formalism, there is considerable interest in creating waveform models that integrate information from various perturbative methods in innovative ways. This becomes particularly crucial when tackling the accuracy challenge posed by upcoming ground-based detectors (such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer) and space-based detectors (such as LISA, TianQin or Taiji) expected to operate in the next decade. In this context, we present the derivation of the first spinning EOB Hamiltonian that incorporates PM results up to three-loop order: the SEOB-PM model. The model accounts for the complete hyperbolic motion, encompassing nonlocal-in-time tails. To evaluate its accuracy, we compare its predictions for the conservative scattering angle, augmented with dissipative contributions, against numerical-relativity data of non-spinning and spinning equal-mass black holes. We observe very good agreement, comparable, and in some cases slightly better to the recently proposed $w_{\rm EOB}$-potential model, of which the SEOB-PM model is a resummation around the probe limit. Indeed, in the probe limit, the SEOB-PM Hamiltonian and scattering angles reduce to the one of a test mass in Kerr spacetime. Once complemented with nonlocal-in-time contributions for bound orbits, the SEOB-PM Hamiltonian can be utilized to generate waveform models for spinning black holes on quasi-circular orbits.</description>

Abstract: Having spectral correlations that, over small enough energy scales, are described by random matrix theory is regarded as the most general defining feature of quantum chaotic systems as it applies in the many-body setting and away from any semiclassical limit. Although this property is extremely difficult to prove analytically for generic many-body systems, a rigorous proof has been achieved for dual-unitary circuits -- a special class of local quantum circuits that remain unitary upon swapping space and time. Here we consider the fate of this property when moving from dual-unitary to generic quantum circuits focussing on the \emph{spectral form factor}, i.e., the Fourier transform of the two-point correlation. We begin with a numerical survey that, in agreement with previous studies, suggests that there exists a finite region in parameter space where dual-unitary physics is stable and spectral correlations are still described by random matrix theory, although up to a maximal quasienergy scale. To explain these findings, we develop a perturbative expansion: it recovers the random matrix theory predictions, provided the terms occurring in perturbation theory obey a relatively simple set of assumptions. We then provide numerical evidence and a heuristic analytical argument supporting these assumptions.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Purity Lost: Perturbative and Resummed Late-Time Inflationary Decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12240v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the rate with which unobserved fields decohere other fields to which they couple, both in flat space and in de Sitter space, for spectator scalar fields prepared in their standard adiabatic vacuum. The process is very efficient in de Sitter space once the modes in question pass outside the Hubble scale, displaying the tell-tale phenomenon of secular growth that indicates the breakdown of perturbative methods on a time scale parameterically long compared with the Hubble time. We show how to match the perturbative evolution valid at early times onto a late-time Lindblad evolution whose domain of validity extends to much later times, thereby allowing a reliable resummation of the perturbative result beyond the perturbative regime. Super-Hubble modes turn out to be dominantly decohered by unobserved modes that are themselves also super-Hubble. Although our calculation is done for spectator fields, if applied to curvature perturbations during inflation our observations here could close a potential loophole in recent calculations of the late-time purity of the observable primordial fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Transport properties in non-Fermi liquid phases of nodal-point semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08635v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this review, we survey the current progress in computing transport properties in semimetals which harbour non-Fermi liquid phases. We first discuss the widely-used Kubo formalism, which can be applied to the effective theory describing the stable non-Fermi liquid phase obtained via a renormalization group procedure and, hence, is applicable for temperatures close to zero (e.g., optical conductivity). For finite-temperature regimes, which apply to the computations of the generalized DC conductivity tensors, we elucidate the memory matrix approach. This approach is based on an effective hydrodynamic description of the system, and is especially suited for tackling transport calculations in strongly-interacting quantum field theories, because it does not rely on the existence of long-lived quasiparticles. As a concrete example, we apply these two approaches to find the response of the so-called Luttinger-Abrikosov-Benelavskii phase of isotropic three-dimensional Luttinger semimetals, which arises under the effects of long-ranged (unscreened) Coulomb interactions, with the chemical potential fine-tuned to cut exactly the nodal point. In particular, we focus on the electric conductivity tensors, thermal and thermoelectric response, Raman response, free energy, entropy density, and shear viscosity.</description>

      <title>Bounding the Cosmological Constant using Galactic Rotation Curves from the SPARC Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16650v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark energy (and its simplest model, the Cosmological Constant or $\Lambda$) acts as a repulsive force that opposes gravitational attraction. Assuming galaxies maintain a steady state over extended periods, the estimated upper limit on $\Lambda$ studies its pushback to the attractive gravitational force of dark matter. From the SPARC dataset, we select galaxies that are best fitted by the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) and Hernquist density models. Introducing the presence of $\Lambda$ in these galaxies helps to establish the upper limit on its repulsive force. This upper limit on $\Lambda$ is around $\rho_{\left(&lt;\Lambda\right)} \sim 10^{-25}$~kg/m$^3$, only two orders of magnitude higher than the one measured by Planck. {We show that for galaxies with detectable velocities far from the galaxy core, the upper limit on $\Lambda$ is lower. Furthermore, we show that galaxies and other systems follow the same principle: for larger orbital periods the upper limit on $\Lambda$ is lower. Consequently, we address the implications for future measurements on the upper limit and the condition for detecting the impact of $\Lambda$ on galactic scales.</description>

      <title>Thermal Dark Matter with Low-Temperature Reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the production of thermal dark matter (DM) candidates (WIMPs, SIMPs, ELDERs and Cannibals) during cosmic reheating. Assuming a general parametrization for the scaling of the inflaton energy density and the standard model (SM) temperature, we study the requirements for kinetic and chemical DM freeze-out in a model-independent way. For each of the mechanisms, up to two solutions that fit the entire observed DM relic density exist, for a given reheating scenario and DM mass. As an example, we assume a simple particle physics model in which DM interacts with itself and with SM through contact interactions. We find that low-temperature reheating can accommodate a wider range of couplings and larger masses than those permitted in the usual instantaneous high-temperature reheating. This results in DM solutions for WIMPs reaching masses as high as $10^{14}$~GeV, whereas for SIMPs and ELDERs, we can reach masses of $10^{13}$~GeV. Interestingly, current experimental data already constrain the enlarged parameter space of these models with low-reheating temperatures. Next-generation experiments could further probe these scenarios.</description>

      <title>Exceptional point and hysteresis in perturbations of Kerr black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ the isomonodromic method to study linear scalar massive perturbations of Kerr black holes for generic scalar masses $M\mu$ and generic black hole spins $a/M$. A degeneracy between the longest-living quasinormal mode and the first overtone is found for $(M\mu)_c \simeq 0.3704981$ and $(a/M)_c\simeq 0.9994660$. We show that the longest-living mode and the first overtone change continuously into each other as we vary the parameters around the point of degeneracy, providing evidence for the existence of a geometric phase around an exceptional point. We interpret our findings through a thermodynamic analogy.</description>

      <title>Fundamental physical constants set the observability and operation of phase and other transitions and increase entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03773v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Approaching the problem of understanding fundamental physical constants (FPCs) started with discussing the role these constants play in high-energy nuclear physics and astrophysics. Condensed matter physics was relatively unexplored in this regard. More recently, it was realised that FPCs set lower or upper bounds on key condensed matter properties. In this Perspective, we discuss a wider role played by FPCs in condensed matter physics: at given environmental conditions, FPCs set the observability and operation of entire physical effects and phenomena. We discuss second-order phase transitions including structural and superconducting transitions and first-order transitions including melting and boiling. We also discuss metastable states, transitions between them, chemical reactions and their products. An interesting byproduct of this discussion is that the order of magnitude of the transition temperature can be calculated from FPCs. We show that the new states emerging as a result of various transitions increase the phase space and entropy. Were FPCs to take different values, these transitions would become inoperative at our environmental conditions and the new states due to these transitions would not emerge. Generalising this insight to other levels of structure in the Universe, this suggests that the current values of FPCs, by enabling various transitions and reactions which give rise to new states, act to increase the phase space and entropy.</description>

      <title>Exact solution of a quantum integrable system associated with the $G_2$ exceptional Lie algebra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A quantum integrable spin chain model associated with the $G_2$ exceptional Lie algebra is studied. By using the fusion technique, the closed recursive relations among the fused transfer matrices are obtained. These identities allow us to derive the exact energy spectrum and Bethe ansatz equations of the system based on polynomial analysis. The present method provides a unified treatment to investigate the Bethe ansatz solutions for both periodic and non-diagonal open boundary conditions associated with exceptional Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>Massive scalar perturbations in Kerr Black Holes: near extremal analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study quasinormal modes of massive scalar perturbations in Kerr black holes using the isomonodromic method. For arbitrary scalar masses $M \mu$ and black hole spins $a/M$, we numerically determine the quasinormal frequencies for various orbital $\ell$, azimuthal $m$, and overtone $n$ numbers. In particular, we derive an analytic expression for frequencies of the zero-damping modes near the extremal limit $a/M \rightarrow 1$. For $\ell=m=1$, we reveal that the fundamental mode becomes a damped mode (rather than a zero-damping mode) if the scalar field is sufficiently heavy. By exploring the parameter space, we find numerical evidence for level-crossing between the longest-living mode and the first overtone at an exceptional point $(M\mu)_c \simeq 0.3704981$ and $(a/M)_c\simeq 0.9994660$.</description>

      <title>The effect of vorticity on the dynamical magnetic fields in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14077v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic fields in heavy-ion collisions are pivotal and subject to diverse factors. In this study, we quantitatively investigate the impact of fluid vorticity on the evolution of magnetic fields in the 20-50\% centrality class in Au+Au collisions, with collision energies of $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=(7.7, 14.5, 19.6, 27, 39, 62.4, 200)$ GeV. Our results indicate that fluid vorticity leads to a delay in the evolution of the magnetic field, in which this effect becomes more pronounced as the collision energy decreases. Additionally, we have calculated the mean magnetic field values on the freeze-out hypersurface for various collision energies. Our simulation results align with the values inferred from experimental data of $\bar{\Lambda}-\Lambda$, within the error margins.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravity is derived from an entropic action coupling matter fields with geometry. The fundamental idea is to relate the metric of Lorentzian spacetime to a density matrix. The matter fields curve spacetime, defining a metric induced by the matter fields. The entropic action is the quantum relative entropy between the metric of spacetime and the metric induced by the matter fields. The modified Einstein equations obtained reduce to the Einstein equations in the regime of low coupling. To simplify the theory, exclusively scalar matter fields are considered. This theoretical framework can be extended in different directions, for instance by including fermionic matter fields and gauge fields. A canonical quantization of this field theory could bring new insights into quantum gravity.</description>
