      <title>An LMI-based Robust Fuzzy Controller for Blood Glucose Regulation in Type 1 Diabetes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a control algorithm for creating an artificial pancreas for type 1 diabetes, factoring in input saturation for a practical application. By utilizing the parallel distributed compensation and Takagi-Sugeno Fuzzy model, we design an optimal robust fuzzy controller. Stability conditions derived from the Lyapunov method are expressed as linear matrix inequalities, allowing for optimal controller gain selection that minimizes disturbance effects. We employ the minimal Bergman and Tolic models to represent type 1 diabetes glucose-insulin dynamics, converting them into corresponding Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy models using the sector nonlinearity approach. Simulation results demonstrate the proposed controller's effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Self-Refined Generative Foundation Models for Wireless Traffic Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With a broad range of emerging applications in 6G networks, wireless traffic prediction has become a critical component of network management. However, the dynamically shifting distribution of wireless traffic in non-stationary 6G networks presents significant challenges to achieving accurate and stable predictions. Motivated by recent advancements in Generative AI (GAI)-enabled 6G networks, this paper proposes a novel self-refined Large Language Model (LLM) for wireless traffic prediction, namely TrafficLLM, through in-context learning without parameter fine-tuning or model training. The proposed TrafficLLM harnesses the powerful few-shot learning abilities of LLMs to enhance the scalability of traffic prediction in dynamically changing wireless environments. Specifically, our proposed TrafficLLM embraces an LLM to iteratively refine its predictions through a three-step process: traffic prediction, feedback generation, and prediction refinement. Initially, the proposed TrafficLLM conducts traffic predictions using task-specific demonstration prompts. Recognizing that LLMs may generate incorrect predictions on the first attempt, we subsequently incorporate feedback demonstration prompts designed to provide multifaceted and valuable feedback related to these initial predictions. Following this comprehensive feedback, our proposed TrafficLLM introduces refinement demonstration prompts, enabling the same LLM to further refine its predictions and thereby enhance prediction performance. The evaluations on two realistic datasets demonstrate that the proposed TrafficLLM outperforms state-of-the-art methods with performance improvements of 23.17% and 17.09%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Low Profile Metamaterial Band-Pass Filter Loaded with 4-Turn Complementary Spiral Resonator for WPT Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a very compact and low insertion loss metamaterial band-pass filter (MBPF) at the center frequency of f0=730 MHz is proposed, based on the rectangular-shape 4 turn complementary spiral resonators (4 CSR). The proposed MBPF consists of an interdigital capacitor as a series capacitance in the top layer, leading to improve the stopband performance in the pass band range of 700 to 760 MHz, which makes it suitable for wireless power transfer (WPT) systems by rejecting unwanted signals. In order to validate the performance of the proposed technique, the MBPF is fabricated on the RO-4003 substrate and great agreement is achieved between simulated and measured results. The stop band attenuations of greater than 52 dB and 20 dB are obtained around the 0.8xfcl (lower cutoff frequency) and 1.2xfcu (upper cutoff frequency), respectively.</description>

      <title>High-Sensitivity and Compact Time-domain Soil Moisture Sensor Using Dispersive Phase Shifter for Complex Permittivity Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a Time-Domain Transmissometry Soil Moisture Sensor (TDT-SMS) using a Dispersive Phase Shifter (DPS), consisting of an interdigital capacitor that is loaded with a stacked 4-turn Complementary Spiral Resonator (S4-CSR). Soil moisture measurement technique of the proposed sensor is based on the complex permittivity sensing property of a DPS in time domain. Soil relative permittivity which varies with its moisture content is measured by burying the DPS under a soil mass and changing its phase difference while excited with a 114 MHz sine wave (single tone). DPS output phase and magnitude are compared with the reference signal and measured with a phase/loss detector. The proposed sensor exhibits accuracy better than +-1.2 percent at the highest Volumetric Water Content (VWC=30 percent) for sandy-type soil. Precise design guide is developed and simulations are performed to achieve a highly sensitive sensor. The measurement results validate the accuracy of theoretical analysis and design procedure. Owning the advantages of low profile, low power consumption, and high sensitivity makes the proposed TDT-SMS a good candidate for precision farming and IoT systems.</description>

      <title>Semi-on-Demand Off-Peak Transit Services with Shared Autonomous Vehicles -- Service Planning, Simulation, and Analysis in Munich, Germany</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the implementation of semi-on-demand (SoD) hybrid-route services using Shared Autonomous Vehicles (SAVs) on existing transit lines. SoD services combine the cost efficiency of fixed-route buses with the flexibility of on-demand services. SAVs first serve all scheduled fixed-route stops, then drop off and pick up passengers in the pre-determined flexible-route portion, and return to the fixed route. This study addresses four key questions: optimal fleet and vehicle sizes for peak-hour fixed-route services with SAVs and during transition (from drivers to autonomous vehicles), optimal off-peak SoD service planning, and suitable use cases. The methodology combines analytical modeling for service planning with agent-based simulation for operational analysis. We examine ten bus routes in Munich, Germany, considering full SAV and transition scenarios with varying proportions of drivers. Our findings demonstrate that the lower operating costs of SAVs improve service quality through increased frequency and smaller vehicles, even in transition scenarios. The reduced headway lowers waiting time and also favors more flexible-route operation in SoD services. The optimal SoD settings range from fully flexible to hybrid routes, where higher occupancy from the terminus favors shorter flexible routes. During the transition phase, limited fleet size and higher headways constrain the benefits of flexible-route operations. The simulation results corroborate the SoD benefits of door-to-door convenience, attracting more passengers without excessive detours and operator costs at moderate flexible-route lengths, and validate the analytical model.</description>

      <title>Fault Tolerant Dynamic Task Assignment for UAV-based Search Teams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research offers a novel framework for dynamic task assignment for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in cooperative search settings. Notably, it incorporates post-fault UAV capabilities into job assignment techniques, assuring operational dependability in the event of sensor and actuator failures. A significant innovation is the utilization of UAV battery charge to assess range relative to search objectives, hence improving job distribution while conserving battery life. This model integrates repair, recharge, and stochastic goal recurrence, hence increasing its real-world applicability. Using stochastic dynamic programming, this method makes it simpler to determine optimal assignment policies offline so they may be implemented rapidly online. This paper emphasizes the holistic aspect of the proposed model, which connects high-level task rules to low-level control capabilities. A simulation-based case study proves its usefulness, highlighting its robustness in fault-prone and battery-variable settings. Overall, this paper proposes and demonstrates a comprehensive method for assigning UAV tasks that integrates defect awareness, battery management, and multilayer control through the use of stochastic dynamic programming.</description>

      <title>Fast Grid Emissions Sensitivities using Parallel Decentralized Implicit Differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Marginal emissions rates -- the sensitivity of carbon emissions to electricity demand -- are important for evaluating the impact of emissions mitigation measures. Like locational marginal prices, locational marginal emissions rates (LMEs) can vary geographically, even between nearby locations, and may be coupled across time periods because of, for example, storage and ramping constraints. This temporal coupling makes computing LMEs computationally expensive for large electricity networks with high storage and renewable penetrations. Recent work demonstrates that decentralized algorithms can mitigate this problem by decoupling timesteps during differentiation. Unfortunately, we show these potential speedups are negated by the sparse structure inherent in power systems problems. We address these limitations by introducing a parallel, reverse-mode decentralized differentiation scheme that never explicitly instantiates the solution map Jacobian. We show both theoretically and empirically that parallelization is necessary to achieve non-trivial speedups when computing grid emissions sensitivities. Numerical results on a 500 node system indicate that our method can achieve greater than 10x speedups over centralized and serial decentralized approaches.</description>

      <title>Emerging clean technologies: policy-driven cost reductions, implications and perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10824v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen production from water electrolysis, direct air capture (DAC), and synthetic kerosene derived from hydrogen and CO2 (`e-kerosene') are expected to play an important role in global decarbonization efforts. So far, the economics of these nascent technologies hamper their market diffusion. However, a wave of recent policy support in the United States, Europe, China, and elsewhere is anticipated to drive their commercial liftoff and bring their costs down. To this end, we evaluate the potential cost reductions driven by policy-induced scale-up of these emerging technologies through 2030 using an experience curves approach accounting for both local and global learning effects. We then analyze the consequences of projected cost declines on the competitiveness of these nascent technologies compared to conventional fossil alternatives, where applicable, and highlight some of the tradeoffs associated with their expansion. Our findings indicate that enacted policies could lead to substantial capital cost reductions for electrolyzers. Nevertheless, electrolytic hydrogen production at $1-2/kg would still require some form of policy support. Given expected costs and experience curves, it is unlikely that liquid solvent DAC (L-DAC) scale-up will bring removal costs to stated targets of $100/tCO2, though a $200/tCO2 may eventually be within reach. We also underscore the importance of tackling methane leakage for natural gas-powered L-DAC: unmitigated leaks amplify net removal costs, exacerbate the investment requirements to reach targeted costs, and cast doubt on L-DAC's role in the clean energy transition. Lastly, despite reductions in electrolysis and L-DAC costs, e-kerosene remains considerably more expensive than fossil jet fuel. The economics of e-kerosene and the resources required for production raise questions about the fuel's ultimate viability as a decarbonization tool for aviation.</description>

      <title>How Much Reserve Fuel: Quantifying the Maximal Energy Cost of System Disturbances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the design question of additional fuel needed to complete a task in an uncertain environment, this paper introduces metrics to quantify the maximal additional energy used by a control system in the presence of bounded disturbances when compared to a nominal, disturbance-free system. In particular, we consider the task of finite-time stabilization for a linear time-invariant system. We first derive the nominal energy required to achieve this task in a disturbance-free system, and then the worst-case energy over all feasible disturbances. The latter leads to an optimal control problem with a least-squares solution, and then an infinite-dimensional optimization problem where we derive an upper bound on the solution. The comparison of these energies is accomplished using additive and multiplicative metrics, and we derive analytical bounds on these metrics. Simulation examples on an ADMIRE fighter jet model demonstrate the practicability of these metrics, and their variation with the task hardness, a combination of the distance of the initial condition from the origin and the task completion time.</description>

      <title>Safety-Critical Stabilization of Force-Controlled Nonholonomic Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a safety-critical controller for the problem of stabilization for force-controlled nonholonomic autonomous vehicles. The proposed control law is based on the constructions of control Lyapunov functions (CLFs) and control barrier functions (CBFs) for cascaded systems. To address nonholonomicity, we design the nominal controller that guarantees global asymptotic stability and local exponential stability for the closed-loop system in polar coordinates and construct a strict Lyapunov function valid on any compact sets. Furthermore, we present a procedure for constructing CBFs for cascaded systems, utilizing the CBF of the kinematic model through integrator backstepping. Quadratic programming is employed to combine CLFs and CBFs to integrate both stability and safety in the closed loop. The proposed control law is time-invariant, continuous along trajectories, and easy to implement. Our main results guarantee both safety and local asymptotic stability for the closed-loop system.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Overview of Reward Engineering and Shaping in Advancing Reinforcement Learning Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in real-world applications is to create systems capable of making autonomous decisions by learning from their environment through trial and error. This paper emphasizes the importance of reward engineering and reward shaping in enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of reinforcement learning algorithms. Reward engineering involves designing reward functions that accurately reflect the desired outcomes, while reward shaping provides additional feedback to guide the learning process, accelerating convergence to optimal policies. Despite significant advancements in reinforcement learning, several limitations persist. One key challenge is the sparse and delayed nature of rewards in many real-world scenarios, which can hinder learning progress. Additionally, the complexity of accurately modeling real-world environments and the computational demands of reinforcement learning algorithms remain substantial obstacles. On the other hand, recent advancements in deep learning and neural networks have significantly improved the capability of reinforcement learning systems to handle high-dimensional state and action spaces, enabling their application to complex tasks such as robotics, autonomous driving, and game playing. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the current state of reinforcement learning, focusing on the methodologies and techniques used in reward engineering and reward shaping. It critically analyzes the limitations and recent advancements in the field, offering insights into future research directions and potential applications in various domains.</description>

      <title>Finite-time input-to-state stability for infinite-dimensional systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the notion of finite-time input-to-state stability (FTISS) for finite-dimensional systems to infinite-dimensional systems. More specifically, we first prove an FTISS Lyapunov theorem for a class of infinite-dimensional systems, namely, the existence of an FTISS Lyapunov functional (FTISS-LF) implies the FTISS of the system, and then, provide a sufficient condition for ensuring the existence of an FTISS-LF for a class of abstract infinite-dimensional systems under the framework of compact semigroup theory and Hilbert spaces. As an application of the FTISS Lyapunov theorem, we verify the FTISS for a class of parabolic PDEs involving sublinear terms and distributed in-domain disturbances. Since the nonlinear terms of the corresponding abstract system are not Lipschitz continuous, the well-posedness is proved based on the application of compact semigroup theory and the FTISS is assessed by using the Lyapunov method with the aid of an interpolation inequality. Numerical simulations are conducted to confirm the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Towards reliable real-time trajectory optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motion planning is a key aspect of robotics. A common approach to address motion planning problems is trajectory optimization. Trajectory optimization can represent the high-level behaviors of robots through mathematical formulations. However, current trajectory optimization approaches have two main challenges. Firstly, their solution heavily depends on the initial guess, and they are prone to get stuck in local minima. Secondly, they face scalability limitations by increasing the number of constraints. This thesis endeavors to tackle these challenges by introducing four innovative trajectory optimization algorithms to improve reliability, scalability, and computational efficiency. There are two novel aspects of the proposed algorithms. The first key innovation is remodeling the kinematic constraints and collision avoidance constraints. Another key innovation lies in the design of algorithms that effectively utilize parallel computation on GPU accelerators. By using reformulated constraints and leveraging the computational power of GPUs, the proposed algorithms of this thesis demonstrate significant improvements in efficiency and scalability compared to the existing methods. Parallelization enables faster computation times, allowing for real-time decision-making in dynamic environments. Moreover, the algorithms are designed to adapt to changes in the environment, ensuring robust performance. Extensive benchmarking for each proposed optimizer validates their efficacy. Overall, this thesis makes a significant contribution to the field of trajectory optimization algorithms. It introduces innovative solutions that specifically address the challenges faced by existing methods. The proposed algorithms pave the way for more efficient and robust motion planning solutions in robotics by leveraging parallel computation and specific mathematical structures.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Recurrent Models Support Emergent Descriptions for Hierarchical Planning and Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An open problem in artificial intelligence is how systems can flexibly learn discrete abstractions that are useful for solving inherently continuous problems. Previous work has demonstrated that a class of hybrid state-space model known as recurrent switching linear dynamical systems (rSLDS) discover meaningful behavioural units via the piecewise linear decomposition of complex continuous dynamics (Linderman et al., 2016). Furthermore, they model how the underlying continuous states drive these discrete mode switches. We propose that the rich representations formed by an rSLDS can provide useful abstractions for planning and control. We present a novel hierarchical model-based algorithm inspired by Active Inference in which a discrete MDP sits above a low-level linear-quadratic controller. The recurrent transition dynamics learned by the rSLDS allow us to (1) specify temporally-abstracted sub-goals in a method reminiscent of the options framework, (2) lift the exploration into discrete space allowing us to exploit information-theoretic exploration bonuses and (3) `cache' the approximate solutions to low-level problems in the discrete planner. We successfully apply our model to the sparse Continuous Mountain Car task, demonstrating fast system identification via enhanced exploration and non-trivial planning through the delineation of abstract sub-goals.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present a Q-learning algorithm to solve the optimal output regulation problem for discrete-time LTI systems. This off-policy algorithm only relies on using persistently exciting input-output data, measured offline. No model knowledge or state measurements are needed and the obtained optimal policy only uses past input-output information. Moreover, our formulation of the proposed algorithm renders it computationally efficient. We provide conditions that guarantee the convergence of the algorithm to the optimal solution. Finally, the performance of our method is compared to existing algorithms in the literature.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a systematic closed-loop approach to provide optimal dynamic ancillary services with converter-interfaced generation systems based on local power grid perception. In particular, we structurally encode dynamic ancillary services such as fast frequency and voltage regulation in the form of a parametric transfer function matrix, which includes several parameters to define a set of different feasible response behaviors, among which we aim to find the optimal one to be realized by the converter system. Our approach is based on a so-called "perceive-and-optimize" (P&amp;O) strategy: First, we identify a grid dynamic equivalent at the interconnection terminals of the converter system. Second, we consider the closed-loop interconnection of the identified grid equivalent and the parametric transfer function matrix, which we optimize for the set of transfer function parameters, resulting in a stable and optimal closed-loop performance for ancillary services provision. In the process, we ensure that grid-code and device-level requirements are satisfied. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in different numerical case studies based on a modified Kundur two-area test system.</description>

      <title>Timer-Based Coverage Control for Mobile Sensors</title>

Abstract: This work investigates the coverage control problem over a static, bounded, and convex workspace and develops a hybrid extension of the continuous-time Lloyd algorithm. Each agent in a multi-agent system (MAS) is equipped with a timer mechanism that generates intermittent measurement and control update events, which may occur asynchronously between agents. Between consecutive event times, as determined by the corresponding timer mechanism, the controller of each agent is held constant. These controllers are shown to drive the configuration of the MAS into a neighborhood of the set of centroidal Voronoi configurations, i.e., a local minimizer of the standard locational cost. The combination of continuous-time dynamics with intermittently updated control inputs is modeled as a hybrid system. The coverage objective is posed as a set attractivity problem for hybrid systems, where an invariance-based convergence analysis yields sufficient conditions that ensure maximal solutions of the hybrid system asymptotically converge to a desired set. A brief simulation example is included to showcase the result.</description>

      <title>System Identification for Lithium-Ion Batteries with Nonlinear Coupled Electro-Thermal Dynamics via Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Essential to various practical applications of lithium-ion batteries is the availability of accurate equivalent circuit models. This paper presents a new coupled electro-thermal model for batteries and studies how to extract it from data. We consider the problem of maximum likelihood parameter estimation, which, however, is nontrivial to solve as the model is nonlinear in both its dynamics and measurement. We propose to leverage the Bayesian optimization approach, owing to its machine learning-driven capability in handling complex optimization problems and searching for global optima. To enhance the parameter search efficiency, we dynamically narrow and refine the search space in Bayesian optimization. The proposed system identification approach can efficiently determine the parameters of the coupled electro-thermal model. It is amenable to practical implementation, with few requirements on the experiment, data types, and optimization setups, and well applicable to many other battery models.</description>

      <title>Semi-Persistent Scheduling in NR Sidelink Mode 2: MAC Packet Reception Ratio Model and ns-3 Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16680</link>

Abstract: 5G New Radio (NR) Sidelink (SL) has demonstrated the promising capability for infrastructure-less cellular coverage. Understanding the fundamentals of the NR SL channel access mechanism, Semi-Persistent Scheduling (SPS), which is specified by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), is a necessity to enhance the NR SL Packet Reception Ratio (PRR). However, most existing works fail to account for the new SPS features introduced in NR SL, which might be out-of-date for comprehensively describing the NR SL PRR. The existing models ignore the relationships between SPS parameters and, therefore, do not provide sufficient insights into the PRR of SPS. This work proposes a novel SPS PRR model incorporating MAC collisions based on new features in NR SL. We extend our model by loosening several simplifying assumptions made in our initial modeling. The extended models illustrate how the PRR is affected by various SPS parameters. The computed results are validated via simulations using the network simulator (ns-3), which provides important guidelines for future NR SL enhancement work.</description>

      <title>Continuous Approximations of Projected Dynamical Systems via Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00447v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Projected Dynamical Systems (PDSs) form a class of discontinuous constrained dynamical systems, and have been used widely to solve optimization problems and variational inequalities. Recently, they have also gained significant attention for control purposes, such as high-performance integrators, saturated control and feedback optimization. In this work, we establish that locally Lipschitz continuous dynamics, involving Control Barrier Functions (CBFs), namely CBF-based dynamics, approximate PDSs. Specifically, we prove that trajectories of CBF-based dynamics uniformly converge to trajectories of PDSs, as a CBF-parameter approaches infinity. Towards this, we also prove that CBF-based dynamics are perturbations of PDSs, with quantitative bounds on the perturbation. Our results pave the way to implement discontinuous PDS-based controllers in a continuous fashion, employing CBFs. We demonstrate this on numerical examples on feedback optimization and synchronverter control. Moreover, our results can be employed to numerically simulate PDSs, overcoming disadvantages of existing discretization schemes, such as computing projections to possibly non-convex sets. Finally, this bridge between CBFs and PDSs may yield other potential benefits, including novel insights on stability.</description>

      <title>Wireless Resource Optimization in Hybrid Semantic/Bit Communication Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04162v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, semantic communication (SemCom) has shown great potential in significant resource savings and efficient information exchanges, thus naturally introducing a novel and practical cellular network paradigm where two modes of SemCom and conventional bit communication (BitCom) coexist. Nevertheless, the involved wireless resource management becomes rather complicated and challenging, given the unique background knowledge matching and time-consuming semantic coding requirements in SemCom. To this end, this paper jointly investigates user association (UA), mode selection (MS), and bandwidth allocation (BA) problems in a hybrid semantic/bit communication network (HSB-Net). Concretely, we first identify a unified performance metric of message throughput for both SemCom and BitCom links. Next, we specially develop a knowledge matching-aware two-stage tandem packet queuing model and theoretically derive the average packet loss ratio and queuing latency. Combined with practical constraints, we then formulate a joint optimization problem for UA, MS, and BA to maximize the overall message throughput of HSB-Net. Afterward, we propose an optimal resource management strategy by utilizing a Lagrange primal-dual transformation method and a preference list-based heuristic algorithm with polynomial-time complexity. Numerical results not only demonstrate the accuracy of our analytical queuing model, but also validate the performance superiority of our proposed strategy compared with different benchmarks.</description>
