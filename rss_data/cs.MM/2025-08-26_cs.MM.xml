      <title>Generative AI for Multimedia Communication: Recent Advances, An Information-Theoretic Framework, and Future Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in generative artificial intelligence (AI) are transforming multimedia communication. This paper systematically reviews key recent advancements across generative AI for multimedia communication, emphasizing transformative models like diffusion and transformers. However, conventional information-theoretic frameworks fail to address semantic fidelity, critical to human perception. We propose an innovative semantic information-theoretic framework, introducing semantic entropy, mutual information, channel capacity, and rate-distortion concepts specifically adapted to multimedia applications. This framework redefines multimedia communication from purely syntactic data transmission to semantic information conveyance. We further highlight future opportunities and critical research directions. We chart a path toward robust, efficient, and semantically meaningful multimedia communication systems by bridging generative AI innovations with information theory. This exploratory paper aims to inspire a semantic-first paradigm shift, offering a fresh perspective with significant implications for future multimedia research.</description>

      <title>Generative Flow Networks for Personalized Multimedia Systems: A Case Study on Short Video Feeds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimedia systems underpin modern digital interactions, facilitating seamless integration and optimization of resources across diverse multimedia applications. To meet growing personalization demands, multimedia systems must efficiently manage competing resource needs, adaptive content, and user-specific data handling. This paper introduces Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets, GFNs) as a brave new framework for enabling personalized multimedia systems. By integrating multi-candidate generative modeling with flow-based principles, GFlowNets offer a scalable and flexible solution for enhancing user-specific multimedia experiences. To illustrate the effectiveness of GFlowNets, we focus on short video feeds, a multimedia application characterized by high personalization demands and significant resource constraints, as a case study. Our proposed GFlowNet-based personalized feeds algorithm demonstrates superior performance compared to traditional rule-based and reinforcement learning methods across critical metrics, including video quality, resource utilization efficiency, and delivery cost. Moreover, we propose a unified GFlowNet-based framework generalizable to other multimedia systems, highlighting its adaptability and wide-ranging applicability. These findings underscore the potential of GFlowNets to advance personalized multimedia systems by addressing complex optimization challenges and supporting sophisticated multimedia application scenarios.</description>

      <title>Predicting User Grasp Intentions in Virtual Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting user intentions in virtual reality (VR) is crucial for creating immersive experiences, particularly in tasks involving complex grasping motions where accurate haptic feedback is essential. In this work, we leverage time-series data from hand movements to evaluate both classification and regression approaches across 810 trials with varied object types, sizes, and manipulations. Our findings reveal that classification models struggle to generalize across users, leading to inconsistent performance. In contrast, regression-based approaches, particularly those using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks, demonstrate more robust performance, with timing errors within 0.25 seconds and distance errors around 5-20 cm in the critical two-second window before a grasp. Despite these improvements, predicting precise hand postures remains challenging. Through a comprehensive analysis of user variability and model interpretability, we explore why certain models fail and how regression models better accommodate the dynamic and complex nature of user behavior in VR. Our results underscore the potential of machine learning models to enhance VR interactions, particularly through adaptive haptic feedback, and lay the groundwork for future advancements in real-time prediction of user actions in VR.</description>

      <title>Seeing Isn't Believing: Addressing the Societal Impact of Deepfakes in Low-Tech Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deepfakes, AI-generated multimedia content that mimics real media, are becoming increasingly prevalent, posing significant risks to political stability, social trust, and economic well-being, especially in developing societies with limited media literacy and technological infrastructure. This work aims to understand how these technologies are perceived and impact resource-limited communities. We conducted a survey to assess public awareness, perceptions, and experiences with deepfakes, leading to the development of a comprehensive framework for prevention, detection, and mitigation in tech-limited environments. Our findings reveal critical knowledge gaps and a lack of effective detection tools, emphasizing the need for targeted education and accessible verification solutions. This work offers actionable insights to support vulnerable populations and calls for further interdisciplinary efforts to tackle deepfake challenges globally, particularly in the Global South.</description>

      <title>MDD: A Dataset for Text-and-Music Conditioned Duet Dance Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Multimodal DuetDance (MDD), a diverse multimodal benchmark dataset designed for text-controlled and music-conditioned 3D duet dance motion generation. Our dataset comprises 620 minutes of high-quality motion capture data performed by professional dancers, synchronized with music, and detailed with over 10K fine-grained natural language descriptions. The annotations capture a rich movement vocabulary, detailing spatial relationships, body movements, and rhythm, making MDD the first dataset to seamlessly integrate human motions, music, and text for duet dance generation. We introduce two novel tasks supported by our dataset: (1) Text-to-Duet, where given music and a textual prompt, both the leader and follower dance motion are generated (2) Text-to-Dance Accompaniment, where given music, textual prompt, and the leader's motion, the follower's motion is generated in a cohesive, text-aligned manner. We include baseline evaluations on both tasks to support future research.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Temporal Masked Attention for Cross-view Online Action Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a critical task in video sequence classification within computer vision, Online Action Detection (OAD) has garnered significant attention. The sensitivity of mainstream OAD models to varying video viewpoints often hampers their generalization when confronted with unseen sources. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Probabilistic Temporal Masked Attention (PTMA) model, which leverages probabilistic modeling to derive latent compressed representations of video frames in a cross-view setting. The PTMA model incorporates a GRU-based temporal masked attention (TMA) cell, which leverages these representations to effectively query the input video sequence, thereby enhancing information interaction and facilitating autoregressive frame-level video analysis. Additionally, multi-view information can be integrated into the probabilistic modeling to facilitate the extraction of view-invariant features. Experiments conducted under three evaluation protocols: cross-subject (cs), cross-view (cv), and cross-subject-view (csv) show that PTMA achieves state-of-the-art performance on the DAHLIA, IKEA ASM, and Breakfast datasets.</description>

      <title>SyncGuard: Robust Audio Watermarking Capable of Countering Desynchronization Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio watermarking has been widely applied in copyright protection and source tracing. However, due to the inherent characteristics of audio signals, watermark localization and resistance to desynchronization attacks remain significant challenges. In this paper, we propose a learning-based scheme named SyncGuard to address these challenges. Specifically, we design a frame-wise broadcast embedding strategy to embed the watermark in arbitrary-length audio, enhancing time-independence and eliminating the need for localization during watermark extraction. To further enhance robustness, we introduce a meticulously designed distortion layer. Additionally, we employ dilated residual blocks in conjunction with dilated gated blocks to effectively capture multi-resolution time-frequency features. Extensive experimental results show that SyncGuard efficiently handles variable-length audio segments, outperforms state-of-the-art methods in robustness against various attacks, and delivers superior auditory quality.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new instance-level human-object interaction detection task on videos called ST-HOID, which aims to distinguish fine-grained human-object interactions (HOIs) and the trajectories of subjects and objects. It is motivated by the fact that HOI is crucial for human-centric video content understanding. To solve ST-HOID, we propose a novel method consisting of an object trajectory detection module and an interaction reasoning module. Furthermore, we construct the first dataset named VidOR-HOID for ST-HOID evaluation, which contains 10,831 spatial-temporal HOI instances. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our method. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the baselines generated by the state-of-the-art methods of image human-object interaction detection, video visual relation detection and video human-object interaction recognition.</description>

      <title>MTNet: Learning modality-aware representation with transformer for RGBT tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to learn robust multi-modality representation has played a critical role in the development of RGBT tracking. However, the regular fusion paradigm and the invariable tracking template remain restrictive to the feature interaction. In this paper, we propose a modality-aware tracker based on transformer, termed MTNet. Specifically, a modality-aware network is presented to explore modality-specific cues, which contains both channel aggregation and distribution module(CADM) and spatial similarity perception module (SSPM). A transformer fusion network is then applied to capture global dependencies to reinforce instance representations. To estimate the precise location and tackle the challenges, such as scale variation and deformation, we design a trident prediction head and a dynamic update strategy which jointly maintain a reliable template for facilitating inter-frame communication. Extensive experiments validate that the proposed method achieves satisfactory results compared with the state-of-the-art competitors on three RGBT benchmarks while reaching real-time speed.</description>

      <title>DanceEditor: Towards Iterative Editable Music-driven Dance Generation with Open-Vocabulary Descriptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating coherent and diverse human dances from music signals has gained tremendous progress in animating virtual avatars. While existing methods support direct dance synthesis, they fail to recognize that enabling users to edit dance movements is far more practical in real-world choreography scenarios. Moreover, the lack of high-quality dance datasets incorporating iterative editing also limits addressing this challenge. To achieve this goal, we first construct DanceRemix, a large-scale multi-turn editable dance dataset comprising the prompt featuring over 25.3M dance frames and 84.5K pairs. In addition, we propose a novel framework for iterative and editable dance generation coherently aligned with given music signals, namely DanceEditor. Considering the dance motion should be both musical rhythmic and enable iterative editing by user descriptions, our framework is built upon a prediction-then-editing paradigm unifying multi-modal conditions. At the initial prediction stage, our framework improves the authority of generated results by directly modeling dance movements from tailored, aligned music. Moreover, at the subsequent iterative editing stages, we incorporate text descriptions as conditioning information to draw the editable results through a specifically designed Cross-modality Editing Module (CEM). Specifically, CEM adaptively integrates the initial prediction with music and text prompts as temporal motion cues to guide the synthesized sequences. Thereby, the results display music harmonics while preserving fine-grained semantic alignment with text descriptions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art models on our newly collected DanceRemix dataset.

Abstract: Streaming 360$^\circ$ videos for virtual reality demands a lot of bandwidth. To optimize this transmission, videos are divided into "tiles" and selectively distributed to the user based on what they are looking at. This interactive approach makes it difficult to assess quality and user experience. To solve this, the paper presents py360tools, a Python library that automates client-side tasks like video reconstruction, tile selection, and viewport extraction. This facilitates the reproduction, simulation, and analysis of 360$^\circ$ video streaming sessions.</description>

      <title>Prompt-based Multimodal Semantic Communication for Multi-spectral Image Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal semantic communication has gained widespread attention due to its ability to enhance downstream task performance. A key challenge in such systems is the effective fusion of features from different modalities, which requires the extraction of rich and diverse semantic representations from each modality. To this end, we propose ProMSC-MIS, a Prompt-based Multimodal Semantic Communication system for Multi-spectral Image Segmentation. Specifically, we propose a pre-training algorithm where features from one modality serve as prompts for another, guiding unimodal semantic encoders to learn diverse and complementary semantic representations. We further introduce a semantic fusion module that combines cross-attention mechanisms and squeeze-and-excitation (SE) networks to effectively fuse cross-modal features. Simulation results show that ProMSC-MIS significantly outperforms benchmark methods across various channel-source compression levels, while maintaining low computational complexity and storage overhead. Our scheme has great potential for applications such as autonomous driving and nighttime surveillance.</description>

      <title>TuningIQA: Fine-Grained Blind Image Quality Assessment for Livestreaming Camera Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Livestreaming has become increasingly prevalent in modern visual communication, where automatic camera quality tuning is essential for delivering superior user Quality of Experience (QoE). Such tuning requires accurate blind image quality assessment (BIQA) to guide parameter optimization decisions. Unfortunately, the existing BIQA models typically only predict an overall coarse-grained quality score, which cannot provide fine-grained perceptual guidance for precise camera parameter tuning. To bridge this gap, we first establish FGLive-10K, a comprehensive fine-grained BIQA database containing 10,185 high-resolution images captured under varying camera parameter configurations across diverse livestreaming scenarios. The dataset features 50,925 multi-attribute quality annotations and 19,234 fine-grained pairwise preference annotations. Based on FGLive-10K, we further develop TuningIQA, a fine-grained BIQA metric for livestreaming camera tuning, which integrates human-aware feature extraction and graph-based camera parameter fusion. Extensive experiments and comparisons demonstrate that TuningIQA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art BIQA methods in both score regression and fine-grained quality ranking, achieving superior performance when deployed for livestreaming camera tuning.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Based Prediction of Quality Shifts on Video Streaming Over 5G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17938v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Quality of Experience (QoE) is the users satisfaction while streaming a video session over an over-the-top (OTT) platform like YouTube. QoE of YouTube reflects the smooth streaming session without any buffering and quality shift events. One of the most important factors nowadays affecting QoE of YouTube is frequent shifts from higher to lower resolutions and vice versa. These shifts ensure a smooth streaming session; however, it might get a lower mean opinion score. For instance, dropping from 1080p to 480p during a video can preserve continuity but might reduce the viewers enjoyment. Over time, OTT platforms are looking for alternative ways to boost user experience instead of relying on traditional Quality of Service (QoS) metrics such as bandwidth, latency, and throughput. As a result, we look into the relationship between quality shifting in YouTube streaming sessions and the channel metrics RSRP, RSRQ, and SNR. Our findings state that these channel metrics positively correlate with shifts. Thus, in real-time, OTT can only rely on them to predict video streaming sessions into lower- and higher-resolution categories, thus providing more resources to improve user experience. Using traditional Machine Learning (ML) classifiers, we achieved an accuracy of 77-percent, while using only RSRP, RSRQ, and SNR. In the era of 5G and beyond, where ultra-reliable, low-latency networks promise enhanced streaming capabilities, the proposed methodology can be used to improve OTT services.</description>

      <title>FlowDubber: Movie Dubbing with LLM-based Semantic-aware Learning and Flow Matching based Voice Enhancing</title>

Abstract: Movie Dubbing aims to convert scripts into speeches that align with the given movie clip in both temporal and emotional aspects while preserving the vocal timbre of a given brief reference audio. Existing methods focus primarily on reducing the word error rate while ignoring the importance of lip-sync and acoustic quality. To address these issues, we propose a large language model (LLM) based flow matching architecture for dubbing, named FlowDubber, which achieves high-quality audio-visual sync and pronunciation by incorporating a large speech language model and dual contrastive aligning while achieving better acoustic quality via the proposed voice-enhanced flow matching than previous works. First, we introduce Qwen2.5 as the backbone of LLM to learn the in-context sequence from movie scripts and reference audio. Then, the proposed semantic-aware learning focuses on capturing LLM semantic knowledge at the phoneme level. Next, dual contrastive aligning (DCA) boosts mutual alignment with lip movement, reducing ambiguities where similar phonemes might be confused. Finally, the proposed Flow-based Voice Enhancing (FVE) improves acoustic quality in two aspects, which introduces an LLM-based acoustics flow matching guidance to strengthen clarity and uses affine style prior to enhance identity when recovering noise into mel-spectrograms via gradient vector field prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art methods on two primary benchmarks.</description>

      <title>One Framework to Rule Them All: Unifying Multimodal Tasks with LLM Neural-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03001v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large-scale models have exhibited remarkable capabilities across diverse domains, including automated medical services and intelligent customer support. However, as most large models are trained on single-modality corpora, enabling them to effectively process and understand multimodal signals remains a significant challenge. Current research often focuses on designing task-specific or scenario-specific tuning strategies, which limits the scalability and versatility. To address this limitation, we propose a unified framework that concurrently handles multiple tasks and modalities. In this framework, all modalities and tasks are represented as unified tokens and trained using a single, consistent approach. To enable efficient multitask processing, we introduce a novel tuning strategy termed neural tuning, inspired by the concept of sparse distributed representation in the human brain, where only specific subsets of neurons are activated for each task. Furthermore, to advance research in multimodal and multitask learning, we present a new benchmark, MMUD, which includes samples annotated with multiple task labels spanning reasoning segmentation, referring segmentation, image captioning, and text-to-image generation. By applying neural tuning to pretrained large models on the MMUD benchmark, we demonstrate the ability to handle multiple tasks simultaneously in a streamlined and efficient manner. All models, code, and datasets will be released publicly upon publication, fostering further research and innovation in this field.</description>

      <title>Watermarking Visual Concepts for Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11688v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The personalization techniques of diffusion models succeed in generating images with specific concepts. This ability also poses great threats to copyright protection and network security since malicious users can generate unauthorized content and disinformation relevant to a target concept. Model watermarking is an effective solution to trace the malicious generated images and safeguard their copyright. However, existing model watermarking techniques merely achieve image-level tracing without concept traceability. When tracing infringing or harmful concepts, current approaches execute image concept detection and model tracing sequentially, where performance is critically constrained by concept detection accuracy. In this paper, we propose a lightweight concept watermarking framework that efficiently binds target concepts to model watermarks, supporting simultaneous concept identification and model tracing via single-stage watermark verification. To further enhance the robustness of concept watermarking, we propose an adversarial perturbation injection method collaboratively embedded with watermarks during image generation, avoiding watermark removal by model purification attacks. Experimental results demonstrate that ConceptWM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art watermarking methods, improving detection accuracy by 6.3%-19.3% across diverse datasets including COCO and StableDiffusionDB. Additionally, ConceptWM possesses a critical capability absent in other watermarking methods: it sustains a 21.7% FID/CLIP degradation under adversarial fine-tuning of Stable Diffusion models on WikiArt and CelebA-HQ, demonstrating its capability to mitigate model misuse.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06602v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-speech (TTS) has advanced from generating natural-sounding speech to enabling fine-grained control over attributes like emotion, timbre, and style. Driven by rising industrial demand and breakthroughs in deep learning, e.g., diffusion and large language models (LLMs), controllable TTS has become a rapidly growing research area. This survey provides the first comprehensive review of controllable TTS methods, from traditional control techniques to emerging approaches using natural language prompts. We categorize model architectures, control strategies, and feature representations, while also summarizing challenges, datasets, and evaluations in controllable TTS. This survey aims to guide researchers and practitioners by offering a clear taxonomy and highlighting future directions in this fast-evolving field.

      <title>Seeing Sarcasm Through Different Eyes: Analyzing Multimodal Sarcasm Perception in Large Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12149v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the advent of large vision-language models (LVLMs) demonstrating increasingly human-like abilities, a pivotal question emerges: do different LVLMs interpret multimodal sarcasm differently, and can a single model grasp sarcasm from multiple perspectives like humans? To explore this, we introduce an analytical framework using systematically designed prompts on existing multimodal sarcasm datasets. Evaluating 12 state-of-the-art LVLMs over 2,409 samples, we examine interpretive variations within and across models, focusing on confidence levels, alignment with dataset labels, and recognition of ambiguous "neutral" cases. We further validate our findings on a diverse 100-sample mini-benchmark, incorporating multiple datasets, expanded prompt variants, and representative commercial LVLMs. Our findings reveal notable discrepancies -- across LVLMs and within the same model under varied prompts. While classification-oriented prompts yield higher internal consistency, models diverge markedly when tasked with interpretive reasoning. These results challenge binary labeling paradigms by highlighting sarcasm's subjectivity. We advocate moving beyond rigid annotation schemes toward multi-perspective, uncertainty-aware modeling, offering deeper insights into multimodal sarcasm comprehension.

      <title>Boosting Temporal Sentence Grounding via Causal Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Temporal Sentence Grounding (TSG) aims to identify relevant moments in an untrimmed video that semantically correspond to a given textual query. Despite existing studies having made substantial progress, they often overlook the issue of spurious correlations between video and textual queries. These spurious correlations arise from two primary factors: (1) inherent biases in the textual data, such as frequent co-occurrences of specific verbs or phrases, and (2) the model's tendency to overfit to salient or repetitive patterns in video content. Such biases mislead the model into associating textual cues with incorrect visual moments, resulting in unreliable predictions and poor generalization to out-of-distribution examples. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel TSG framework, causal intervention and counterfactual reasoning that utilizes causal inference to eliminate spurious correlations and enhance the model's robustness. Specifically, we first formulate the TSG task from a causal perspective with a structural causal model. Then, to address unobserved confounders reflecting textual biases toward specific verbs or phrases, a textual causal intervention is proposed, utilizing do-calculus to estimate the causal effects. Furthermore, visual counterfactual reasoning is performed by constructing a counterfactual scenario that focuses solely on video features, excluding the query and fused multi-modal features. This allows us to debias the model by isolating and removing the influence of the video from the overall effect. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.

      <title>PediatricsMQA: a Multi-modal Pediatrics Question Answering Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and vision-augmented LLMs (VLMs) have significantly advanced medical informatics, diagnostics, and decision support. However, these models exhibit systematic biases, particularly age bias, compromising their reliability and equity. This is evident in their poorer performance on pediatric-focused text and visual question-answering tasks. This bias reflects a broader imbalance in medical research, where pediatric studies receive less funding and representation despite the significant disease burden in children. To address these issues, a new comprehensive multi-modal pediatric question-answering benchmark, PediatricsMQA, has been introduced. It consists of 3,417 text-based multiple-choice questions (MCQs) covering 131 pediatric topics across seven developmental stages (prenatal to adolescent) and 2,067 vision-based MCQs using 634 pediatric images from 67 imaging modalities and 256 anatomical regions. The dataset was developed using a hybrid manual-automatic pipeline, incorporating peer-reviewed pediatric literature, validated question banks, existing benchmarks, and existing QA resources. Evaluating state-of-the-art open models, we find dramatic performance drops in younger cohorts, highlighting the need for age-aware methods to ensure equitable AI support in pediatric care.</description>
