      <title>Entropic curvature not comparable to other curvatures -- or is it?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider global $\theta$-curvatures of finite Markov chains with associated means $\theta$ in the spirit of the entropic curvature (based on the logarithmic mean) by Erbar-Maas and Mielke. As in the case of Bakry-\'Emery curvature, we also allow for a finite dimension parameter by making use of an adapted $\Gamma$ calculus for $\theta$-curvatures. We prove explicit positive lower curvature bounds (both finite- and infinite-dimensional) for finite abelian Cayley graphs. In the case of cycles, we provide also an upper curvature bound which shows that our lower bounds are asymptotically sharp (up to a logarithmic factor). Moreover, we prove new universal lower curvature bounds for finite Markov chains as well as curvature perturbation results (allowing, in particular, to compare entropic and Bakry-\'Emery curvatures). Finally, we present examples where entropic curvature differs significantly from other curvature notions like Bakry-\'Emery curvature or Ollivier Ricci and sectional curvatures.</description>

      <title>The Michor-Mumford conjecture in Hilbertian H-type groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce infinite dimensional Hilbertian H-type groups equipped with weak, graded, left invariant Riemannian metrics. For these Lie groups, we show that the vanishing of the geodesic distance and the local unboundedness of the sectional curvature coexist. The result validates a deep phenomenon conjectured in an influential 2005 paper by Michor and Mumford, namely, the vanishing of the geodesic distance is linked to the local unboundedness of the sectional curvature. We prove that degenerate geodesic distances appear for a large class of weak, left invariant Riemannian metrics. Their vanishing is rather surprisingly related to the infinite dimensional sub-Riemannian structure of Hilbertian H-type groups. The same class of weak Riemannian metrics yields the nonexistence of the Levi-Civita covariant derivative.</description>

      <title>On Euler-Dierkes-Huisken variational problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the stability and minimizing properties of higher codimensional surfaces in Euclidean space associated with the $f$-weighted area-functional $$\mathcal{E}_f(M)=\int_M f(x)\; d \mathcal{H}_k$$ with the density function $f(x)=g(|x|)$ and $g(t)$ is non-negative, which develop the recent works by U. Dierkes and G. Huisken (Math. Ann., 20 October 2023) on hypersurfaces with the density function $|x|^\alpha$. Under suitable assumptions on $g(t)$, we prove that minimal cones with globally flat normal bundles are $f$-stable, and we also prove that the regular minimal cones satisfying Lawlor curvature criterion, the highly singular determinantal varieties and Pfaffian varieties without some exceptional cases are $f$-minimizing. As an application, we show that $k$-dimensional minimal cones over product of spheres are $|x|^\alpha$-stable for $\alpha\geq-k+2\sqrt{2(k-1)}$, the oriented stable minimal hypercones are $|x|^\alpha$-stable for $\alpha\geq 0$, and we also show that the minimal cones over product of spheres $\mathcal{C}=C \left(S^{k_1} \times \cdots \times S^{k_{m}}\right)$ are $|x|^\alpha$-minimizing for $\dim \mathcal{C} \geq 7$, $k_i&gt;1$ and $\alpha \geq 0$, the Simons cones $C(S^{p} \times S^{p})(p\geq 1)$ are $|x|^\alpha$-minimizing for any $\alpha \geq 1$, which relaxes the assumption $1\leq\alpha \leq 2p$ in \cite{DH23}.</description>

      <title>Deforming Locally Convex Curves into Curves of Constant $k$-order Width</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A nonlocal curvature flow is introduced to evolve locally convex curves in the plane. It is proved that this flow with any initial locally convex curve has a global solution, keeping the local convexity and the elastic energy of the evolving curve, and that, as the time goes to infinity, the curve converges to a smooth, locally convex curve of constant $k$-order width. In particular, the limiting curve is a multiple circle if and only if the initial locally convex curve is $k$-symmetric.</description>

      <title>On the existence and rigidity of critical Z2 eigenvalues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the eigenvalues and eigenfunction problems for the Laplace operator on multivalued functions, defined on the complement of the 2n points on the round sphere. These eigenvalues and eigensections could also be viewed as functions on the configuration spaces of points, introduced and systematically studied by Taubes-Wu. Critical eigenfunctions, which serve as local singularity models for gauge theoretical problems, are of particular interest.
  Our study focuses on the existence and rigidity problems pertaining to these critical eigenfunctions. We prove that for generic configurations, the critical eigenfunctions do not exist. Furthermore, for each n&gt;1, we construct infinitely many configurations that admit critical eigensections. Additionally, we show that the Taubes-Wu tetrahedral eigensections are deformation rigid and non-degenerate. Our main tools are algebraic identities developed by Taubes-Wu and finite group representation theory.</description>

      <title>Geometry of infinite dimensional Cartan Developments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cartan development takes a Lie algebra valued 1-form satisfying the Maurer-Cartan equation on a simply connected manifold $M$ to a smooth mapping from $M$ into the Lie group. In this paper this is generalized to infinite dimensional $M$ for infinite dimensional regular Lie groups. The Cartan development is viewed as a generalization of the evolution map of a regular Lie group. The tangent mapping of a Cartan development is identified as another Cartan development.</description>

      <title>Curvature of quaternionic skew-Hermitian manifolds and bundle constructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This articles is devoted to a description of the second-order differential geometry of torsion-free almost quaternionic skew-Hermitian manifolds, that is, of quaternionic skew-Hermitian manifolds $(M, Q, \omega)$. We provide a curvature characterization of such integrable geometric structures, based on the holonomy theory of symplectic connections and we study qualitative properties of the induced Ricci tensor. Then we proceed with bundle constructions over such a manifold $(M, Q, \omega)$. In particular, we prove the existence of almost hypercomplex skew-Hermitian structures on the Swann bundle over $M$ and investigate their integrability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish analogs of the Darboux, Moser and Weinstein theorems for prequantum systems. We show that two prequantum systems on a manifold with vanishing first cohomology, with symplectic forms defining the same cohomology class and homotopic to each other within that class, differ only by a symplectomorphism and a gauge transformation. As an application, we show that the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization of prequantum system on a manifold with trivial first cohomology is independent of the choice of the connection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the Gromov-Hausdorff distance from the circle with its geodesic metric to any simply connected geodesic space is never smaller than $\frac{\pi}{4}$. We also prove that this bound is tight through the construction of a simply connected geodesic space $\mathrm{E}$ which attains the lower bound $\frac{\pi}{4}$. We deduce the first statement from a general result that we also establish which gives conditions on how small the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between two geodesic metric spaces $(X, d_X)$ and $(Y, d_Y )$ has to be in order for $\pi_1(X)$ and $\pi_1(Y)$ to be isomorphic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1904.09220v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 9We consider complex structures with totally real zero section of the tangent bundle. We assume that the complex structure tensor is real-analytic along the fibers of the tangent bundle. This assumption is quite natural in view of a well known existence result by Bruhat and Whitney. We provide explicit integrability equations for such complex structures in terms of the fiberwise Taylor expansion. In a particular geometric case considered in the literature, we explicit much further the fiberwise Taylor expansion of the complex structure as well as the integrability equations.</description>

      <title>A new proof for the existence of rotationally symmetric gradient Ricci solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.03805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.03805v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a new proof for the existence of rotationally symmetric steady and expanding gradient Ricci solitons in dimension $n+1$, $2\le n\le 4$, with metric $g=\frac{da^2}{h(a^2)}+a^2d\,\sigma$ for some function $h$ where $d\sigma$ is the standard metric on the unit sphere $S^n$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$. More precisely for any $\lambda\ge 0$, $2\le n\le 4$ and $\mu_1\in\mathbb{R}$, we prove the existence of unique solution $h\in C^2((0,\infty))\cap C^1([0,\infty))$ for the equation $2r^2h(r)h_{rr}(r)=(n-1)h(r)(h(r)-1)+rh_r(r)(rh_r(r)-\lambda r-(n-1))$, $h(r)&gt;0$, in $(0,\infty)$ satisfying $h(0)=1$, $h_r(0)=\mu_1$. We also prove the existence of unique analytic solution of the about equation on $[0,\infty)$ for any $\lambda\ge 0$, $n\ge 2$ and $\mu_1\in\mathbb{R}$. Moreover we will prove the asymptotic behaviour of the solution $h$ for any $n\ge 2$, $\lambda\ge 0$ and $\mu_1\in\mathbb{R}\setminus\{0\}$.</description>

Abstract: Recent advances in the theory of metric measures spaces on the one hand, and of sub-Riemannian ones on the other hand, suggest the possibility of a "great unification" of Riemannian and sub-Riemannian geometries in a comprehensive framework of synthetic Ricci curvature lower bounds. With the aim of achieving such a unification program, in this paper we initiate the study of gauge metric measure spaces.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we uncover an intriguing algebra property of an element symmetric polynomial. By this property, we establish the longtime existence and convergence of a locally constrained flow, thereby some families of geometric inequalities in sphere can be derived. Meanwhile, a new family of ``three terms'' geometric inequalities involving two weighted curvature integrals and one quermassintegral are proved. Unlike hyperbolic spaces, we also obtain an inverse weighted geometric inequality in sphere.</description>

We prove some basic diffeological properties for tiling spaces and analyze two different fiber bundle structures of one-dimensional tiling spaces over the irrational torus. We use the diffeological classification of irrationatl tori which captures their arithmetical escence in order to inherit the diffeological equivalence in the context of tiling spaces.</description>

      <title>On the geometry of silent and anisotropic big bang singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.04955v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article is the second of two in which we develop a geometric framework for analysing silent and anisotropic big bang singularities. In the present article, we record geometric conclusions obtained by combining the geometric framework with Einstein's equations. The main features of the results are the following: The assumptions do not involve any symmetry requirements and are weak enough to be consistent with most big bang singularities for which the asymptotic geometry is understood. The framework gives a clear picture of the asymptotic geometry. It also reproduces the Kasner map, conjectured in the physics literature to constitute the essence of the asymptotic dynamics for vacuum solutions to Einstein's equations. When combined with Einstein's equations, the framework yields partial improvements of the assumptions concerning, e.g., the expansion normalised Weingarten map $\mathcal{K}$ (one of the central objects of the framework, defined as the Weingarten map of the leaves of the foliation divided by the mean curvature). For example, the expansion normalised normal derivative of $\mathcal{K}$ can, under suitable assumptions concerning the eigenvalues of $\mathcal{K}$, be demonstrated to decay exponentially and $\mathcal{K}$ can be demonstrated to converge exponentially, even though we initially only impose weighted bounds on these quantities. Finally, the framework gives a unified perspective on the existing results. Moreover, in $3+1$-dimensions, the only parameters necessary to interpret the results are the eigenvalues of $\mathcal{K}$ and an additional scalar function determined by the geometry induced on the leaves of the foliation.
  In the companion article, we obtain conclusions concerning the asymptotic behaviour of solutions to linear systems of wave equations on the backgrounds consistent with the framework.</description>

      <title>A new notion of subharmonicity on locally smoothing spaces, and a conjecture by Braverman, Milatovic, Shubin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.09423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a strongly local Dirichlet space and $\lambda\geq 0$, we introduce a new notion of $\lambda$--subharmonicity for $L^1_\loc$--functions, which we call \emph{local $\lambda$--shift defectivity}, and which turns out to be equivalent to distributional $\lambda$--subharmonicity in the Riemannian case. We study the regularity of these functions on a new class of strongly local Dirichlet, so called locally smoothing spaces, which includes Riemannian manifolds (without any curvature assumptions), finite dimensional RCD spaces, Carnot groups, and Sierpinski gaskets. As a byproduct of this regularity theory, we obtain in this general framework a proof of a conjecture by Braverman, Milatovic, Shubin on the positivity of distributional $L^q$-solutions of $\Delta f\leq f$ for complete Riemannian manifolds.</description>

      <title>Defining equations of $7$-dimensional model CR hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18588v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain a complete normal form for models of real analytic uniformly $2$-nondegenerate CR hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{C}^4$, and present a detailed study of their local invariants. The normal form illustrates that $2$-nondegenerate models in $\mathbb{C}^4$ comprise a moduli space parameterized by two univariate holomorphic functions, which is in sharp contrast to the well known Levi-nondegenerate setting and the more recently discovered behavior of $2$-nondegenerate structures in $\mathbb{C}^3$. In further contrast to these previously studied settings, we demonstrate that not all $2$-nondegenerate structures in $\mathbb{C}^4$ arise as perturbations of homogeneous models. We derive defining equations for the homogeneous models, a set of $9$ structures, and find explicit formulas for their infinitesimal symmetries.</description>

      <title>The Adjoint Representation of a Higher Lie Groupoid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the standard construction of the adjoint representation of a Lie groupoid to the case of an arbitrary higher Lie groupoid. As for a Lie groupoid, the adjoint representation of a higher Lie groupoid turns out to be a representation up to homotopy which is well defined up to isomorphism. Its existence and uniqueness are immediate consequences of a more general result in the theory of simplicial vector bundles: the representation up to homotopy obtained by splitting a higher vector bundle by means of a cleavage is, to within isomorphism, independent of the choice of the cleavage.</description>
