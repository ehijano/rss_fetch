      <title>Neural Network-Augmented Iterative Learning Control for Friction Compensation of Motion Control Systems with Varying Disturbances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a robust control strategy that integrates Iterative Learning Control (ILC) with a simple lateral neural network to enhance the trajectory tracking performance of a linear Lorentz force actuator under friction and model uncertainties. The ILC compensates for nonlinear friction effects, while the neural network estimates the nonlinear ILC effort for varying reference commands. By dynamically adjusting the ILC effort, the method adapts to time-varying friction, reduces errors at reference changes, and accelerates convergence. Compared to previous approaches using complex neural networks, this method simplifies online training and implementation, making it practical for real-time applications. Experimental results confirm its effectiveness in achieving precise tracking across multiple tasks with different reference trajectories.</description>

      <title>Emulation-based Neuromorphic Control for the Stabilization of LTI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain-inspired neuromorphic technologies can offer important advantages over classical digital clock-based technologies in various domains, including systems and control engineering. Indeed, neuromorphic engineering could provide low-latency, low-energy and adaptive control systems in the form of spiking neural networks (SNNs) exploiting spike-based control and communication. However, systematic methods for designing and analyzing neuron-inspired spiking controllers are currently lacking. This paper presents a new systematic approach for stabilizing linear time-invariant (LTI) systems using SNN-based controllers, designed as a network of integrate-and-fire neurons, whose input is the measured output from the plant and generating spiking control signals. The new approach consists of a two-step emulation-based design procedure. In the first step, we establish conditions on the neuron parameters to ensure that the spiking signal generated by a pair of neurons emulates any continuous-time signal input to the neurons with arbitrary accuracy in terms of a special metric for spiky signals. In the second step, we propose a novel stability notion, called integral spiking-input-to-state stability (iSISS) building on this special metric. We prove that an asymptotically stable LTI system has this iSISS property. By combining these steps, a certifiable practical stability property of the closed-loop system can be established. Generalizations are discussed and the effectiveness of the approach is illustrated in a numerical case study.</description>

      <title>Sampling-Aware Control Barrier Functions for Safety-Critical and Finite-Time Constrained Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In safety-critical control systems, ensuring both safety and feasibility under sampled-data implementations is crucial for practical deployment. Existing Control Barrier Function (CBF) frameworks, such as High-Order CBFs (HOCBFs), effectively guarantee safety in continuous time but may become unsafe when executed under zero-order-hold (ZOH) controllers due to inter-sampling effects. Moreover, they do not explicitly handle finite-time reach-and-remain requirements or multiple simultaneous constraints, which often lead to conflicts between safety and reach-and-remain objectives, resulting in feasibility issues during control synthesis. This paper introduces Sampling-Aware Control Barrier Functions (SACBFs), a unified framework that accounts for sampling effects and high relative-degree constraints by estimating and incorporating Taylor-based upper bounds on barrier evolution between sampling instants. The proposed method guarantees continuous-time forward invariance of safety and finite-time reach-and-remain sets under ZOH control. To further improve feasibility, a relaxed variant (r-SACBF) introduces slack variables for handling multiple constraints realized through time-varying CBFs. Simulation studies on a unicycle robot demonstrate that SACBFs achieve safe and feasible performance in scenarios where traditional HOCBF methods fail.</description>

      <title>On The Detection of Minimum Forecast Horizon For Real-Time Scheduling of Energy Storage Systems in Smart Grid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing integration of energy storage systems (ESSs) into power grids has necessitated effective real-time control strategies under uncertain and volatile electricity prices. An important problem of model predictive control of ESSs is identifying the minimum forecast horizon needed to exactly simulate the globally optimal control trajectory. Existing methods in the literature provide only sufficient conditions and might ignore real-world inconsistencies in control actions. In this paper, we introduce a trajectory-alignment-based definition of the minimum forecast horizon and propose an algorithm that identifies the minimum planning horizon for which all rolling-horizon control decisions match those of the full-horizon global optimization. Using real price data from the bidding zone DK1 in Denmark of the Nord Pool day-ahead market and a realistic ESS model, we illustrate that $60$ hours of forecast horizon allows us to exactly simulate the global control sequence and economic outcomes. In addition, we illustrate that under other parameter configurations, no forecast horizon ensures full convergence, demonstrating the sensitivity of the existence of a forecast horizon to various parameters. Our findings provide an operationally significant framework for minimum forecast horizon detection in storage scheduling and pave the way for the analytical description of this important planning measure.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Physics-Aware Battery Health Monitoring from Partial Charging Profiles via Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monitoring battery health is essential for ensuring safe and efficient operation. However, there is an inherent trade-off between assessment speed and diagnostic depth-specifically, between rapid overall health estimation and precise identification of internal degradation states. Capturing detailed internal battery information efficiently remains a major challenge, yet such insights are key to understanding the various degradation mechanisms. To address this, we develop a parameterized physics-informed neural network (P-PINNSPM) over the key aging-related parameter space for a single particle model. The model can accurately predict internal battery variables across the parameter space and identifies internal parameters in about 30 seconds-achieving a 47x speedup over the finite volume method-while maintaining high accuracy. These parameters improve the battery state-of-health (SOH) estimation accuracy by at least 60.61%, compared to models without parameter incorporation. Moreover, they enable extrapolation to unseen SOH levels and support robust estimation across diverse charging profiles and operating conditions. Our results demonstrate the strong potential of physics-informed machine learning to advance real-time, data-efficient, and physics-aware battery management systems.</description>

      <title>Tight displacement-based formation control under bounded disturbances. A set-theoretic perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the synthesis of controllers for displacement-based formation control in the presence of bounded disturbances, specifically focusing on uncertainties originating from measurement noise. While the literature frequently addresses such problems using stochastic frameworks, this work proposes a deterministic methodology grounded in set-theoretic concepts. By leveraging the principles of set invariance, we adapt the theory of ultimate boundedness to the specific dynamics of displacement-based formations. This approach provides a rigorous method for analyzing the system's behavior under persistent disturbances. Furthermore, this set-theoretic framework allows for the optimized selection of the proposed control law parameters to guarantee pre-specified performance bounds. The efficacy of the synthesized controller is demonstrated in the challenging application of maintaining tight formations in a multi-obstacles environment.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents an AI enhanced IoT framework for predictive maintenance and affordability optimization in smart microgrids using a Digital Twin modeling approach. The proposed system integrates real time sensor data, machine learning based fault prediction, and cost aware operational analytics to improve reliability and energy efficiency in distributed microgrid environments. By synchronizing physical microgrid components with a virtual Digital Twin, the framework enables early detection of component degradation, dynamic load management, and optimized maintenance scheduling. Experimental evaluations demonstrate improved predictive accuracy, reduced operational downtime, and measurable cost savings compared to baseline microgrid management methods. The findings highlight the potential of Digital Twin driven IoT architectures as a scalable solution for next generation intelligent and affordable energy systems.</description>

      <title>DataOps-driven CI/CD for analytics repositories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of SQL for data processing has often occurred without the rigor of traditional software development, leading to siloed efforts, logic replication, and increased risk. This ad-hoc approach hampers data governance and makes validation nearly impossible. Organizations are adopting DataOps, a methodology combining Agile, Lean, and DevOps principles to address these challenges to treat analytics pipelines as production systems. However, a standardized framework for implementing DataOps is lacking. This perspective proposes a qualitative design for a DataOps-aligned validation framework. It introduces a DataOps Controls Scorecard, derived from a multivocal literature review, which distills key concepts into twelve testable controls. These controls are then mapped to a modular, extensible CI/CD pipeline framework designed to govern a single source of truth (SOT) SQL repository. The framework consists of five stages: Lint, Optimize, Parse, Validate, and Observe, each containing specific, automated checks. A Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) demonstrates how each high-level control is enforced by concrete pipeline checks, ensuring qualitative completeness. This approach provides a structured mechanism for enhancing data quality, governance, and collaboration, allowing teams to scale analytics development with transparency and control.</description>

      <title>Target Defense against Sequentially Arriving Intruders: Algorithm for Agents with Dubins Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a variant of the target defense problem where a single defender is tasked to capture a sequence of incoming intruders. Both the defender and the intruders have non-holonomic dynamics. The intruders' objective is to breach the target perimeter without being captured by the defender, while the defender's goal is to capture as many intruders as possible. After one intruder breaches or is captured, the next appears randomly on a fixed circle surrounding the target. Therefore, the defender's final position in one game becomes its starting position for the next. We divide an intruder-defender engagement into two phases, partial information and full information, depending on the information available to the players. We address the capturability of an intruder by the defender using the notions of Dubins path and guarding arc. We quantify the percentage of capture for both finite and infinite sequences of incoming intruders. Finally, the theoretical results are verified through numerical examples using Monte-Carlo-type random trials of experiments.</description>

      <title>DER Day-Ahead Offering: A Neural Network Column-and-Constraint Generation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the day-ahead energy market, the offering strategy of distributed energy resource (DER) aggregators must be submitted before the uncertainty realization in the form of price-quantity pairs. This work addresses the day-ahead offering problem through a two-stage robust adaptive stochastic optimization model, wherein the first-stage price-quantity pairs and second-stage operational commitment decisions are made before and after DER uncertainty is realized, respectively. Uncertainty in day-ahead price is addressed using a stochastic programming, while uncertainty of DER generation is handled through robust optimization. To address the max-min structure of the second-stage problem, a neural network-accelerated column-and-constraint generation method is developed. A dedicated neural network is trained to approximate the value function, while optimality is maintained by the design of the network architecture. Numerical studies indicate that the proposed method yields high-quality solutions and is up to 100 times faster than Gurobi and 33 times faster than classical column-and-constraint generation on the same 1028-node synthetic distribution network.</description>

      <title>Online Adaptive Probabilistic Safety Certificate with Language Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving long-term safety in uncertain or extreme environments while accounting for human preferences remains a fundamental challenge for autonomous systems. Existing methods often trade off long-term guarantees for fast real-time control and cannot adapt to variability in human preferences or risk tolerance. To address these limitations, we propose a language-guided adaptive probabilistic safety certificate (PSC) framework that guarantees long-term safety for stochastic systems under environmental uncertainty while accommodating diverse human preferences. The proposed framework integrates natural-language inputs from users and Bayesian estimators of the environment into adaptive safety certificates that explicitly account for user preferences, system dynamics, and quantified uncertainties. Our key technical innovation leverages probabilistic invariance--a generalization of forward invariance to a probability space--to obtain myopic safety conditions with long-term safety guarantees that integrate language guidance, model information, and quantified uncertainty. We validate the framework through numerical simulations of autonomous lane-keeping with human-in-the-loop guidance under uncertain and extreme road conditions, demonstrating enhanced safety-performance trade-offs, adaptability to changing environments, and personalization to different user preferences.</description>

      <title>One Request, Multiple Experts: LLM Orchestrates Domain Specific Models via Adaptive Task Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the integration of massive distributed energy resources and the widespread participation of novel market entities, the operation of active distribution networks (ADNs) is progressively evolving into a complex multi-scenario, multi-objective problem. Although expert engineers have developed numerous domain specific models (DSMs) to address distinct technical problems, mastering, integrating, and orchestrating these heterogeneous DSMs still entail considerable overhead for ADN operators. Therefore, an intelligent approach is urgently required to unify these DSMs and enable efficient coordination. To address this challenge, this paper proposes the ADN-Agent architecture, which leverages a general large language model (LLM) to coordinate multiple DSMs, enabling adaptive intent recognition, task decomposition, and DSM invocation. Within the ADN-Agent, we design a novel communication mechanism that provides a unified and flexible interface for diverse heterogeneous DSMs. Finally, for some language-intensive subtasks, we propose an automated training pipeline for fine-tuning small language models, thereby effectively enhancing the overall problem-solving capability of the system. Comprehensive comparisons and ablation experiments validate the efficacy of the proposed method and demonstrate that the ADN-Agent architecture outperforms existing LLM application paradigms.</description>

      <title>Density-Driven Multi-Agent Coordination for Efficient Farm Coverage and Management in Smart Agriculture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing scale of modern farms has increased the need for efficient and adaptive multi-agent coverage strategies for pest, weed, and disease management. Traditional methods such as manual inspection and blanket pesticide spraying often lead to excessive chemical use, resource waste, and environmental impact. While unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offer a promising platform for precision agriculture through targeted spraying and improved operational efficiency, existing UAV-based approaches remain limited by battery life, payload capacity, and scalability, especially in large fields where single-UAV or uniformly distributed spraying is insufficient. Although multi-UAV coordination has been explored, many current frameworks still assume uniform spraying and do not account for infestation severity, UAV dynamics, non-uniform resource allocation, or energy-efficient coordination.
  To address these limitations, this paper proposes a Density-Driven Optimal Control (D2OC) framework that integrates Optimal Transport (OT) theory with multi-UAV coverage control for large-scale agricultural spraying. The method supports non-uniform, priority-aware resource allocation based on infestation intensity, reducing unnecessary chemical application. UAVs are modeled as a linear time-varying (LTV) system to capture variations in mass and inertia during spraying missions. The D2OC control law, derived using Lagrangian mechanics, enables efficient coordination, balanced workload distribution, and improved mission duration. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms uniform spraying and Spectral Multiscale Coverage (SMC) in coverage efficiency, chemical reduction, and operational sustainability, providing a scalable solution for smart agriculture.</description>

      <title>On hyperexponential stabilization of a chain of integrators in continuous and discrete time subject to unmatched perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recursive time-varying state feedback is presented for a chain of integrators with unmatched perturbations in continuous and discrete time. In continuous time, it is shown that hyperexponential convergence is achieved for the first state variable \(x_1\), while the second state \(x_2\) remains bounded. For the other states, we establish ISS {\cb property} by saturating the growing {\cb control} gain. In discrete time, we use implicit Euler discretization to {\cb preserve} hyperexponential convergence. The main results are demonstrated through several examples of the proposed control laws, illustrating the conditions established for both continuous and discrete-time systems.</description>

      <title>On two-degrees-of-freedom agreement protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a distributed two-degrees-of-freedom (2DOF) architecture for driving autonomous, possibly heterogeneous, agents to agreement. The scheme mirrors classical servo structures, separating local feedback from network filtering. This separation enables independent network-filter design for prescribed noise attenuation and allows controller heterogeneity to reject local disturbances, including disturbances exciting unstable agreement poles -- which is known to be impossible via standard diffusive couplings. The potential of the framework is illustrated via two numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Visibility-aware Satellite Selection and Resource Allocation in Multi-Orbit LEO Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi orbit low earth orbit (LEO) satellites communication is envisioned as a key infrastructure to deliver global coverage, enabling future services from space air ground integrated networks.However, the optimized design of LEO which jointly addresses satellite selection, association control, and resource scheduling while accounting for dynamic visibility in multi orbit constellations still remains open. Satellites moving along distinct orbital planes yield phase shifted ground tracks and heterogeneous, time varying coverage patterns that significantly complicate the optimization.To bridge the gap, we propose a dynamic visibility aware multi orbit satellite selection framework which can determine the optimal serving satellites across orbital layers. The framework is built upon Markov approximation and matching game theory. Specifically, we formulate a combinatorial optimization problem that maximizes the sum rate under per satellite power budgets. The problem is NP hard , combining discrete user association (UA) decisions with continuous power allocation, and an inherently non convex sum rate maximization objective. We address it through a problem specific Markov approximation. Moreover, we alternately solve UA or bandwidth allocation via a matching game and power allocation via a Lagrangian dual program, which together form a block coordinate descent method tailored to this problem. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm converges to a suboptimal solution across all scenarios. Extensive experiments against four state of the art baselines further demonstrate that our algorithm achieves, on average, approximately 7.85% higher sum rate than the best performing baseline.</description>

      <title>Density-Driven Optimal Control for Non-Uniform Area Coverage in Decentralized Multi-Agent Systems Using Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the fundamental problem of non-uniform area coverage in multi-agent systems, where different regions require varying levels of attention due to mission-dependent priorities. Existing uniform coverage strategies are insufficient for realistic applications, and many non-uniform approaches either lack optimality guarantees or fail to incorporate crucial real-world constraints such as agent dynamics, limited operation time, the number of agents, and decentralized execution.
  To resolve these limitations, we propose a novel framework called Density-Driven Optimal Control (D2OC). The central idea of D2OC is the integration of optimal transport theory with multi-agent coverage control, enabling each agent to continuously adjust its trajectory to match a mission-specific reference density map. The proposed formulation establishes optimality by solving a constrained optimization problem that explicitly incorporates physical and operational constraints. The resulting control input is analytically derived from the Lagrangian of the objective function, yielding closed-form optimal solutions for linear systems and a generalizable structure for nonlinear systems. Furthermore, a decentralized data-sharing mechanism is developed to coordinate agents without reliance on global information.
  Comprehensive simulation studies demonstrate that D2OC achieves significantly improved non-uniform area coverage performance compared to existing methods, while maintaining scalability and decentralized implementability.</description>

      <title>On Boundedness of Quadratic Dynamics with Energy-Preserving Nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boundedness is an important property of many physical systems. This includes incompressible fluid flows, which are often modeled by quadratic dynamics with an energy-preserving nonlinearity. For such systems, Schlegel and Noack proposed a sufficient condition for boundedness utilizing quadratic Lyapunov functions. They also propose a necessary condition for boundedness aiming to provide a more complete characterization of boundedness in this class of models. The sufficient condition is based on Lyapunov theory and is true. Our paper focuses on this necessary condition. We use an independent proof to show that the condition is true for two dimensional systems. However, we provide a three dimensional counterexample to illustrate that the necessary condition fails to hold in higher dimensions. Our results highlight a theoretical gap in boundedness analysis and suggest future directions to address the conservatism.</description>

      <title>Discrete-Time Stability Analysis of ReLU Feedback Systems via Integral Quadratic Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analyzes internal stability of a discrete-time feedback system with a ReLU nonlinearity. This feedback system is motivated by recurrent neural networks. We first review existing static quadratic constraints (QCs) for slope-restricted nonlinearities. Next, we derive hard integral quadratic constraints (IQCs) for scalar ReLU by using finite impulse filters and structured matrices. These IQCs are combined with a dissipation inequality leading to an LMI condition that certifies internal stability. We show that our new dynamic IQCs for ReLU are a superset of the well-known Zames-Falb IQCs specified for slope-restricted nonlinearities. Numerical results show that the proposed hard IQCs give less conservative stability margins than Zames-Falb multipliers and prior static QC methods, sometimes dramatically so.</description>

      <title>Green Emergency Communications in RIS- and MA-Assisted Multi-UAV SAGINs: A Partially Observable Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In post-disaster space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGINs), terrestrial infrastructure is often impaired, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) must rapidly restore connectivity for mission-critical ground terminals in cluttered non-line-of-sight (NLoS) urban environments. To enhance coverage, UAVs employ movable antennas (MAs), while reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) on surviving high-rises redirect signals. The key challenge is communication-limited partial observability, leaving each UAV with a narrow, fast-changing neighborhood view that destabilizes value estimation. Existing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches are inadequate--non-communication methods rely on unavailable global critics, heuristic sharing is brittle and redundant, and learnable protocols (e.g., CommNet, DIAL) lose per-neighbor structure and aggravate non-stationarity under tight bandwidth. To address partial observability, we propose a spatiotemporal A2C where each UAV transmits prior-decision messages with local state, a compact policy fingerprint, and a recurrent belief, encoded per neighbor and concatenated. A spatial discount shapes value targets to emphasize local interactions, while analysis under one-hop-per-slot latency explains stable training with delayed views. Experimental results show our policy outperforms IA2C, ConseNet, FPrint, DIAL, and CommNet--achieving faster convergence, higher asymptotic reward, reduced Temporal-Difference(TD)/advantage errors, and a better communication throughput-energy trade-off.</description>

      <title>Wide-Area Feedback Control for Renewables-Heavy Power Systems: A Comparative Study of Reinforcement Learning and Lyapunov-Based Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As renewable energy sources become more prevalent, accurately modeling power grid dynamics is becoming increasingly more complex. Concurrently, data acquisition and realtime system state monitoring are becoming more available for control centers. This motivates shifting from \textit{model- and Lyapunov-based} feedback controller designs toward \textit{model-free} ones. Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a key tool for designing model-free controllers. Various studies have been carried out to study voltage/frequency control strategies via RL. However, usually a simplified system model is used neglecting detailed dynamics of solar, wind, and composite loads -- and damping system-wide oscillations and modeling power flows are all usually ignored. To that end, we pose an optimal feedback control problem for a detailed renewables-heavy power system, defined by a set of nonlinear differential algebraic equations (NDAE). The control problem is solved using a completely model-free design via RL as well as using a model-based approach built upon the Lyapunov stability theory with guarantees. The paper in its essence seeks to explore whether data-driven feedback control should be used in power grids over its model-driven counterpart. Theoretical developments and thorough case studies are presented with an eye on this exploration. Finally, a detailed analysis is provided to delineate the strengths and weaknesses of both approaches for renewables-heavy grids.</description>

      <title>Cooperative ISAC for LAE: Joint Trajectory Planning, Power allocation, and Dynamic Time Division</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To enhance the performance of aerial-ground networks, this paper proposes an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) framework for multi-UAV systems. In our model, ground base stations (BSs) cooperatively serve multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and employ a time-division strategy in which beam scanning for sensing comes before data communication in each time slot. To maximize the sum communication rate while satisfying the total sensing mutual information (MI) requirement, we jointly optimize the UAV trajectories, communication and sensing power allocation, and the dynamic time-division ratio. The resulting non-convex optimization problem is efficiently solved using an alternating optimization (AO) framework. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed joint design significantly outperforms benchmark schemes with static or partially optimized resources. The findings also reveal the critical importance of dynamic trajectory and resource management for effectively navigating the sensing-communication trade-off, especially under stringent power or sensing constraints.</description>

      <title>An Online Multiobjective Policy Gradient for Long-run Average-reward Markov Decision Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for multi-objective decision-making, where the agent seeks to optimize a vector of rewards rather than a single scalar value. The objective is to ensure that the time-averaged reward vector converges asymptotically to a predefined target set. Since standard RL algorithms operate on scalar rewards, we introduce a dynamic scalarization mechanism guided by Blackwell's Approachability Theorem. This theorem enables adaptive updates of the scalarization vector to guarantee convergence toward the target set. Assuming ergodicity, the Markov chain induced by the learned policies admits a stationary distribution, ensuring all states recur with finite return times. Our algorithm exploits this property by defining an inner loop that applies a policy gradient method (with baseline) between successive visits to a designated recurrent state, enforcing Blackwell's condition at each iteration. An outer loop then updates the scalarization vector after each recurrence. We establish theoretical convergence of the long-run average reward vector to the target set and validate the approach through a numerical example.</description>

      <title>Initial Excitation-based Adaptive Observers for Discrete-Time LTI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In practical applications, the efficacy of a control algorithm relies critically on the accurate knowledge of the parameters and states of the underlying system. However, obtaining these quantities in practice is often challenging. Adaptive observers address this issue by performing simultaneous state and parameter estimation using only input-output measurements. While many adaptive observer designs exist for continuous-time systems, their discrete-time counterparts remain relatively unexplored. This paper proposes an initial excitation (IE)-based adaptive observer for discrete-time linear time-invariant systems. In contrast to conventional designs that rely on the persistence of excitation condition, which requires continuous excitation and infinite control effort, the proposed method does not require excitation for infinite time, thus making it more practical for stabilization tasks. We employ a two-layer filtering structure and a normalized gradient descent-based update law for learning the unknown parameters. We also propose modifying the regressors to enhance information extraction, leading to faster convergence. Rigorous theoretical analysis guarantees bounded and exponentially converging estimates of both states and parameters under the IE condition, and simulation results validate the efficacy of the proposed design.</description>

      <title>Carbon Reduction Potential and Sensitivity Analysis of Rural Integrated Energy System with Carbon Trading and Coordinated Electric-Thermal Demand Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constructing clean and low-carbon rural integrated energy system (RIES) is a fundamental requirement for supporting China's rural modernization and new-type urbanization. Existing research on RIES decarbonization primarily focuses on the optimal low-carbon operation of system-level energy devices at the macro level, while the synergistic carbon-reduction effects of demand-side flexible loads and external carbon trading mechanisms have not been fully explored. Meanwhile, at the micro level, the carbon sensitivity of device parameters and their potential contribution to emission reduction remain insufficiently investigated. To address these gaps, this study integrates macro- and micro-level analyses. At the macro level, a multi-energy-coupled low-carbon optimal operation framework is developed, incorporating coordinated electric-thermal demand response (DR) and carbon trading. At the micro level, a carbon emission model for RIES components is established, and sensitivity analysis is conducted on 28 carbon-related parameters to identify highly sensitive determinants of emission reduction. Case studies based on typical operation data from a rural region in northern China demonstrate that coordinated electric-thermal DR and carbon trading can achieve maximum carbon-reduction potential. Furthermore, the identified high-sensitivity parameters provide essential theoretical guidance for enhancing the decarbonization potential of RIES.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Review of Advancements in Powering and Charging Systems for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or drones have witnessed a spectacular surge in applications for military, commercial, and civilian purposes. However, their potential for flight is always limited by the finite power budget of their onboard power supplies. The limited flight time problem has led to intensive research into new sources of power and innovative charging strategies to enable protracted, autonomous flight. This paper gives a comparative summary of the current state-of-the-art in UAV power and refuelling technology. The paper begins with an analysis of the variety of energy sources, from classical batteries to fuel cells and hybrid systems, based on their relative advantages and disadvantages in energy density, weight, and safety. Subsequently, the review explores a spectrum of replenishment options, from simple manual battery swapping to sophisticated high-tech automatic docking stations and smart contact-based charging pads. Most of the review is dedicated to the newer technology of wireless power transfer, which involves near-field (inductive, capacitive) and far-field (laser, microwave) technology. The article also delves into the most important power electronic converter topologies, battery management systems, and control approaches that form the core of these charging systems. Finally, it recapitulates the most significant challenges in technical, economic, and social aspects for promising avenues of future research. The comprehensive review is a valuable guide for researchers, engineers, and policymakers striving to enhance UAV operational performance.</description>

      <title>Cyber-Resilient Fault Diagnosis Methodology in Inverter-Based Resource-Dominated Microgrids with Single-Point Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyber-attacks jeopardize the safe operation of inverter-based resource-dominated microgrids (IBR-dominated microgrids). At the same time, existing diagnostic methods either depend on expensive multi-point instrumentation or stringent modeling assumptions that are untenable under single-point measurement constraints. This paper proposes a Fractional-Order Memory-Enhanced Attack-Diagnosis Scheme (FO-MADS) that achieves timely fault localization and cyber-resilient fault diagnosis using only one VPQ (voltage, active power, reactive power) measurement point. FO-MADS first constructs a dual fractional-order feature library by jointly applying Caputo and Gr\"unwald-Letnikov derivatives, thereby amplifying micro-perturbations and slow drifts in the VPQ signal. A two-stage hierarchical classifier then pinpoints the affected inverter and isolates the faulty IGBT switch, effectively alleviating class imbalance. Robustness is further strengthened through Progressive Memory-Replay Adversarial Training (PMR-AT), whose attack-aware loss is dynamically re-weighted via Online Hard Example Mining (OHEM) to prioritize the most challenging samples. Experiments on a four-inverter IBR-dominated microgrid testbed comprising 1 normal and 24 fault classes under four attack scenarios demonstrate diagnostic accuracies of 96.6% (bias), 94.0% (noise), 92.8% (data replacement), and 95.7% (replay), while sustaining 96.7% under attack-free conditions. These results establish FO-MADS as a cost-effective and readily deployable solution that markedly enhances the cyber-physical resilience of IBR-dominated microgrids.</description>

      <title>Event-Triggered Regulation of Mixed-Autonomy Traffic Under Varying Traffic Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling and congestion mitigation of mixed-autonomy traffic systems consisting of human-driven vehicles (HVs) and autonomous vehicles (AVs) have become increasingly critical with the rapid development of autonomous driving technology. This paper develops an event-triggered control (ETC) framework for mitigating congestion in such systems, which are modeled using an extended Aw-Rascle-Zhang (ARZ) formulation consisting of coupled 4 x 4 hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs). Ramp metering is employed as the boundary actuation mechanism. To reduce computational and communication burdens while avoiding excessive ramp signal changes, we design the ETC strategy based on the backstepping method, together with an observer-based ETC formulation for practical implementation under limited sensing. Rigorous Lyapunov analysis ensures exponential convergence and avoidance of Zeno behavior. Extensive simulations validate the proposed approach under diverse traffic scenarios, including varying AV penetration rates, different spacing policies, multiple demand levels, and non-recurrent congestion patterns. Results show that ETC not only stabilizes mixed traffic flows but also significantly reduces control updates, improving driver comfort, and roadway safety. Higher AV penetration rates lead to longer release time and fewer triggering events, indicating the positive impact of AVs in mitigating traffic congestion while reducing computational resource usage. Compared to continuous backstepping controllers, the proposed ETC achieves near-equivalent stabilization performance with far fewer controller updates, resulting in longer signal release time that reduces driver distraction, which demonstrates great potential for ETC applications in traffic management.</description>

      <title>Robust Control Design Using a Hybrid-Gain Finite-Time Sliding-Mode Controller</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a hybrid-gain finite-time sliding-mode control (HG-FTSMC) strategy for a class of perturbed nonlinear systems. The controller combines a finite-time reaching law that drives the sliding variable to a predefined boundary layer with an inner mixed-power or exponential law that guarantees rapid convergence within the layer while maintaining smooth and bounded control action. The resulting control design achieves finite-time convergence and robustness to matched disturbances, while explicitly limits the control effort. The control framework is first analyzed on a perturbed first-order integrator model, and then extended to Euler-Lagrange (EL) systems, representing a broad class of robotic and mechanical systems. Comparative simulations demonstrate that the proposed controller achieves settling times comparable to recent finite-time approaches [1], while substantially reducing the control effort. Finally, trajectory-tracking simulations on a two-link manipulator further validate the robustness and practical feasibility of the proposed HG-FTSMC approach.</description>

      <title>Beyond Energy Functions and Numerical Integration: A New Methodology to Determine Transient Stability at the Initial State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for transient stability analysis (TSA) that circumvents the limitations of sequential numerical integration and energy functions. The proposed method begins by constructing a trajectory-dependent stability indicator function to distinguish the system's destiny. To overcome the difficulty in analyzing the asymptotic behavior at infinite time, a strategic time contraction mapping is then applied. This allows TSA to be recast as a pole-placement detection problem for the indicator function. By leveraging high-order derivatives at the initial state, a rational function approximation is derived, yielding a mathematically direct and computationally efficient prediction. Numerical validations on benchmark systems demonstrate that the method not only provides a direct mathematical shortcut for TSA in power systems but also establishes a promising new methodology for evaluating the transient stability of a broad class of nonlinear dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Event-triggered Dual Gradient Tracking for Distributed Resource Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High communication costs create a major bottleneck for distributed resource allocation over unbalanced directed networks. Conventional dual gradient tracking methods, while effective for problems on unbalanced digraphs, rely on periodic communication that creates significant overhead in resource-constrained networks. This paper introduces a novel event-triggered dual gradient tracking algorithm to mitigate this limitation, wherein agents communicate only when local state deviations surpass a predefined threshold. We establish comprehensive convergence guarantees for this approach. First, we prove sublinear convergence for non-convex dual objectives and linear convergence under the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz condition. Building on this, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves sublinear convergence for general strongly convex cost functions and linear convergence for those that are also Lipschitz-smooth. Numerical experiments confirm that our event-triggered method significantly reduces communication events compared to periodic schemes while preserving comparable convergence performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrical isolation is critical to ensure safety and minimize electromagnetic interference (EMI), yet existing methods struggle to simultaneously transmit power and signals through a unified channel. Here we demonstrate a mechanically-isolated gate driver based on microwave-frequency surface acoustic wave (SAW) device on lithium niobate that achieves galvanic isolation of 2.75 kV with ultralow isolation capacitance (0.032 pF) over 1.25 mm mechanical propagation length, delivering 13.4 V open-circuit voltage and 44.4 mA short-circuit current. We demonstrate isolated gate driving for a gallium nitride (GaN) high-electron-mobility transistor, achieving a turn-on time of 108.8 ns comparable to commercial drivers and validate its operation in a buck converter. In addition, our SAW device operates over an ultrawide temperature range from 0.5 K (-272.6 {\deg}C) to 544 K (271 {\deg}C). The microwave-frequency SAW devices offer inherent EMI immunity and potential for heterogeneous integration on multiple semiconductor platforms, enabling compact, high-performance isolated power and signal transmission in advanced power electronics.</description>

      <title>High-resolution hierarchical PV system performance modeling in urban environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate performance modeling of PV systems in urban environments is a significant challenge due to complex partial shading. This study introduces a high-resolution, hierarchical modeling framework that provides detailed insights from the solar cell to the system level. Rigorously validated against field-test data from calibrated equipment, the model demonstrates high accuracy in predicting minute-wised dynamic electrical characteristics (R2 &gt; 0.90). A key finding is the critical shortcoming of conventional, coarser-resolution models under realistic shading; these are shown to overestimate the actual string operating power by up to 163% and the monthly energy yield by up to 54%. The proposed framework avoids these errors by precisely capturing mismatch losses and the time-varying phenomena of system components, such as bypass diode activations. Furthermore, the model accurately quantifies the effectiveness of mitigation technologies, showing that Module-Level Power Electronics (MLPEs) can increase the monthly energy yield of a heavily shaded string by over 20%. This research provides a crucial tool for reliable system design, accurate power forecasting, and the optimization of PV systems in complex urban settings.</description>

      <title>Handover-Aware URLLC UAV Trajectory Planning: A Continuous-Time Trajectory Optimization via Graphs of Convex Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) which aims to fly between two predetermined locations while maintaining ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) for command-and-control (C2) links with terrestrial base stations (BSs). Long-range flights often trigger frequent inter-cell handovers, which may introduce delays and synchronization overhead. We jointly optimize the continuous trajectory and BS association to minimize handovers, path length, and flying time, subject to communication reliability and kinematic constraints. To address this problem, we reformulate it as an optimization based on the graph of convex sets (GCS). First, the URLLC requirement is translated into spatially feasible regions in the flight plane for each BS. And an intersection graph is constructed including the start and goal points. Each graph node is associated with a smooth and dynamically feasible trajectory segment. The trajectory is parameterized in space by B\'ezier curves and in time by a monotonic B\'ezier scaling, together with convex constraints that ensure continuity and enforce speed bounds. Next, we impose unit-flow constraints to enforce a single path, and by coupling the resulting binary edge-selection variables with the convex constraints, we obtain a mixed-integer convex program (MICP). Applying a convex relaxation and rounding to the mixed-integer convex program produces nearly globally optimal routes, and a final refinement yields smooth, dynamically feasible trajectories. Simulations verify that the method preserves URLLC connectivity while achieving a clear trade-off between fewer handovers and flight efficiency.</description>

      <title>The Liquid Buffer: Multi-Year Storage for Defossilization and Energy Security under Climate Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The climate-driven uncertainty of renewable generation and electricity demand challenges energy security in net-zero energy systems. By introducing a scalable stochastic model that implicitly accounts for 51'840 climate years, this paper identifies multi-year storage of liquid hydrocarbons as a key option for managing climate uncertainty and ensuring energy security. In Europe, multi-year storage reduces system costs by 4.1%, fossil imports by 86%, and curtailment by 60%. The benefit of multi-year storage is that a renewable surplus in one year is not curtailed but converted to synthetic oil, with hydrogen as an intermediate product, and stored to balance a future deficit. We find that the required energy capacity for liquid hydrocarbons is 525 TWh, a quarter of the European Union's current oil and gas reserves, complemented by 116 TWh for hydrogen storage. Security of supply remains high and unserved energy only amounts to 0.0035 per thousand, well below the common target of 0.02 per thousand.</description>

      <title>On the controller form for linear hyperbolic MIMO systems with dynamic boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This contribution develops an algebraic approach to obtain a controller form for a class of linear hyperbolic MIMO systems, bidirectionally coupled with a linear ODE system at the unactuated boundary. After a short summary of established controller forms for SISO and MIMO ODE as well as SISO hyperbolic PDE systems, it is shown that the direct ap- proach to state a controller form fails already for a very simple MIMO example. Next, a generalised hyperbolic controller form with different variants is proposed and a new flatnesss-based scheme to compute said form is presented. Therein, the system is treated in an algebraic setting where generalised polynomials with real exponents are used to describe the predictions and delays in the system. The proposed algorithm is then applied to the motivating example.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Acceleration of MPC with Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a powerful framework for optimal control but can be too slow for low-latency applications. We present a data-driven framework to accelerate MPC by replacing online optimization with a nonparametric policy constructed from offline MPC solutions. Our policy is greedy with respect to a constructed upper bound on the optimal cost-to-go, and can be implemented as a nonparametric lookup rule that is orders of magnitude faster than solving MPC online. Our analysis shows that under sufficient coverage condition of the offline data, the policy is recursively feasible and admits provable, bounded optimality gap. These conditions establish an explicit trade-off between the amount of data collected and the tightness of the bounds. Our experiments show that this policy is between 100 and 1000 times faster than standard MPC, with only a modest hit to optimality, showing potential for real-time control tasks.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Nonlinear Output Regulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13595v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work addresses the full-information output regulation problem for nonlinear systems, assuming the states of both the plant and the exosystem are known. In this setting, perfect tracking or rejection is achieved by constructing a zero-regulation-error manifold $\pi(w)$ and a feedforward input $c(w)$ that render such manifold invariant. The pair $(\pi(w), c(w))$ is characterized by the regulator equations, i.e., a system of PDEs with an algebraic constraint. We focus on accurately solving the regulator equations introducing a physics-informed neural network (PINN) approach that directly approximates $\pi(w)$ and $c(w)$ by minimizing the residuals under boundary and feasibility conditions, without requiring precomputed trajectories or labeled data. The learned operator maps exosystem states to steady state plant states and inputs, enables real-time inference and, critically, generalizes across families of the exosystem with varying initial conditions and parameters. The framework is validated on a regulation task that synchronizes a helicopter's vertical dynamics with a harmonically oscillating platform. The resulting PINN-based solver reconstructs the zero-error manifold with high fidelity and sustains regulation performance under exosystem variations, highlighting the potential of learning-enabled solvers for nonlinear output regulation. The proposed approach is broadly applicable to nonlinear systems that admit a solution to the output regulation problem.</description>

      <title>Scalable Iterative Algorithm for Solving Optimal Transmission Switching with De-energization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transmission System Operators routinely use transmission switching as a tool to manage congestion and ensure system security. Motivated by sub-transmission operations at RTE, this paper considers the Optimal Transmission Switching with De-energization (OTSD), which captures potential loss of connectivity (and therefore localized blackout) following loss of transmission elements. While directly relevant to real-life operations, this problem has received very little attention in the literature. The paper proposes a new mixed-integer linear programming formulation for OTSD that represents post-contingency loss of connectivity without requiring additional binary variables. This new formulation provides the foundation for a fast, iterative heuristic algorithm. Computational experiments confirms that state-of-the-art optimization solvers struggle to solve the extensive formulation of OTSD, often failing to find even trivial solutions within reasonable time. In contrast, numerical results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed heuristic, which finds high-quality feasible solutions 100-1000x faster than using Gurobi.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces a Ramanujan inner product and its corresponding norm, establishing a novel framework for the stability analysis of hybrid and discrete-time systems as an alternative to traditional Euclidean metrics. We establish new $\epsilon$-$\delta$ stability conditions that utilize the unique properties of Ramanujan summations and their relationship with number-theoretic concepts. The proposed approach provides enhanced robustness guarantees and reveals fundamental connections between system stability and arithmetic properties of the system dynamics. Theoretical results are rigorously proven, and simulation results on numerical examples are presented to validate the efficacy of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Resilient Distribution Network Planning against Dynamic Malicious Power Injection Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active distribution networks facilitating bidirectional power exchange with renewable energy resources are susceptible to cyberattacks due to integration of a diverse array of cyber components. This study introduces a grid-level defense strategy aimed at enhancing attack resiliency based on distribution network planning. Our proposed framework imposes a security requirement into existing planning methodologies, ensuring that voltage deviation from its rated value remains within a tolerable range against dynamically and maliciously injected power at end-user nodes. Unfortunately, the formulated problem in its original form is intractable because it is an infinite-dimensional bi-level optimization problem over a function space. To address this complexity, we develop an equivalent transformation into a tractable form as mixed-integer linear program leveraging linear dynamical system theory and graph theory. Notably, our investigation reveals that the severity of potential attacks hinges solely on the cumulative reactances over the path from the substation to the targeted node, thereby reducing the problem to a finite-dimensional problem. Further, the bi-level optimization problem is reduced to a single-level optimization problem by using a technique utilized in solving the shortest path problem. Through extensive numerical simulations conducted on a 54-node distribution network benchmark, our proposed methodology exhibits a noteworthy 29.3% enhancement in the resiliency, with a mere 2.1% uptick in the economic cost.</description>

      <title>Fast 3D Surrogate Modeling for Data Center Thermal Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reducing energy consumption and carbon emissions in data centers by enabling real-time temperature prediction is critical for sustainability and operational efficiency. Achieving this requires accurate modeling of the 3D temperature field to capture airflow dynamics and thermal interactions under varying operating conditions. Traditional thermal CFD solvers, while accurate, are computationally expensive and require expert-crafted meshes and boundary conditions, making them impractical for real-time use. To address these limitations, we develop a vision-based surrogate modeling framework that operates directly on a 3D voxelized representation of the data center, incorporating server workloads, fan speeds, and HVAC temperature set points. We evaluate multiple architectures, including 3D CNN U-Net variants, a 3D Fourier Neural Operator, and 3D vision transformers, to map these thermal inputs to high-fidelity heat maps. Our results show that the surrogate models generalize across data center configurations and achieve up to 20,000x speedup (hundreds of milliseconds vs. hours). This fast and accurate estimation of hot spots and temperature distribution enables real-time cooling control and workload redistribution, leading to substantial energy savings (7\%) and reduced carbon footprint.</description>

      <title>Lessons Learned from Developing a Privacy-Preserving Multimodal Wearable for Local Voice-and-Vision Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many promising applications of multimodal wearables require continuous sensing and heavy computation, yet users reject such devices due to privacy concerns. This paper shares our experiences building an ear-mounted voice-and-vision wearable that performs local AI inference using a paired smartphone as a trusted personal edge. We describe the hardware--software co-design of this privacy-preserving system, including challenges in integrating a camera, microphone, and speaker within a 30-gram form factor, enabling wake word-triggered capture, and running quantized vision-language and large-language models entirely offline. Through iterative prototyping, we identify key design hurdles in power budgeting, connectivity, latency, and social acceptability. Our initial evaluation shows that fully local multimodal inference is feasible on commodity mobile hardware with interactive latency. We conclude with design lessons for researchers developing embedded AI systems that balance privacy, responsiveness, and usability in everyday settings.</description>

      <title>SBAMP: Sampling Based Adaptive Motion Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous robotic systems must navigate complex, dynamic environments in real time, often facing unpredictable obstacles and rapidly changing conditions. Traditional sampling-based methods, such as RRT*, excel at generating collision-free paths but struggle to adapt to sudden changes without extensive replanning. Conversely, learning-based dynamical systems, such as the Stable Estimator of Dynamical Systems (SEDS), offer smooth, adaptive trajectory tracking but typically rely on pre-collected demonstration data, limiting their generalization to novel scenarios. This paper introduces Sampling-Based Adaptive Motion Planning (SBAMP), a novel framework that overcomes these limitations by integrating RRT* for global path planning with a SEDS-based local controller for continuous, adaptive trajectory adjustment. Our approach requires no pre-trained datasets and ensures smooth transitions between planned waypoints, maintaining stability through Lyapunov-based guarantees. We validate SBAMP in both simulated environments and real hardware using the RoboRacer platform, demonstrating superior performance in dynamic obstacle scenarios, rapid recovery from perturbations, and robust handling of sharp turns. Experimental results highlight SBAMP's ability to adapt in real time without sacrificing global path optimality, providing a scalable solution for dynamic, unstructured environments.</description>

      <title>Fusion-ResNet: A Lightweight multi-label NILM Model Using PCA-ICA Feature Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) is an advanced load monitoring technique that uses data-driven algorithms to disaggregate the total power consumption of a household into the consumption of individual appliances. However, real-world NILM deployment still faces major challenges, including overfitting, low model generalization, and disaggregating a large number of appliances operating at the same time. To address these challenges, this work proposes an end-to-end framework for the NILM classification task, which consists of high-frequency labeled data, a feature extraction method, and a lightweight neural network. Within this framework, we introduce a novel feature extraction method that fuses Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) features. Moreover, we propose a lightweight architecture for multi-label NILM classification (Fusion-ResNet). The proposed feature-based model achieves a higher $F1$ score on average and across different appliances compared to state-of-the-art NILM classifiers while minimizing the training and inference time. Finally, we assessed the performance of our model against baselines with a varying number of simultaneously active devices. Results demonstrate that Fusion-ResNet is relatively robust to stress conditions with up to 15 concurrently active appliances.</description>

      <title>Novel Multi-objective Switched Model Predictive Control with Feasibility and Stability Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the relevance of control systems capable of dealing with multiple objectives rises (e.g. being economic while maintaining a certain performance), multi-objective Switched Model Predictive Control combines all the advantages of Model Predictive Control while dealing with multiple objectives. We propose two novel frameworks, a nominal and a robust framework to guarantee recursive feasibility of each Model Predictive Controller under arbitrary switching and assure asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system applying the nominal framework and Input-to-State stability using the robust framework. The presented frameworks employ methods from switched systems, enabling the utilization of a supervisor control instance which allows for complex objectives and multi-objective control. Our numerical example confirms the superior performance of our proposed frameworks compared to a standard Model Predictive Control approach.</description>

      <title>SCI: An Equilibrium for Signal Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present SCI, a closed-loop, control-theoretic framework that models interpretability as a regulated state. SCI formalizes the interpretive error Delta SP and actively drives SP(t) in [0, 1] ("Surgical Precision") toward a target via a projected update on the parameters Theta under a human-gain budget. The framework operates through three coordinated components: (1) reliability-weighted, multiscale features P(t, s); (2) a knowledge-guided interpreter psi_Theta that emits traceable markers and rationales; and (3) a Lyapunov-guided controller equipped with rollback, trust-region safeguards, and a descent condition. Across biomedical (EEG/ECG/ICU), industrial (bearings/tool wear), and environmental (climate/seismic) domains, SCI reduces interpretive error by 25-42% (mean 38%, 95% confidence interval 22-43%) relative to static explainers while maintaining AUC/F1 within approximately 1-2 percentage points of baseline. SCI also reduces SP variance from 0.030 to 0.011, indicating substantially more stable explanations. Modeling interpretability as a control objective yields steadier, faster-recovering, and more trustworthy interpretive behavior across diverse signal regimes.</description>

      <title>SAC-MoE: Reinforcement Learning with Mixture-of-Experts for Control of Hybrid Dynamical Systems with Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybrid dynamical systems result from the interaction of continuous-variable dynamics with discrete events and encompass various systems such as legged robots, vehicles and aircrafts. Challenges arise when the system's modes are characterized by unobservable (latent) parameters and the events that cause system dynamics to switch between different modes are also unobservable. Model-based control approaches typically do not account for such uncertainty in the hybrid dynamics, while standard model-free RL methods fail to account for abrupt mode switches, leading to poor generalization.
  To overcome this, we propose SAC-MoE which models the actor of the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) framework as a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with a learned router that adaptively selects among learned experts. To further improve robustness, we develop a curriculum-based training algorithm to prioritize data collection in challenging settings, allowing better generalization to unseen modes and switching locations. Simulation studies in hybrid autonomous racing and legged locomotion tasks show that SAC-MoE outperforms baselines (up to 6x) in zero-shot generalization to unseen environments. Our curriculum strategy consistently improves performance across all evaluated policies. Qualitative analysis shows that the interpretable MoE router activates different experts for distinct latent modes.</description>

      <title>Learning to Control Misinformation: a Closed-loop Approach for Misinformation Mitigation over Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern social networks rely on recommender systems that inadvertently amplify misinformation by prioritizing engagement over content veracity. We present a control framework that mitigates misinformation spread while maintaining user engagement by penalizing content characteristics commonly exploited by false information, specifically, extreme negative sentiment and novelty. We extend the closed-loop Friedkin-Johnsen model to incorporate the mitigation of misinformation together with the maximization of user engagement. Both model-free and model-based control strategies demonstrate up to 76% reduction in misinformation propagation across diverse network configurations, validated through simulations using the LIAR2 dataset with sentiment features extracted via large language models. Analysis of engagement-misinformation trade-offs reveals that in networks with radical users, median engagement improves even as misinformation decreases, suggesting content moderation enhances discourse quality for non-extremist users. The framework provides practical guidance for platform operators in balancing misinformation suppression with engagement objectives.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic Regret and Polynomial Scaling in Online Multi-step-ahead Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This letter studies the problem of online multi-step-ahead prediction for unknown linear stochastic systems. Using conditional distribution theory, we derive an optimal parameterization of the prediction policy as a linear function of future inputs, past inputs, and past outputs. Based on this characterization, we propose an online least-squares algorithm to learn the policy and analyze its regret relative to the optimal model-based predictor. We show that the online algorithm achieves logarithmic regret with respect to the optimal Kalman filter in the multi-step setting. Furthermore, with new proof techniques, we establish an almost-sure regret bound that does not rely on fixed failure probabilities for sufficiently large horizons $N$. Finally, our analysis also reveals that, while the regret remains logarithmic in $N$, its constant factor grows polynomially with the prediction horizon $H$, with the polynomial order set by the largest Jordan block of eigenvalue 1 in the system matrix.</description>

      <title>PID-controlled Langevin Dynamics for Faster Sampling of Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Langevin dynamics sampling suffers from extremely low generation speed, fundamentally limited by numerous fine-grained iterations to converge to the target distribution. We introduce PID-controlled Langevin Dynamics (PIDLD), a novel sampling acceleration algorithm that reinterprets the sampling process using control-theoretic principles. By treating energy gradients as feedback signals, PIDLD combines historical gradients (the integral term) and gradient trends (the derivative term) to efficiently traverse energy landscapes and adaptively stabilize, thereby significantly reducing the number of iterations required to produce high-quality samples. Our approach requires no additional training, datasets, or prior information, making it immediately integrable with any Langevin-based method. Extensive experiments across image generation and reasoning tasks demonstrate that PIDLD achieves higher quality with fewer steps, making Langevin-based generative models more practical for efficiency-critical applications. The implementation can be found at \href{https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/PIDLD}{https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/PIDLD}.</description>

      <title>Task-Aware Morphology Optimization of Planar Manipulators via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, Yoshikawa's manipulability index is used to investigate reinforcement learning (RL) as a framework for morphology optimization in planar robotic manipulators. A 2R manipulator tracking a circular end-effector path is first examined because this case has a known analytical optimum: equal link lengths and the second joint orthogonal to the first. This serves as a validation step to test whether RL can rediscover the optimum using reward feedback alone, without access to the manipulability expression or the Jacobian. Three RL algorithms (SAC, DDPG, and PPO) are compared with grid search and black-box optimizers, with morphology represented by a single action parameter phi that maps to the link lengths. All methods converge to the analytical solution, showing that numerical recovery of the optimum is possible without supplying analytical structure.
  Most morphology design tasks have no closed-form solutions, and grid or heuristic search becomes expensive as dimensionality increases. RL is therefore explored as a scalable alternative. The formulation used for the circular path is extended to elliptical and rectangular paths by expanding the action space to the full morphology vector (L1, L2, theta2). In these non-analytical settings, RL continues to converge reliably, whereas grid and black-box methods require far larger evaluation budgets. These results indicate that RL is effective for both recovering known optima and solving morphology optimization problems without analytical solutions.</description>

Abstract: To study resilience with real data, it is necessary to group the individual outages recorded by utilities into events in which the outages bunch up and overlap due to extreme weather. We show how to automatically group utility outage data into resilience events based on their time and location. The methods work with both detailed utility outage data and EAGLE-I data.</description>

      <title>From Black-Box to White-Box: Control-Theoretic Neural Network Interpretability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks achieve state of the art performance but remain difficult to interpret mechanistically. In this work, we propose a control theoretic framework that treats a trained neural network as a nonlinear state space system and uses local linearization, controllability and observability Gramians, and Hankel singular values to analyze its internal computation. For a given input, we linearize the network around the corresponding hidden activation pattern and construct a state space model whose state consists of hidden neuron activations. The input state and state output Jacobians define local controllability and observability Gramians, from which we compute Hankel singular values and associated modes. These quantities provide a principled notion of neuron and pathway importance: controllability measures how easily each neuron can be excited by input perturbations, observability measures how strongly each neuron influences the output, and Hankel singular values rank internal modes that carry input output energy. We illustrate the framework on simple feedforward networks, including a 1 2 2 1 SwiGLU network and a 2 3 3 2 GELU network. By comparing different operating points, we show how activation saturation reduces controllability, shrinks the dominant Hankel singular value, and shifts the dominant internal mode to a different subset of neurons. The proposed method turns a neural network into a collection of local white box dynamical models and suggests which internal directions are natural candidates for pruning or constraints to improve interpretability.</description>

      <title>Transformer-Based Scalable Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Networked Systems with Long-Range Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has shown promise for large-scale network control, yet existing methods face two major limitations. First, they typically rely on assumptions leading to decay properties of local agent interactions, limiting their ability to capture long-range dependencies such as cascading power failures or epidemic outbreaks. Second, most approaches lack generalizability across network topologies, requiring retraining when applied to new graphs. We introduce STACCA (Shared Transformer Actor-Critic with Counterfactual Advantage), a unified transformer-based MARL framework that addresses both challenges. STACCA employs a centralized Graph Transformer Critic to model long-range dependencies and provide system-level feedback, while its shared Graph Transformer Actor learns a generalizable policy capable of adapting across diverse network structures. Further, to improve credit assignment during training, STACCA integrates a novel counterfactual advantage estimator that is compatible with state-value critic estimates. We evaluate STACCA on epidemic containment and rumor-spreading network control tasks, demonstrating improved performance, network generalization, and scalability. These results highlight the potential of transformer-based MARL architectures to achieve scalable and generalizable control in large-scale networked systems.</description>

      <title>Revealing POMDPs: Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis for Parity Objectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) are a central model for uncertainty in sequential decision making. The most basic objective is the reachability objective, where a target set must be eventually visited, and the more general parity objectives can model all omega-regular specifications. For such objectives, the computational analysis problems are the following: (a) qualitative analysis that asks whether the objective can be satisfied with probability 1 (almost-sure winning) or probability arbitrarily close to 1 (limit-sure winning); and (b) quantitative analysis that asks for the approximation of the optimal probability of satisfying the objective. For general POMDPs, almost-sure analysis for reachability objectives is EXPTIME-complete, but limit-sure and quantitative analyses for reachability objectives are undecidable; almost-sure, limit-sure, and quantitative analyses for parity objectives are all undecidable. A special class of POMDPs, called revealing POMDPs, has been studied recently in several works, and for this subclass the almost-sure analysis for parity objectives was shown to be EXPTIME-complete. In this work, we show that for revealing POMDPs the limit-sure analysis for parity objectives is EXPTIME-complete, and even the quantitative analysis for parity objectives can be achieved in EXPTIME.</description>

      <title>DiffFP: Learning Behaviors from Scratch via Diffusion-based Fictitious Play</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-play reinforcement learning has demonstrated significant success in learning complex strategic and interactive behaviors in competitive multi-agent games. However, achieving such behaviors in continuous decision spaces remains challenging. Ensuring adaptability and generalization in self-play settings is critical for achieving competitive performance in dynamic multi-agent environments. These challenges often cause methods to converge slowly or fail to converge at all to a Nash equilibrium, making agents vulnerable to strategic exploitation by unseen opponents. To address these challenges, we propose DiffFP, a fictitious play (FP) framework that estimates the best response to unseen opponents while learning a robust and multimodal behavioral policy. Specifically, we approximate the best response using a diffusion policy that leverages generative modeling to learn adaptive and diverse strategies. Through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that the proposed FP framework converges towards $\epsilon$-Nash equilibria in continuous- space zero-sum games. We validate our method on complex multi-agent environments, including racing and multi-particle zero-sum games. Simulation results show that the learned policies are robust against diverse opponents and outperform baseline reinforcement learning policies. Our approach achieves up to 3$\times$ faster convergence and 30$\times$ higher success rates on average against RL-based baselines, demonstrating its robustness to opponent strategies and stability across training iterations</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an integrated navigation framework for Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) that unifies environment representation, trajectory generation, and Model Predictive Control (MPC). The proposed approach incorporates a quadtree-based method to generate structured, axis-aligned collision-free regions from occupancy maps. These regions serve as both a basis for developing safe corridors and as linear constraints within the MPC formulation, enabling efficient and reliable navigation without requiring direct obstacle encoding. The complete pipeline combines safe-area extraction, connectivity graph construction, trajectory generation, and B-spline smoothing into one coherent system. Experimental results demonstrate consistent success and superior performance compared to baseline approaches across complex environments.</description>

Abstract: This article presents an analytical account of the capacity limits and operational challenges of the main airports in the S\~ao Paulo Macrometropolis. Drawing on international examples, such as London Heathrow, it discusses how large hubs combine high traffic generation with severe physical constraints, highlighting how saturation intensifies delays, operating costs, and pressures for expansion. It analyzes capacity scarcity as a central economic problem, in which runways, aprons, boarding gates, and terminals become critical resources whose use requires administrative and market mechanisms, including slot coordination, prioritization rules, and regulatory incentives. It discusses the limitations imposed by high earthmoving costs, environmental impacts, and expropriation costs, which restrict the physical expansion of central airports such as Congonhas and increase dependence on efficiency gains. Demand projections indicate that the combined capacity of Congonhas, Guarulhos, and Viracopos is likely to be exceeded, even in conservative scenarios, reinforcing the urgency of integrated planning. The effects of regulatory restrictions on Congonhas, the challenges of expanding Guarulhos, and the structural difficulties of Viracopos are evaluated, highlighting the strategic relevance of this multi-airport system for sustaining national connectivity.</description>

      <title>Uniform Feasibility For Smoothed Backup Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study feasibility guarantees for safety filters developed using Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) when a safe set is defined using the pointwise minimum of continuously differentiable functions, a construction that is common for the backup CBF method and typically nonsmooth. We replace the minimum by its log-sum-exp (soft-min) smoothing and show that, under a strict safety condition, the smooth function becomes a CBF (or extended CBF) for a range of the smoothing parameter. For compact safe sets, we derive an explicit lower bound on the smoothing parameter that makes the smooth function a CBF and hence renders the corresponding safety filter feasible. For unbounded sets, we introduce tail conditions under which the smooth function satisfies an extended CBF condition uniformly. Finally, we apply these results to backup CBFs. We show that safety of a compact (terminal) backup set under a backup controller, together with a condition ensuring safety of the backup trajectories on the relevant boundary of the safe set, is sufficient for feasibility for backup CBFs. These results provide a recipe for a priori feasibility guarantees for smooth inner approximations of nonsmooth safe sets without the need for additional online certification.</description>

      <title>Naga: Vedic Encoding for Deep State Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents Naga, a deep State Space Model (SSM) encoding approach inspired by structural concepts from Vedic mathematics. The proposed method introduces a bidirectional representation for time series by jointly processing forward and time-reversed input sequences. These representations are then combined through an element-wise (Hadamard) interaction, resulting in a Vedic-inspired encoding that enhances the model's ability to capture temporal dependencies across distant time steps. We evaluate Naga on multiple long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) benchmarks, including ETTh1, ETTh2, ETTm1, ETTm2, Weather, Traffic, and ILI. The experimental results show that Naga outperforms 28 current state of the art models and demonstrates improved efficiency compared to existing deep SSM-based approaches. The findings suggest that incorporating structured, Vedic-inspired decomposition can provide an interpretable and computationally efficient alternative for long-range sequence modeling.</description>

      <title>A Model Predictive Control Scheme for Flight Scheduling and Energy Management of Electric Aviation Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme for flight scheduling and energy management of electric aviation networks, where electric aircraft transport passengers between electrified airports equipped with sustainable energy sources and battery storage, with the goal of minimizing grid dependency. Specifically, we first model the aircraft flight and charge scheduling problem jointly with the airport energy management problem, explicitly accounting for local weather forecasts. Second, we frame the minimum-grid-energy operational problem as a mixed-integer linear program and solve it in a receding horizon fashion, where the route assignment and charging decisions of each aircraft can be dynamically reassigned to mitigate disruptions. We showcase the proposed MPC scheme on real-world data taken from a conventional flight network and weather conditions in the US American North East. The proposed framework saves between 10 and 37% of grid energy requirements when compared to a baseline without re-routing. Hence, results show that MPC can effectively guarantee operation of the network by efficiently re-assigning flights and rescheduling aircraft charging, while maximizing the efficiency of the on-site energy systems.</description>

      <title>Time-Series-Informed Closed-loop Learning for Sequential Decision Making and Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Closed-loop performance of sequential decision making algorithms, such as model predictive control, depends strongly on the choice of controller parameters. Bayesian optimization allows learning of parameters from closed-loop experiments, but standard Bayesian optimization treats this as a black-box problem and ignores the temporal structure of closed-loop trajectories, leading to slow convergence and inefficient use of experimental resources. We propose a time-series-informed multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization framework that aligns the fidelity dimension with closed-loop time, enabling intermediate performance evaluations within a closed-loop experiment to be incorporated as lower-fidelity observations. Additionally, we derive probabilistic early stopping criteria to terminate unpromising closed-loop experiments based on the surrogate model's posterior belief, avoiding full episodes for poor parameterizations and thereby reducing resource usage. Simulation results on a nonlinear control benchmark demonstrate that, compared to standard black-box Bayesian optimization approaches, the proposed method achieves comparable closed-loop performance with roughly half the experimental resources, and yields better final performance when using the same resource budget, highlighting the value of exploiting temporal structure for sample-efficient closed-loop controller tuning.</description>

      <title>Invariant Kalman Filter for Relative Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10519v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a geometric framework for invariant filtering of relative dynamics on Lie groups. We first revisit the notion of state trajectory independence, under which the estimation error evolves autonomously, and derive new equivalent conditions by decomposing the system vector field into left-invariant, intrinsic, and right-invariant components. Building on this result, we introduce the concept of relative trajectory independence to characterize when the relative motion between two dynamical systems is autonomous. A key theoretical finding is that relative trajectory independence automatically ensures state trajectory independence for the corresponding estimation error. This connection provides the foundation for constructing invariant filters that preserve the Lie group structure, maintain exact linearization of the error dynamics, and enable consistent covariance propagation. These are illustrated with numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Inertia-aware Unit Commitment and Remuneration Methods for Decarbonized Power System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10820v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To maintain frequency stability in decarbonized power systems, inertia services from synchronous generators (SGs) and inverter-based resources must be procured. However, designing an inertia-aware system operation poses significant challenges in considering the variability and uncertainty of renewable energy sources (RES) and adopting a remuneration method for inertia provision due to SG commitment variables. To address this research gap, we renovate the inertia-aware chance constraints unit commitment model by incorporating time-coupling constraints for SGs and joint chance constraints for RES uncertainty. We investigate remuneration methods for inertia provision, including uplift, marginal pricing (MP), approximated convex hull pricing (aCHP), and average incremental cost pricing (AIP), applying these to the renovated model. Numerical experiments show that the model enhances frequency stability during a contingency. Among the remuneration methods, only aCHP guarantees revenue adequacy without requiring uplift while maximizing economic welfare. However, the MP requires the highest level of uplift to adequately compensate generation costs, as the price function fails to account for inertia provision.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12750v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a system identification algorithm for systems with multi-rate sensors in a discrete-time framework. It is challenging to obtain an accurate mathematical model when the ratios of inputs and outputs are different in the system. A cyclic reformulation-based model for multi-rate systems is formulated, and the multi-rate system can be reduced to a linear time-invariant system to derive the model under the multi-rate sensing environment. The proposed algorithm integrates a cyclic reformulation with a state coordinate transformation of the cycled system to enable precise identification of systems under the multi-rate sensing environment. The effectiveness of the proposed system identification method is demonstrated using numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Meta-Learning Driven Movable-Antenna-assisted Full-Duplex RSMA for Multi-User Communication: Performance and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03982v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Full-duplex (FD) radios at base station (BS) have gained significant interest because of their ability to simultaneously transmit and receive signals on the same frequency band. However, FD communication is hindered by self-interference (SI) and intra-cell interference caused by simultaneous uplink (UL) transmissions affecting downlink (DL) reception. These interferences significantly limit the ability to fully exploit FD's potential. Recently, movable antenna (MA) technology has emerged as a groundbreaking innovation, offering an effective way to mitigate interference by adjusting the position of each MA within the transmitter or receiver region. This dynamic repositioning allows MAs to move away from high-interference zones to areas with minimal interference, thereby enhancing multiplexing gain and improving spectral efficiency (SE). In light of this, in this paper, we investigate an FD communication system by integrating it with MAs to evaluate and investigate its effectiveness in handling SI and intra-cell interference. Moreover, we utilize rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) as our multiple access technique in both UL and DL transmission. To achieve the full potential of the system, we evaluated three different scenarios with FD-BS-RSMA with MAs where our goal is to maximize the total sum rate of the system by jointly optimizing the transmitting and receiving beamforming vectors, UL user equipment (UE) transmission power, MA positions, and common stream split ratio of RSMA while satisfying the minimum data rate requirements of all UEs, common stream constraint, power budget requirements of BS and UL UEs, and inter-MA distance. The formulated optimization problem is highly non-convex in nature, and hence, we propose a gradient-based meta-learning (GML) approach which can handle the non-convexity in a discrete manner by optimizing each variable in a different neural network.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of solving constrained
  reinforcement learning problems with anytime guarantees, meaning
  that the algorithmic solution returns a safe policy regardless of
  when it is terminated. Drawing inspiration from anytime constrained
  optimization, we introduce Reinforcement Learning-based Safe
  Gradient Flow (RL-SGF), an on-policy algorithm which employs
  estimates of the value functions and their respective gradients
  associated with the objective and safety constraints for the current
  policy, and updates the policy parameters by solving a convex
  quadratically constrained quadratic program. We show that if the
  estimates are computed with a sufficiently large number of episodes
  (for which we provide an explicit bound), safe policies are updated
  to safe policies with a probability higher than a prescribed
  tolerance. We also show that iterates asymptotically converge to a
  neighborhood of a KKT point, whose size can be arbitrarily reduced
  by refining the estimates of the value function and their gradients.
  We illustrate the performance of RL-SGF in a navigation example.</description>

      <title>Customising Electricity Contracts at Scale with Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electricity system becomes more complex, connecting massive numbers of end-users and distributed generators. Adding or removing grid connections requires expert studies to align technical constraints with user requests. In times of labour shortages, carrying out these studies represents a significant amount of time that engineers at system operators spend in planning departments. As time is limited, only standard block connectivity contracts can be offered to end-users, or the requests pile up. Even if offers are made, these often do not perfectly match the user's requirements, leading to overpaying or underusing the grid capacity. This paper investigates whether end-users can negotiate individual, flexible time-of-use contracts directly with the grid using Large Language Models (LLMs) in chats at scale. This work addresses core technical challenges in automating contract design under grid constraints, integrating LLMs with power system models, and ensuring secure, reliable interaction. We develop a chat system using functional programs for power system analysis, enabling users to request customised, technically feasible contracts at scale. We demonstrate high accuracy in executing engineering studies, robustness to user input variations, self-assessment of connection requests by small and medium enterprises, and potential for secure, chat-enabled maintenance planning. This initial study paves the way toward developing a tailored LLM system, resulting in possible high-efficiency gains for grid planning and customer management.

      <title>Learning Koopman Models From Data Under General Noise Conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09646v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel identification approach of Koopman models of nonlinear systems with inputs under rather general noise conditions. The method uses deep state-space encoders based on the concept of state reconstructability and an efficient multiple-shooting formulation of the squared loss of the prediction error to estimate the dynamics and the lifted state from input-output data. Furthermore, the Koopman model structure includes an innovation noise term that is used to handle process and measurement noise. It is shown that the proposed approach is statistically consistent and computationally efficient due to the multiple-shooting formulation where, on subsections of the data, multi-step prediction errors can be calculated in parallel. The latter allows for efficient batch optimization of the network parameters and, at the same time, excellent long-term prediction capabilities of the obtained models. The performance of the approach is illustrated by nonlinear benchmark examples and an experimental quadcopter setup.</description>

      <title>A Joint Delay-Energy-Security Aware Framework for Intelligent Task Scheduling in Satellite-Terrestrial Edge Computing Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a two-stage optimization framework for secure task scheduling in satellite-terrestrial edge computing networks (STECNs). The framework jointly considers secure user association and task offloading to balance transmission delay, energy consumption, and physical-layer security. To address the inherent complexity, we decouple the problem into two stages. In the first stage, a secrecy-aware user association strategy is designed by discretizing artificial noise (AN) power ratios and identifying feasible links that satisfy secrecy constraints, resulting in a set of candidate secure associations. In the second stage, we formulate a delay-energy-aware task scheduling problem as an integer linear program and solve it using a heuristic Mayfly Algorithm (MA) to obtain low-complexity, high-quality solutions. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed framework in achieving secure and efficient task scheduling under dynamic satellite environments.</description>

      <title>Geometric Decentralized Stability Condition for Power Systems Based on Projecting DW Shells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of decentralized stability conditions has gained considerable attention due to the need to analyze multi-agent network systems, such as heterogeneous multi-converter power systems. A recent advance is the application of the small-phase theorem, which extends the passivity theory. However, it requires the transfer function matrix to be sectorial, which may not hold in some frequency range and will result in conservativeness. To address this issue, this paper proposes a geometric decentralized stability condition based on Davis-Wielandt (DW) shell and its projections. Our approach provides a geometric interpretation of the small-gain and small-phase theorems and enables decentralized stability analysis of power systems, serving as a visualization method to understand the closed-loop interactions and assess the stability of large-scale network systems in a scalable and modular manner.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a frequency-domain system identification method for learning low-order systems. The identification problem is formulated as the minimization of the l2 norm between the identified and measured frequency responses, with the nuclear norm of the Loewner matrix serving as a regularization term. This formulation results in an optimization problem that can be efficiently solved using standard convex optimization techniques. We derive an upper bound on the sampled-frequency complexity of the identification process and subsequently extend this bound to characterize the identification error over all frequencies. A detailed analysis of the sample complexity is provided, along with a thorough interpretation of its terms and dependencies. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated through an example, and numerical simulations validating the growth rate of the sample complexity bound.</description>

      <title>Global Convergence of Policy Gradient for Entropy Regularized Linear-Quadratic Control with Multiplicative Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02896v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful framework for sequential decision-making in dynamic environments, particularly when system parameters are unknown. This paper investigates RL-based control for entropy-regularized Linear Quadratic control (LQC) problems with multiplicative noises over an infinite time horizon. First, we adapt the Regularized Policy Gradient (RPG) algorithm to stochastic optimal control settings, proving that despite the non-convexity of the problem, RPG converges globally under conditions of gradient domination and near-smoothness. Second, based on zero-order optimization approach, we introduce a novel model free RL algorithm: Sample-Based Regularized Policy Gradient (SB-RPG). SB-RPG operates without knowledge of system parameters yet still retains strong theoretical guarantees of global convergence. Our model leverages entropy regularization to accelerate convergence and address the exploration versus exploitation trade-off inherent in RL. Numerical simulations validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the efficacy of SB-RPG in unknown-parameters environments.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Grid-Forming Behavior: Bridging Device-Level Dynamics and System-Level Strength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Grid-forming (GFM) technology is widely regarded as a promising solution for future power systems dominated by power electronics. However, a precise method for quantifying GFM converter behavior and a universally accepted GFM definition remain elusive. Moreover, the impact of GFM on system stability is not precisely quantified, creating a significant disconnect between device and system levels. To address these gaps from a small-signal perspective, at the device level, we introduce a novel metric, the Forming Index (FI) to quantify a converter's response to grid voltage fluctuations. Rather than enumerating various control architectures, the FI provides a metric for the converter's GFM ability by quantifying its sensitivity to grid variations. At the system level, we propose a new quantitative measure of system strength that captures the multi-bus voltage stiffness, which quantifies the voltage and phase angle responses of multiple buses to current or power disturbances. We further extend and define this concept to grid strength and bus strength to identify weak areas within the system. Finally, we bridge the device and system levels by formally proving that GFM converters enhance system strength. Our proposed framework provides a unified benchmark for GFM converter design, optimal placement, and system stability assessment.</description>

      <title>Predictive Compensation in Finite-Horizon LQ Games under Gauss-Markov Deviations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03744v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a predictive compensation framework for finite-horizon, discrete-time linear quadratic dynamic games subject to Gauss-Markov execution deviations from feedback Nash strategies. One player's control is corrupted by temporally correlated stochastic perturbations modeled as a first-order autoregressive (AR(1)) process, while the opposing player has causal access to past deviations and employs a predictive feedforward strategy that anticipates their future effect. We derive closed-form recursions for mean and covariance propagation under the resulting perturbed closed loop, establish boundedness and sensitivity properties of the equilibrium trajectory, and characterize the reduction in expected cost achieved by optimal predictive compensation. Numerical experiments corroborate the theoretical results and demonstrate performance gains relative to nominal Nash feedback across a range of disturbance persistence levels.</description>

      <title>A Dynamic Recurrent Adjacency Memory Network for Mixed-Generation Power System Stability Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03746v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern power systems with high penetration of inverter-based resources exhibit complex dynamic behaviors that challenge the scalability and generalizability of traditional stability assessment methods. This paper presents a dynamic recurrent adjacency memory network (DRAMN) that combines physics-informed analysis with deep learning for real-time power system stability forecasting. The framework employs sliding-window dynamic mode decomposition to construct time-varying, multi-layer adjacency matrices from phasor measurement unit and sensor data to capture system dynamics such as modal participation factors, coupling strengths, phase relationships, and spectral energy distributions. As opposed to processing spatial and temporal dependencies separately, DRAMN integrates graph convolution operations directly within recurrent gating mechanisms, enabling simultaneous modeling of evolving dynamics and temporal dependencies. Extensive validations on modified IEEE 9-bus, 39-bus, and a multi-terminal HVDC network demonstrate high performance, achieving 99.85%, 99.90%, and 99.69% average accuracies, respectively, surpassing all tested benchmarks, including classical machine learning algorithms and recent graph-based models. The framework identifies optimal combinations of measurements that reduce feature dimensionality by 82% without performance degradation. Correlation analysis between dominant measurements for small-signal and transient stability events validates generalizability across different stability phenomena. DRAMN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while providing enhanced interpretability for power system operators, making it suitable for real-time deployment in modern control centers.</description>

      <title>Convex Reformulation of LMI-Based Distributed Controller Design with a Class of Non-Block-Diagonal Lyapunov Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04576v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study addresses a distributed state feedback controller design problem for continuous-time linear time-invariant systems by means of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). As structural constraints on a control gain result in non-convexity in general, the block-diagonal relaxation of Lyapunov functions has been prevalent despite its conservatism. In this work, we target a class of non-block-diagonal Lyapunov functions with the same sparsity pattern as distributed controllers. By leveraging a block-diagonal factorization of sparse matrices and Finsler's lemma, we first present a nonlinear matrix inequality for stabilizing distributed controllers with such Lyapunov functions, which boils down to a necessary and sufficient condition for such controllers if the sparsity pattern is chordal. As its relaxation, we derive novel LMIs, one of which strictly covers the conventional relaxation, and then provide analogous results for $H_\infty$ control. Lastly, numerical examples underscore the efficacy of our results.</description>

      <title>Sequential Autonomous Exploration-Based Precise Mapping for Mobile Robots through Stepwise and Consistent Motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a 2-D autonomous exploration and mapping framework for LiDAR-based SLAM mobile robots, designed to address the major challenges on low-cost platforms, including process instability, map drift, and increased risks of collisions and deadlocks. For frontier search, the local-global sampling architecture based on Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRTs) is employed. For local exploration, the proposed Self-Convergent RRT (SC-RRT) efficiently covers the reachable space within a finite time while the robot remains stationary, without relying on motion-induced sampling diversity. In addition, traversability checks during RRT expansion and global RRT pruning upon map updates eliminate unreachable frontiers, reducing potential collisions and deadlocks. For frontier point navigation, a stepwise consistent motion strategy is employed to generate motion trajectories that are more amenable to stable scan matching. The resulting straight-segment and in-place-rotation pattern improves scan-matching robustness and effectively suppresses map drift on resource-constrained platforms. For the process control, the framework serializes frontier point selection and navigation, avoiding oscillations caused by frequent goal changes in conventional parallelized processes. The waypoint retracing mechanism is incorporated to generate repeated observations, triggering loop closure detection and backend optimization in graph-based SLAM, thereby improving map consistency. Experiments in challenging simulated and real-world environments validate the effectiveness of the framework. Compared with baseline methods, the proposed framework achieves higher mapping success rates and stronger robustness on resource-constrained robots and maintains consistent mapping quality across various LiDAR field-of-view (FoV) configurations.</description>

      <title>Less is More: Contextual Sampling for Nonlinear Data-Driven Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data-Driven Predictive Control (DPC) optimizes system behavior directly from measured trajectories without requiring an explicit model. However, its computational cost scales with dataset size, limiting real-time applicability to nonlinear robotic systems. For robotic tasks such as trajectory tracking and motion planning, real-time feasibility and numerical robustness are essential. Nonlinear DPC often relies on large datasets or learned nonlinear representations to ensure accuracy, both of which increase computational demand. We propose Contextual Sampling, a dynamic data selection strategy that adaptively selects the most relevant trajectories based on the current state and reference. By reducing dataset size while preserving representativeness, it improves computational efficiency. Experiments on a scaled autonomous vehicle and a quadrotor show that Contextual Sampling achieves comparable or better tracking than Random Sampling with fewer trajectories, enabling real-time feasibility. Compared with Select-DPC, it achieves similar tracking accuracy at lower computational cost. In comparison with the full DPC formulation without sampling, Contextual Sampling attains comparable tracking performance while requiring less computation, highlighting the benefit of efficient data selection in data-driven predictive control.</description>

      <title>AI-Native Open RAN for Non-Terrestrial Networks: An Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-terrestrial network (NTN) is expected to be a critical component of Sixth Generation (6G) networks, providing ubiquitous services and enhancing the system resilience. However, the high-altitude operation and inherent mobility of NTN introduce significant challenges across the development and operations (DevOps) lifecycle. Apart from that, how to achieve artificial intelligence native (AI-Native) capabilities in NTN for intelligent network management and orchestration remains an important challenge. To solve the challenges above, we propose integrating the Open Radio Access Network (ORAN) with NTN as a promising solution, leveraging its principles of disaggregation, openness, virtualization, and embedded intelligence. Despite extensive technical literature on ORAN and NTN, respectively, there is a lack of a holistic view of the integration of ORAN and NTN architectures, particularly in terms of how intelligent ORAN can address the scalability challenge in NTN management. To address this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive and structured overview of an AI-native ORAN-based NTN framework to support dynamic configuration, scalability, and intelligent orchestration. The paper commences with an in-depth review of the existing literature from leading industry and academic institutions, subsequently providing the necessary background knowledge related to ORAN, NTN, and AI-Native for communication. Furthermore, the paper analyzes the unique DevOps challenges for NTN and proposes the orchestrated AI-Native ORAN-based NTN framework, with a detailed discussion on the key technological enablers within the framework. Finally, this paper presents various use cases and outlines the prospective research directions of this study in detail.</description>

      <title>Streaming Generated Gaussian Process Experts for Online Learning and Control: Extended Version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03679v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaussian Processes (GPs), as a nonparametric learning method, offer flexible modeling capabilities and calibrated uncertainty quantification for function approximations. Additionally, GPs support online learning by efficiently incorporating new data with polynomial-time computation, making them well-suited for safety-critical dynamical systems that require rapid adaptation. However, the inference and online updates of exact GPs, when processing streaming data, incur cubic computation time and quadratic storage memory complexity, limiting their scalability to large datasets in real-time settings. In this paper, we propose a streaming kernel-induced progressively generated expert framework of Gaussian processes (SkyGP) that addresses both computational and memory constraints by maintaining a bounded set of experts, while inheriting the learning performance guarantees from exact Gaussian processes. Furthermore, two SkyGP variants are introduced, each tailored to a specific objective, either maximizing prediction accuracy (SkyGP-Dense) or improving computational efficiency (SkyGP-Fast). The effectiveness of SkyGP is validated through extensive benchmarks and real-time control experiments demonstrating its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>zkSTAR: A zero knowledge system for time series attack detection enforcing regulatory compliance in critical infrastructure networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Industrial control systems (ICS) form the operational backbone of critical infrastructure networks (CIN) such as power grids, water supply systems, and gas pipelines. As cyber threats to these systems escalate, regulatory agencies are imposing stricter compliance requirements to ensure system-wide security and reliability. A central challenge, however, is enabling regulators to verify the effectiveness of detection mechanisms without requiring utilities to disclose sensitive operational data. In this paper, we introduce zkSTAR, a cyberattack detection framework that leverages zk-SNARKs to reconcile these requirements and enable provable detection guarantees while preserving data confidentiality. Our approach builds on established residual-based statistical hypothesis testing methods applied to state-space detection models. Specifically, we design a two-pronged zk-SNARK architecture that enforces (i) temporal consistency of the state-space dynamics and (ii) statistical consistency of the detection tests, enabling regulators to verify correctness and prevent suppression of alarms without visibility into utility-level data. We formally analyze the soundness and zero-knowledge properties of our framework and validate its practical feasibility through computational experiments on real-world ICS datasets. As a result, our work demonstrates a scalable, privacy-preserving alternative for regulatory compliance for ICS driven critical infrastructure networks.</description>
