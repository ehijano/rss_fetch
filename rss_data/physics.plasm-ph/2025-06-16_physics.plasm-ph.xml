      <title>Scattering Theory in Noncanonical Phase Space: A Drift-Kinetic Collision Operator for Weakly Collisional Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After developing a scattering theory for grazing collisions in general noncanonical phase spaces, we introduce a guiding center collision operator in five-dimensional phase space designed for plasma regimes characterized by long wavelengths (relative to the Larmor radius), low frequencies (relative to the cyclotron frequency), and weak collisionality (where repeated Coulomb collisions induce cumulatively small changes in particle magnetic moment). The collision operator is fully determined by the noncanonical Hamiltonian structure of guiding center dynamics and exhibits a metriplectic structure, ensuring the conservation of particle number, momentum, energy, and interior Casimir invariants. It also satisfies an H-theorem, allowing for deviations from Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics due to the nontrivial kernel of the noncanonical guiding center Poisson tensor, spanned by the magnetic moment. We propose that this collision operator and its underlying mathematical structure may offer valuable insights into the study of turbulence, transport, and self-organizing phenomena in both laboratory and astrophysical plasmas.</description>

      <title>In situ studies of a molten metal anode ablation in a nearly atmospheric pressure DC arc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A DC arc with a meltable metal anode in a near-atmospheric pressure hydrocarbon gas is an emerging method for producing single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). In these systems, evaporation of the molten metal anode determines the formation of catalyst seed particles needed for SWCNT growth, and therefore, should be monitored, controlled, and optimized. Evaluating the anode ablation rate by weighing the anode before and after a synthesis run is unfeasible due to anode carburization in the hydrocarbon atmosphere. To overcome this, we implemented a high-speed, 2D, 2-color pyrometry for reliable temperature measurements of the molten anode in a DC arc. The obtained temperature fields were used to calculate the anode ablation rates. Results showed the importance of resolving the arc and molten pool dynamics, as well as addressing the issue of reflections. Furthermore, significant changes in ablation rates were revealed upon addition of CH4, which must be considered when scaling up the production of SWCNTs.</description>

      <title>Electron Heating in Hypersonic Flows: A New Thermodynamically Consistent Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of electron temperature ($T_{\rm e}$) in hypersonic non-equilibrium flows is critical, yet hampered by inadequate models for electron heating from vibrationally excited nitrogen. Prior models often relied on ad-hoc scaling or flawed applications of detailed balance that failed to ensure the convergence of electron and vibrational temperatures ($T_{\rm v}$) at thermal equilibrium. This paper introduces a novel, thermodynamically consistent electron heating model derived rigorously from the principle of detailed balance. By assuming a Boltzmann vibrational distribution and employing an effective activation energy, our approach yields a simple heating-to-cooling ratio of $\exp(\theta_{\rm v}/T_{\rm e}-\theta_{\rm v}/T_{\rm v})$, where $\theta_{\rm v}$ is the characteristic vibrational temperature of nitrogen. This formulation guarantees that $T_{\rm e}$ correctly converges to $T_{\rm v}$ at equilibrium. A key advantage is that our model can utilize total cooling rates determined from swarm experiments, leading to higher accuracy at the low electron temperatures typical of hypersonic flight. This results in simulations that better agree with flight-test data, predicting an electron temperature up to six times lower than previous models. These more reliable predictions can significantly enhance the fidelity of plasma modeling for hypersonic technologies, including radio-frequency blackout mitigation, MHD aerocapture, electron transpiration cooling, and electromagnetic shielding.</description>

      <title>Surfaces with Klein bottle topology occur in fusion reactor fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic confinement fusion devices, such as tokamaks and stellarators, are designed such that magnetic field lines lie in magnetic surfaces that form a foliation of nested genus-1 tori. The Poincar\'e-Hopf index theorem implies that only surfaces with genus 1 allow for vector fields that lie tangent to the surface and are are smooth and nowhere-vanishing. It is often implicitly assumed that magnetic surfaces are always toroidal. This paper we show that surfaces with the topology of an immersed Klein bottle (the only other genus-1 compact surface) can also occur in fusion reactor fields.
  These surfaces occur around fixed points of the Poincar\'e map that are reflection-hyperbolic, and are spanned by the field lines that asymptotically approach and depart from this closed line. Configurations in which this occurs appear in the stellarator database QUASR, and have been described in literature in the context of abnormal satwooth crashes.</description>

      <title>Suppressing spurious oscillations and particle noise in particle-in-cell simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations are essential for studying kinetic plasma processes, but they often suffer from statistical noise, especially in plasmas with fast flows. We have also found that the typical central difference scheme used in PIC codes to solve Maxwell's equations produces spurious oscillations near discontinuities, which can lead to unphysical solutions. In this work, we present numerical techniques to address these challenges within the semi-implicit PIC code FLEKS, which is based on the Gauss's Law-satisfying Energy-Conserving Semi-Implicit Particle-in-Cell method (GL-ECSIM). First, we introduce a Lax-Friedrichs-type diffusion term with a flux limiter into the Maxwell solver to suppress unphysical oscillations near discontinuities. Second, we propose a novel approach for calculating the current density in the comoving frame, which significantly reduces particle noise in simulations with fast plasma flows. Numerical tests are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in mitigating spurious oscillations and noise in shock and magnetic reconnection simulations.</description>

      <title>Resolving discrepancies in bang-time predictions for indirect-drive ICF experiments on the NIF: Insights from the Build-A-Hohlraum campaign</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10350v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigated discrepancies between measured and simulated x-ray drive in Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF) hohlraums at the National Ignition Facility (NIF). Despite advances in radiation-hydrodynamic simulations, a consistent "drive deficit" remains. Experimentally measured ICF capsule bang-times are systematically 400-700 ps later than simulations predict. The Build-A-Hohlraum (BAH) campaign explored potential causes for this discrepancy by systematically varying hohlraum features, including laser entrance hole (LEH) windows, capsules, and gas fills. Overall, the agreement between simulated and experimental x-ray drive was found to be largely unaffected by these changes. The data allows us to exclude some hypotheses put forward to potentially explain the discrepancy. Errors in the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) atomic modeling, errors in the modeling of LEH closure and errors due to a lack of plasma species mix physics in simulations are shown to be inconsistent with our measurements. Instead, the data supports the hypothesis that errors in NLTE emission modeling are a significant contributor to the discrepancy. X-ray emission in the 2 - 4 keV range is found to be approximately 30% lower than in simulations. This is accompanied by higher than predicted electron temperatures in the gold bubble region, pointing to errors in non-LTE modeling. Introducing an opacity multiplier of 0.87 on energy groups above 1.8 keV improves agreement with experimental data, reducing the bang-time discrepancy from 300 ps to 100 ps. These results underscore the need for refined NLTE opacity models to enhance the predictive power of hohlraum simulations.</description>

      <title>Computation of Magnetohydrodynamic Equilibria with Voigt Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19594v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents the first numerical investigation of using Voigt regularization as a method for obtaining magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibria without the assumption of nested magnetic flux surfaces. Voigt regularization modifies the MHD dynamics by introducing additional terms that vanish in the infinite-time limit, allowing for magnetic reconnection and the formation of magnetic islands, which can overlap and produce field-line chaos. The utility of this approach is demonstrated through numerical solutions of two-dimensional ideal and resistive test problems. Our results show that Voigt regularization can significantly accelerate the convergence to solutions in resistive MHD problems, while also highlighting challenges in applying the method to ideal MHD systems. This research opens up new possibilities for developing more efficient and robust MHD equilibrium solvers, which could contribute to the design and optimization of future fusion devices.</description>
