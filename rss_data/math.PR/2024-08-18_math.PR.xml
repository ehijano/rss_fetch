      <title>Airy wanderer line ensembles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In (J. Stat. Phys. 132, 275-290, 2008) Borodin and P\'ech\'e introduced a generalization of the extended Airy kernel based on two infinite sets of parameters. For an arbitrary choice of parameters we construct determinantal point processes on $\mathbb{R}^2$ for these generalized kernels. In addition, for a subset of the parameter space we show that the point processes can be lifted to line ensembles on $\mathbb{R}$, which satisfy the Brownian Gibbs property. Our ensembles generalize the wanderer line ensembles introduced by Corwin and Hammond in (Invent. Math. 195, 441-508, 2014).</description>

      <title>Percolation Inequalities and Decision Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of decision trees for percolation inequalities started with the celebrated O'Donnell--Saks--Schramm--Servedio (OSSS) inequality. We prove decision tree generalizations of the Harris--Kleitman (HK), van den Berg--Kesten (vdBK), and other inequalities. These inequalities are then applied to estimate the connection probabilities in Bernoulli bond percolation on general graphs.</description>

      <title>Onsager-Machlup functional for stochastic lattice dynamical systems driven by time-varying noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the Onsager-Machlup functional of stochastic lattice dynamical systems (SLDSs) driven by time-varying noise. We extend the Onsager-Machlup functional from finite-dimensional to infinite-dimensional systems, and from constant to time-varying diffusion coefficients. We first verify the existence and uniqueness of general SLDS solutions in the infinite sequence weighted space $l^2_{\rho}$. Building on this foundation, we employ techniques such as the infinite-dimensional Girsanov transform, Karhunen-Lo\`eve expansion, and probability estimation of Brownian motion balls to derive the Onsager-Machlup functionals for SLDSs in $l^2_{\rho}$ space. Additionally, we use a numerical example to illustrate our theoretical findings, based on the Euler Lagrange equation corresponding to the Onsage Machup functional.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations in Wasserstein dynamics on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a drift-diffusion process on the probability simplex to study stochastic fluctuations in probability spaces. We construct a counting process for linear detailed balanced chemical reactions with finite species such that its thermodynamic limit is a system of ordinary differential equations (ODE) on the probability simplex. This ODE can be formulated as a gradient flow with an Onsager response matrix that induces a Riemannian metric on the probability simplex. After incorporating the induced Riemannian structure, we propose a diffusion approximation of the rescaled counting process for molecular species in the chemical reactions, which leads to Langevin dynamics on the probability simplex with a degenerate Brownian motion constructed from the eigen-decomposition of Onsager's response matrix. The corresponding Fokker-Planck equation on the simplex can be regarded as the usual drift-diffusion equation with the extrinsic representation of the divergence and Laplace-Beltrami operator. The invariant measure is the Gibbs measure, which is the product of the original macroscopic free energy and a volume element. When the drift term vanishes, the Fokker-Planck equation reduces to the heat equation with the Laplace-Beltrami operator, which we refer to as canonical Wasserstein diffusions on graphs. In the case of a two-point probability simplex, the constructed diffusion process is converted to one dimensional Wright-Fisher diffusion process, which leads to a natural boundary condition ensuring that the process remains within the probability simplex.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper the relations between independence preserving (IP) involutions and reversible Markov kernels are investigated. We introduce an involutive augmentation H = (f, g_f) of a measurable function f and relate the IP property of H to f-generated reversible Markov kernels. Various examples appeared in the literature are presented as particular cases of the construction. In particular, we prove that the IP property generated by the (reversible) Markov kernel of random walk with a reflecting barrier at the origin characterizes geometric-type laws</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we accomplish the existence and stability of the solution of a class of delay rough partial differential equations (DRPDEs). Moreover, we prove that the solution of DRPDEs can converge to that of RPDEs in sense of some distance as the delay tends to zero. As applications, we employ the main results to the study of a class of delay stochastic partial differential equations driven by fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter $\alpha\in(\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{2}]$.</description>

      <title>When invariance implies exchangeability (and applications to invariant Keisler measures)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of when, given a homogeneous structure $M$ and a space $S$ of expansions of $M$, every $\mathrm{Aut}(M)$-invariant probability measure on $S$ is exchangeable (i.e. $S_\infty$-invariant). We define a condition of $k$-overlap closedness on $M$ which implies exchangeability of random expansions by a class of structures whose finite substructures are all contained in a hereditary class with labelled growth-rate $O(e^{n^{k+\delta}})$ for all $\delta&gt;0$. For example, the generic tetrahedron-free $3$-hypergraph is $2$-overlap closed and so all of its random expansions by graphs are exchangeable. Our more general results on $k$-overlap closedness for homogeneous structures imply the same for every finitely bounded homogeneous $3$-hypergraph with free amalgamation. Our results extend and recover both the work of Angel, Kechris and Lyons on invariant random orderings of homogeneous structures and some of the work of Crane and Towsner, and Ackerman on relatively exchangeable structures. We also study conditions under which there are non-exchangeable invariant random expansions looking at the universal homogeneous kay-graphs.
  In the second part of the paper we apply our results to study invariant Keisler measures in homogeneous structures. We prove that invariant Keisler measures can be viewed as a particular kind of invariant random expansion. Thus, we describe the spaces of invariant Keisler measures of various homogeneous structures, obtaining the first results of this kind since the work of Albert and Ensley. We also show there are $2^{\aleph_0}$ supersimple homogeneous ternary structures for which there are non-forking formulas which are universally measure zero.</description>

      <title>Systemic values-at-risk and their sample-average approximations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the convergence properties of sample-average approximations (SAA) for set-valued systemic risk measures. We assume that the systemic risk measure is defined using a general aggregation function with some continuity properties and value-at-risk applied as a monetary risk measure. We focus on the theoretical convergence of its SAA under Wijsman and Hausdorff topologies for closed sets. After building the general theory, we provide an in-depth study of an important special case where the aggregation function is defined based on the Eisenberg-Noe network model. In this case, we provide mixed-integer programming formulations for calculating the SAA sets via their weighted-sum and norm-minimizing scalarizations. To demonstrate the applicability of our findings, we conduct a comprehensive sensitivity analysis by generating a financial network based on the preferential attachment model and modeling the economic disruptions via a Pareto distribution.</description>

      <title>A Mean Field Ansatz for Zero-Shot Weight Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pre-training cost of large language models (LLMs) is prohibitive. One cutting-edge approach to reduce the cost is zero-shot weight transfer, also known as model growth for some cases, which magically transfers the weights trained in a small model to a large model. However, there are still some theoretical mysteries behind the weight transfer. In this paper, inspired by prior applications of mean field theory to neural network dynamics, we introduce a mean field ansatz to provide a theoretical explanation for weight transfer. Specifically, we propose the row-column (RC) ansatz under the mean field point of view, which describes the measure structure of the weights in the neural network (NN) and admits a close measure dynamic. Thus, the weights of different sizes NN admit a common distribution under proper assumptions, and weight transfer methods can be viewed as sampling methods. We empirically validate the RC ansatz by exploring simple MLP examples and LLMs such as GPT-3 and Llama-3.1. We show the mean-field point of view is adequate under suitable assumptions which can provide theoretical support for zero-shot weight transfer.</description>

      <title>Varadhan's Decomposition of Shift-Invariant Closed $L^2$-forms for Large Scale Interacting Systems on the Euclidean Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.08934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.08934v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We rigorously formulate and prove for a relatively general class of interactions Varadhan's Decomposition of shift-invariant closed $L^2$-forms for a large scale interacting system on the Euclidean lattice with finite range. Such decomposition of closed forms has played an essential role in proving the diffusive scaling limit of nongradient systems. A general expression in terms of conserved quantities was sought from observations for specific models, but a precise formulation or rigorous proof up until now had been elusive. Our result is based on a general decomposition theorem of shift-invariant closed uniform forms studied in our previous article (arXiv:2009.04699). In the present article, we show that the same universal structure also appears for $L^2$-forms. The essential assumptions are: (i) the set of states on each vertex is a finite set, (ii) the measure on the configuration space is the product measure, and (iii) there is a certain uniform spectral gap estimate for the mean field version of the interaction. As a special case, our result gives Varadhan's decomposition for the case of the multi-species exclusion process, which is a new result that could not be proved by existing methods. Our result also gives complete proofs of Varadhan's decompositions for finite range interactions, whose detailed proofs have been missing in the literature - presumably because there exists an obstruction to the standard method of proof.</description>

      <title>On a version of a multivariate integration by parts formula for Lebesgue integrals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.06772v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multidimensional integration by parts formulas apply under the standard assumption that one of the functions is continuous and the other has bounded Hardy-Krause variation. Motivated by recently developed results in the probabilistic context of price and risk bounds, this paper provides a version of an integration by parts formula for the Lebesgue integral of measure-inducing functions which may both be discontinuous and may have infinite Hardy-Krause variation. To this end, we give a general definition of measure-inducing functions and establish various of their properties, such as a characterization in terms of Delta-monotone functions. As a consequence of the integration by parts formula, several convergence results are provided, allowing an extension of the Lebesgue integral of a measure-inducing function to the case where one integrates with respect to a continuous semi-copula. The latter class of aggregation functions includes quasi-copulas which serve as bounds for the dependence structure in many applications.</description>

      <title>Rate of convergence of the smoothed empirical Wasserstein distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.02128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.02128v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider an empirical measure $\mathbb{P}_n$ induced by $n$ iid samples from a $d$-dimensional $K$-subgaussian distribution $\mathbb{P}$ and let $\gamma = N(0,\sigma^2 I_d)$ be the isotropic Gaussian measure. We study the speed of convergence of the smoothed Wasserstein distance $W_2(\mathbb{P}_n * \gamma, \mathbb{P}*\gamma) = n^{-\alpha + o(1)}$ with $*$ being the convolution of measures. For $K&lt;\sigma$ and in any dimension $d\ge 1$ we show that $\alpha = {1\over2}$. For $K&gt;\sigma$ in dimension $d=1$ we show that the rate is slower and is given by $\alpha = {(\sigma^2 + K^2)^2\over 4 (\sigma^4 + K^4)} &lt; 1/2$. This resolves several open problems in [GGNWP20], and in particular precisely identifies the amount of smoothing $\sigma$ needed to obtain a parametric rate. In addition, for any $d$-dimensional $K$-subgaussian distribution $\mathbb{P}$, we also establish that $D_{KL}(\mathbb{P}_n * \gamma \|\mathbb{P}*\gamma)$ has rate $O(1/n)$ for $K&lt;\sigma$ but only slows down to $O({(\log n)^{d+1}\over n})$ for $K&gt;\sigma$. The surprising difference of the behavior of $W_2^2$ and KL implies the failure of $T_{2}$-transportation inequality when $\sigma &lt; K$. Consequently, it follows that for $K&gt;\sigma$ the log-Sobolev inequality (LSI) for the Gaussian mixture $\mathbb{P} * N(0, \sigma^{2})$ cannot hold. This closes an open problem in [WW+16], who established the LSI under the condition $K&lt;\sigma$ and asked if their bound can be improved.</description>

      <title>Large deviation principles for stochastic nonlinear Schrodinger equations driven by Levy noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.05234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we establish a Freidlin-Wentzell type large deviation principle for stochastic nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation, with either focusing or defocusing nonlinearity, driven by nonlinear multiplicative L\'evy noise in the Marcus canonical form. This task is challenging in the current setting due to the presence of the power-type nonlinear term, the lack of regularization effect of the Schr\"odinger operator and the absence of compactness of embeddings. To overcome these difficulties, we employ a regularization procedure based on Yosida approximations and implement techniques such as time discretization, cut-off arguments, and relative entropy estimates of sequences of probability measures. Our innovative approach circumvents the need for compactness conditions, distinguishing our work from previous studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the joint asymptotic distribution of the least squares estimator of the parameter $(\theta,\,\mu)$ for the non-ergodic Vasicek models driven by seven specific Gaussian processes. %The similar result concerning to the non-ergodic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process is a by-product. To facilitate the proofs, we extract two common hypotheses from the covariance functions of the seven Gaussian processes and develop two types of new inner product formulas for functions of bounded variation in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space of the Gaussian processes. The integration by parts for normalized bounded variation functions is essential to the inner product formulas. We apply the inner product formulas of the seven Gaussian processes to check the set of conditions of Es-Sebaiy, Es.Sebaiy (2021).</description>

Abstract: Best Response Dynamics (BRD) is a class of strategy updating rules to find Pure Nash Equilibria (PNE) in a game. At each step, a player is randomly picked, and the player switches to a "best response" strategy based on the strategies chosen by others, so that the new strategy profile maximises their payoff. If no such strategy exists, a different player will be chosen randomly. When no player wants to change their strategy anymore, the process reaches a PNE and will not deviate from it. On the other hand, either PNE may not exist, or BRD could be "trapped" within a subgame that has no PNE. We consider a random game with $N$ players, each with two actions available, and i.i.d. payoffs, in which the payoff distribution may have an atom, i.e. ties are allowed. We study a class of random walks in a random medium on the $N$-dimensional hypercube induced by the random game. The medium contains two types of obstacles corresponding to PNE and traps. The class of processes we analyze includes BRD, simple random walks on the hypercube, and many other nearest neighbour processes. We prove that, with high probability, these processes reach a PNE before hitting any trap.</description>

      <title>Active Inference Tree Search in Large POMDPs</title>

Abstract: The ability to plan ahead efficiently is key for both living organisms and artificial systems. Model-based planning and prospection are widely studied in cognitive neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI), but from different perspectives--and with different desiderata in mind (biological realism versus scalability) that are difficult to reconcile. Here, we introduce a novel method to plan in POMDPs--Active Inference Tree Search (AcT)--that combines the normative character and biological realism of a leading planning theory in neuroscience (Active Inference) and the scalability of tree search methods in AI. This unification enhances both approaches. On the one hand, tree searches enable the biologically grounded, first principle method of active inference to be applied to large-scale problems. On the other hand, active inference provides a principled solution to the exploration-exploitation dilemma, which is often addressed heuristically in tree search methods. Our simulations show that AcT successfully navigates binary trees that are challenging for sampling-based methods, problems that require adaptive exploration, and the large POMDP problem 'RockSample'--in which AcT reproduces state-of-the-art POMDP solutions. Furthermore, we illustrate how AcT can be used to simulate neurophysiological responses (e.g., in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex) of humans and other animals that solve large planning problems. These numerical analyses show that Active Tree Search is a principled realisation of neuroscientific and AI planning theories, which offer both biological realism and scalability.</description>

      <title>Moments of Autocorrelation Demerit Factors of Binary Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14281v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sequences with low aperiodic autocorrelation are used in communications and remote sensing for synchronization and ranging. The autocorrelation demerit factor of a sequence is the sum of the squared magnitudes of its autocorrelation values at every nonzero shift when we normalize the sequence to have unit Euclidean length. The merit factor, introduced by Golay, is the reciprocal of the demerit factor. We consider the uniform probability measure on the $2^\ell$ binary sequences of length $\ell$ and investigate the distribution of the demerit factors of these sequences. Sarwate and Jedwab have respectively calculated the mean and variance of this distribution. We develop new combinatorial techniques to calculate the $p$th central moment of the demerit factor for binary sequences of length $\ell$. These techniques prove that for $p\geq 2$ and $\ell \geq 4$, all the central moments are strictly positive. For any given $p$, one may use the technique to obtain an exact formula for the $p$th central moment of the demerit factor as a function of the length $\ell$. Jedwab's formula for variance is confirmed by our technique with a short calculation, and we go beyond previous results by also deriving an exact formula for the skewness. A computer-assisted application of our method also obtains exact formulas for the kurtosis, which we report here, as well as the fifth central moment.</description>

      <title>Multistatic-Radar RCS-Signature Recognition of Aerial Vehicles: A Bayesian Fusion Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17987v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radar Automated Target Recognition (RATR) for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) involves transmitting Electromagnetic Waves (EMWs) and performing target type recognition on the received radar echo, crucial for defense and aerospace applications. Previous studies highlighted the advantages of multistatic radar configurations over monostatic ones in RATR. However, fusion methods in multistatic radar configurations often suboptimally combine classification vectors from individual radars probabilistically. To address this, we propose a fully Bayesian RATR framework employing Optimal Bayesian Fusion (OBF) to aggregate classification probability vectors from multiple radars. OBF, based on expected 0-1 loss, updates a Recursive Bayesian Classification (RBC) posterior distribution for target UAV type, conditioned on historical observations across multiple time steps. We evaluate the approach using simulated random walk trajectories for seven drones, correlating target aspect angles to Radar Cross Section (RCS) measurements in an anechoic chamber. Comparing against single radar Automated Target Recognition (ATR) systems and suboptimal fusion methods, our empirical results demonstrate that the OBF method integrated with RBC significantly enhances classification accuracy compared to other fusion methods and single radar configurations.</description>

      <title>Commutativity and liftings of codensity monads of probability measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12917v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several well-studied probability monads have been expressed as codensity monads over small categories of stochastic maps, giving a limit description of spaces of probability measures. In this paper we show how properties of probability monads such as commutativity and affineness can arise from their codensity presentation. First we show that their codensity presentation is closely related to another universal property of probability monads as liftings of the Giry monad, which allows us to generalise a result by Van Breugel on the Kantorovich monad and provide a novel characterisation of the Radon monad. We then provide sufficient conditions for a codensity monad to lift to \textbf{MonCat}, and give a characterisation of exactly pointwise monoidal codensity monads; codensity monads that satisfy a strengthening of these conditions. We show that the Radon monad is exactly pointwise monoidal, and hence give a description of the tensor product of free algebras of the Radon monad in terms of Day convolution. Finally we show that the Giry monad is not exactly pointwise monoidal due to the existence of probability bimeasures that do not extend to measures, although its restriction to standard Borel spaces is.</description>

      <title>On the impossibility of detecting a late change-point in the preferential attachment random graph model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of late change-point detection under the preferential attachment random graph model with time dependent attachment function. This can be formulated as a hypothesis testing problem where the null hypothesis corresponds to a preferential attachment model with a constant affine attachment parameter $\delta_0$ and the alternative corresponds to a preferential attachment model where the affine attachment parameter changes from $\delta_0$ to $\delta_1$ at a time $\tau_n = n - \Delta_n$ where $0\leq \Delta_n \leq n$ and $n$ is the size of the graph. It was conjectured in Bet et al. that when observing only the unlabeled graph, detection of the change is not possible for $\Delta_n = o(n^{1/2})$. In this work, we make a step towards proving the conjecture by proving the impossibility of detecting the change when $\Delta_n = o(n^{1/3})$. We also study change-point detection in the case where the labeled graph is observed and show that change-point detection is possible if and only if $\Delta_n \to \infty$, thereby exhibiting a strong difference between the two settings.</description>

      <title>On the Lottery Problem: Tracing Stefan Mandel's Combinatorial Condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stefan Mandel is the man who won the lottery 14 times. He never disclosed the recipe he called combinatorial condensation, which enabled him to hit the Romanian lottery jackpot in the early phase of his betting career. Combinatorial condensation is frequently mixed up with another strategy known as buying the pot, which Stefan Mandel was pursuing later on. On occasion, he dropped a few hints on combinatorial condensation. The hints are applied in this work to narrow down and assess his initial recipe. The underlying theory resembles what a weekend mathematician, as he once referred to himself, may have encountered in the 1960s. Calculations indicate that he took residual risks that his method might fail. Residual risks explain why he changed his strategy from combinatorial condensation to buying the pot. The cardinality of the (15, 6, 6, 5)- and (49, 6, 6, 5)-lottery schemes shows that Stefan Mandel probably wasn't aware of lottery designs. First concepts on such topics had been available at that time, but coherent theories on combinatorial designs took off only in later decades, triggered by growing computing power, and eventually triggered by Stefan Mandel's publicity and successes in the field. But, as the comparison with actual covering designs reveals, Stefan Mandel most likely pioneered in constructing a (15, 6, 5)-covering design many years before others published about it, which he applied in the Romanian lottery.</description>
