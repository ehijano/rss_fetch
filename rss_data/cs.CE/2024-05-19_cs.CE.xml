      <title>WISER: multimodal variational inference for full-waveform inversion without dimensionality reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a semi-amortized variational inference framework designed for computationally feasible uncertainty quantification in 2D full-waveform inversion to explore the multimodal posterior distribution without dimensionality reduction. The framework is called WISER, short for full-Waveform variational Inference via Subsurface Extensions with Refinements. WISER leverages the power of generative artificial intelligence to perform approximate amortized inference that is low-cost albeit showing an amortization gap. This gap is closed through non-amortized refinements that make frugal use of acoustic wave physics. Case studies illustrate that WISER is capable of full-resolution, computationally feasible, and reliable uncertainty estimates of velocity models and imaged reflectivities.</description>

      <title>Off-the-Shelf Neural Network Architectures for Forex Time Series Prediction come at a Cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our study focuses on comparing the performance and resource requirements between different Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network architectures and an ANN specialized architecture for forex market prediction. We analyze the execution time of the models as well as the resources consumed, such as memory and computational power. Our aim is to demonstrate that the specialized architecture not only achieves better results in forex market prediction but also executes using fewer resources and in a shorter time frame compared to LSTM architectures. This comparative analysis will provide significant insights into the suitability of these two types of architectures for time series prediction in the forex market environment.</description>

      <title>High order unfitted finite element discretizations for explicit boundary representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When modeling scientific and industrial problems, geometries are typically modeled by explicit boundary representations obtained from computer-aided design software. Unfitted (also known as embedded or immersed) finite element methods offer a significant advantage in dealing with complex geometries, eliminating the need for generating unstructured body-fitted meshes. However, current unfitted finite elements on nonlinear geometries are restricted to implicit (possibly high-order) level set geometries. In this work, we introduce a novel automatic computational pipeline to approximate solutions of partial differential equations on domains defined by explicit nonlinear boundary representations. For the geometrical discretization, we propose a novel algorithm to generate quadratures for the bulk and surface integration on nonlinear polytopes required to compute all the terms in unfitted finite element methods. The algorithm relies on a nonlinear triangulation of the boundary, a kd-tree refinement of the surface cells that simplify the nonlinear intersections of surface and background cells to simple cases that are diffeomorphically equivalent to linear intersections, robust polynomial root-finding algorithms and surface parameterization techniques. We prove the correctness of the proposed algorithm. We have successfully applied this algorithm to simulate partial differential equations with unfitted finite elements on nonlinear domains described by computer-aided design models, demonstrating the robustness of the geometric algorithm and showing high-order accuracy of the overall method.</description>

      <title>C(NN)FD -- a deep learning framework for turbomachinery CFD analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep Learning methods have seen a wide range of successful applications across different industries. Up until now, applications to physical simulations such as CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics), have been limited to simple test-cases of minor industrial relevance. This paper demonstrates the development of a novel deep learning framework for real-time predictions of the impact of manufacturing and build variations on the overall performance of axial compressors in gas turbines, with a focus on tip clearance variations. The associated scatter in efficiency can significantly increase the CO2 emissions, thus being of great industrial and environmental relevance. The proposed C(NN)FD architecture achieves in real-time accuracy comparable to the CFD benchmark. Predicting the flow field and using it to calculate the corresponding overall performance renders the methodology generalisable, while filtering only relevant parts of the CFD solution makes the methodology scalable to industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Input Convex Lipschitz RNN: A Fast and Robust Approach for Engineering Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07494v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computational efficiency and non-adversarial robustness are critical factors in process modeling and optimization for real-world engineering applications. Yet, conventional neural networks often fall short in addressing both simultaneously, or even separately. Drawing insights from natural physical systems and existing literature, it is known theoretically that an input convex architecture will enhance computational efficiency, while a Lipschitz-constrained architecture will bolster non-adversarial robustness. However, integrating both properties into one model is a nontrivial task, as enforcing one property may compromise the other one. Therefore, in this work, we develop a novel network architecture, termed Input Convex Lipschitz Recurrent Neural Networks, that inherits the strengths of both convexity and Lipschitz continuity. This model is explicitly designed for fast and robust optimization-based tasks, which outperforms existing recurrent units in terms of computational efficiency and non-adversarial robustness. Additionally, we have successfully implemented this model in various practical engineering applications, such as optimization of chemical processes and real-world solar irradiance prediction for Solar PV system planning at LHT Holdings in Singapore.

      <title>Data-Driven Physics-Informed Neural Networks: A Digital Twin Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08667v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study explores the potential of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for the realization of digital twins (DT) from various perspectives. First, various adaptive sampling approaches for collocation points are investigated to verify their effectiveness in the mesh-free framework of PINNs, which allows automated construction of virtual representation without manual mesh generation. Then, the overall performance of the data-driven PINNs (DD-PINNs) framework is examined, which can utilize the acquired datasets in DT scenarios. Its scalability to more general physics is validated within parametric Navier-Stokes equations, where PINNs do not need to be retrained as the Reynolds number varies. In addition, since datasets can be often collected from different fidelity/sparsity in practice, multi-fidelity DD-PINNs are also proposed and evaluated. They show remarkable prediction performance even in the extrapolation tasks, with $42\sim62\%$ improvement over the single-fidelity approach. Finally, the uncertainty quantification performance of multi-fidelity DD-PINNs is investigated by the ensemble method to verify their potential in DT, where an accurate measure of predictive uncertainty is critical. The DD-PINN frameworks explored in this study are found to be more suitable for DT scenarios than traditional PINNs from the above perspectives, bringing engineers one step closer to seamless DT realization.</description>

      <title>A Machine Learning Approach for Multiscale Modeling of Biological Tissues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13357v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a new neural network architecture that strictly enforces constitutive constraints such as polyconvexity, frame-indifference, and the symmetry of the stress and material stiffness. Additionally, we show that the accuracy of the stress and material stiffness predictions is significantly improved for this neural network by using a Sobolev minimization strategy that includes derivative terms. Using our neural network, we model the constitutive behavior of fibrous-type discrete network material. With Sobolev minimization, we obtain a normalized mean square error of 0.15% for the strain energy density, 0.815% averaged across the components of the stress, and 5.4% averaged across the components of the stiffness tensor. This machine-learned constitutive model was deployed in a finite element simulation of a facet capsular ligament. The displacement fields and stress-strain curves were compared to a multiscale simulation that required running on a GPU-based supercomputer. The new approach maintained upward of 85% accuracy in stress up to 70% strain while reducing the computation cost by orders of magnitude.</description>
