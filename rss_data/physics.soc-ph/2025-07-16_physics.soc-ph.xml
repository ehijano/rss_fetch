      <title>Will anyone review this paper? Screening, sorting, and the feedback cycles that imperil peer review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scholarly publishing relies on peer review to identify the best science. Yet finding willing and qualified reviewers to evaluate manuscripts has become an increasingly challenging task, possibly even threatening the long-term viability of peer review as an institution. What can or should be done to salvage it? Here, we develop mathematical models to reveal the intricate interactions among incentives faced by authors, reviewers, and readers in their endeavors to identify the best science. Two facets are particularly salient. First, peer review partially reveals authors' private sense of their work's quality through their decisions of where to send their manuscripts. Second, journals' reliance on traditionally unpaid and largely unrewarded review labor deprives them of a standard market mechanism -- wages -- to recruit additional reviewers when review labor is in short supply. We highlight a resulting feedback loop that threatens to overwhelm the peer review system: (1) an increase in submissions overtaxes the pool of suitable peer reviewers; (2) the accuracy of review drops because journals either must either solicit assistance from less qualified reviewers or ask current reviewers to do more; (3) as review accuracy drops, submissions further increase as more authors try their luck at venues that might otherwise be a stretch. We illustrate how this cycle is further propelled by forces including the increasing emphasis on high-impact publications, the proliferation of journals, and competition among these journals for peer reviews. Finally, we suggest interventions that could slow or even reverse this cycle of peer-review meltdown.</description>

      <title>Universal self-similarity of hierarchical communities formed through a general self-organizing principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emergence of self-similarity in hierarchical community structures is ubiquitous in complex systems. Yet, there is a dearth of universal quantification and general principles describing the formation of such structures. Here, we discover universality in scaling laws describing self-similar hierarchical community structure in multiple real-world networks including biological, infrastructural, and social networks. We replicate these scaling relations using a phenomenological model, where nodes with higher similarity in their properties have greater probability of forming a connection. A large difference in their properties forces two nodes into different communities. Smaller communities are formed owing to further differences in node properties within a larger community. We discover that the general self-organizing principle is in agreement with Hakens principle; nodes self-organize into groups such that the diversity or differences between properties of nodes in the same community is minimized at each scale and the organizational entropy decreases with increasing complexity of the organized structure.</description>

      <title>An Interpretable AI framework Quantifying Traditional Chinese Medicine Principles Towards Enhancing and Integrating with Modern Biomedicine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional Chinese Medicine diagnosis and treatment principles, established through centuries of trial-and-error clinical practice, directly maps patient-specific symptom patterns to personalised herbal therapies. These empirical holistic mapping principles offer valuable strategies to address remaining challenges of reductionism methodologies in modern biomedicine. However, the lack of a quantitative framework and molecular-level evidence has limited their interpretability and reliability. Here, we present an AI framework trained on ancient and classical TCM formula records to quantify the symptom pattern-herbal therapy mappings. Interestingly, we find that empirical TCM diagnosis and treatment are consistent with the encoding-decoding processes in the AI model. This enables us to construct an interpretable TCM embedding space (TCM-ES) using the model's quantitative representation of TCM principles. Validated through broad and extensive TCM patient data, the TCM-ES offers universal quantification of the TCM practice and therapeutic efficacy. We further map biomedical entities into the TCM-ES through correspondence alignment. We find that the principal directions of the TCM-ES are significantly associated with key biological functions (such as metabolism, immune, and homeostasis), and that the disease and herb embedding proximity aligns with their genetic relationships in the human protein interactome, which demonstrate the biological significance of TCM principles. Moreover, the TCM-ES uncovers latent disease relationships, and provides alternative metric to assess clinical efficacy for modern disease-drug pairs. Finally, we construct a comprehensive and integrative TCM knowledge graph, which predicts potential associations between diseases and targets, drugs, herbal compounds, and herbal therapies, providing TCM-informed opportunities for disease analysis and drug development.</description>

      <title>Multiscale patterns of migration flows in Austria: regionalization, administrative barriers, and urban-rural divides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Migration is central in various societal problems related to socioeconomic development. While much of the existing research has focused on international migration, migration patterns within a single country remain relatively unexplored. In this work we study internal migration patterns in Austria for a period of over 20 years, obtained from open and high-granularity administrative records. We employ inferential network methods to characterize the flows between municipalities and extract their clustering according to similar target and destination rates. Our methodology reveals significant deviations from commonly assumed relocation patterns modeled by the gravity law. At the same time, we observe unexpected biases of internal migrations that leads to less frequent movements across boundaries at both district and state levels than predictions suggest. This leads to significant regionalization of migration at multiple geographical scales and augmented division between urban and rural areas. These patterns appear to be remarkably persistent across decades of migration data, demonstrating systematic limitations of conventionally used gravity models in migration studies. Our approach presents a robust methodology that can be used to improve such evaluations, and can reveal new phenomena in migration networks.</description>

      <title>HIF: The hypergraph interchange format for higher-order networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many empirical systems contain complex interactions of arbitrary size, representing, for example, chemical reactions, social groups, co-authorship relationships, and ecological dependencies. These interactions are known as higher-order interactions and the collection of these interactions comprise a higher-order network, or hypergraph. Hypergraphs have established themselves as a popular and versatile mathematical representation of such systems and a number of software packages written in various programming languages have been designed to analyze these networks. However, the ecosystem of higher-order network analysis software is fragmented due to specialization of each software's programming interface and compatible data representations. To enable seamless data exchange between higher-order network analysis software packages, we introduce the Hypergraph Interchange Format (HIF), a standardized format for storing higher-order network data. HIF supports multiple types of higher-order networks, including undirected hypergraphs, directed hypergraphs, and simplicial complexes, while actively exploring extensions to represent multiplex hypergraphs, temporal hypergraphs, and ordered hypergraphs. To accommodate the wide variety of metadata used in different contexts, HIF also includes support for attributes associated with nodes, edges, and incidences. This initiative is a collaborative effort involving authors, maintainers, and contributors from prominent hypergraph software packages. This project introduces a JSON schema with corresponding documentation and unit tests, example HIF-compliant datasets, and tutorials demonstrating the use of HIF with several popular higher-order network analysis software packages.</description>

      <title>Opinion dynamics: Statistical physics and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Opinion dynamics, the study of how individual beliefs and collective public opinion evolve, is a fertile domain for applying statistical physics to complex social phenomena. Like physical systems, societies exhibit macroscopic regularities from localized interactions, leading to outcomes such as consensus or fragmentation. This field has grown significantly, attracting interdisciplinary methods and driven by a surge in large-scale behavioral data. This review covers its rapid progress, bridging the literature dispersion. We begin with essential concepts and definitions, encompassing the nature of opinions, microscopic and macroscopic dynamics. This foundation leads to an overview of empirical research, from lab experiments to large-scale data analysis, which informs and validates models of opinion dynamics. We then present individual-based models, categorized by their macroscopic phenomena (e.g., consensus, polarization, echo chambers) and microscopic mechanisms (e.g., homophily, assimilation). We also review social contagion phenomena, highlighting their connection to opinion dynamics. Furthermore, the review covers common analytical and computational tools, including stochastic processes, treatments, simulations, and optimization. Finally, we explore emerging frontiers, such as connecting empirical data to models and using AI agents as testbeds for novel social phenomena. By systematizing terminology and emphasizing analogies with traditional physics, this review aims to consolidate knowledge, provide a robust theoretical foundation, and shape future research in opinion dynamics.</description>

      <title>Socioeconomic Impact of the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Pierre Auger Observatory has been operating in Malargue, Province of Mendoza, western Argentina, for over two decades, significantly advancing our understanding of cosmic rays. Beyond its scientific mission, the installation and operation of the Observatory has had profound social, economic, educational and cultural impact on the local community, the region and worldwide. More than 90 percent of the Observatory's annual operational budget is invested in the region, benefiting sectors such as tourism, hospitality, gastronomy, and local commerce. Additionally, the presence of international visitors and collaborations has fostered a rich cultural exchange. Malargue has emerged as a destination for scientific tourism, with the Observatory as a major attraction, having welcomed over 178,000 visitors since its inauguration and boosting the development of the region. This article explores the broad direct and indirect benefits of the Auger Observatory and the key lessons learned from this endeavor. A new International Agreement signed in 2024 ensures the continuity of the project for at least another decade, until 2035, reaffirming its scientific, economic, and social relevance.</description>

      <title>Geometric Criticality in Scale-Invariant Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dimension in physical systems determines universal properties at criticality. Yet, the impact of structural perturbations on dimensionality remains largely unexplored. Here, we characterize the attraction basins of structural fixed points in scale-invariant networks from a renormalization group perspective, demonstrating that basin stability connects to a structural phase transition. This topology-dependent effect, which we term geometric criticality, triggers a geometric breakdown hereto unknown, which induces non-trivial fractal dimensions and unveils hidden flows toward unstable structural fixed points. Our systematic study of how networks and lattices respond to disorder paves the way for future analysis of non-ergodic behavior induced by quenched disorder.</description>

      <title>Assess Space-Based Solar Power in European-Scale Power System Decarbonization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Meeting net-zero targets remains formidable as terrestrial renewables grapple with intermittency and regional variability. Here, we integrate space-based solar power (SBSP) -- a potential near-constant, orbital solar technology -- into a high-resolution, Europe-wide capacity-expansion and dispatch model to quantify its contribution under net-zero constraints. We examine two advanced SBSP designs: (1) a near-baseload, low Technology Readiness Level (TRL) concept (heliostat-based Representative Design RD1) and (2) a partially intermittent, higher-TRL concept (planar-based RD2), both drawing on NASA's 2050 cost and performance projections. Our results show that RD1 can reduce total system costs by 7--15%, displace up to 80% of intermittent wind and solar, and cut battery usage by over 70%, if it meets its forecast cost reductions -- though long-duration storage (e.g., hydrogen) remains essential for seasonal balancing. By contrast, RD2 is economically unattractive at its projected 2050 costs. Through extensive sensitivity analyses, we identify cost thresholds at which SBSP shifts from cost-prohibitive to complementary and ultimately to a dominant baseload technology. Specifically, RD1 becomes complementary at roughly 14x and dominant at 9x the 2050 solar PV capital cost, benefiting from its continuous power generation. Meanwhile, RD2 must achieve even lower cost levels (9x to be complementary and 6x to dominate) and would rely on short-duration storage to mitigate its partial intermittency. These findings provide quantified techno-economic benchmarks and reveal alternative net-zero pathways, offering critical guidance for policymakers and industry stakeholders seeking large-scale, centrally coordinated renewable solutions with non- or low-intermittency.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Synchronization and Distortion Scaling in Social Media Networks: A Fractal-Like Topology Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05769v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid proliferation of social media as a dominant channel for information dissemination has intensified concerns over systemic information distortion, whereby content is progressively altered through successive layers of transmission. While prior studies have explored such distortion qualitatively, the quantitative interplay between propagation topology and stochastic cognitive perturbations remains insufficiently understood. In this work, we propose a novel fractal-inspired directed hierarchical network model to capture the structural patterns of propagation, and introduce a Noise-Frustrated Hegselmann-Krause (NFHK) framework to model opinion dynamics under noise. Analytical results, supported by group and graph theory, reveal that noise accumulation leads to increasing opinion distortion and the emergence of intra-layer synchronization. Multi-agent simulations confirm these effects, showing that noise intensity shapes both convergence rates and weak intra-layer clustering. Empirical validation using a representative retweet cascade demonstrates that the proposed model reproduces real-world distortion patterns and synchronization behaviors, even without direct links. This work uncovers a unified mechanism for information distortion in digital platforms and offers topology-aware insights for public opinion governance and platform regulation.</description>

      <title>Scaling and Multi-scaling Laws and Meta-Graph Reconstruction in Laplacian Renormalization of Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The renormalization group (RG) method in spectral space (SS) has recently emerged as a compelling alternative to traditional RG approaches in real space (RS) and momentum space (MS). Leveraging the intrinsic properties of random walks and diffusion, the SS RG framework is particularly effective in analyzing the structural and dynamical features of complex networks, serving as a valuable complement to RS and MS techniques. However, its theoretical foundation remains incomplete due to its time-dependent long-range coarse-graining mechanism. In this work, we construct a self-consistent framework in which the fractal, random walk, and degree exponents are determined simultaneously, while their scaling relations remain invariant. We also introduce a novel method for constructing meta-renormalized networks and discuss the roles of meta-links in a real electric power grid. Finally, we demonstrate the validity and non-recursive nature of the SS RG transformation.</description>
