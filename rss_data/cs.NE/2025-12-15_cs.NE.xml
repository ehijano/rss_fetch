      <title>Learning to Evolve with Convergence Guarantee via Neural Unrolling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition from hand-crafted heuristics to data-driven evolutionary algorithms faces a fundamental dilemma: achieving neural plasticity without sacrificing mathematical stability. Emerging learned optimizers demonstrate high adaptability. However, they often lack rigorous convergence guarantees. This deficiency results in unpredictable behaviors on unseen landscapes. To address this challenge, we introduce Learning to Evolve (L2E), a unified bilevel meta-optimization framework. This method reformulates evolutionary search as a Neural Unrolling process grounded in Krasnosel'skii-Mann (KM) fixed-point theory. First, L2E models a coupled dynamic system in which the inner loop enforces a strict contractive trajectory via a structured Mamba-based neural operator. Second, the outer loop optimizes meta-parameters to align the fixed point of the operator with the target objective minimizers. Third, we design a gradient-derived composite solver that adaptively fuses learned evolutionary proposals with proxy gradient steps, thereby harmonizing global exploration with local refinement. Crucially, this formulation provides the learned optimizer with provable convergence guarantees. Extensive experiments demonstrate the scalability of L2E in high-dimensional spaces and its robust zero-shot generalization across synthetic and real-world control tasks. These results confirm that the framework learns a generic optimization manifold that extends beyond specific training distributions.</description>

      <title>CogniSNN: Enabling Neuron-Expandability, Pathway-Reusability, and Dynamic-Configurability with Random Graph Architectures in Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs), regarded as the third generation of artificial neural networks, are expected to bridge the gap between artificial intelligence and computational neuroscience. However, most mainstream SNN research directly adopts the rigid, chain-like hierarchical architecture of traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs), ignoring key structural characteristics of the brain. Biological neurons are stochastically interconnected, forming complex neural pathways that exhibit Neuron-Expandability, Pathway-Reusability, and Dynamic-Configurability. In this paper, we introduce a new SNN paradigm, named Cognition-aware SNN (CogniSNN), by incorporating Random Graph Architecture (RGA). Furthermore, we address the issues of network degradation and dimensional mismatch in deep pathways by introducing an improved pure spiking residual mechanism alongside an adaptive pooling strategy. Then, we design a Key Pathway-based Learning without Forgetting (KP-LwF) approach, which selectively reuses critical neural pathways while retaining historical knowledge, enabling efficient multi-task transfer. Finally, we propose a Dynamic Growth Learning (DGL) algorithm that allows neurons and synapses to grow dynamically along the internal temporal dimension. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CogniSNN achieves performance comparable to, or even surpassing, current state-of-the-art SNNs on neuromorphic datasets and Tiny-ImageNet. The Pathway-Reusability enhances the network's continuous learning capability across different scenarios, while the dynamic growth algorithm improves robustness against interference and mitigates the fixed-timestep constraints during neuromorphic chip deployment. This work demonstrates the potential of SNNs with random graph structures in advancing brain-inspired intelligence and lays the foundation for their practical application on neuromorphic hardware.</description>

      <title>Unambiguous Representations in Neural Networks: An Information-Theoretic Approach to Intentionality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Representations pervade our daily experience, from letters representing sounds to bit strings encoding digital files. While such representations require externally defined decoders to convey meaning, conscious experience appears fundamentally different: a neural state corresponding to perceiving a red square cannot alternatively encode the experience of a green square. This intrinsic property of consciousness suggests that conscious representations must be unambiguous in a way that conventional representations are not. We formalize this intuition using information theory, defining representational ambiguity as the conditional entropy H(I|R) over possible interpretations I given a representation R. Through experiments on neural networks trained to classify MNIST digits, we demonstrate that relational structures in network connectivity can unambiguously encode representational content. Using both learned decoders and direct geometric matching, we achieve perfect (100%) accuracy for dropout-trained networks and 38% for standard backpropagation in identifying output neuron class identity, despite identical task performance, demonstrating that representational ambiguity can arise orthogonally to behavioral accuracy. We further show that spatial position information of input neurons can be decoded from network connectivity with R2 up to 0.844. These results provide a quantitative method for measuring representational ambiguity in neural systems and demonstrate that neural networks can exhibit the low-ambiguity representations posited as necessary (though not sufficient) by theoretical accounts of consciousness.</description>

      <title>The Emergence of Complex Behavior in Large-Scale Ecological Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18221v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore how physical scale and population size shape the emergence of complex behaviors in open-ended ecological environments. In our setting, agents are unsupervised and have no explicit rewards or learning objectives but instead evolve over time according to reproduction, mutation, and selection. As they act, agents also shape their environment and the population around them in an ongoing dynamic ecology. Our goal is not to optimize a single high-performance policy, but instead to examine how behaviors emerge and evolve across large populations due to natural competition and environmental pressures. We use modern hardware along with a new multi-agent simulator to scale the environment and population to sizes much larger than previously attempted, reaching populations of over 60,000 agents, each with their own evolved neural network policy. We identify various emergent behaviors such as long-range resource extraction, vision-based foraging, and predation that arise under competitive and survival pressures. We examine how sensing modalities and environmental scale affect the emergence of these behaviors and find that some of them appear only in sufficiently large environments and populations, and that larger scales increase the stability and consistency of these emergent behaviors. While there is a rich history of research in evolutionary settings, our scaling results on modern hardware provide promising new directions to explore ecology as an instrument of machine learning in an era of increasingly abundant computational resources and efficient machine frameworks.

      <title>BAMBO: Construct Ability and Efficiency LLM Pareto Set via Bayesian Adaptive Multi-objective Block-wise Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Constructing a Pareto set is pivotal for navigating the capability-efficiency trade-offs in Large Language Models (LLMs); however, existing merging techniques remain inadequate for this task. Coarse-grained, model-level methods yield only a sparse set of suboptimal solutions, while fine-grained, layer-wise approaches suffer from the "curse of dimensionality," rendering the search space computationally intractable. To resolve this dichotomy, we propose BAMBO (Bayesian Adaptive Multi-objective Block-wise Optimization), a novel framework that automatically constructs the LLM Pareto set. BAMBO renders the search tractable by introducing a Hybrid Optimal Block Partitioning strategy. Formulated as a 1D clustering problem, this strategy leverages a dynamic programming approach to optimally balance intra-block homogeneity and inter-block information distribution, thereby dramatically reducing dimensionality without sacrificing critical granularity. The entire process is automated within an evolutionary loop driven by the q-Expected Hypervolume Improvement (qEHVI) acquisition function. Experiments demonstrate that BAMBO discovers a superior and more comprehensive Pareto frontier than baselines, enabling agile model selection tailored to diverse operational constraints.
