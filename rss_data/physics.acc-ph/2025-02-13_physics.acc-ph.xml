      <title>Carbon Nanotube-Based 100s TeV/m-Level Particle Accelerators Driven by High-density Electron Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid-state materials, such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs), have the potential to support ultra-high accelerating fields in the TV/m range for charged particle acceleration. In this study, we explore the feasibility of using nanostructured CNTs forest to develop plasma-based accelerators at the 100s TeV-level, driven by high-density, ultra-relativistic electron beams, using fully three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. Two different acceleration mechanisms are proposed and investigated: the surface plasmon leakage field and the bubble wakefield. The leakage field, driven by a relatively low-density beam, can achieve an acceleration field up to TV/m, capable of accelerating both electron and positron beams. In particular, due to the direct acceleration by the driving beam, the positron acceleration is highly efficient with an average acceleration gradient of 2.3 TeV/m. In contrast, the bubble wakefield mechanism allows significantly higher acceleration fields, e.g. beyond 400 TV/m, with a much higher energy transfer efficiency of 66.7%. In principle, electrons can be accelerated to PeV energies over distances of several meters. If the beam density is sufficiently high, the CNT target will be completely blown out, where no accelerating field is generated. Its threshold has been estimated. Two major challenges in these schemes are recognised and investigated. Lever- aging the ultra-high energy and charge pumping rate of the driving beam, the nanostructured CNTs also offer significant potential for a wide range of advanced applications. This work represents a promising avenue for the development of ultra-compact, high-energy particle accelerators. We also outline conceptual experiments using currently available facilities, demonstrating that this approach is experimentally accessible.</description>

      <title>Wakefield regeneration in a resonantly driven plasma accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Plasma wakefields offer high acceleration gradients, orders of magnitude larger than conventional RF accelerators. However, the achievable luminosity remains relatively low, typically limited by repetition rate and the charge accelerated per shot. In this work, we show that a train of drive bunches can be harnessed to accelerate multiple witness bunches in a single shot. We demonstrate that periodically loading the wakefields removes the limit on the energy transfer from the drive beam to the plasma, which allows the luminosity to be increased. Proof-of-concept simulations for the AWAKE scheme are carried out to demonstrate the technique, achieving a doubling of the accelerated charge while exploiting only a fraction of the drive train.</description>
