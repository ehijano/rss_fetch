      <title>Magnetohydrodynamic/Kinetic Modeling of the Interaction between the Solar Wind and the Local Interstellar Medium with He$^+$, He$^{2+}$, and Pickup H$^+$ ions and H, He Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction of the solar wind with the local interstellar medium (LISM) spans a wide range of interacting particle populations, energies, and scales. Sophisticated models are required to capture the global picture, interpret near-Earth observations, and ultimately understand the properties of the LISM at distances of thousands of AUs, where the medium is presumed to be unperturbed by this interaction. We present a new extension of our MHD-plasma/kinetic-neutral heliospheric model, implemented within the Multi-Scale Fluid-Kinetic Simulation Suite (MS-FLUKSS). The new model treats singly and doubly charged helium ions, pickup protons, and electrons as separate, self-consistently coupled populations, interacting through six charge exchange processes and photoionization with kinetically treated neutral hydrogen and helium atoms. In this paper, we provide detailed information on the implementation, including new fits for the charge-exchange cross sections, and demonstrate the functionality and performance of the new code.</description>

      <title>Magnetohydrodynamic Simulation of a Coronal Mass Ejection Observed During the Near-radial Alignment of Solar Orbiter and Earth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections (ICMEs) are the primary sources of geomagnetic storms at Earth. Negative out-of-ecliptic component (Bz) of magnetic field in the ICME or its associated sheath region is necessary for it to be geo-effective. For this reason, magnetohydrodynamic simulations of CMEs containing data-constrained flux ropes are more suitable for forecasting their geo-effectiveness as compared to hydrodynamic models of the CME. ICMEs observed in situ by radially aligned spacecraft can provide an important setup to validate the physics-based heliospheric modeling of CMEs. In this work, we use the constant-turn flux rope (CTFR) model to study an ICME that was observed in situ by Solar Orbiter (SolO) and at Earth, when they were in a near-radial alignment. This was a stealth CME that erupted on 2020 April 14 and reached Earth on 2020 April 20 with a weak shock and a smoothly rotating magnetic field signature. We found that the CTFR model was able to reproduce the rotating magnetic field signature at both SolO and Earth with very good accuracy. The simulated ICME arrived 5 hours late at SolO and 5 hours ahead at Earth, when compared to the observed ICME. We compare the propagation of the CME front through the inner heliosphere using synthetic J-maps and those observed in the heliospheric imager data and discuss the role of incorrect ambient SW background on kinematics of the simulated CME. This study supports the choice of the CTFR model for reproducing the magnetic field of ICMEs.</description>

      <title>Revisiting turbulent properties of solar convection with 3D radiative hydrodynamic modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the turbulent structure and dynamics of the upper solar convection zone using a 3D radiative hydrodynamic simulation model at 45 degrees latitude. The model reveals the self-formation of meridional flows, the leptocline, and the radial differential rotation. Unlike previous studies, the model shows a complex variation of the characteristic scales of turbulent flows with depth. In particular, an increase in the characteristic convective scale is trackable within an individual snapshot up to a depth of 7 Mm, near the bottom of the hydrogen ionization zone, where turbulent flows become weaker and more homogeneous. However, the turbulent spectra show an increase in scale with depth and a qualitative change in convective patterns below 7 Mm (near the bottom of the leptocline), suggesting changes in the diffusivity properties and energy exchange among different scales.</description>

      <title>Solar Cycles: Can They Be Predicted?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The solar magnetic field, thought to be generated by the motion of plasma within the Sun, alternates on the order of 11-year cycles and is incompletely understood. Industries rely on accurate forecasts of solar activity, but can solar cycles be predicted? And how well did predictions perform for the current cycle? The answer is less-than-stellar... Of more than 100 predictions, most underestimated the amplitude (peak sunspot number) of cycle 25, some massively so. Fewer predictions were made for the timing of solar maximum, but timing predictions seem to have performed better than amplitude predictions. Reasons for inaccurate prediction are suggested, and perspectives are given on how future studies might improve upon the extant literature.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field Amplification in a Rotating Astrophysical Plasma Sphere: $\alpha$ and $\beta$ Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated the generation of the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ effects in a rotating spherical plasma system with oppositely polarized kinetic helicity in the northern and southern hemispheres and examined their contributions to the induction of magnetic fields. We found that the $\alpha$ effect is relatively small, and its sign depends on the polarization of kinetic helicity. In contrast, the $\beta$ effect remains negative regardless of the sign of kinetic helicity. Despite its small magnitude, the $\alpha$ effect plays a crucial role in determining the polarity of helical magnetic structures, while a negative $\beta$ indicates energy diffusion from turbulent regions into the large-scale magnetic field. We derived the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ effects with oppositely polarized kinetic helicity using different approaches, incorporating large-scale magnetic data and turbulent kinetic data. These were used to reproduce the large-scale magnetic field and compare it with DNS results. In the kinematic regime, where the magnetic field strength is weak, our results align well; however, in regions with strong nonlinear magnetic effects, the magnetic field reproduced using turbulent kinetic data diverges. This divergence is attributed to insufficient quenching of the $\beta$ effect, suggesting that including the second-moment terms of velocity in the magnetic field effect would improve the accuracy of the $\beta$ coefficient. In this study, we considered the case of a rotating plasma sphere with $Pr_M = 1$ and low Reynolds numbers. However, in reality, Reynolds numbers are much higher, and $Pr_M$ is much less than 1, which necessitates further studies on this topic. We plan to address this in future research.</description>
