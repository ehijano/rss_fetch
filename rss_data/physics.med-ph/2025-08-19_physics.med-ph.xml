      <title>Stretchable and self-adhesive triboelectric sensor for real-time musculoskeletal monitoring and personalized recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in medical diagnostics have highlighted the importance of wearable technologies for continuous and real-time physiological monitoring. In this study, we introduce a flexible, self-powered triboelectric nanogenerator (MB-TENG) engineered from commercially available medical elastic bandages for biomechanical sensing during rehabilitation and gait analysis. Leveraging the porous and skin-friendly properties of the bandage combined with a PTFE film, the MB-TENG delivers robust electrical performance, achieving a peak open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 122~V, a short-circuit current (ISC) of 25~$\mu$A, and a transferred charge (QSC) of 110~nC, while maintaining long-term stability across 40{,}000 mechanical cycles. Its inherent self-adhesive property allows for multi-layer assembly without extra bonding agents, and mechanical stretching enhances output, enabling dual configurability. A stacked design further improves the power capacity, supporting applications in wearable medical electronics. The MB-TENG device seamlessly conforms to joint surfaces and foot regions, providing accurate detection of motion states and abnormal gait patterns. These features underscore the MB-TENG's potential as a low-cost, scalable platform for personalized rehabilitation, injury monitoring, and early musculoskeletal diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Deformation Driven Suction Cups: A Mechanics-Based Approach to Wearable Electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wearable electronics are emerging as essential tools for health monitoring, haptic feedback, and human-computer interactions. While stable contact at the device-body interface is critical for these applications, it remains challenging due to the skin's softness, roughness, and mechanical variability. Existing methods, such as grounding structures or adhesive tapes, often suffer from contact loss, limited repeatability, and restrictions on the types of electronics they can support. Suction-based adhesives offer a promising alternative by generating negative pressure without requiring tight bands or chemical adhesives. However, most existing cup designs rely on rigid-surface assumptions and overlook mechanical interactions between suction cups and skin. Inspired by traditional cupping therapies, we present a suction-based adhesive system that attaches through elastic deformation and recovery. Using analytical modeling, numerical simulations, and experiments, we present a mechanics-based framework showing how suction performance depends on cup geometry, substrate compliance, and interfacial adhesion. We show that cup geometry should be tailored to substrate stiffness. Wide, flat suction cups perform well on rigid surfaces but fail on soft ones like skin due to substrate intrusion into the chamber. Narrow and tall domes better preserve recoverable volume and generate stronger suction. To improve sealing on rough, dry skin, we introduce a soft, tacky interfacial layer informed by a contact mechanics model. Using our design principles for skin suction adhesives, we demonstrate secure attachment of rigid and flexible components including motion sensors, haptic actuators, and electrophysiological electrodes across diverse anatomical regions. These findings provide a fundamental basis for designing the next generation of skin-friendly adhesives for wearable electronics.</description>

      <title>Accuracy of propagation-based phase-contrast CT under the projection approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray phase-contrast imaging has the potential to improve image contrast with lower dose by probing an object's refractive properties as well as its absorptive properties. To reconstruct a phase-contrast image from a raw dataset, a phase retrieval algorithm must be applied to invert the forward model of the image acquisition scheme. Discrete forward modeling presents unique computational challenges due to high x-ray wave field sampling requirements. At the cost of accuracy, approximations are often applied for the sake of simplicity and experimental convenience. One of the most ubiquitous simplifications is the projection approximation, which neglects refractive effects within an object. The approximation's validity decreases when imaging thicker objects or using a detector with higher spatial resolution. For greater accuracy, one might use the multislice model instead. In this work, we explore the accuracy of the projection approximation in simulated synchrotron micro-CT images. We simulated images using two detector resolutions (0.5 and 2 micron) with either the projection approximation or multislice forward model. Paganin phase retrieval was applied to the resulting datasets, and the final phase-contrast images were reconstructed using filtered back-projection. The 2-micron resolution detector images showed little difference between forward models, indicating the projection approximation is satisfied. With sub-micron resolution, there is a noticeable difference in the phase-contrast images, especially around fine details. An accurate phase retrieval algorithm for such high-resolution data likely requires more detailed forward modeling that avoids making the projection approximation.</description>

      <title>Optimization-based phase retrieval for material decomposition with multi-energy computed tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-energy CT has long demonstrated its ability to enhance image quality with material decomposition. Yet, it has largely been limited to applications that already have high contrast. More recently, x-ray phase-contrast (XPC) imaging has gained interest for its potential to improve detectability in tasks lacking such contrast. Previous work has demonstrated the benefit of combining multi-energy imaging with XPC for material decomposition. While the existing method is promising, its analytical approach requires several approximations that limit its broad applicability, and it is based on projection imaging, requiring separate tomographic reconstruction for three-dimensional (3D) volumes. We propose a natively 3D optimization-based solution that leverages modern computational advances, namely automatic differentiability, to efficiently solve the multi-energy CT phase retrieval problem with a more accurate forward model. In a simulation study, we quantitatively demonstrate the improvement of our proposed technique relative to the existing analytical standard, and we affirm the benefits of phase contrast over traditional absorption-only x-ray imaging.</description>

      <title>Towards a better understanding of abdominal wall biomechanics: in vivo relationship between dynamic intra-abdominal pressure and magnetic resonance imaging measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background In vivo mechanical behaviour of the abdominal wall has been poorly characterised and important details are missing regarding the occurrence and post-operative recurrence rate of hernias which can be as high as 30 %. This study aimed to assess the correlation between abdominal wall displacement and intra-abdominal pressure, as well as abdominal compliance. Methods Eighteen healthy participants performed audio-guided passive (breathing) and active (coughing, Valsalva maneuver) exercises. Axial dynamic changes of abdominal muscles and visceral area were measured using MRI, and intra-abdominal pressure with ingested pressure sensor. Findings Correlations between abdominal wall displacement and intra-abdominal pressure were specific to participant, exercise, and varying between rectus abdominis and lateral muscles. Strong correlations were found between rectus abdominis displacement and intra-abdominal pressure during breathing (r = 0.92 $\pm$ 0.06), as well as lateral muscles displacement with intra-abdominal pressure during coughing and Valsalva maneuver (r = --0.98 $\pm$ 0.03 and -- 0.94 $\pm$ 0.05 respectively). The abdominal pseudo-compliance varied greatly among participants during muscular contraction, the coefficient of variation reaching up to 70 %. Interpretation The combination of intra-abdominal pressure and dynamic MRI measurements enables the identification of participant-specific behaviour pattern. Intra-abdominal pressure and abdominal wall dynamic undergo consistent and predictable interactions. However, this relationship is subject-specific and may not be extrapolated to other individuals. Therefore, both intra-abdominal pressure and abdominal wall motion must be measured in the same participant in order to accurately characterise the abdominal wall behaviour. These results are of great importance for mesh design, surgical decision-making, and personalised healthcare.</description>

      <title>Fast silicon detectors as proton therapy beam monitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low Gain Avalanche Detectors (LGADs) are fast silicon sensors with potential for high-resolution proton beam monitoring. In this work, we investigated their response in a 60 MeV proton beam from an AIC-144 cyclotron. Several features of the pulse structure of the cyclotron were observed for the first time. The detector and acquisition system tested was shown to provide accurate flux measurements up to an instantaneous dose rate of about 7.5 Gy/s. Above this, there is an efficiency loss due to multiple protons crossing the detector, which could be addressed through a redesign of the sensors and electronics. LGADs therefore offer a viable alternative for proton therapy beam diagnostics.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Resolution Benchmark Framework for Spatial Reasoning Assessment in Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents preliminary results in the definition of a comprehensive benchmark framework designed to systematically evaluate spatial reasoning capabilities in neural networks, with a particular focus on morphological properties such as connectivity and distance relationships. The framework is currently being used to study the capabilities of nnU-Net, exploiting the spatial model checker VoxLogicA to generate two distinct categories of synthetic datasets: maze connectivity problems for topological analysis and spatial distance computation tasks for geometric understanding. Each category is evaluated across multiple resolutions to assess scalability and generalization properties. The automated pipeline encompasses a complete machine learning workflow including: synthetic dataset generation, standardized training with cross-validation, inference execution, and comprehensive evaluation using Dice coefficient and IoU (Intersection over Union) metrics. Preliminary experimental results demonstrate significant challenges in neural network spatial reasoning capabilities, revealing systematic failures in basic geometric and topological understanding tasks. The framework provides a reproducible experimental protocol, enabling researchers to identify specific limitations. Such limitations could be addressed through hybrid approaches combining neural networks with symbolic reasoning methods for improved spatial understanding in clinical applications, establishing a foundation for ongoing research into neural network spatial reasoning limitations and potential solutions.</description>

      <title>AI-Augmented Thyroid Scintigraphy for Robust Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: Thyroid scintigraphy plays a vital role in diagnosing a range of thyroid disorders. While deep learning classification models hold significant promise in this domain, their effectiveness is frequently compromised by limited and imbalanced datasets. This study investigates the impact of three data augmentation strategies including Stable Diffusion (SD), Flow Matching (FM), and Conventional Augmentation (CA), on enhancing the performance of a ResNet18 classifier.
  Methods: Anterior thyroid scintigraphy images from 2,954 patients across nine medical centers were classified into four categories: Diffuse Goiter (DG), Nodular Goiter (NG), Normal (NL), and Thyroiditis (TI). Data augmentation was performed using various SD and FM models, resulting in 18 distinct augmentation scenarios. Each augmented dataset was used to train a ResNet18 classifier. Model performance was assessed using class-wise and average precision, recall, F1-score, AUC, and image fidelity metrics (FID and KID).
  Results: FM-based augmentation outperformed all other methods, achieving the highest classification accuracy and lowest FID/KID scores, indicating both improved model generalization and realistic image synthesis. SD1, combining image and prompt inputs in the inference process, was the most effective SD variant, suggesting that physician-generated prompts provide meaningful clinical context. O+FM+CA yielded the most balanced and robust performance across all classes.
  Conclusion: Integrating FM and clinically-informed SD augmentation, especially when guided by expert prompts, substantially improves thyroid scintigraphy classification. These findings highlight the importance of leveraging both structured medical input and advanced generative models for more effective training on limited datasets.</description>

      <title>A High-Granularity Proton CT Enhanced by Track Discrimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Proton Computed Tomography (pCT) provides a promising solution to enhance the accuracy of Relative Stopping Power (RSP) required for proton therapy planning. This research introduces a novel high-granularity pCT architecture that incorporates a silicon pixel tracking system and a calorimetric range telescope, which uniquely integrates range telescope functionality with track discrimination capabilities. The Bortfeld function fitting and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier algorithms are developed and applied for discrimination. In simulation studies, both approaches demonstrate the capability to reduce uncertainty in Water Equivalent Path Length (WEPL) determination for individual proton tracks to below 3~mm. The standard imaging protocol (3.2~mGy, $4\times10^{8}$ protons) achieves sub-millimeter spatial resolution ($\sim$0.5 mm) with sub-1\% RSP accuracy. With proton count requirements reduced by track discrimination, an ultra-low-dose protocol (0.16~mGy, $2\times10^{7}$~protons) is proposed with achieved sub-1\% RSP accuracy and $\sim$1.1~mm spatial resolution in simulation. This low-dose performance significantly expands clinical applicability, particularly for pediatric imaging or frequent imaging scenarios. Furthermore, the target 10 MHz proton detection rate suggests potential for real-time image guidance during radiotherapy. By circumventing the need for ultra-precise energy measurements, this design minimizes hardware complexity and provides a scalable foundation for future pCT systems.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Repair on Dynamic Patient-Specific Left Atrioventricular Valve Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09285v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: To develop and evaluate a dynamic, image-derived patient-specific physical simulation platform for the assessment of left atrioventricular valve (LAVV) repair strategies in pediatric patients with repaired atrioventricular canal defects. Methods: 3D transesophageal echocardiographic images of two patients with regurgitant LAVVs were identified from an institutional database. Custom code in SlicerHeart was used to segment leaflets, define the annulus, and generate patient-specific valve molds. Silicone valve models were fabricated and tested in a pulse duplicator under simulated physiological conditions. Five unrepaired valves were analyzed for manufacturing consistency, and multiple surgical repair techniques were compared for two patient-specific models. Results: Manufacturing variability was low in annular metrics (CV for annular circumference: 2.1; commissural distance: 4.1; annulus height: 14.7) but higher in leaflet closure metrics (billow height: 11.1%; billow volume: 18.9%; tenting height: 45.9%; tenting volume: 73.5%). In Patient 1, cleft closure and an Alfieri stitch both eliminated the regurgitant orifice area, but the Alfieri stitch resulted in elevated mean pressure gradient (17 mmHg vs. 4-9 mmHg for other repairs) and deteriorated with repeated loading. In Patient 2, no repair eliminated regurgitation entirely; however, combining an 11 mm patch augmentation with commissuroplasty reduced regurgitant area to 0.147 cm2, the smallest observed among tested strategies. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the feasibility of a dynamic physical simulation platform for preclinical LAVV repair evaluation. This proof-of-concept work highlights the platform potential for refining repair strategies before clinical application, which may be particularly relevant in small and heterogeneous populations with congenital heart disease.</description>
