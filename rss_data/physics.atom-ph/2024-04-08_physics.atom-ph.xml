      <title>Convergence-acceleration approach to partial-wave expansion of two-electron self-energy contributions to the Lamb shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Methods of bound-state QED that treat the self-energy contributions to the Lamb shift within the partial-wave expansion usually face the problem of slow convergence of the latter. Inspired by an approach formulated in [J. Sapirstein and K. T. Cheng, Phys. Rev. A 108, 042804 (2023)], we propose a modification of the standard procedure for calculating the contributions of two-electron self-energy diagrams. The performance of the method is studied by evaluating the corresponding corrections to the binding energies of He-like ions and by comparing the obtained results with the state-of-the-art values available in the literature: our calculations involving a much smaller number of partial waves show an improvement in accuracy.</description>

      <title>Pushing the limits of negative group velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distortion free negative group velocity pulse propagation is demonstrated in a rare-earth-ion-doped-crystal (RE) through the creation of a carefully designed spectral absorption structure in the inhomogeneous profile of Eu:YSO and subsequently inverting it. The properties of the RE system make it particularly well suited for this since it supports the creation of very sharp, arbitrarily tailored spectral features, which can be coherently inverted by a single pulse thanks to the long coherence time of the transition. All together these properties allow for a large time advancement of pulses without causing distortion. A pulse advancement of 10.9% with respect to the pulse full-width-half-maximum was achieved corresponding to a time-bandwidth product of 0.05. This to our knowledge is the largest time-bandwidth product achieved, with negligible shape distortion and attenuation. Our results show that the rare-earth platform is a powerful test bed for superluminal propagation in particular and dispersion profile programming in general</description>

      <title>Semi-empirical cross-section formulas for electron-impact ionization and rate coefficient calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a semi-empirical formula for the cross section of ionization by electron impact. The formula involves adjustable parameters which are determined by comparison with measured or numerically calculated cross sections. In the latter case, the ions are perturbed by their environment which is a high-density plasma. As a consequence, the cross section is significantly modified. We investigate Be-like carbon, nitrogen and oxygen as well as aluminum ions. We also show that the formula is well-suited for interpolation and extrapolation. Knowing the cross section, we calculate the rate coefficient within the Boltzmann and Fermi-Dirac statistics. In the first case, the rate can be calculated analytically. In the second one, it can be expressed in terms of special functions, but the numerical evaluation is more convenient while providing accurate results. Our results are compared to experiment and to other calculations.</description>

      <title>Axion-mediated electron-nucleus and electron-electron interactions in barium monofluoride molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effects induced by the time-reversal ($\mathcal{T}$) and spatial parity ($\mathcal{P}$) violating electron-nucleus and electron-electron interactions mediated by the axion-like particles (ALPs) in the BaF molecule were estimated. Molecular parameters characterizing these interactions were calculated across a wide range of ALP masses. In case of the electron-nuclear interaction, the effect of the extended nucleus was studied and shown to be significant for heavy ALPs. Based on the calculated molecular parameters, we obtained a link between the $\mathcal{T}$,$\mathcal{P}$-violating energy shift which can be measured in the ongoing experiment designed to search for the electron electric dipole moment using the BaF molecule [A. Boeschoten et al., arXiv:2303.06402 (2023)] and the products of coupling constants of the ALP-electron or ALP-electron and ALP-nucleus interactions.</description>

      <title>Laser Resonance Chromatography: First Commissioning Results and Future Prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report first results obtained during the commissioning of the Laser Resonance Chromatography (LRC) apparatus, which is conceived to enable atomic structure investigations in the region of the heaviest elements beyond nobelium. In our studies we first established optimum conditions for the operation of the different components of the setup, including the radio-frequency quadrupole ion buncher and the cryogenic drift tube, which was operated with helium buffer gas at relatively low electric fields. We used laser ablated hafnium, lutetium, and ytterbium cations to assess the chromatography performance of the drift tube at a gas temperature of $295$K. Arrival time distributions of singly charged lutetium revealed two distinct ion mobilities of this ion in the ground and metastable state in helium with a relative difference of about $19$%. By using $^{219}$Rn ions from a $^{223}$Ra recoil source the overall efficiency of the apparatus is found to be $(0.6\pm0.1)$%. The findings help to establish LRC on lutetium, which is the lighter chemical homolog of lawrencium.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the ratio of the scalar polarizability to the vector polarizability for the $6s ^2S_{1/2} \rightarrow 7s ^2S_{1/2}$ transition in cesium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report measurements of the ratio of the scalar polarizability $\alpha$ to the vector polarizability $\beta$ for the $6s ^2S_{1/2} \rightarrow 7s ^2S_{1/2}$ transition in atomic cesium. These measurements are motivated by a discrepancy between the values of the vector transition polarizability as determined using two separate methods. In the present measurement, we use a two-pathway, coherent-control technique in which we observe the interference between a two-photon interaction driven by infrared light at 1079 nm and a linear Stark-induced interaction driven by the mutually-coherent second harmonic of this infrared beam at 540 nm. The result of our measurements is $\alpha/\beta = -9.902 \: (9)$, in good agreement with the previous determination of this ratio. This measurement, critical to the study of atomic parity violation in cesium, does not reduce the discrepancy between the two methods for the determination of the vector polarizability $\beta$ for this transition.</description>

      <title>Entropy Engineered Middle-In Synthesis of Dual Single-Atom Compounds for Nitrate Reduction Reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the immense potential of Dual Single-Atom Compounds (DSACs), the challenges in their synthesis process, including complexity, stability, purity, and scalability, remain primary concerns in current research. Here, we present a general strategy, termed "Entropy-Engineered Middle-In Synthesis of Dual Single-Atom Compounds" (EEMIS-DSAC), which is meticulously crafted to produce a diverse range of DSACs, effectively addressing the aforementioned issues. Our strategy integrates the advantages of both bottom-up and top-down paradigms, proposing a new insight to optimize the catalyst structure. The as-fabricated DSACs exhibited excellent activity and stability in the nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR). In a significant advancement, our prototypical CuNi DSACs demonstrated outstanding performance under conditions reminiscent of industrial wastewater. Specifically, under a NO3- concentration of 2000 ppm, it yielded a Faradaic efficiency (FE) for NH3 of 96.97 %, coupled with a mass productivity of 131.47 mg h-1 mg-1 and an area productivity of 10.06 mg h-1 cm-2. Impressively, even under a heightened NO3- concentration of 0.5 M, the FE for NH3 peaked at 90.61 %, with mass productivity reaching 1024.50 mg h-1 mg-1 and an area productivity of 78.41 mg h-1 cm-2. This work underpins the potential of the EEMIS-DSAC approach, signaling a promising frontier for high-performing DSACs.</description>

      <title>Energy exchange statistics and fluctuation theorem for non-thermal asymptotic states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exchange energy statistics between two bodies at different thermal equilibrium obey the Jarzynski-W\'ojcik fluctuation theorem. The corresponding energy scale factor is the difference of the inverse temperatures associated to the bodies at equilibrium. In this work, we consider a dissipative quantum dynamics leading the quantum system towards a, possibly non-thermal, asymptotic state. To generalize the Jarzynski-W\'ojcik theorem to non-thermal states, we identify a sufficient condition ${\cal I}$ for the existence of an energy scale factor $\eta^{*}$ that is unique, finite and time-independent, such that the characteristic function of the exchange energy distribution becomes identically equal to $1$ for any time. This $\eta^*$ plays the role of the difference of inverse temperatures. We discuss the physical interpretation of the condition ${\cal I}$, showing that it amounts to an almost complete memory loss of the initial state. The robustness of our results against quantifiable deviations from the validity of ${\cal I}$ is evaluated by experimental studies on a single nitrogen-vacancy center subjected to a sequence of laser pulses and dissipation.</description>

      <title>Topological photon pumping in quantum optical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the concept of topological pumping in one-dimensional systems with long-range interactions and apply it to the transport of a photon in quantum optical systems. In our theoretical investigation, we introduce an extended version of the Rice-Mele model with all-to-all exchange interactions. By analyzing its properties, we identify the general conditions for topological pumping and demonstrate the topologically protected and dispersionless transport of a photon on a one-dimensional emitter chain. As concrete examples, we investigate three different popular quantum optics platforms, namely Rydberg atom lattices, dense lattices of atoms excited to low-lying electronic states, and atoms coupled to waveguides, using experimentally relevant parameters. We observe that despite the long-ranged character of the dipole-dipole interactions, topological pumping facilitates the transport of a photon with a fidelity per cycle which can reach 99.9%. Moreover, we find that the photon pumping process remains topologically protected against local disorder in the coupling rates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide an overview of standard "projective" quantum measurements with the goal of elucidating connections between theory and experiment. We make use of a unitary "Stinespring" representation of measurements on a dilated Hilbert space that includes both the physical degrees of freedom and those of the measurement apparatus. We explain how this unitary representation (i) is guaranteed by the axioms of quantum mechanics, (ii) relates to both the Kraus and von Neumann representations, and (iii) corresponds to the physical time evolution of the system and apparatus during the measurement process. The Stinespring representation also offers significant conceptual insight into measurements, helps connects theory and experiment, is particularly useful in describing protocols involving midcircuit measurements and outcome-dependent operations, and establishes that all quantum operations are compatible with relativistic locality, among other insights.</description>

      <title>In-situ Imaging of a Single-Atom Wave Packet in Continuous Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The wave nature of matter remains one of the most striking aspects of quantum mechanics. Since its inception, a wealth of experiments has demonstrated the interference, diffraction or scattering of massive particles. More recently, experiments with ever increasing control and resolution have allowed imaging the wavefunction of individual atoms. Here, we use quantum gas microscopy to image the in-situ spatial distribution of deterministically prepared single-atom wave packets as they expand in a plane. We achieve this by controllably projecting the expanding wavefunction onto the sites of a deep optical lattice and subsequently performing single-atom imaging. The protocol established here for imaging extended wave packets via quantum gas microscopy is readily applicable to the wavefunction of interacting many-body systems in continuous space, promising a direct access to their microscopic properties, including spatial correlation functions up to high order and large distances.</description>

      <title>Attosecond Rabi Oscillations in High Harmonic Generation Resonantly Driven by Extreme Ultraviolet Laser Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-order harmonic generation driven by intense extreme ultraviolet (EUV) fields merges quantum optics and attosecond science, giving rise to an appealing route for the generation of coherent EUV and soft X-ray light for high-resolution imaging and spectroscopies. We theoretically investigate ultrafast resonant dynamics during the interaction of He atoms with strong extreme ultraviolet pulses. At high driving intensities, we identify record fast attosecond Rabi oscillations imprinting observable signatures in the high harmonic spectrum. At field strengths suppressing the Coulomb potential barrier for all the bounded states, we demonstrate the survival of the attosecond two-level dynamics for several Rabi cycles. Consequently, this intense EUV laser-atom interaction reveals a new strong-field scenario where the resonant coupling of two-level bound-bound transitions prevails, contrasting with the dominance of bound-continuum transitions in the conventional strong-field infrared regimes. These findings set an interesting perspective for extreme attosecond nonlinear optics with intense short-wavelength fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2111.10129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum non-Gaussian mechanical states from inherently nonlinear quantum processes are already required in a range of applications spanning from quantum sensing up to quantum computing with continuous variables. The discrete building blocks of such states are the energy eigenstates - Fock states. Despite the progress in their preparation, the remaining imperfections can still invisibly cause loss of the critical quantum non-Gaussian aspects of the phonon distribution relevant in the applications. We derive the most challenging hierarchy of quantum non-Gaussian criteria for the individual mechanical Fock states and demonstrate its implementation on the characterization of single trapped-ion oscillator states up to 10~phonons. We analyze the depth of quantum non-Gaussian features under mechanical heating and predict their application in quantum sensing. These results uncover that the crucial quantum non-Gaussian features are demanded to reach quantum advantage in the applications.</description>

      <title>Probing pair correlations in Fermi gases with Ramsey-Bragg interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an interferometric method to probe pair correlations in a gas of spin-1/2 fermions. The method consists of a Ramsey sequence where both spin states of the Fermi gas are set in a superposition of a state at rest and a state with a large recoil velocity. The two-body density matrix is extracted via the fluctuations of the transferred fraction to the recoiled state. In the pair-condensed phase, the off-diagonal long-range order is directly reflected in the asymptotic behavior of the interferometric signal for long interrogation times. The method also allows to probe the spatial structure of the condensed pairs: the interferometric signal is an oscillating function of the interrogation time in the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer regime; it becomes an overdamped function in the molecular Bose-Einstein condensate regime.</description>
