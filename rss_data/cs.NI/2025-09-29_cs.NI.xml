      <title>Context-Aware Hybrid Routing in Bluetooth Mesh Networks Using Multi-Model Machine Learning and AODV Fallback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bluetooth-based mesh networks offer a promising infrastructure for offline communication in emergency and resource constrained scenarios. However, traditional routing strategies such as Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) often degrade under congestion and dynamic topological changes. This study proposes a hybrid intelligent routing framework that augments AODV with supervised machine learning to improve next-hop selection under varied network constraints. The framework integrates four predictive models: a delivery success classifier, a TTL regressor, a delay regressor, and a forwarder suitability classifier, into a unified scoring mechanism that dynamically ranks neighbors during multi-hop message transmission. A simulation environment with stationary node deployments was developed, incorporating buffer constraints and device heterogeneity to evaluate three strategies: baseline AODV, a partial hybrid ML model (ABC), and the full hybrid ML model (ABCD). Across ten scenarios, the Hybrid ABCD model achieves approximately 99.97 percent packet delivery under these controlled conditions, significantly outperforming both the baseline and intermediate approaches. The results demonstrate that lightweight, explainable machine learning models can enhance routing reliability and adaptability in Bluetooth mesh networks, particularly in infrastructure-less environments where delivery success is prioritized over latency constraints.</description>

      <title>A Target-Agnostic Protocol-Independent Interface for the Transport Layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transport protocols are fundamental to network communications, continuously evolving to meet the demands of new applications, workloads, and network architectures while running in a wide range of execution environments (a.k.a targets). We argue that this diversity across protocols and targets calls for a high-level, target-agnostic programming abstraction for the transport layer. Specifically, we propose to specify transport protocols as high-level programs that take an event and flow state as input, and using constrained C-like constructs, produce the updated state along with target-agnostic instructions for key transport operations such as data reassembly, packet generation and scheduling, and timer manipulations.
  We show the benefits of our high-level transport programs by developing multiple transport protocols in our programming framework called TINF, developing two TINF- compliant backends, one in DPDK and one in Linux eXpress DataPath, and deploying TINF programs for multiple protocols across both backends. Inspired by the benefits unlocked by L2/L3 packet-processing languages like P4, we believe target-agnostic transport programs can reduce the development effort for transport protocols, enable automated analysis and formal verification of the transport layer, and further research in programmable targets for transport protocols.</description>

      <title>eXplainable Artificial Intelligence for RL-based Networking Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents have been widely used to improve networking tasks. However, understanding the decisions made by these agents is essential for their broader adoption in networking and network management. To address this, we introduce eXplaNet - a pipeline grounded in explainable artificial intelligence - designed to help networking researchers and practitioners gain deeper insights into the decision-making processes of RL-based solutions. We demonstrate how eXplaNet can be applied to refine a routing solution powered by a Q-learning agent, specifically by improving its reward function. In addition, we discuss the opportunities and challenges of incorporating explainability into RL to better optimize network performance.</description>

      <title>XenoFlow: How Fast Can a SmartNIC-Based DNS Load Balancer Run?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advent of programmable network hardware, more and more
  functionality can be moved from software running on general purpose CPUs to
  the NIC. Early NICs only allowed offloading fixed functions like checksum
  computation. Recent NICs like the Nvidia Bluefield-3 allow a fully
  programmable dataplane. In this paper, we present our first steps towards a
  load balancer named XenoFlow running on the Bluefield-3. Furthermore, we
  show the capabilities and limitations of the Bluefield-3 eSwitch. Our
  results show that the Bluefield-3 will not achieve line rate with only 2
  entries in a Flow Pipe. However, we also show the adventages of hardware
  offloading on the NIC and being closer to the network. With XenoFlow, we
  achieve an 44% lower latency compared to a comparable eBPF-based load
  balancer running on the host. Furthermore, XenoFlow achieves this low
  latency even under high load.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Open-Source Large Language Models for Technical Telecom Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across various fields. However, their performance in technical domains such as telecommunications remains underexplored. This paper evaluates two open-source LLMs, Gemma 3 27B and DeepSeek R1 32B, on factual and reasoning-based questions derived from advanced wireless communications material. We construct a benchmark of 105 question-answer pairs and assess performance using lexical metrics, semantic similarity, and LLM-as-a-judge scoring. We also analyze consistency, judgment reliability, and hallucination through source attribution and score variance. Results show that Gemma excels in semantic fidelity and LLM-rated correctness, while DeepSeek demonstrates slightly higher lexical consistency. Additional findings highlight current limitations in telecom applications and the need for domain-adapted models to support trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (AI) assistants in engineering.</description>

      <title>Extreme Value Theory-enhanced Radio Maps for Handovers in Ultra-reliable Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient handover (HO) strategies are essential for maintaining the stringent performance requirements of ultra-reliable communication (URC) systems. This work introduces a novel HO framework designed from a physical-layer perspective, where the decision-making process focuses on determining the optimal time and location for performing HOs. Leveraging extreme value theory (EVT) and statistical radio maps, the proposed method predicts signal behaviour and enables efficient resource allocation. The framework ensures seamless HOs and improved system performance by facilitating effective resource transitions and coordination across spatial locations while incorporating mechanisms to mitigate the ping-pong effect. Comparative evaluations demonstrate that this strategy provides superior service availability and energy efficiency than traditional HO mechanisms, highlighting its effectiveness in URC environments.</description>

      <title>Bridging Technical Capability and User Accessibility: Off-grid Civilian Emergency Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During large-scale crises disrupting cellular and Internet infrastructure, civilians lack reliable methods for communication, aid coordination, and access to trustworthy information. This paper presents a unified emergency communication system integrating a low-power, long-range network with a crisis-oriented smartphone application, enabling decentralized and off-grid civilian communication. Unlike previous solutions separating physical layer resilience from user layer usability, our design merges these aspects into a cohesive crisis-tailored framework.
  The system is evaluated in two dimensions: communication performance and application functionality. Field experiments in urban Z\"urich demonstrate that the 868 MHz band, using the LongFast configuration, achieves a communication range of up to 1.2 km with 92% Packet Delivery Ratio, validating network robustness under real-world infrastructure degraded conditions. In parallel, a purpose-built mobile application featuring peer-to-peer messaging, identity verification, and community moderation was evaluated through a requirements-based analysis.</description>

      <title>MobiLLM: An Agentic AI Framework for Closed-Loop Threat Mitigation in 6G Open RANs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution toward 6G networks is being accelerated by the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) paradigm -- an open, interoperable architecture that enables intelligent, modular applications across public telecom and private enterprise domains. While this openness creates unprecedented opportunities for innovation, it also expands the attack surface, demanding resilient, low-cost, and autonomous security solutions. Legacy defenses remain largely reactive, labor-intensive, and inadequate for the scale and complexity of next-generation systems. Current O-RAN applications focus mainly on network optimization or passive threat detection, with limited capability for closed-loop, automated response.
  To address this critical gap, we present an agentic AI framework for fully automated, end-to-end threat mitigation in 6G O-RAN environments. MobiLLM orchestrates security workflows through a modular multi-agent system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework features a Threat Analysis Agent for real-time data triage, a Threat Classification Agent that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to map anomalies to specific countermeasures, and a Threat Response Agent that safely operationalizes mitigation actions via O-RAN control interfaces. Grounded in trusted knowledge bases such as the MITRE FiGHT framework and 3GPP specifications, and equipped with robust safety guardrails, MobiLLM provides a blueprint for trustworthy AI-driven network security. Initial evaluations demonstrate that MobiLLM can effectively identify and orchestrate complex mitigation strategies, significantly reducing response latency and showcasing the feasibility of autonomous security operations in 6G.</description>

      <title>QECO: A QoE-Oriented Computation Offloading Algorithm based on Deep Reinforcement Learning for Mobile Edge Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02525v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the realm of mobile edge computing (MEC), efficient computation task offloading plays a pivotal role in ensuring a seamless quality of experience (QoE) for users. Maintaining a high QoE is paramount in today's interconnected world, where users demand reliable services. This challenge stands as one of the most primary key factors contributing to handling dynamic and uncertain mobile environments. In this study, we delve into computation offloading in MEC systems, where strict task processing deadlines and energy constraints can adversely affect the system performance. We formulate the computation task offloading problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) to maximize the long-term QoE of each user individually. We propose a distributed QoE-oriented computation offloading (QECO) algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) that empowers mobile devices to make their offloading decisions without requiring knowledge of decisions made by other devices. Through numerical studies, we evaluate the performance of QECO. Simulation results reveal that compared to the state-of-the-art existing works, QECO increases the number of completed tasks by up to 14.4%, while simultaneously reducing task delay and energy consumption by 9.2% and 6.3%, respectively. Together, these improvements result in a significant average QoE enhancement of 37.1%. This substantial improvement is achieved by accurately accounting for user dynamics and edge server workloads when making intelligent offloading decisions. This highlights QECO's effectiveness in enhancing users' experience in MEC systems.</description>

      <title>Experimental Study of Low-Latency Video Streaming in an ORAN Setup with Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12751v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current Adaptive Bit Rate (ABR) methods react to network congestion after it occurs, causing application layer buffering and latency spikes in live video streaming. We introduce a proactive semantic control channel that enables coordination between Open Radio Access Network (ORAN) xApp, Mobile Edge computing (MEC), and User Equipment (UE) components for seamless live video streaming between mobile devices. When the transmitting UE experiences poor Uplink (UL) conditions, the MEC proactively instructs downscaling based on low-level RAN metrics, including channel SNR updated every millisecond, preventing buffering before it occurs. A Generative AI (GAI) module at the MEC reconstructs high-quality frames from downscaled video before forwarding to the receiving UE via the typically more robust Downlink (DL). Experimental validation on a live ORAN testbed with 50 video streams shows that our approach reduces latency tail behavior while achieving up to 4 dB improvement in PSNR and 15 points in VMAF compared to reactive ABR methods. The proactive control eliminates latency spikes exceeding 600 ms, demonstrating effective cross-layer coordination for latency-critical live video streaming.</description>

      <title>Policy Design in Zero-Trust Distributed Networks: Challenges and Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04526v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional security architectures are becoming more vulnerable to distributed attacks due to significant dependence on trust. This will further escalate when implementing agentic AI within the systems, as more components must be secured over a similar distributed space. These scenarios can be observed in consumer technologies, such as the dense Internet of things (IoT). Here, zero-trust architecture (ZTA) can be seen as a potential solution, which relies on a key principle of not giving users explicit trust, instead always verifying their privileges whenever a request is made. However, the overall security in ZTA is managed through its policies, and unverified policies can lead to unauthorized access. Thus, this paper explores challenges and solutions for ZTA policy design in the context of distributed networks, which is referred to as zero-trust distributed networks (ZTDN). This is followed by a case-study on formal verification of policies using UPPAAL. Subsequently, the importance of accountability and responsibility in the system's security is discussed.</description>
