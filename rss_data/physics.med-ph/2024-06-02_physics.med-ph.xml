      <title>Geometric Characterization of Rat Urinary Bladder Wall During Ex-Vivo Filling Using Micro-Computed Tomography (Micro-CT)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study employs micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) to unravel the geometrical intricacies of the rat urinary bladder wall during various states of ex-vivo filling, contrasting markedly with the commonly held idealizations of uniform bladder geometry. Through precise 3D reconstructions at resolutions between 10-20 micrometers, the research meticulously documents the bladder's morphological transformations across different filling pressures. The findings illuminate substantial deviations from the theoretical model of a uniformly thick, spherical bladder, particularly underlined by variations in wall thickness and bladder volume during the transition from voided to filled states. These results are pivotal for refining mechanical models of bladder function, which have traditionally oversimplified the complex geometrical and biomechanical behavior of the bladder. Moreover, this study underscores the potential of micro-CT in providing a deeper understanding of bladder mechanics, essential for advancing therapeutic strategies for conditions like bladder outlet obstruction (BOO), thereby enhancing both surgical and pharmacological treatment paradigms.</description>

      <title>Assessment of different head tilt angles in volumetric modulated arc therapy for hippocampus-avoidance whole-brain radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: We aims to examine the impact of different head tilt angles on the dose distribution in the whole-brain target area and organs at risk. It also aims to determine the head tilt angle to achieve optimal radiation therapy outcomes. Methods: CT images were collected from 8 brain metastases patients at 5 different groups of head tilt angle. The treatment plans were designed using the volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) technique. The 5 groups of tilt angle were as follows: [0,10), [10,20), [20,30), [30,40), and [40,45]. The analysis involved assessing parameters such as the uniformity index, conformity index, average dose delivered to the target, dose coverage of the target, hot spots within the target area, maximum dose, and average dose received by organs at risk. Additionally, the study evaluated the correlation between hippocampal dose and other factors and established linear regression models. Results: Significant differences in dosimetric results were observed between the [40,45] and [0,10) head tilt angles. The [40,45] angle showed significant differences compared to the [0,10) angle in the average dose in the target area, dose uniformity, hotspots in the target area, maximum hippocampal dose, maximum dose in the lens, and average dose in the lens. There is a moderate correlation between the maximum dose in the hippocampi and the PTV length. Likewise, the mean dose in the hippocampi is significantly correlated with the hippocampi length. Conclusion: The VMAT plan with a head tilt angle of [40,45] met all dose constraints and demonstrated improved uniformity of the target area while reducing the dose to organs at risk. Furthermore, the linear regression models suggest that increasing the head tilt angle within the current range of [0,45] is likely to lead to a decrease in the average hippocampal dose.</description>

      <title>A transportable hyperspectral imaging setup based on fast, high-density spectral scanning for in situ quantitative biochemical mapping of fresh tissue biopsies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Histopathological examination of surgical biopsies, such as in glioma and glioblastoma resection, is hindered in current clinical practice by the long times required for the laboratory analysis and pathological screening, typically taking several days or even weeks to be completed. We propose here a transportable, high-density, spectral-scanning based hyperspectral imaging setup, named HyperProbe1, that can provide in situ, fast biochemical analysis and mapping of fresh surgical tissue samples, right after excision, and without the need of fixing or staining. HyperProbe1 is based on spectral scanning via supercontinuum laser illumination filtered with acousto-optic tuneable filters. Such methodology allows the user to select any number and type of wavelength bands in the visible and near-infrared range between 510 and 900 nm (up to 79), and to reconstruct 3D hypercubes composed of high-resolution, widefield images of the surgical samples, where each pixel is associated with a complete spectrum. The system is applied on 11 fresh surgical biopsies of glioma from routine patients, including different grades of tumour classification. Quantitative analysis of the composition of the tissue is performed via fast spectral unmixing to reconstruct mapping of major biomarkers. We also provided a preliminary attempt to infer tumour classification based on differences of composition in the samples, suggesting the possibility to use lipid content and differential cytochrome-c-oxidase concentrations to distinguish between lower and higher grade gliomas. A proof-of-concept of the performances of HyperProbe1 for quantitative, biochemical mapping of surgical biopsies is demonstrated, paving the way for improving current post-surgical, histopathological practice via non-destructive, in situ streamlined screening of fresh tissue samples in a matter of minutes after excision.</description>

      <title>Analysis of clinical, dosimetric and radiomic features for predicting local failure after stereotactic radiotherapy of brain metastases in malignant melanoma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: The aim of this study was to investigate the role of clinical, dosimetric and pretherapeutic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features for lesion-specific outcome prediction of stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) in patients with brain metastases from malignant melanoma (MBM).
  Methods: In this multicenter, retrospective analysis, we reviewed 517 MBM from 130 patients treated with SRT (single fraction or hypofractionated). For each gross tumor volume (GTV) 1576 radiomic features (RF) were calculated (788 each for the GTV and for a 3 mm margin around the GTV). Clinical parameters, radiation dose and RF from pretherapeutic contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI from different institutions were evaluated with a feature processing and elimination pipeline in a nested cross-validation scheme.
  Results: Seventy-two (72) of 517 lesions (13.9%) showed a local failure (LF) after SRT. The processing pipeline showed clinical, dosimetric and radiomic features providing information for LF prediction. The most prominent ones were the correlation of the gray level co-occurrence matrix of the margin (hazard ratio (HR): 0.37, confidence interval (CI): 0.23-0.58) and systemic therapy before SRT (HR: 0.55, CI: 0.42-0.70). The majority of RF associated with LF was calculated in the margin around the GTV.
  Conclusions: Pretherapeutic MRI based RF connected with lesion-specific outcome after SRT could be identified, despite multicentric data and minor differences in imaging protocols. Image data analysis of the surrounding metastatic environment may provide therapy-relevant information with the potential to further individualize radiotherapy strategies.</description>

      <title>An automated pipeline for computation and analysis of functional ventilation and perfusion lung MRI with matrix pencil decomposition: TrueLung</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18275v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: To introduce and evaluate TrueLung, an automated pipeline for computation and analysis of free-breathing and contrast-agent free pulmonary functional MRI.
  Material and Methods: time-resolved ultra-fast bSSFP acquisitions are transferred to TrueLung, which includes image quality checks, image registration, and computation of perfusion and ventilation maps with matrix pencil decomposition. Neural network whole-lung and lobar segmentations allow quantification of impaired relative perfusion (RQ) and fractional ventilation (RFV). TrueLung delivers functional maps and quantitative outcomes, reported for clinicians in concise documents. We evaluated the pipeline in 75 cystic fibrosis children. Whole-lung and lobar segmentations were manually refined when necessary, and the impact on RQ and RFV was quantified.
  Results: Functional imaging was performed at 7.9 $\pm$ 1.8 (mean $\pm$ SD) coronal slice positions per patient, totaling on average 6min 20s scan time per patient. The whole pipeline required 20min calculation time per subject. TrueLung delivered the functional maps of all the subjects for radiological assessment. Quality controlling maps and segmentations lasted 1min 12s per patient. The automated segmentations and quantification of whole-lung defects were satisfying in 88% of patients (97% of slices) and the lobar quantification in 73% (93% of slices). The segmentations refinements required 16s per patient for the whole-lung, and 2min 10s for the lobe masks. The relative differences in RFV and RQ between fully-automated and manually refined data were marginal.
  Conclusions: TrueLung quickly delivers functional maps and quantitative outcomes in an objective and standardized way, suitable for radiological and pneumological assessment with minimal manual input. TrueLung can be used for clinical research in cystic fibrosis and might be applied across various lung diseases.</description>
