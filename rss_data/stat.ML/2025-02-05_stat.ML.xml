      <title>Doubly Robust Monte Carlo Tree Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Doubly Robust Monte Carlo Tree Search (DR-MCTS), a novel algorithm that integrates Doubly Robust (DR) off-policy estimation into Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to enhance sample efficiency and decision quality in complex environments. Our approach introduces a hybrid estimator that combines MCTS rollouts with DR estimation, offering theoretical guarantees of unbiasedness and variance reduction under specified conditions. Empirical evaluations in Tic-Tac-Toe and the partially observable VirtualHome environment demonstrate DR-MCTS's superior performance over standard MCTS. In Tic-Tac-Toe, DR-MCTS achieves an 88% win rate compared to a 10% win rate for standard MCTS. In compound VirtualHome tasks, DR-MCTS attains a 20.7% success rate versus 10.3% for standard MCTS. Our scaling analysis reveals that DR-MCTS exhibits better sample efficiency, notably outperforming standard MCTS with larger language models while using a smaller model. These results underscore DR-MCTS's potential for efficient decision-making in complex, real-world scenarios where sample efficiency is paramount.</description>

      <title>Graph Canonical Correlation Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is a widely used technique for estimating associations between two sets of multi-dimensional variables. Recent advancements in CCA methods have expanded their application to decipher the interactions of multiomics datasets, imaging-omics datasets, and more. However, conventional CCA methods are limited in their ability to incorporate structured patterns in the cross-correlation matrix, potentially leading to suboptimal estimations. To address this limitation, we propose the graph Canonical Correlation Analysis (gCCA) approach, which calculates canonical correlations based on the graph structure of the cross-correlation matrix between the two sets of variables. We develop computationally efficient algorithms for gCCA, and provide theoretical results for finite sample analysis of best subset selection and canonical correlation estimation by introducing concentration inequalities and stopping time rule based on martingale theories. Extensive simulations demonstrate that gCCA outperforms competing CCA methods. Additionally, we apply gCCA to a multiomics dataset of DNA methylation and RNA-seq transcriptomics, identifying both positively and negatively regulated gene expression pathways by DNA methylation pathways.</description>

      <title>Poisson Hierarchical Indian Buffet Processes for Within and Across Group Sharing of Latent Features-With Indications for Microbiome Species Sampling Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a comprehensive Bayesian posterior analysis of what we term Poisson Hierarchical Indian Buffet Processes, designed for complex random sparse count species sampling models that allow for the sharing of information across and within groups. This analysis covers a potentially infinite number of species and unknown parameters, which, within a Bayesian machine learning context, we are able to learn from as more information is sampled. To achieve our refined results, we employ a range of methodologies drawn from Bayesian latent feature models, random occupancy models, and excursion theory. Despite this complexity, our goal is to make our findings accessible to practitioners, including those who may not be familiar with these areas. To facilitate understanding, we adopt a pseudo-expository style that emphasizes clarity and practical utility. We aim to express our findings in a language that resonates with experts in microbiome and ecological studies, addressing gaps in modeling capabilities while acknowledging that we are not experts ourselves in these fields. This approach encourages the use of our models as basic components of more sophisticated frameworks employed by domain experts, embodying the spirit of the seminal work on the Dirichlet Process. Ultimately, our refined posterior analysis not only yields tractable computational procedures but also enables practical statistical implementation and provides a clear mapping to relevant quantities in microbiome analysis.</description>

      <title>Local minima of the empirical risk in high dimension: General theorems and convex examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a general model for high-dimensional empirical risk minimization whereby the data $\mathbf{x}_i$ are $d$-dimensional isotropic Gaussian vectors, the model is parametrized by $\mathbf{\Theta}\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times k}$, and the loss depends on the data via the projection $\mathbf{\Theta}^\mathsf{T}\mathbf{x}_i$. This setting covers as special cases classical statistics methods (e.g. multinomial regression and other generalized linear models), but also two-layer fully connected neural networks with $k$ hidden neurons. We use the Kac-Rice formula from Gaussian process theory to derive a bound on the expected number of local minima of this empirical risk, under the proportional asymptotics in which $n,d\to\infty$, with $n\asymp d$. Via Markov's inequality, this bound allows to determine the positions of these minimizers (with exponential deviation bounds) and hence derive sharp asymptotics on the estimation and prediction error. In this paper, we apply our characterization to convex losses, where high-dimensional asymptotics were not (in general) rigorously established for $k\ge 2$. We show that our approach is tight and allows to prove previously conjectured results. In addition, we characterize the spectrum of the Hessian at the minimizer. A companion paper applies our general result to non-convex examples.</description>

      <title>Theoretical and Practical Analysis of Fr\'echet Regression via Comparison Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fr\'echet regression extends classical regression methods to non-Euclidean metric spaces, enabling the analysis of data relationships on complex structures such as manifolds and graphs. This work establishes a rigorous theoretical analysis for Fr\'echet regression through the lens of comparison geometry which leads to important considerations for its use in practice. The analysis provides key results on the existence, uniqueness, and stability of the Fr\'echet mean, along with statistical guarantees for nonparametric regression, including exponential concentration bounds and convergence rates. Additionally, insights into angle stability reveal the interplay between curvature of the manifold and the behavior of the regression estimator in these non-Euclidean contexts. Empirical experiments validate the theoretical findings, demonstrating the effectiveness of proposed hyperbolic mappings, particularly for data with heteroscedasticity, and highlighting the practical usefulness of these results.</description>

      <title>An Information-Theoretic Analysis of Thompson Sampling with Infinite Action Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the Bayesian regret of the Thompson Sampling algorithm for bandit problems, building on the information-theoretic framework introduced by Russo and Van Roy (2015). Specifically, it extends the rate-distortion analysis of Dong and Van Roy (2018), which provides near-optimal bounds for linear bandits. A limitation of these results is the assumption of a finite action space. We address this by extending the analysis to settings with infinite and continuous action spaces. Additionally, we specialize our results to bandit problems with expected rewards that are Lipschitz continuous with respect to the action space, deriving a regret bound that explicitly accounts for the complexity of the action space.</description>

      <title>Variance-Adjusted Cosine Distance as Similarity Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosine similarity is a popular distance measure that measures the similarity between two vectors in the inner product space. It is widely used in many data classification algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbors, Clustering etc. This study demonstrates limitations of application of cosine similarity. Particularly, this study demonstrates that traditional cosine similarity metric is valid only in the Euclidean space, whereas the original data resides in a random variable space. When there is variance and correlation in the data, then cosine distance is not a completely accurate measure of similarity. While new similarity and distance metrics have been developed to make up for the limitations of cosine similarity, these metrics are used as substitutes to cosine distance, and do not make modifications to cosine distance to overcome its limitations. Subsequently, we propose a modified cosine similarity metric, where cosine distance is adjusted by variance-covariance of the data. Application of variance-adjusted cosine distance gives better similarity performance compared to traditional cosine distance. KNN modelling on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset is performed using both traditional and modified cosine similarity measures and compared. The modified formula shows 100% test accuracy on the data.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretic Proofs for Diffusion Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides an elementary, self-contained analysis of diffusion-based sampling methods for generative modeling. In contrast to existing approaches that rely on continuous-time processes and then discretize, our treatment works directly with discrete-time stochastic processes and yields precise non-asymptotic convergence guarantees under broad assumptions. The key insight is to couple the sampling process of interest with an idealized comparison process that has an explicit Gaussian-convolution structure. We then leverage simple identities from information theory, including the I-MMSE relationship, to bound the discrepancy (in terms of the Kullback-Leibler divergence) between these two discrete-time processes. In particular, we show that, if the diffusion step sizes are chosen sufficiently small and one can approximate certain conditional mean estimators well, then the sampling distribution is provably close to the target distribution. Our results also provide a transparent view on how to accelerate convergence by introducing additional randomness in each step to match higher order moments in the comparison process.</description>

      <title>On the Impact of Performative Risk Minimization for Binary Random Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Performativity, the phenomenon where outcomes are influenced by predictions, is particularly prevalent in social contexts where individuals strategically respond to a deployed model. In order to preserve the high accuracy of machine learning models under distribution shifts caused by performativity, Perdomo et al. (2020) introduced the concept of performative risk minimization (PRM). While this framework ensures model accuracy, it overlooks the impact of the PRM on the underlying distributions and the predictions of the model. In this paper, we initiate the analysis of the impact of PRM, by studying performativity for a sequential performative risk minimization problem with binary random variables and linear performative shifts. We formulate two natural measures of impact. In the case of full information, where the distribution dynamics are known, we derive explicit formulas for the PRM solution and our impact measures. In the case of partial information, we provide performative-aware statistical estimators, as well as simulations. Our analysis contrasts PRM to alternatives that do not model data shift and indicates that PRM can have amplified side effects compared to such methods.</description>

      <title>FAB-PPI: Frequentist, Assisted by Bayes, Prediction-Powered Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prediction-powered inference (PPI) enables valid statistical inference by combining experimental data with machine learning predictions. When a sufficient number of high-quality predictions is available, PPI results in more accurate estimates and tighter confidence intervals than traditional methods. In this paper, we propose to inform the PPI framework with prior knowledge on the quality of the predictions. The resulting method, which we call frequentist, assisted by Bayes, PPI (FAB-PPI), improves over PPI when the observed prediction quality is likely under the prior, while maintaining its frequentist guarantees. Furthermore, when using heavy-tailed priors, FAB-PPI adaptively reverts to standard PPI in low prior probability regions. We demonstrate the benefits of FAB-PPI in real and synthetic examples.</description>

      <title>A Scalable Crawling Algorithm Utilizing Noisy Change-Indicating Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Web refresh crawling is the problem of keeping a cache of web pages fresh, that is, having the most recent copy available when a page is requested, given a limited bandwidth available to the crawler. Under the assumption that the change and request events, resp., to each web page follow independent Poisson processes, the optimal scheduling policy was derived by Azar et al. 2018. In this paper, we study an extension of this problem where side information indicating content changes, such as various types of web pings, for example, signals from sitemaps, content delivery networks, etc., is available. Incorporating such side information into the crawling policy is challenging, because (i) the signals can be noisy with false positive events and with missing change events; and (ii) the crawler should achieve a fair performance over web pages regardless of the quality of the side information, which might differ from web page to web page. We propose a scalable crawling algorithm which (i) uses the noisy side information in an optimal way under mild assumptions; (ii) can be deployed without heavy centralized computation; (iii) is able to crawl web pages at a constant total rate without spikes in the total bandwidth usage over any time interval, and automatically adapt to the new optimal solution when the total bandwidth changes without centralized computation. Experiments clearly demonstrate the versatility of our approach.</description>

      <title>Distribution Transformers: Fast Approximate Bayesian Inference With On-The-Fly Prior Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Bayesian inference provides a principled framework for reasoning under uncertainty, its widespread adoption is limited by the intractability of exact posterior computation, necessitating the use of approximate inference. However, existing methods are often computationally expensive, or demand costly retraining when priors change, limiting their utility, particularly in sequential inference problems such as real-time sensor fusion. To address these challenges, we introduce the Distribution Transformer -- a novel architecture that can learn arbitrary distribution-to-distribution mappings. Our method can be trained to map a prior to the corresponding posterior, conditioned on some dataset -- thus performing approximate Bayesian inference. Our novel architecture represents a prior distribution as a (universally-approximating) Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), and transforms it into a GMM representation of the posterior. The components of the GMM attend to each other via self-attention, and to the datapoints via cross-attention. We demonstrate that Distribution Transformers both maintain flexibility to vary the prior, and significantly reduces computation times-from minutes to milliseconds-while achieving log-likelihood performance on par with or superior to existing approximate inference methods across tasks such as sequential inference, quantum system parameter inference, and Gaussian Process predictive posterior inference with hyperpriors.</description>

      <title>SDE Matching: Scalable and Simulation-Free Training of Latent Stochastic Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Latent Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) is a powerful tool for time series and sequence modeling. However, training Latent SDEs typically relies on adjoint sensitivity methods, which depend on simulation and backpropagation through approximate SDE solutions, which limit scalability. In this work, we propose SDE Matching, a new simulation-free method for training Latent SDEs. Inspired by modern Score- and Flow Matching algorithms for learning generative dynamics, we extend these ideas to the domain of stochastic dynamics for time series and sequence modeling, eliminating the need for costly numerical simulations. Our results demonstrate that SDE Matching achieves performance comparable to adjoint sensitivity methods while drastically reducing computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Catoni Contextual Bandits are Robust to Heavy-tailed Rewards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Typical contextual bandit algorithms assume that the rewards at each round lie in some fixed range $[0, R]$, and their regret scales polynomially with this reward range $R$. However, many practical scenarios naturally involve heavy-tailed rewards or rewards where the worst-case range can be substantially larger than the variance. In this paper, we develop an algorithmic approach building on Catoni's estimator from robust statistics, and apply it to contextual bandits with general function approximation. When the variance of the reward at each round is known, we use a variance-weighted regression approach and establish a regret bound that depends only on the cumulative reward variance and logarithmically on the reward range $R$ as well as the number of rounds $T$. For the unknown-variance case, we further propose a careful peeling-based algorithm and remove the need for cumbersome variance estimation. With additional dependence on the fourth moment, our algorithm also enjoys a variance-based bound with logarithmic reward-range dependence. Moreover, we demonstrate the optimality of the leading-order term in our regret bound through a matching lower bound.</description>

      <title>Metastable Dynamics of Chain-of-Thought Reasoning: Provable Benefits of Search, RL and Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key paradigm to improve the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) is to allocate more inference-time compute to search against a verifier or reward model. This process can then be utilized to refine the pretrained model or distill its reasoning patterns into more efficient models. In this paper, we study inference-time compute by viewing chain-of-thought (CoT) generation as a metastable Markov process: easy reasoning steps (e.g., algebraic manipulations) form densely connected clusters, while hard reasoning steps (e.g., applying a relevant theorem) create sparse, low-probability edges between clusters, leading to phase transitions at longer timescales. Under this framework, we prove that implementing a search protocol that rewards sparse edges improves CoT by decreasing the expected number of steps to reach different clusters. In contrast, we establish a limit on reasoning capability when the model is restricted to local information of the pretrained graph. We also show that the information gained by search can be utilized to obtain a better reasoning model: (1) the pretrained model can be directly finetuned to favor sparse edges via policy gradient methods, and moreover (2) a compressed metastable representation of the reasoning dynamics can be distilled into a smaller, more efficient model.</description>

      <title>On The Concurrence of Layer-wise Preconditioning Methods and Provable Feature Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Layer-wise preconditioning methods are a family of memory-efficient optimization algorithms that introduce preconditioners per axis of each layer's weight tensors. These methods have seen a recent resurgence, demonstrating impressive performance relative to entry-wise ("diagonal") preconditioning methods such as Adam(W) on a wide range of neural network optimization tasks. Complementary to their practical performance, we demonstrate that layer-wise preconditioning methods are provably necessary from a statistical perspective. To showcase this, we consider two prototypical models, linear representation learning and single-index learning, which are widely used to study how typical algorithms efficiently learn useful features to enable generalization. In these problems, we show SGD is a suboptimal feature learner when extending beyond ideal isotropic inputs $\mathbf{x} \sim \mathsf{N}(\mathbf{0}, \mathbf{I})$ and well-conditioned settings typically assumed in prior work. We demonstrate theoretically and numerically that this suboptimality is fundamental, and that layer-wise preconditioning emerges naturally as the solution. We further show that standard tools like Adam preconditioning and batch-norm only mildly mitigate these issues, supporting the unique benefits of layer-wise preconditioning.</description>

      <title>Estimating Network Models using Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exponential random graph models (ERGMs) are very flexible for modeling network formation but pose difficult estimation challenges due to their intractable normalizing constant. Existing methods, such as MCMC-MLE, rely on sequential simulation at every optimization step. We propose a neural network approach that trains on a single, large set of parameter-simulation pairs to learn the mapping from parameters to average network statistics. Once trained, this map can be inverted, yielding a fast and parallelizable estimation method. The procedure also accommodates extra network statistics to mitigate model misspecification. Some simple illustrative examples show that the method performs well in practice.</description>

      <title>Learning Hyperparameters via a Data-Emphasized Variational Objective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When training large flexible models, practitioners often rely on grid search to select hyperparameters that control over-fitting. This grid search has several disadvantages: the search is computationally expensive, requires carving out a validation set that reduces the available data for training, and requires users to specify candidate values. In this paper, we propose an alternative: directly learning regularization hyperparameters on the full training set via the evidence lower bound ("ELBo") objective from variational methods. For deep neural networks with millions of parameters, we recommend a modified ELBo that upweights the influence of the data likelihood relative to the prior. Our proposed technique overcomes all three disadvantages of grid search. In a case study on transfer learning of image classifiers, we show how our method reduces the 88+ hour grid search of past work to under 3 hours while delivering comparable accuracy. We further demonstrate how our approach enables efficient yet accurate approximations of Gaussian processes with learnable length-scale kernels.</description>

      <title>Invariant Kernels: Rank Stabilization and Generalization Across Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry arises often when learning from high dimensional data. For example, data sets consisting of point clouds, graphs, and unordered sets appear routinely in contemporary applications, and exhibit rich underlying symmetries. Understanding the benefits of symmetry on the statistical and numerical efficiency of learning algorithms is an active area of research. In this work, we show that symmetry has a pronounced impact on the rank of kernel matrices. Specifically, we compute the rank of a polynomial kernel of fixed degree that is invariant under various groups acting independently on its two arguments. In concrete circumstances, including the three aforementioned examples, symmetry dramatically decreases the rank making it independent of the data dimension. In such settings, we show that a simple regression procedure is minimax optimal for estimating an invariant polynomial from finitely many samples drawn across different dimensions. We complete the paper with numerical experiments that illustrate our findings.</description>

      <title>The Ball-Proximal (="Broximal") Point Method: a New Algorithm, Convergence Theory, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-smooth and non-convex global optimization poses significant challenges across various applications, where standard gradient-based methods often struggle. We propose the Ball-Proximal Point Method, Broximal Point Method, or Ball Point Method (BPM) for short - a novel algorithmic framework inspired by the classical Proximal Point Method (PPM) (Rockafellar, 1976), which, as we show, sheds new light on several foundational optimization paradigms and phenomena, including non-convex and non-smooth optimization, acceleration, smoothing, adaptive stepsize selection, and trust-region methods. At the core of BPM lies the ball-proximal ("broximal") operator, which arises from the classical proximal operator by replacing the quadratic distance penalty by a ball constraint. Surprisingly, and in sharp contrast with the sublinear rate of PPM in the nonsmooth convex regime, we prove that BPM converges linearly and in a finite number of steps in the same regime. Furthermore, by introducing the concept of ball-convexity, we prove that BPM retains the same global convergence guarantees under weaker assumptions, making it a powerful tool for a broader class of potentially non-convex optimization problems. Just like PPM plays the role of a conceptual method inspiring the development of practically efficient algorithms and algorithmic elements, e.g., gradient descent, adaptive step sizes, acceleration (Ahn &amp; Sra, 2020), and "W" in AdamW (Zhuang et al., 2022), we believe that BPM should be understood in the same manner: as a blueprint and inspiration for further development.</description>

      <title>Heteroscedastic Double Bayesian Elastic Net</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many practical applications, regression models are employed to uncover relationships between predictors and a response variable, yet the common assumption of constant error variance is frequently violated. This issue is further compounded in high-dimensional settings where the number of predictors exceeds the sample size, necessitating regularization for effective estimation and variable selection. To address this problem, we propose the Heteroscedastic Double Bayesian Elastic Net (HDBEN), a novel framework that jointly models the mean and log-variance using hierarchical Bayesian priors incorporating both $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ penalties. Our approach simultaneously induces sparsity and grouping in the regression coefficients and variance parameters, capturing complex variance structures in the data. Theoretical results demonstrate that proposed HDBEN achieves posterior concentration, variable selection consistency, and asymptotic normality under mild conditions which justifying its behavior. Simulation studies further illustrate that HDBEN outperforms existing methods, particularly in scenarios characterized by heteroscedasticity and high dimensionality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks may naturally favor distance-based representations, where smaller activations indicate closer proximity to learned prototypes. This contrasts with intensity-based approaches, which rely on activation magnitudes. To test this hypothesis, we conducted experiments with six MNIST architectural variants constrained to learn either distance or intensity representations. Our results reveal that the underlying representation affects model performance. We develop a novel geometric framework that explains these findings and introduce OffsetL2, a new architecture based on Mahalanobis distance equations, to further validate this framework. This work highlights the importance of considering distance-based learning in neural network design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bilevel optimization is characterized by a two-level optimization structure, where the upper-level problem is constrained by optimal lower-level solutions, and such structures are prevalent in real-world problems. The constraint by optimal lower-level solutions poses significant challenges, especially in noisy, constrained, and derivative-free settings, as repeating lower-level optimizations is sample inefficient and predicted lower-level solutions may be suboptimal. We present BILevel Bayesian Optimization (BILBO), a novel Bayesian optimization algorithm for general bilevel problems with blackbox functions, which optimizes both upper- and lower-level problems simultaneously, without the repeated lower-level optimization required by existing methods. BILBO samples from confidence-bounds based trusted sets, which bounds the suboptimality on the lower level. Moreover, BILBO selects only one function query per iteration, where the function query selection strategy incorporates the uncertainty of estimated lower-level solutions and includes a conditional reassignment of the query to encourage exploration of the lower-level objective. The performance of BILBO is theoretically guaranteed with a sublinear regret bound for commonly used kernels and is empirically evaluated on several synthetic and real-world problems.</description>

      <title>How Memory in Optimization Algorithms Implicitly Modifies the Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In modern optimization methods used in deep learning, each update depends on the history of previous iterations, often referred to as memory, and this dependence decays fast as the iterates go further into the past. For example, gradient descent with momentum has exponentially decaying memory through exponentially averaged past gradients. We introduce a general technique for identifying a memoryless algorithm that approximates an optimization algorithm with memory. It is obtained by replacing all past iterates in the update by the current one, and then adding a correction term arising from memory (also a function of the current iterate). This correction term can be interpreted as a perturbation of the loss, and the nature of this perturbation can inform how memory implicitly (anti-)regularizes the optimization dynamics. As an application of our theory, we find that Lion does not have the kind of implicit anti-regularization induced by memory that AdamW does, providing a theory-based explanation for Lion's better generalization performance recently documented.</description>

      <title>Flatten Graphs as Sequences: Transformers are Scalable Graph Generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce AutoGraph, a novel autoregressive framework for generating large attributed graphs using decoder-only transformers. At the core of our approach is a reversible "flattening" process that transforms graphs into random sequences. By sampling and learning from these sequences, AutoGraph enables transformers to model and generate complex graph structures in a manner akin to natural language. In contrast to diffusion models that rely on computationally intensive node features, our approach operates exclusively on these sequences. The sampling complexity and sequence length scale linearly with the number of edges, making AutoGraph highly scalable for generating large sparse graphs. Empirically, AutoGraph achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse synthetic and molecular graph generation benchmarks, while delivering a 100-fold generation and a 3-fold training speedup compared to leading diffusion models. Additionally, it demonstrates promising transfer capabilities and supports substructure-conditioned generation without additional fine-tuning. By extending language modeling techniques to graph generation, this work paves the way for developing graph foundation models.</description>

      <title>Bias Detection via Maximum Subgroup Discrepancy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bias evaluation is fundamental to trustworthy AI, both in terms of checking data quality and in terms of checking the outputs of AI systems. In testing data quality, for example, one may study a distance of a given dataset, viewed as a distribution, to a given ground-truth reference dataset. However, classical metrics, such as the Total Variation and the Wasserstein distances, are known to have high sample complexities and, therefore, may fail to provide meaningful distinction in many practical scenarios.
  In this paper, we propose a new notion of distance, the Maximum Subgroup Discrepancy (MSD). In this metric, two distributions are close if, roughly, discrepancies are low for all feature subgroups. While the number of subgroups may be exponential, we show that the sample complexity is linear in the number of features, thus making it feasible for practical applications. Moreover, we provide a practical algorithm for the evaluation of the distance, based on Mixed-integer optimization (MIO). We also note that the proposed distance is easily interpretable, thus providing clearer paths to fixing the biases once they have been identified. It also provides guarantees for all subgroups. Finally, we empirically evaluate, compare with other metrics, and demonstrate the above properties of MSD on real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Exact Sequence Classification with Hardmax Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that hardmax attention transformers perfectly classify datasets of $N$ labeled sequences in $\mathbb{R}^d$, $d\geq 2$. Specifically, given $N$ sequences with an arbitrary but finite length in $\mathbb{R}^d$, we construct a transformer with $\mathcal{O}(N)$ blocks and $\mathcal{O}(Nd)$ parameters perfectly classifying this dataset. Our construction achieves the best complexity estimate to date, independent of the length of the sequences, by innovatively alternating feed-forward and self-attention layers and by capitalizing on the clustering effect inherent to the latter. Our novel constructive method also uses low-rank parameter matrices within the attention mechanism, a common practice in real-life transformer implementations. Consequently, our analysis holds twofold significance: it substantially advances the mathematical theory of transformers and it rigorously justifies their exceptional real-world performance in sequence classification tasks.</description>

      <title>No Metric to Rule Them All: Toward Principled Evaluations of Graph-Learning Datasets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Benchmark datasets have proved pivotal to the success of graph learning, and good benchmark datasets are crucial to guide the development of the field. Recent research has highlighted problems with graph-learning datasets and benchmarking practices -- revealing, for example, that methods which ignore the graph structure can outperform graph-based approaches on popular benchmark datasets. Such findings raise two questions: (1) What makes a good graph-learning dataset, and (2) how can we evaluate dataset quality in graph learning? Our work addresses these questions. As the classic evaluation setup uses datasets to evaluate models, it does not apply to dataset evaluation. Hence, we start from first principles. Observing that graph-learning datasets uniquely combine two modes -- the graph structure and the node features -- , we introduce RINGS, a flexible and extensible mode-perturbation framework to assess the quality of graph-learning datasets based on dataset ablations -- i.e., by quantifying differences between the original dataset and its perturbed representations. Within this framework, we propose two measures -- performance separability and mode complementarity -- as evaluation tools, each assessing, from a distinct angle, the capacity of a graph dataset to benchmark the power and efficacy of graph-learning methods. We demonstrate the utility of our framework for graph-learning dataset evaluation in an extensive set of experiments and derive actionable recommendations for improving the evaluation of graph-learning methods. Our work opens new research directions in data-centric graph learning, and it constitutes a first step toward the systematic evaluation of evaluations.</description>

      <title>Avoiding spurious sharpness minimization broadens applicability of SAM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Curvature regularization techniques like Sharpness Aware Minimization (SAM) have shown great promise in improving generalization on vision tasks. However, we find that SAM performs poorly in domains like natural language processing (NLP), often degrading performance -- even with twice the compute budget. We investigate the discrepancy across domains and find that in the NLP setting, SAM is dominated by regularization of the logit statistics -- instead of improving the geometry of the function itself. We use this observation to develop an alternative algorithm we call Functional-SAM, which regularizes curvature only through modification of the statistics of the overall function implemented by the neural network, and avoids spurious minimization through logit manipulation. Furthermore, we argue that preconditioning the SAM perturbation also prevents spurious minimization, and when combined with Functional-SAM, it gives further improvements. Our proposed algorithms show improved performance over AdamW and SAM baselines when trained for an equal number of steps, in both fixed-length and Chinchilla-style training settings, at various model scales (including billion-parameter scale). On the whole, our work highlights the importance of more precise characterizations of sharpness in broadening the applicability of curvature regularization to large language models (LLMs).</description>

      <title>Privacy Amplification by Structured Subsampling for Deep Differentially Private Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many forms of sensitive data, such as web traffic, mobility data, or hospital occupancy, are inherently sequential. The standard method for training machine learning models while ensuring privacy for units of sensitive information, such as individual hospital visits, is differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD). However, we observe in this work that the formal guarantees of DP-SGD are incompatible with timeseries-specific tasks like forecasting, since they rely on the privacy amplification attained by training on small, unstructured batches sampled from an unstructured dataset. In contrast, batches for forecasting are generated by (1) sampling sequentially structured time series from a dataset, (2) sampling contiguous subsequences from these series, and (3) partitioning them into context and ground-truth forecast windows. We theoretically analyze the privacy amplification attained by this structured subsampling to enable the training of forecasting models with sound and tight event- and user-level privacy guarantees. Towards more private models, we additionally prove how data augmentation amplifies privacy in self-supervised training of sequence models. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that amplification by structured subsampling enables the training of forecasting models with strong formal privacy guarantees.</description>

      <title>Robust and Conjugate Spatio-Temporal Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-space formulations allow for Gaussian process (GP) regression with linear-in-time computational cost in spatio-temporal settings, but performance typically suffers in the presence of outliers. In this paper, we adapt and specialise the robust and conjugate GP (RCGP) framework of Altamirano et al. (2024) to the spatio-temporal setting. In doing so, we obtain an outlier-robust spatio-temporal GP with a computational cost comparable to classical spatio-temporal GPs. We also overcome the three main drawbacks of RCGPs: their unreliable performance when the prior mean is chosen poorly, their lack of reliable uncertainty quantification, and the need to carefully select a hyperparameter by hand. We study our method extensively in finance and weather forecasting applications, demonstrating that it provides a reliable approach to spatio-temporal modelling in the presence of outliers.</description>

      <title>Distributional Diffusion Models with Scoring Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models generate high-quality synthetic data. They operate by defining a continuous-time forward process which gradually adds Gaussian noise to data until fully corrupted. The corresponding reverse process progressively "denoises" a Gaussian sample into a sample from the data distribution. However, generating high-quality outputs requires many discretization steps to obtain a faithful approximation of the reverse process. This is expensive and has motivated the development of many acceleration methods. We propose to accomplish sample generation by learning the posterior {\em distribution} of clean data samples given their noisy versions, instead of only the mean of this distribution. This allows us to sample from the probability transitions of the reverse process on a coarse time scale, significantly accelerating inference with minimal degradation of the quality of the output. This is accomplished by replacing the standard regression loss used to estimate conditional means with a scoring rule. We validate our method on image and robot trajectory generation, where we consistently outperform standard diffusion models at few discretization steps.</description>

      <title>Deep Weight Factorization: Sparse Learning Through the Lens of Artificial Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sparse regularization techniques are well-established in machine learning, yet their application in neural networks remains challenging due to the non-differentiability of penalties like the $L_1$ norm, which is incompatible with stochastic gradient descent. A promising alternative is shallow weight factorization, where weights are decomposed into two factors, allowing for smooth optimization of $L_1$-penalized neural networks by adding differentiable $L_2$ regularization to the factors. In this work, we introduce deep weight factorization, extending previous shallow approaches to more than two factors. We theoretically establish equivalence of our deep factorization with non-convex sparse regularization and analyze its impact on training dynamics and optimization. Due to the limitations posed by standard training practices, we propose a tailored initialization scheme and identify important learning rate requirements necessary for training factorized networks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our deep weight factorization through experiments on various architectures and datasets, consistently outperforming its shallow counterpart and widely used pruning methods.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Exploration for Multi-Reward Multi-Policy Evaluation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the policy evaluation problem in an online multi-reward multi-policy discounted setting, where multiple reward functions must be evaluated simultaneously for different policies. We adopt an $(\epsilon,\delta)$-PAC perspective to achieve $\epsilon$-accurate estimates with high confidence across finite or convex sets of rewards, a setting that has not been investigated in the literature. Building on prior work on Multi-Reward Best Policy Identification, we adapt the MR-NaS exploration scheme to jointly minimize sample complexity for evaluating different policies across different reward sets. Our approach leverages an instance-specific lower bound revealing how the sample complexity scales with a measure of value deviation, guiding the design of an efficient exploration policy. Although computing this bound entails a hard non-convex optimization, we propose an efficient convex approximation that holds for both finite and convex reward sets. Experiments in tabular domains demonstrate the effectiveness of this adaptive exploration scheme.</description>

      <title>A weak convergence approach to large deviations for stochastic approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of stochastic approximations form the theoretical foundation for studying convergence properties of many popular recursive learning algorithms in statistics, machine learning and statistical physics. Large deviations for stochastic approximations provide asymptotic estimates of the probability that the learning algorithm deviates from its expected path, given by a limit ODE, and the large deviation rate function gives insights to the most likely way that such deviations occur.
  In this paper we prove a large deviation principle for general stochastic approximations with state-dependent Markovian noise and decreasing step size. Using the weak convergence approach to large deviations, we generalize previous results for stochastic approximations and identify the appropriate scaling sequence for the large deviation principle. We also give a new representation for the rate function, in which the rate function is expressed as an action functional involving the family of Markov transition kernels. Examples of learning algorithms that are covered by the large deviation principle include stochastic gradient descent, persistent contrastive divergence and the Wang-Landau algorithm.</description>

      <title>Deep Linear Network Training Dynamics from Random Initialization: Data, Width, Depth, and Hyperparameter Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02531v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically characterize gradient descent dynamics in deep linear networks trained at large width from random initialization and on large quantities of random data. Our theory captures the ``wider is better" effect of mean-field/maximum-update parameterized networks as well as hyperparameter transfer effects, which can be contrasted with the neural-tangent parameterization where optimal learning rates shift with model width. We provide asymptotic descriptions of both non-residual and residual neural networks, the latter of which enables an infinite depth limit when branches are scaled as $1/\sqrt{\text{depth}}$. We also compare training with one-pass stochastic gradient descent to the dynamics when training data are repeated at each iteration. Lastly, we show that this model recovers the accelerated power law training dynamics for power law structured data in the rich regime observed in recent works.</description>

      <title>Decision Theoretic Foundations for Conformal Prediction: Optimal Uncertainty Quantification for Risk-Averse Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental question in data-driven decision making is how to quantify the uncertainty of predictions in ways that can usefully inform downstream action. This interface between prediction uncertainty and decision-making is especially important in risk-sensitive domains, such as medicine. In this paper, we develop decision-theoretic foundations that connect uncertainty quantification using prediction sets with risk-averse decision-making. Specifically, we answer three fundamental questions: (1) What is the correct notion of uncertainty quantification for risk-averse decision makers? We prove that prediction sets are optimal for decision makers who wish to optimize their value at risk. (2) What is the optimal policy that a risk averse decision maker should use to map prediction sets to actions? We show that a simple max-min decision policy is optimal for risk-averse decision makers. Finally, (3) How can we derive prediction sets that are optimal for such decision makers? We provide an exact characterization in the population regime and a distribution free finite-sample construction. Answering these questions naturally leads to an algorithm, Risk-Averse Calibration (RAC), which follows a provably optimal design for deriving action policies from predictions. RAC is designed to be both practical-capable of leveraging the quality of predictions in a black-box manner to enhance downstream utility-and safe-adhering to a user-defined risk threshold and optimizing the corresponding risk quantile of the user's downstream utility. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate the significant advantages of RAC in applications such as medical diagnosis and recommendation systems. Specifically, we show that RAC achieves a substantially improved trade-off between safety and utility, offering higher utility compared to existing methods while maintaining the safety guarantee.</description>

Abstract: We introduce STRING: Separable Translationally Invariant Position Encodings. STRING extends Rotary Position Encodings, a recently proposed and widely used algorithm in large language models, via a unifying theoretical framework. Importantly, STRING still provides exact translation invariance, including token coordinates of arbitrary dimensionality, whilst maintaining a low computational footprint. These properties are especially important in robotics, where efficient 3D token representation is key. We integrate STRING into Vision Transformers with RGB(-D) inputs (color plus optional depth), showing substantial gains, e.g. in open-vocabulary object detection and for robotics controllers. We complement our experiments with a rigorous mathematical analysis, proving the universality of our methods.</description>

      <title>Minimax-Optimal Dimension-Reduced Clustering for High-Dimensional Nonspherical Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02580v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In mixture models, nonspherical (anisotropic) noise within each cluster is widely present in real-world data. We study both the minimax rate and optimal statistical procedure for clustering under high-dimensional nonspherical mixture models. In high-dimensional settings, we first establish the information-theoretic limits for clustering under Gaussian mixtures. The minimax lower bound unveils an intriguing informational dimension-reduction phenomenon: there exists a substantial gap between the minimax rate and the oracle clustering risk, with the former determined solely by the projected centers and projected covariance matrices in a low-dimensional space. Motivated by the lower bound, we propose a novel computationally efficient clustering method: Covariance Projected Spectral Clustering (COPO). Its key step is to project the high-dimensional data onto the low-dimensional space spanned by the cluster centers and then use the projected covariance matrices in this space to enhance clustering. We establish tight algorithmic upper bounds for COPO, both for Gaussian noise with flexible covariance and general noise with local dependence. Our theory indicates the minimax-optimality of COPO in the Gaussian case and highlights its adaptivity to a broad spectrum of dependent noise. Extensive simulation studies under various noise structures and real data analysis demonstrate our method's superior performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.01727v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A uniform $k$-{\sc dag} generalizes the uniform random recursive tree by picking $k$ parents uniformly at random from the existing nodes. It starts with $k$ ''roots''. Each of the $k$ roots is assigned a bit. These bits are propagated by a noisy channel. The parents' bits are flipped with probability $p$, and a majority vote is taken. When all nodes have received their bits, the $k$-{\sc dag} is shown without identifying the roots. The goal is to estimate the majority bit among the roots. We identify the threshold for $p$ as a function of $k$ below which the majority rule among all nodes yields an error $c+o(1)$ with $c&lt;1/2$. Above the threshold the majority rule errs with probability $1/2+o(1)$.</description>

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization is a popular approach for optimizing expensive black-box functions. Its key idea is to use a surrogate model to approximate the objective and, importantly, quantify the associated uncertainty that allows a sequential search of query points that balance exploitation-exploration. Gaussian process (GP) has been a primary candidate for the surrogate model, thanks to its Bayesian-principled uncertainty quantification power and modeling flexibility. However, its challenges have also spurred an array of alternatives whose convergence properties could be more opaque. Motivated by these, we study in this paper an axiomatic framework that elicits the minimal requirements to guarantee black-box optimization convergence that could apply beyond GP-based methods. Moreover, we leverage the design freedom in our framework, which we call Pseudo-Bayesian Optimization, to construct empirically superior algorithms. In particular, we show how using simple local regression, and a suitable "randomized prior" construction to quantify uncertainty, not only guarantees convergence but also consistently outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in examples ranging from high-dimensional synthetic experiments to realistic hyperparameter tuning and robotic applications.</description>

      <title>Towards Marginal Fairness Sliced Wasserstein Barycenter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sliced Wasserstein barycenter (SWB) is a widely acknowledged method for efficiently generalizing the averaging operation within probability measure spaces. However, achieving marginal fairness SWB, ensuring approximately equal distances from the barycenter to marginals, remains unexplored. The uniform weighted SWB is not necessarily the optimal choice to obtain the desired marginal fairness barycenter due to the heterogeneous structure of marginals and the non-optimality of the optimization. As the first attempt to tackle the problem, we define the marginal fairness sliced Wasserstein barycenter (MFSWB) as a constrained SWB problem. Due to the computational disadvantages of the formal definition, we propose two hyperparameter-free and computationally tractable surrogate MFSWB problems that implicitly minimize the distances to marginals and encourage marginal fairness at the same time. To further improve the efficiency, we perform slicing distribution selection and obtain the third surrogate definition by introducing a new slicing distribution that focuses more on marginally unfair projecting directions. We discuss the relationship of the three proposed problems and their relationship to sliced multi-marginal Wasserstein distance. Finally, we conduct experiments on finding 3D point-clouds averaging, color harmonization, and training of sliced Wasserstein autoencoder with class-fairness representation to show the favorable performance of the proposed surrogate MFSWB problems.</description>

      <title>A Differential Equation Approach for Wasserstein GANs and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new theoretical lens to view Wasserstein generative adversarial networks (WGANs). To minimize the Wasserstein-1 distance between the true data distribution and our estimate of it, we derive a distribution-dependent ordinary differential equation (ODE) which represents the gradient flow of the Wasserstein-1 loss, and show that a forward Euler discretization of the ODE converges. This inspires a new class of generative models that naturally integrates persistent training (which we call W1-FE). When persistent training is turned off, we prove that W1-FE reduces to WGAN. When we intensify persistent training, W1-FE is shown to outperform WGAN in training experiments from low to high dimensions, in terms of both convergence speed and training results. Intriguingly, one can reap the benefits only when persistent training is carefully integrated through our ODE perspective. As demonstrated numerically, a naive inclusion of persistent training in WGAN (without relying on our ODE framework) can significantly worsen training results.</description>

      <title>Error dynamics of mini-batch gradient descent with random reshuffling for least squares regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the discrete dynamics of mini-batch gradient descent with random reshuffling for least squares regression. We show that the training and generalization errors depend on a sample cross-covariance matrix $Z$ between the original features $X$ and a set of new features $\widetilde{X}$ in which each feature is modified by the mini-batches that appear before it during the learning process in an averaged way. Using this representation, we establish that the dynamics of mini-batch and full-batch gradient descent agree up to leading order with respect to the step size using the linear scaling rule. However, mini-batch gradient descent with random reshuffling exhibits a subtle dependence on the step size that a gradient flow analysis cannot detect, such as converging to a limit that depends on the step size. By comparing $Z$, a non-commutative polynomial of random matrices, with the sample covariance matrix of $X$ asymptotically, we demonstrate that batching affects the dynamics by resulting in a form of shrinkage on the spectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model parsimony is an important \emph{cognitive bias} in data-driven modelling that aids interpretability and helps to prevent over-fitting. Sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) methods are able to learn sparse representations of complex dynamics directly from data, given a basis of library functions. In this work, a novel Bayesian treatment of dictionary learning system identification, as an alternative to SINDy, is envisaged. The proposed method -- Bayesian identification of nonlinear dynamics (BINDy) -- is distinct from previous approaches in that it targets the full joint posterior distribution over both the terms in the library and their parameterisation in the model. This formulation confers the advantage that an arbitrary prior may be placed over the model structure to produce models that are sparse in the model space rather than in parameter space. Because this posterior is defined over parameter vectors that can change in dimension, the inference cannot be performed by standard techniques. Instead, a Gibbs sampler based on reversible-jump Markov-chain Monte-Carlo is proposed. BINDy is shown to compare favourably to ensemble SINDy in three benchmark case-studies. In particular, it is seen that the proposed method is better able to assign high probability to correct model terms.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for a Discrete-Time Linear-Quadratic Control Problem with an Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the discrete-time linear-quadratic (LQ) control model using reinforcement learning (RL). Using entropy to measure the cost of exploration, we prove that the optimal feedback policy for the problem must be Gaussian type. Then, we apply the results of the discrete-time LQ model to solve the discrete-time mean-variance asset-liability management problem and prove our RL algorithm's policy improvement and convergence. Finally, a numerical example sheds light on the theoretical results established using simulations.</description>

      <title>Fisher-Rao Gradient Flows of Linear Programs and State-Action Natural Policy Gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kakade's natural policy gradient method has been studied extensively in recent years, showing linear convergence with and without regularization. We study another natural gradient method based on the Fisher information matrix of the state-action distributions which has received little attention from the theoretical side. Here, the state-action distributions follow the Fisher-Rao gradient flow inside the state-action polytope with respect to a linear potential. Therefore, we study Fisher-Rao gradient flows of linear programs more generally and show linear convergence with a rate that depends on the geometry of the linear program. Equivalently, this yields an estimate on the error induced by entropic regularization of the linear program which improves existing results. We extend these results and show sublinear convergence for perturbed Fisher-Rao gradient flows and natural gradient flows up to an approximation error. In particular, these general results cover the case of state-action natural policy gradients.</description>

      <title>Beyond Random Missingness: Clinically Rethinking for Healthcare Time Series Imputation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17508v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the impact of masking strategies on time series imputation models in healthcare settings. While current approaches predominantly rely on random masking for model evaluation, this practice fails to capture the structured nature of missing patterns in clinical data. Using the PhysioNet Challenge 2012 dataset, we analyse how different masking implementations affect both imputation accuracy and downstream clinical predictions across eleven imputation methods. Our results demonstrate that masking choices significantly influence model performance, while recurrent architectures show more consistent performance across strategies. Analysis of downstream mortality prediction reveals that imputation accuracy doesn't necessarily translate to optimal clinical prediction capabilities. Our findings emphasise the need for clinically-informed masking strategies that better reflect real-world missing patterns in healthcare data, suggesting current evaluation frameworks may need reconsideration for reliable clinical deployment.</description>

      <title>Towards the Transferability of Rewards Recovered via Regularized Inverse Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01793v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aims to infer a reward from expert demonstrations, motivated by the idea that the reward, rather than the policy, is the most succinct and transferable description of a task [Ng et al., 2000]. However, the reward corresponding to an optimal policy is not unique, making it unclear if an IRL-learned reward is transferable to new transition laws in the sense that its optimal policy aligns with the optimal policy corresponding to the expert's true reward. Past work has addressed this problem only under the assumption of full access to the expert's policy, guaranteeing transferability when learning from two experts with the same reward but different transition laws that satisfy a specific rank condition [Rolland et al., 2022]. In this work, we show that the conditions developed under full access to the expert's policy cannot guarantee transferability in the more practical scenario where we have access only to demonstrations of the expert. Instead of a binary rank condition, we propose principal angles as a more refined measure of similarity and dissimilarity between transition laws. Based on this, we then establish two key results: 1) a sufficient condition for transferability to any transition laws when learning from at least two experts with sufficiently different transition laws, and 2) a sufficient condition for transferability to local changes in the transition law when learning from a single expert. Furthermore, we also provide a probably approximately correct (PAC) algorithm and an end-to-end analysis for learning transferable rewards from demonstrations of multiple experts.</description>

      <title>Demystifying Language Model Forgetting with Low-rank Example Associations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14026v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language models (LLMs) suffer from forgetting of upstream data when fine-tuned. Despite efforts on mitigating forgetting, few have investigated whether, and how forgotten upstream examples are dependent on newly learned tasks. Insights on such dependencies enable efficient and targeted mitigation of forgetting. In this paper, we empirically analyze forgetting that occurs in $N$ upstream examples of language modeling or instruction-tuning after fine-tuning LLMs on one of $M$ new tasks, visualized in $M\times N$ matrices. We show that the matrices are often well-approximated with low-rank matrices, indicating the dominance of simple associations between the learned tasks and forgotten upstream examples. Leveraging the analysis, we predict forgetting of upstream examples when fine-tuning on unseen tasks with matrix completion over the empirical associations. This enables fast identification of most forgotten examples without expensive inference on the entire upstream data. The approach, despite simplicity, outperforms prior approaches that learn semantic relationships of learned tasks and upstream examples with LMs for predicting forgetting. We demonstrate the practical utility of our analysis by showing statistically significantly reduced forgetting as we upweight predicted examples for replay at fine-tuning.

      <title>A Deterministic Information Bottleneck Method for Clustering Mixed-Type Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03389v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an information-theoretic method for clustering mixed-type data, that is, data consisting of both continuous and categorical variables. The proposed approach is built on the deterministic variant of the Information Bottleneck algorithm, designed to optimally compress data while preserving its relevant structural information. We evaluate the performance of our method against four well-established clustering techniques for mixed-type data -- KAMILA, K-Prototypes, Factor Analysis for Mixed Data with K-Means, and Partitioning Around Medoids using Gower's dissimilarity -- using both simulated and real-world datasets. The results highlight that the proposed approach offers a competitive alternative to traditional clustering techniques, particularly under specific conditions where heterogeneity in data poses significant challenges.</description>

      <title>Large-scale Time-Varying Portfolio Optimisation using Graph Attention Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15532v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Apart from assessing individual asset performance, investors in financial markets also need to consider how a set of firms performs collectively as a portfolio. Whereas traditional Markowitz-based mean-variance portfolios are widespread, network-based optimisation techniques offer a more flexible tool to capture complex interdependencies between asset values. However, most of the existing studies do not contain firms at risk of default and remove any firms that drop off indices over a certain time. This is the first study to also incorporate such firms in portfolio optimisation on a large scale. We propose and empirically test a novel method that leverages Graph Attention networks (GATs), a subclass of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). GNNs, as deep learning-based models, can exploit network data to uncover nonlinear relationships. Their ability to handle high-dimensional data and accommodate customised layers for specific purposes makes them appealing for large-scale problems such as mid- and small-cap portfolio optimisation. This study utilises 30 years of data on mid-cap firms, creating graphs of firms using distance correlation and the Triangulated Maximally Filtered Graph approach. These graphs are the inputs to a GAT model incorporating weight and allocation constraints and a loss function derived from the Sharpe ratio, thus focusing on maximising portfolio risk-adjusted returns. This new model is benchmarked against a network characteristic-based portfolio, a mean variance-based portfolio, and an equal-weighted portfolio. The results show that the portfolio produced by the GAT-based model outperforms all benchmarks and is consistently superior to other strategies over a long period, while also being informative of market dynamics.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Transformer Captures Spatial-Temporal Dependencies: A Theory for Gaussian Process Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16134v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion Transformer, the backbone of Sora for video generation, successfully scales the capacity of diffusion models, pioneering new avenues for high-fidelity sequential data generation. Unlike static data such as images, sequential data consists of consecutive data frames indexed by time, exhibiting rich spatial and temporal dependencies. These dependencies represent the underlying dynamic model and are critical to validate the generated data. In this paper, we make the first theoretical step towards bridging diffusion transformers for capturing spatial-temporal dependencies. Specifically, we establish score approximation and distribution estimation guarantees of diffusion transformers for learning Gaussian process data with covariance functions of various decay patterns. We highlight how the spatial-temporal dependencies are captured and affect learning efficiency. Our study proposes a novel transformer approximation theory, where the transformer acts to unroll an algorithm. We support our theoretical results by numerical experiments, providing strong evidence that spatial-temporal dependencies are captured within attention layers, aligning with our approximation theory.</description>

      <title>Explosive neural networks via higher-order interactions in curved statistical manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02326v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Higher-order interactions underlie complex phenomena in systems such as biological and artificial neural networks, but their study is challenging due to the scarcity of tractable models. By leveraging a generalisation of the maximum entropy principle, here we introduce curved neural networks as a class of prototypical models with a limited number of parameters that are particularly well-suited for studying higher-order phenomena. Through exact mean-field descriptions, we show that these curved neural networks implement a self-regulating annealing process that can accelerate memory retrieval, leading to explosive order-disorder phase transitions with multi-stability and hysteresis effects. Moreover, by analytically exploring their memory-retrieval capacity using the replica trick near ferromagnetic and spin-glass phase boundaries, we demonstrate that these networks can enhance memory capacity and robustness of retrieval over classical associative-memory networks. Overall, the proposed framework provides parsimonious models amenable to analytical study, revealing novel higher-order phenomena in complex networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19546v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic approximation is an important class of algorithms, and a large body of previous analysis focuses on stochastic approximations driven by contractive operators, which is not applicable in some important reinforcement learning settings. This work instead investigates stochastic approximations with merely nonexpansive operators. In particular, we study nonexpansive stochastic approximations with Markovian noise, providing both asymptotic and finite sample analysis. Key to our analysis are a few novel bounds of noise terms resulting from the Poisson equation. As an application, we prove, for the first time, that the classical tabular average reward temporal difference learning converges to a sample path dependent fixed point.</description>

      <title>Trajectory Flow Matching with Applications to Clinical Time Series Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21154v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling stochastic and irregularly sampled time series is a challenging problem found in a wide range of applications, especially in medicine. Neural stochastic differential equations (Neural SDEs) are an attractive modeling technique for this problem, which parameterize the drift and diffusion terms of an SDE with neural networks. However, current algorithms for training Neural SDEs require backpropagation through the SDE dynamics, greatly limiting their scalability and stability. To address this, we propose Trajectory Flow Matching (TFM), which trains a Neural SDE in a simulation-free manner, bypassing backpropagation through the dynamics. TFM leverages the flow matching technique from generative modeling to model time series. In this work we first establish necessary conditions for TFM to learn time series data. Next, we present a reparameterization trick which improves training stability. Finally, we adapt TFM to the clinical time series setting, demonstrating improved performance on three clinical time series datasets both in terms of absolute performance and uncertainty prediction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are extremely popular and effective for image classification tasks but tend to be overly confident in their predictions. Various works have sought to quantify uncertainty associated with these models, detect out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs, or identify anomalous regions in an image, but limited work has sought to develop a holistic approach that can accurately estimate perception model confidence across various sources of uncertainty. We develop a probabilistic and reconstruction-based competency estimation (PaRCE) method and compare it to existing approaches for uncertainty quantification and OOD detection. We find that our method can best distinguish between correctly classified, misclassified, and OOD samples with anomalous regions, as well as between samples with visual image modifications resulting in high, medium, and low prediction accuracy. We describe how to extend our approach for anomaly localization tasks and demonstrate the ability of our approach to distinguish between regions in an image that are familiar to the perception model from those that are unfamiliar. We find that our method generates interpretable scores that most reliably capture a holistic notion of perception model confidence.</description>

      <title>Edge of Stochastic Stability: Revisiting the Edge of Stability for SGD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20553v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent findings by Cohen et al., 2021, demonstrate that when training neural networks with full-batch gradient descent with a step size of $\eta$, the largest eigenvalue $\lambda_{\max}$ of the full-batch Hessian consistently stabilizes at $\lambda_{\max} = 2/\eta$. These results have significant implications for convergence and generalization. This, however, is not the case of mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (SGD), limiting the broader applicability of its consequences. We show that SGD trains in a different regime we term Edge of Stochastic Stability (EoSS). In this regime, what stabilizes at $2/\eta$ is *Batch Sharpness*: the expected directional curvature of mini-batch Hessians along their corresponding stochastic gradients. As a consequence $\lambda_{\max}$--which is generally smaller than Batch Sharpness--is suppressed, aligning with the long-standing empirical observation that smaller batches and larger step sizes favor flatter minima. We further discuss implications for mathematical modeling of SGD trajectories.</description>

Abstract: Quantum neural networks (QNNs) play an important role as an emerging technology in the rapidly growing field of quantum machine learning. While their empirical success is evident, the theoretical explorations of QNNs, particularly their generalization properties, are less developed and primarily focus on the uniform convergence approach. In this paper, we exploit an advanced tool in classical learning theory, i.e., algorithmic stability, to study the generalization of QNNs. We first establish high-probability generalization bounds for QNNs via uniform stability. Our bounds shed light on the key factors influencing the generalization performance of QNNs and provide practical insights into both the design and training processes. We next explore the generalization of QNNs on near-term noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, highlighting the potential benefits of quantum noise. Moreover, we argue that our previous analysis characterizes worst-case generalization guarantees, and we establish a refined optimization-dependent generalization bound for QNNs via on-average stability. Numerical experiments on various real-world datasets support our theoretical findings.</description>

Abstract: Short text clustering has gained significant attention in the data mining community. However, the limited valuable information contained in short texts often leads to low-discriminative representations, increasing the difficulty of clustering. This paper proposes a novel short text clustering framework, called Reliable \textbf{P}seudo-labeling via \textbf{O}ptimal \textbf{T}ransport with \textbf{A}ttention for Short Text Clustering (\textbf{POTA}), that generate reliable pseudo-labels to aid discriminative representation learning for clustering. Specially, \textbf{POTA} first implements an instance-level attention mechanism to capture the semantic relationships among samples, which are then incorporated as a semantic consistency regularization term into an optimal transport problem. By solving this OT problem, we can yield reliable pseudo-labels that simultaneously account for sample-to-sample semantic consistency and sample-to-cluster global structure information. Additionally, the proposed OT can adaptively estimate cluster distributions, making \textbf{POTA} well-suited for varying degrees of imbalanced datasets. Then, we utilize the pseudo-labels to guide contrastive learning to generate discriminative representations and achieve efficient clustering. Extensive experiments demonstrate \textbf{POTA} outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

      <title>Growing the Efficient Frontier on Panel Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of tree-based models, P-Trees, for analyzing (unbalanced) panel of individual asset returns, generalizing high-dimensional sorting with economic guidance and interpretability. Under the mean-variance efficient framework, P-Trees construct test assets that significantly advance the efficient frontier compared to commonly used test assets, with alphas unexplained by benchmark pricing models. P-Tree tangency portfolios also constitute traded factors, recovering the pricing kernel and outperforming popular observable and latent factor models for investments and cross-sectional pricing. Finally, P-Trees capture the complexity of asset returns with sparsity, achieving out-of-sample Sharpe ratios close to those attained only by over-parameterized large models.</description>

      <title>The Price of Linear Time: Error Analysis of Structured Kernel Interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Structured Kernel Interpolation (SKI) (Wilson et al. 2015) helps scale Gaussian Processes (GPs) by approximating the kernel matrix via interpolation at inducing points, achieving linear computational complexity. However, it lacks rigorous theoretical error analysis. This paper bridges the gap: we prove error bounds for the SKI Gram matrix and examine the error's effect on hyperparameter estimation and posterior inference. We further provide a practical guide to selecting the number of inducing points under convolutional cubic interpolation: they should grow as $n^{d/3}$ for error control. Crucially, we identify two dimensionality regimes governing the trade-off between SKI Gram matrix spectral norm error and computational complexity. For $d \leq 3$, any error tolerance can achieve linear time for sufficiently large sample size. For $d &gt; 3$, the error must increase with sample size to maintain linear time. Our analysis provides key insights into SKI's scalability-accuracy trade-offs, establishing precise conditions for achieving linear-time GP inference with controlled approximation error.</description>
