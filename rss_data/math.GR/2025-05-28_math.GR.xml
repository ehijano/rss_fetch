      <title>Bounded cohomology, quotient extensions, and hierarchical hyperbolicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We call a central extension bounded if its Euler class is represented by a bounded cocycle. We prove that a bounded central extension of a hierarchically hyperbolic group (HHG) is still a HHG; conversely if a central extension is a HHG, then the extension is bounded, and the quotient is commensurable to a HHG. Motivated by questions on hierarchical hyperbolicity of quotients of mapping class groups, we therefore consider the general problem of determining when a quotient of a bounded central extension is still bounded, which we prove to be equivalent to an extendability problem for quasihomomorphisms. Finally, we show that quotients of the 4-strands braid group by suitable powers of a pseudo-Anosov are HHG, and in fact bounded central extensions of some HHG. We also speculate on how to extend the previous result to all mapping class groups.</description>

      <title>Virtual homological torsion in graphs of free groups with cyclic edge groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a hyperbolic group that splits as a graph of free groups with cyclic edge groups. We prove that, unless $G$ is isomorphic to a free product of free and surface groups, every finite abelian group $M$ appears as a direct summand in the abelianization of some finite-index subgroup $G'\le G$. As an application, we deduce that free products of free and surface groups are profinitely rigid among hyperbolic graphs of free groups with cyclic edge groups. We also conclude that partial surface words in a free group are determined by the word measures they induce on finite groups.</description>

      <title>On a problem of B. Hartley about a small centralizer in finite and locally finite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is proved that if a finite group $G$ has an automorphism of order $n$ with $m$ fixed points, then $G$ has a soluble subgroup whose index and Fitting height are bounded in terms of $m$ and $n$. As a corollary, a problem of B. Hartley is solved in the affirmative: if a locally finite group $G$ has an element with finite centralizer, then $G$ has a subgroup of finite index which has a finite normal series with locally nilpotent factors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define strict C(n) small-cancellation complexes, intermediate to C(n) and C(n+1), and we prove groups acting properly cocompactly on a simply-connected strict C(6) complex are hyperbolic relative to a collection of maximal virtually free abelian subgroups of rank 2. We study geometric walls in a simply-connected strict C(6) complex, and we use them to prove a convex cocompact (cosparse) core theorem for (relatively) quasiconvex subgroups of strict C(6) groups. We provide an examples showing the convex cocompact core theorem is false without the strict C(6) assumption.</description>

      <title>Residual Finiteness Growth in Two-Step Nilpotent Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a finitely generated residually finite group $G$, the residual finiteness growth $\text{RF}_G: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ bounds the size of a finite group $Q$ needed to detect an element of norm at most $r$. More specifically, if $g\in G$ is a non-trivial element with $\|g\|_G \leq r$, so $g$ can be written as a product of at most $r$ generators or their inverses, then we can find a homomorphism $\phi: G \to Q$ with $\phi(g) \neq e_Q$ and $|Q| \leq \text{RF}_G(r)$. The residual finiteness growth is defined as the smallest function with this property. This function has been bounded from above and below for several classes of groups, including virtually abelian, nilpotent, linear and free groups.
  However, for many of these groups, the exact asymptotics of $\text{RF}_G$ are unknown (in particular this is the case for a general nilpotent group), nor whether it is a quasi-isometric invariant for certain classes of groups. In this paper, we make a first step in giving an affirmative answer to the latter question for $2$-step nilpotent groups, by improving the polylogarithmic upper bound known in literature, and to show that it only depends on the complex Mal'cev completion of the group. If the commutator subgroup is one- or two-dimensional, we prove that our bound is in fact exact, and we conjecture that this holds in general.</description>

      <title>Sylow subgroups for distinct primes and intersection of nilpotent subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group, and let $(P_i)_{i=1}^n$ be Sylow subgroups for distinct primes $p_1,\ldots,p_n$. We conjecture that there exists $x \in G$ such that $P_i \cap P_i^x$ is minimal in $\{ P_i \cap P_i^g : g \in G\}$ for all $i$. We prove some weak forms of the conjecture, for example that a finite group cannot be covered by (proper) Sylow normalizers for distinct primes. Applications concerning the intersection of nilpotent subgroups are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the sum of the squares of the irreducible character degrees not divisible by some prime $p$, and its relationship with the the corresponding quantity in a $p$-Sylow normalizer. This leads to study a recent conjecture by E. Giannelli, which we prove for $p=2$ and in some other cases.</description>

      <title>Markov processes associated to fractal branch groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The author introduced recently a new natural construction which associates a measure-preserving dynamical system to any fractal profinite group. Here, we investigate these measure-preserving dynamical systems under the extra assumption on the groups to be branch. First, we compute their $f$-invariant, a measure-conjugacy invariant introduced by Bowen, and show that they are Markov processes over free semigroups in the sense of Bowen. Secondly, we show that fractal branch profinite groups with the same Hausdorff dimension and whose associated measure-preserving dynamical systems have the same $f$-invariant yield isomorphic Markov processes.</description>

      <title>On Distinguishing Graphs and Cost Number using Automorphism Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A \textit{distinguishing coloring} of a graph is a vertex coloring such that only the identity automorphism of the graph preserves the coloring. A \textit{2-distinguishable graph} is a graph which can be distinguished using 2 colors. The \textit{cost} $\rho(G)$ of a 2-distinguishable graph is the smallest size of a color set of a distinguishing coloring of $G$. The \textit{determining number} of a graph, $Det(G)$, is the minimum number of nodes, which if fixed by a coloring, would ensure that the coloring distinguishes the entire graph.
  Boutin (J. Combin. Math. Combin. Comput. 85: 161-171, 2013) posed an open problem which asks if $\rho(G)$ and $Det(G)$ can be arbitrarily far apart. It is trivial that it cannot be so for the case $Det(G) = 1$ but the answer was unknown for $Det(G) \geq 2$. We solve this problem for the case $Det(G) = 2$. We show that for the case $Det(G) = 2$, that not only is the cost bounded but in fact it takes small values with $\rho(G) = 2, \ 3$ or $4$. In order to establish this, the concept of the \textit{automorphism representation} of a graph is developed. Graphs having equivalent automorphism representations implies that they have the same distinguishing number (note that just having isomorphic automorphism groups is not enough for this to hold). This prompts a factoring of graphs by which two graphs are \textit{distinguishably equivalent} iff they have equivalent automorphism representations.</description>

      <title>Counting Reciprocal Hyperbolic Elements in Hecke Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A reciprocal geodesic on a (2,k, $\infty$) Hecke surface is a geodesic loop based at an even order cone point p traversing its path an even number of times. Associated to each reciprocal geodesic is the conjugacy class of a hyperbolic element in the (2,k,$\infty$) Hecke group whose axis passes through a cone point that projects to p. Such an element is called a reciprocal hyperbolic element based at p.
  In this paper, we determine the asymptotic growth rate and limiting constant (in terms of word length) of the number of primitive conjugacy classes of reciprocal hyperbolic elements in a Hecke group.</description>

      <title>Random groups are not n-cubulated</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A group $G$ has $FW_n$ if every action on a $n$-dimensional $\mathrm{CAT}(0)$ cube complex has a global fixed point. This provides a natural stratification between Serre's $FA$ and Kazhdan's $(T)$. For every $n$, we show that random groups in the plain words density model have $FW_n$ with overwhelming probability. The same result holds for random groups in the reduced words density model assuming there are sufficiently many generators. These are the first examples of cubulated hyperbolic groups with $FW_n$ for $n$ arbitrarily large.</description>

Abstract: We study the bounded cohomology and the stable commutator length of verbal wreath products $\Gamma \wr^{_W}A$, where $A$ has trivial bounded cohomology for a sufficiently large class of coefficients.\\ We prove that the stable commutator length always vanishes, and that the bounded cohomology vanishes in positive degrees for some such verbal wreath products; including the standard restricted wreath products (extending a recent result by Monod for lamplighters groups), as well as verbal wreath products arising from n-solvable, $n$-nilpotent, and $k$-Burnside $(k = 2, 3, 4, 6)$ verbal products.\ As an application, we show that every group of type $F_p$ isometrically embeds into a group of type $F_p$ with vanishing bounded cohomology in positive degrees for a large class of coefficients.</description>
