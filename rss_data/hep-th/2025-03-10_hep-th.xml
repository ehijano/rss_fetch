      <title>Modular Fluctuations in Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Verlinde and Zurek (VZ) have proposed that quantum gravity fluctuations in causal diamonds lead to observable effects. In particular, they argued that in quantum gravity causal diamonds have an uncertainty in their size that scales as $\delta L \sim \sqrt{\ell_p L}$, i.e. fluctuations are enhanced from the Planck scale. In this work, we explore the origin of the VZ scaling by studying scalar perturbations in inflationary cosmology. We reinterpret these cosmological perturbations as fluctuations of the modular Hamiltonian associated with a causal diamond, establishing a connection between modular fluctuations and observable primordial perturbations. Independent of assumptions about the modular Hamiltonian or the background spacetime, our results show that -- whenever an (effective) spherically symmetric perturbation is quantized -- it leads to the VZ scaling. However, whether such a mode exists in the vacuum of any theory of quantum gravity remains an open question.</description>

      <title>Continuous symmetry defects and brane/anti-brane systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explicitly compute correlation functions with the insertion of a continuous symmetry defect in bosonic field theories. To recover the expected action, the definition of the defect must be modified to include a specific contact term. This can be regarded as a singular background gauge field for the global symmetry. It can be traced to the definition of the generating functional for current correlators, where the source is akin to a background gauge field for the symmetry. For holographic theories, it has been proposed that continuous symmetry defects are realized in terms of non-BPS $D(q-1)$ branes. We argue that these can be regarded as $Dq/\overline{Dq}$ system and show its application to the case of the baryonic symmetry in the Klebanov-Witten theory. The $Dq/\overline{Dq}$ can be regarded as a particular regularization of the defect, holographically realizing the field theory discussion.</description>

      <title>Integrated line-defect correlators in $Sp(N)$ SCFTs at strong coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider two four-dimensional SCFTs with gauge group $Sp(N)$: the $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory and the $\mathcal{N}=2$ theory with four hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation and one hypermultiplet in the rank-2 antisymmetric representation of the gauge group. Using supersymmetric localization and by exploiting a Toda equation, we compute the integrated correlator between a half-BPS Wilson line and two moment map operators of conformal dimension 2. We obtain exact expressions for this observable, valid for any value of the 't Hooft coupling in the large $N$-limit of the theory and we derive the corresponding strong coupling expansions.</description>

Abstract: Brown and Maclay \cite{Brown} found the energy-momentum tensor for the Casimir effect of parallel plates in 1969. We find its curved spacetime version in a static background using the point splitting regularization method.

      <title>Bridging between reheating and late-time observations in quintessential inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an idea to build a bridge between reheating and late-time observations in quintessential inflation by backtracking the evolution of the inflaton field from the present time to the end of reheating. This idea is implemented when the potential gradient is negligible compared to the Hubble friction, rendering the inflaton field frozen, till the present time. We find a simple analytic relation between the reheating temperature and the observational parameters for dark energy, and numerically confirm its validity for typical models of quintessential inflation. This relation is universal and can apply to all quintessential inflation models with any reheating mechanism. It also implies that any quintessential inflation model with a successful reheating with the reheating temperature $1\textrm{MeV}\lesssim T_\textrm{re}\lesssim 10^{15}\textrm{GeV}$ predicts the equation of state of dark energy today extremely close to $-1$, i.e. $-1+10^{-60}\lesssim w_0\lesssim -1+10^{-24}$, unless the inflaton field unfreezes before the present time.</description>

      <title>Chern-Simons Inspired Massive Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we propose a new 2+1 theory of gravity. We start with a modification of Chern-Simons 2+1 gravity. By introducing a vector field $\Phi$ to the usual composition of the vierbein and connection, we derive a new action that includes the Einstein-Hilbert term, a cosmological constant and a polynomial term for the vector field. This allows us to write a Chern-Simons inspired Massive Gravity. After solving the polynomial function, the action can be rewritten as a Born-Infeld type action. Moreover, we show that the second order expansion of this action is equivalent to New Massive Gravity. We explore solutions to the theory and show that it has a BTZ solution with an effective cosmological constant in terms of the parameters of the theory, global Lifshitz space-times as well as regular Lifshitz black holes, and asymptotically flat black holes.</description>

      <title>"Glueballs" in the Quantum Mechanics of three large massless Yang-Mills coupled Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a loop truncated Jevicki-Sakita effective collective field Hamiltonian to obtain, over a very large range of values of 't Hooft's coupling, and directly in the large N limit, the large N (planar) ground state energy, the planar ground state expectation values of invariant correlators, and the 1/N spectrum of the quantum mechanical system of three massless Yang-Mills coupled matrices. This captures the dynamics of the (residual) gauge invariant sector of the spatially reduced 3+1 dimensional pure Yang-Mills theory, in the large N limit. The large N loop space constraints are handled by the use of master variables. As is the case for two matrices, the method is highly efficient directly in the massless limit, and it reproduces to a very high precision the scaling dependence of physical quantities, determined by their dimensions, on the dimensionful 't Hooft coupling. We obtain the bound state masses of "glueballs", their quantum numbers and ensuing degeneracies.</description>

      <title>$\mathrm{O}$/$\mathrm{SO}$ Gauge Groups, $BC$ Quivers and $O3$ Planes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: D3-/D5-/NS5-brane systems with $O3$ orientifold planes realise 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ gauge theories with orthogonal and symplectic gauge groups on the D3-brane worldvolume. Such setups have long contained an ambiguity regarding the global form of $D$-type gauge groups. This note offers a partial prescription for reading $\mathrm{O}(2k)$ and $\mathrm{SO}(2k)$ gauge nodes in orthosymplectic quivers using the presence of $\frac{1}{2}$D5-branes on the orientifolds bordering $\frac{1}{2}$NS5-brane intervals spanned by $O3^{-}$ planes. A set of identities are proposed relating the Coulomb branches of generic quivers under a Higgsing that relates $\mathrm{SO}(2k+1)$ and $\mathrm{O}(2k)$ gauge groups. A further prescription is conjectured regarding the action of $\frac{1}{2}$D5-branes on maximal $DC$-chains.</description>

      <title>Note on surface defects in multiscalar critical models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies generic surface defects for multiscalar critical models using a perturbative $\epsilon$ expansion in $4-\epsilon$ dimensions. The beta functions of the defect couplings for a generic multiscalar bulk with quartic interactions are computed at first non-trivial order in $\epsilon$. Specific bulks of interest are then considered: $O(N)$, hypercubic, hypertetrahdral, and biconical $O(m)\times O(n)$. In each case, we compute fixed points for the defect couplings and determine the remaining bulk symmetry. Expanding beyond the $O(N)$ model, we find a greater variety of patterns of symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Juggling with Tensor Bases in Functional Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systematic expansion schemes in functional approaches require the inclusion of higher order vertices. These vertices are expanded in independent tensor bases with a rapidly increasing number of basis elements. Amongst the related tasks are the construction of bases and projection operators, the importance ordering of their elements, and the optimisation of such tensor bases, as well as an analysis of their regularity in momentum space. We present progress in all these directions and introduce the Mathematica package TensorBases designed for the aforementioned tasks.</description>

      <title>Topological modes, non-locality and the double copy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The double copy connects scattering amplitudes and other objects in gauge and gravity theories. Open conceptual issues include whether non-local information in gravity theories can be generated from the double copy, and how the double copy should be practically implemented in unseen cases. In this paper, we consider topological theories (with and without mass) in 2+1 dimensions, and argue that this makes a useful playground for exploring non-locality. In particular, topological modes of the gauge field arise, themselves associated with non-trivial global behaviour, and it is not clear {\it a priori} how to double copy them. We settle this issue, and clarify the role of BCJ shifts in modifying how topological modes contribute. We show how our conclusions apply to four- and five-point scattering amplitudes in topological gauge / gravity theories, as a by-product obtaining greatly simplified analytic expressions for the four-point amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Impact of Perfect Fluid Dark Matter on the Thermodynamics of $AdS$ Ay\'{o}n--Beato--Garc\'{i}a Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive the black hole solution in the context of nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED) coupled to a perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM) field. The resulting black hole solution interpolates between the $AdS$ Ay\'{o}n--Beato--Garc\'{i}a (ABG) black hole in the absence of the PFDM field and the Schwarzschild black hole devoid of magnetic monopole charges and PFDM influence. A numerical investigation of the horizon structure and thermodynamic properties, including both local and global stability, is conducted for the obtained black hole solution. The thermodynamic quantities are shown to be modified by the presence of the NLED and PFDM fields. We observe that the behaviour of thermodynamical quantities of black holes depends on these parameters significantly. We also discuss the stability and phase transition dependency on these parameters.</description>

      <title>Renormalized Quantum Stress-Energy Tensor of a Nonzero Radius Cosmic String</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the effects of quantum fluctuations of a scalar field in the "ballpoint pen" cosmic string geometry. Using the approach to renormalization established previously for the energy density in two space dimensions, we extend those calculations to $3+1$ dimensions, nonzero scalar mass, and the full stress-energy tensor, including its contribution to the null energy condition for radial geodesics. The calculation demonstrates in detail the process of renormalization in curved spacetime, including the effects of the conformal anomaly. This calculation provides one of the few examples where quantum effects in curved spacetime can be explicitly calculated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The three-dimensional U(1) gauge theory displays a peculiar form of confinement which does not fit in the standard paradigm of effective string theory. In this work, we report results of numerical computations of the ground state energy of the confining string in the lattice theory at finite temperature, which we compared with various theoretical predictions. We find markedly different behavior compared to non-Abelian theories. For small values of the bare coupling, far from the continuum, the results are well-described by the Nambu-Goto string. In an intermediate region, all known theoretical predictions are incompatible with the numerical data. For large bare coupling, close to the continuum, we find remarkable agreement with a formula recently derived by Aharony, Barel and Sheaffer.</description>

      <title>Peaks sphericity of non-Gaussian random fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate the statistics of peaks of non-Gaussian random fields and implement it to study the sphericity of peaks. For non-Gaussianity of the local type, we present a general formalism valid regardless of how large the deviation from Gaussian statistics is. For general types of non-Gaussianity, we provide a framework that applies to any system with a given power spectrum and the corresponding bispectrum in the regime in which contributions from higher-order correlators can be neglected. We present an explicit expression for the most probable values of the sphericity parameters, including the effect of non-Gaussianity on the profile. We show that the effects of small perturbative non-Gaussianity on the sphericity parameters are negligible, as they are even smaller than the subleading Gaussian corrections. In contrast, we find that large non-Gaussianity can significantly distort the peak configurations, making them much less spherical.</description>

      <title>A novel Lagrange-multiplier approach to the effective-one-body dynamics of binary systems in post-Minkowskian gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new approach to the conservative dynamics of binary systems, within the effective one-body (EOB) framework, based on the use of a Lagrange multiplier to impose the mass-shell constraint. When applied to the post-Minkowskian (PM) description of the two-body problem in Einsteinian gravity, this Lagrange-EOB (LEOB) approach allows for a new formulation of the conservative dynamics that avoids the drawbacks of the recursive definition of EOB-PM Hamiltonians. Using state-of-the-art values of the waveform and radiation reaction, based on factorized and resummed post-Newtonian (PN) expressions, we apply our new formalism to the construction of an aligned-spin, quasi-circular, inspiralling EOB waveform model, called LEOB-PM, that incorporates analytical information up to the 4PM level, completed by 4PN contributions up to the sixth order in eccentricity, in the orbital sector, and by 4.5PN contributions, in the spin-orbit sector. In the nonspinning case, we find, for the first time, that an uncalibrated LEOB-PM model delivers EOB/NR unfaithfulness (with the Advanced LIGO noise in the total mass range $10-200M_\odot$) of at most $1\%$ over all the nonspinning dataset of the Simulating eXtreme Spacetime (SXS) Numerical Relativity (NR) catalog up to mass ratio $q=15$, also yielding excellent phasing agreement with the $q=32$ configuration of the RIT catalog. When NR-informing the dynamics of the model (both orbital and spinning sectors) by using only 17 SXS dataset, we find that the EOB/NR unfaithfulness (compared to 530 spin-aligned SXS waveforms) has a median value of $5.39\times 10^{-4}$ reaching at most $\sim 1\%$ in some of the high-spin corners. Our finding shows that the LEOB approach is a promising route towards robustly incorporating both PM and PN information in the EOB description of the dynamics.</description>

      <title>Genus $g$ Virasoro Correlation Functions for Vertex Operator Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a simple, self-dual, strong CFT-type vertex operator algebra (VOA) of central charge $c$, we describe the Virasoro $n$-point correlation function on a genus $g$ marked Riemann surface in the Schottky uniformisation. We show that this $n$-point function determines the correlation functions for all Virasoro vacuum descendants. Using our recent work on genus $g$ Zhu recursion, we show that the Virasoro $n$-point function is determined by a differential operator $\mathcal{D}_{n}$ acting on the genus $g$ VOA partition function normalised by the Heisenberg partition function to the power of $c$. We express $\mathcal{D}_{n}$ as the sum of weights over certain Virasoro graphs where the weights explicitly depend on $c$, the classical bidifferential of the second kind, the projective connection, holomorphic 1-forms and derivatives with respect to any $3g-3$ locally independent period matrix elements. We also describe the modular properties of $\mathcal{D}_{n}$ under a homology base change.</description>

Abstract: We prove and generalize some recent conjectures of Z.-W. Sun on infinite series whose summands involve products of harmonic numbers and several binomial coefficients. We evaluate various classes of infinite sums in closed form by interpreting them as automorphic objects on the moduli spaces for Legendre curves $Y^{ g+1}=(1-X)^{ g}X(1-t X)$ of positive genera $ g\in\{1,2,3,5\}$.</description>

      <title>Statistical Analysis of Scientific Metrics in High Energy, Cosmology, and Astroparticle Physics in Latin America</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive statistical analysis of key scientific metrics to evaluate the productivity and impact of research conducted in Latin American countries within the fields of High Energy Physics, Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics (HECAP). Using data from the widely used open-access digital library INSPIRE-HEP, we provide a detailed assessment of the scientific contributions from the continent over the past 70 years. We provide data for the evolution of the overall productivity in the region relative to the rest of the world, comparing the productivity of each country, number of active researchers, number of publications, citations, h-index in total and relative to the population and number of researchers, as well as the productivity and impact compared to the percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) invested in research, and the Human Development Index (HDI) of each country. We also analyse collaborations among the different countries, as well as collaborations with the rest of the world. Additionally, we studied the gender gap evolution over the same period. This pioneering analysis, which relies solely on open data, can serve as an essential resource for researchers and policymakers alike. It aims to empower scientists with insights into the significance of their contributions to both regional and global research. Moreover, it provides both researchers and policymakers with critical quantitative data, strengthening their understanding of the progress in scientific productivity over the years to better support scientific endeavours in Latin America.</description>

      <title>Quantum State Designs from Minimally Random Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random many-body states are both a useful tool to model certain physical systems and an important asset for quantum computation. Realising them, however, generally requires an exponential (in system size) amount of resources. Recent research has presented a way out by showing that one can generate random states, or more precisely a controlled approximation of them, by applying a quantum circuit built in terms of few-body unitary gates. Most of this research, however, has been focussed on the case of quantum circuits composed by completely random unitary gates. Here we consider what happens for circuits that, instead, involve a minimal degree of randomness. Specifically, we concentrate on two different settings: (a) brickwork quantum circuits with a single one-qudit random matrix at a boundary; (b) brickwork quantum circuits with fixed interactions but random one-qudit gates everywhere. We show that, for any given initial state, (a) and (b) produce a distribution of states approaching the Haar distribution in the limit of large circuit depth. More precisely, we show that the moments of the distribution produced by our circuits can approximate the ones of the Haar distribution in a depth proportional to the system size. Interestingly we find that in both Cases (a) and (b) the relaxation to the Haar distribution occurs in two steps - this is in contrast with what happens in fully random circuits. Moreover, we show that choosing appropriately the fixed interactions, for example taking the local gate to be a dual-unitary gate with high enough entangling power, minimally random circuits produce a Haar random distribution more rapidly than fully random circuits. In particular, dual-unitary circuits with maximal entangling power - i.e. perfect tensors - appear to provide the optimal quantum state design preparation for any design number.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study conformal field theories at finite temperature in the presence of a temporal conformal line defect, wrapping the thermal circle, akin to a Polyakov loop in gauge theories. Although several symmetries of the conformal group are broken, the model can still be highly constrained from its features at zero-temperature. In this work we show that the defect and bulk one and two-point correlators can be written as functions of zero-temperature data and thermal one-point functions (defect and bulk). The defect one-point functions are new data and they are induced by thermal effects of the bulk. For this new set of data we derive novel sum rules and establish a bootstrap problem for the thermal defect one-point functions from the KMS condition. We also comment on the behaviour of operators with large scaling dimensions. Additionally, we relate the free energy and entropy density to the OPE data through the one-point function of the stress-energy tensor. Our formalism is validated through analytical computations in generalized free scalar field theory, and we present new predictions for the O(N) model with a magnetic impurity in the $\varepsilon$-expansion and the large N limit.</description>

Abstract: This study investigates the universal relation between Goon and Penco (GP) proposed within the frameworks of Power-Maxwell, Power-Yang-Mills, and Maxwell-Power-Yang-Mills black holes. We begin by analyzing these black holes' thermodynamics and then calculating the perturbed metric and thermodynamic quantities by perturbing the action. Our objective is to examine the consistency of the GP relation across various power-law terms in the field equations, aiming to gain deeper insights into the nature of these black holes. The GP connection remains robust across different power spacetimes, indicating that this relation is a universal feature of black holes.</description>

Abstract: We investigate canonically quantized open string solutions associated to the analytically continued action for the recently proposed tropical limit of topological A-type models, tropological sigma models, with various boundary conditions. These solutions naturally give rise to a non-relativistic counterpart of branes, which we name tropical branes. We provide a preliminary worldsheet description of these tropical branes, laying the groundwork for an upcoming paper that will explore the role of tropical branes in the context of brane quantization.</description>

      <title>Operator K-complexity in DSSYK: Krylov complexity equals bulk length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the notion of complexity under time evolution in chaotic quantum systems with holographic duals. Continuing on from our previous work, we turn our attention to the issue of Krylov complexity upon the insertion of a class of single-particle operators in the double-scaled SYK model. Such an operator is described by a matter-chord insertion, which splits the theory into left/right sectors, allowing us, via chord-diagram technology, to compute two different notions of complexity associated to the operator insertion: first a Krylov operator complexity, and second the Krylov complexity of a state obtained by an operator acting on the thermofield double state. We will provide both an analytic proof and detailed numerical evidence, that both Krylov complexities arise from a recursively defined basis of states characterized by a constant total chord number. As a consequence, in all cases we are able to establish that Krylov complexity is given by the expectation value of a length operator acting on the Hilbert space of the theory, expressed in terms of basis states, organized by left and right chord number. We find analytic expressions for the semiclassical limit of K-complexity, and study how the size of the operator encodes the scrambling dynamics upon the matter insertion in Krylov language. We furthermore determine the effective Hamiltonian governing the evolution of K-complexity, showing that evolution on the Krylov chain can equivalently be understood as a particle moving in a Morse potential. A particular type of triple scaling limit allows to access the gravitational sector of the theory, in which the geometrical nature of K-complexity is assured by virtue of being a total chord length, in an analogous fashion to what was found in [1] for the K-complexity of the thermofield double state.</description>

Abstract: The screened massive expansion of full QCD is used in conjunction with a model for infrared quark masses to compute the Landau-gauge gluon propagator at finite temperature and baryonic density. Analytic expressions up to a one-dimensional momentum integral are provided for the propagator, and its behavior is studied at zero Matsubara frequency with respect to temperature, chemical potential, and the parameters of the expansion. The phase diagram of QCD is explored under the assumption that the deconfinement temperature can be identified as the position of the maximum of the longitudinal gluon propagator at zero Matsubara frequency and fixed spatial momentum.</description>

      <title>Four loop renormalization of QCD in the Curci-Ferrari gauge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We renormalize Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) when gauge fixed in the nonlinear Curci-Ferrari gauge to four loops in the modified minimal subtraction (MSbar) scheme. We reproduce the four loop QCD MSbar beta-function from the Slavnov-Taylor identity for this gauge which relates the coupling constant renormalization to the gluon, Faddeev-Popov ghost and gauge parameter anomalous dimensions. This is carried out for a nonzero gauge parameter, without having to evaluate a vertex function. The anomalous dimension of the BRST invariant dimension two gluon and ghost mass term is deduced from a similar Slavnov-Taylor identity for this gauge. Consequently we construct the renormalization group functions in the minimal momentum subtraction scheme to four loops. As a corollary we deduce the five loop beta-function and quark mass anomalous dimensions in the same scheme. We also outline the pros and cons of employing the Curci-Ferrari gauge to access the six loop QCD beta-function in the MSbar scheme.</description>

      <title>The gravitational path integral from an observer's point of view</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the fundamental problems in quantum gravity is to describe the experience of a gravitating observer in generic spacetimes. In this paper, we develop a framework for describing non-perturbative physics relative to an observer using the gravitational path integral. We apply our proposal to an observer that lives in a closed universe and one that falls behind a black hole horizon. We find that the Hilbert space that describes the experience of the observer is much larger than the Hilbert space in the absence of an observer. In the case of closed universes, the Hilbert space is not one-dimensional, as calculations in the absence of the observer suggest. Rather, its dimension scales exponentially with $G_N^{-1}$. Similarly, from an observer's perspective, the dimension of the Hilbert space in a two-sided black hole is increased. We compute various observables probing the experience of a gravitating observer in this Hilbert space. We find that an observer experiences non-trivial physics in the closed universe in contrast to what it would see in a one-dimensional Hilbert space. In the two-sided black hole setting, our proposal implies that non-perturbative corrections to effective field theory for an infalling observer are suppressed until times exponential in the black hole entropy, resolving a recently raised puzzle in black hole physics. While the framework that we develop is exemplified in the toy-model of JT gravity, most of our analysis can be extended to higher dimensions and, in particular, to generic spacetimes not admitting a conventional holographic description, such as cosmological universes or black hole interiors.</description>

      <title>Gapped Phases in (2+1)d with Non-Invertible Symmetries: Part II</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) to systematically characterize gapped phases in 2+1 dimensions with categorical symmetries. The SymTFTs that we consider are (3+1)d Dijkgraaf-Witten (DW) theories for finite groups $G$, whose gapped boundaries realize all so-called ``All Bosonic type" fusion 2-category symmetries. In arXiv:2408.05266 we provided the general framework and studied the case where $G$ is an abelian group. In this work we focus on the case of non-Abelian $G$. Gapped boundary conditions play a central role in the SymTFT construction of symmetric gapped phases. These fall into two broad families: minimal and non-minimal boundary conditions, respectively. The first kind corresponds to boundaries on which all line operators are obtainable as boundary projections of bulk line operators. The symmetries on such boundaries include (anomalous) 2-groups and 2-representation categories of 2-groups. Conversely non-minimal boundaries contain line operators that are intrinsic to the boundaries. The symmetries on such boundaries correspond to fusion 2-categories where modular tensor categories intertwine non-trivially with the above symmetry types. We discuss in detail the generalized charges of these symmetries and their condensation patterns that give rise to a zoo of rich beyond-Landau gapped phases. Among these are phases that exhibit novel patterns of symmetry breaking wherein the symmetry broken vacua carry distinct kinds of topological order. We exemplify this framework for the case where $G$ is a dihedral group.</description>

      <title>Wavefunction branching: when you can't tell pure states from mixed states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04494v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a definition of wavefunction "branchings": quantum superpositions which can't be feasibly distinguished from the corresponding mixed state, even under time evolution. Our definition is largely independent of interpretations, requiring only that it takes many more local gates to swap branches than to distinguish them. We give several examples of states admitting such branch decompositions. Under our definition, we argue that attempts to get relative-phase information between branches will fail without frequent active error correction, that branches are effectively the opposite of good error-correcting codes, that branches effectively only grow further apart in time under natural evolution, that branches tend to absorb spatial entanglement, that branching is stronger in the presence of conserved quantities, and that branching implies effective irreversibility. Identifying these branch decompositions in many-body quantum states could shed light on the emergence of classicality, provide a metric for experimental tests at the quantum/ classical boundary, and allow for longer numerical time evolution simulations. We see this work as a generalization of the basic ideas of environmentally-induced decoherence to situations with no clear system/ environment split.</description>

      <title>Classical origins of Landau-incompatible transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continuous phase transitions where symmetry is spontaneously broken are ubiquitous in physics and often found between `Landau-compatible' phases where residual symmetries of one phase are a subset of the other. However, continuous `deconfined quantum critical' transitions between Landau-incompatible symmetry-breaking phases are known to exist in certain quantum systems, often with anomalous microscopic symmetries. In this Letter, we investigate the need for such special conditions. We show that Landau-incompatible transitions can be found in a family of well-known classical statistical mechanical models with anomaly-free symmetries, introduced by Jos\'{e}, Kadanoff, Kirkpatrick and Nelson (Phys. Rev. B 16, 1217). The models are anisotropic deformations of the classical 2d XY model labelled by a positive integer $Q$. For a range of temperatures, even $Q$ models exhibit two Landau-incompatible partial symmetry-breaking phases and a direct transition between them for $Q \ge 4$. Characteristic features of deconfined quantum criticality, such as enhanced symmetries and melting of charged defects are easily seen in a classical setting. For odd $Q$, and corresponding temperature ranges, two regions of a single partial symmetry-breaking phase appear, split by a stable `unnecessary critical' line. We discuss experimental systems that realize these transitions and present anomaly-free quantum models that also exhibit similar phase diagrams.</description>

      <title>Post-Newtonian Tests of Gravitational Quantum Field Theory with Spin and Scaling Gauge Symmetry</title>

Abstract: A self-consistent gravitational quantum field theory, with gravitational force treated on the same footing as the other three fundamental interactions, was established recently. The gravidynamics predicted by such a theory could lead to important implications, and the comparisons with experimental results may provide us opportunities to test such new approach of gravity based on the framework of the quantum field theory of gauge interactions. In this work, we start with the effective field equation of the gravitational quantum field theory, and then solve the perturbative gravigauge field order by order up to the 1st post-Newtonian level under the assumption of a simplified energy-momentum tensor of perfect fluids. Having the constraints on the related post-Newtonian parameters from the most up-to-date observational data, the new bound on the combined coupling in the gravitational quantum field theory $|\gamma_G(\alpha_G-\alpha_W/2)|\leq (2.4\pm30)\times10^{-6} $ is obtained. Under such bound, we found that the new gravitational quantum field theory successfully passed and found no conflict with the contemporary keynote Solar system experiments of gravity.</description>

      <title>Gravitational charge production</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10605v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wash-in leptogenesis is an attractive mechanism to produce the baryon asymmetry of the Universe. It treats right-handed-neutrino interactions as spectator processes, on the same footing as electroweak sphalerons, that reprocess primordial charge asymmetries in the thermal plasma into a baryon-minus-lepton asymmetry. The origin of these primordial charges must be accounted for by new $CP$-violating dynamics at very high energies. In this paper, we propose such a scenario of chargegenesis that, unlike earlier proposals, primarily relies on new interactions in the gravitational sector. We point out that a coupling of a conserved current to the divergence of the Ricci scalar during reheating can lead to nonzero effective chemical potentials in the plasma that, together with a suitable charge-violating interaction, can result in the production of a primordial charge asymmetry. Gravitational chargegenesis represents a substantial generalization of the idea of gravitational baryogenesis. We provide a detailed analysis of a generic and minimal realization that is consistent with inflation and show that it can successfully explain the baryon asymmetry of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Full-shape analysis with simulation-based priors: cosmological parameters and the structure growth anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore full-shape analysis with simulation-based priors, which is the simplest approach to galaxy clustering data analysis that combines effective field theory (EFT) on large scales and numerical simulations on small scales. The core ingredient of our approach is the prior density of EFT parameters which we extract from a suite of 10500 galaxy simulations based on the halo occupation distribution (HOD) model. We measure the EFT parameters with the field-level forward model, which enables us to cancel cosmic variance. On the theory side, we develop a new efficient approach to calculate field-level transfer functions using time-sliced perturbation theory and the logarithmic fast Fourier transform. We find that the cosmology dependence of EFT parameters of galaxies is approximately degenerate with the HOD parameters, and hence it can be ignored for the purpose of prior generation. We use neural density estimation to model the measured distribution of EFT parameters. Our distribution model is then used as a prior in a reanalysis of the BOSS full-shape galaxy power spectrum data. Assuming the $\Lambda$CDM model, we find significant ($\approx 30\%$ and $\approx 60\%$) improvements for the matter density fraction and the mass fluctuation amplitude, which are constrained to $\Omega_{m}= 0.315 \pm 0.010$ and $\sigma_8 = 0.671 \pm 0.027$. The value of the Hubble constant does not change, $H_0= 68.7\pm 1.1$~km/s/Mpc. This reaffirms earlier reports of the structure growth tension from the BOSS data. Finally, we use the measured EFT parameters to constrain the galaxy-dark matter connection.</description>

      <title>Tracking the nonlinear formation of an interfacial wave spectral cascade from one to few to many</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08842v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A hallmark of far-from-equilibrium systems is the emergence of a spectral cascade, where energy is transferred across length-scales following a simple power law. The universal nature of this phenomenon has led to advances in a range of disciplines, including climate forecasting, foreign exchange trading, and the modelling of neurological activity. For many diverse far-from-equilibrium scenarios, the scaling laws of steady states have been successfully predicted by the statistical theory of weak wave turbulence, originally developed by considering the leading order interactions between waves on a fluid surface. However, the predictive power of weak wave turbulence breaks down in the presence of large amplitudes, high dissipation, and finite-size effects. We offer new insight into these regimes by experimentally tracking the formation of a spectral cascade under these conditions in an externally driven fluid-fluid interface. We resolve individual wave modes and observe their time evolution from one to few to many, a process culminating in a steady state with a spectral density characterised by a power-law scaling. Our findings confirm that interfacial dynamics can be effectively modelled by a weakly nonlinear Lagrangian theory, a predictive framework encompassing both underlying wave interaction and emergent behaviours of the system. Such nonlinear interactions are experimentally quantified through statistical correlations, revealing a hierarchy in wave-mixing order that confirms a key assumption of weak wave turbulence. The Lagrangian formulation further aids our time-evolution analysis; specific interactions are tracked through time, and we predict the timescale until a cascade emerges. Our findings are transferable to other far-from-equilibrium systems, which we demonstrate by providing a mapping to reheating scenarios following cosmic inflation in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Harris-Luck criterion in the plateau transition of the Integer Quantum Hall Effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Harris criterion imposes a constraint on the critical behavior of a system upon introduction of new disorder, based on its dimension $d$ and localization length exponent $\nu$. It states that the new disorder can be relevant only if $d \nu &lt; 2$. We analyze the applicability of the Harris criterion to the GKNS network disorder formulated in the paper [I. A. Gruzberg, A. Kl\"umper, W. Nuding, and A. Sedrakyan, Phys. Rev. B 95, 125414 (2017)] and show that the fluctuations of the geometry are relevant despite $d \nu&gt; 2$, implying that Harris criterion should be modified. We have observed that the fluctuations of the critical point in different quenched configurations of disordered network blocks is of order $L^0$, i.e.~it does not depend on block size $L$ in contrast to the expectation based on the Harris criterion that they should decrease as $L^{-d/2}$ according to the central limit theorem. Since $L^0 &gt; (x-x_c)$ is always satisfied near the critical point, the mentioned network disorder is relevant and the critical indices of the system can be changed. We have also shown that the GKNS disordered network is fundamentally different from Voronoi-Delaunay and dynamically triangulated random lattices: the probability of higher connectivity in the GKNS network decreases in a power law as opposed to an exponential, indicating that we are dealing with a ``scale free" network, such as the Internet, protein-protein interactions, etc.</description>

      <title>Higher-dimensional magnetic Skyrmions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a generalization of the theory of magnetic Skyrmions in chiral magnets in two dimensions to a higher-dimensional theory with magnetic Skyrmions in three dimensions and an $S^3$ target space, requiring a 4-dimensional magnetization vector. A physical realization of our theory could be made using a synthetic dimension, recently promoted and realized in condensed matter physics. In the simplest incarnation of the theory, we find a Skyrmion and a sphaleron - the latter being an unstable soliton. Including also the Skyrme term in the theory enriches the spectrum to a small metastable Skyrmion, an unstable sphaleron and a large stable Skyrmion.</description>

      <title>Kick it like DESI: PNGB quintessence with a dynamically generated initial velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07418v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the hint for time-dependent dynamical dark energy from an analysis of the DESI Baryon Accoustic Oscillation (BAO) data together with information from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Supernovae (SN), we relax the assumption of a vanishing initial velocity for a quintessence field. In particular we focus on pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone-Boson (PNGB) quintessence in the form of an axion like particle, that can arise as the phase of a complex scalar and could possess derivative couplings to fermions or topological couplings to abelian gauge fields, without upsetting the necessary flatness of its potential. We discuss mechanisms from the aforementioned interactions for sourcing an initial axion field velocity $\dot{\theta_i}$ at redshifts $3\leq z\leq 10$, that will "kick" it into motion. Driven by this initial velocity the axion will first roll up in its potential, similar to "freezing" dark energy. After it has reached the pinnacle of its trajectory, it will start to roll down, and behave as "thawing" quintessence. As a proof of concept we undertake a combined fit to BAO, SN and CMB data at the background level. We find that a scenario with $\dot{\theta_i}=\mathcal{O}(1) \; m_a$, where $m_a$ is the axion mass, is slightly preferred over both $\Lambda$CDM and the conventional "thawing" quintessence with $\dot{\theta_i}=0$. The best fit points for this case exhibit transplanckian decay constants and very flat potentials, which both are in tension with conjectures from string theory.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic construction of SSA-compatible extreme rays of the subadditivity cone and the ${\sf N}=6$ solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the set of all extreme rays of the 6-party subadditivity cone that are compatible with strong subadditivity. In total, we identify 208 new (genuine 6-party) orbits, 52 of which violate at least one known holographic entropy inequality. For the remaining 156 orbits, which do not violate any such inequalities, we construct holographic graph models for 150 of them. For the final 6 orbits, it remains an open question whether they are holographic. Consistent with the strong form of the conjecture in arXiv:2204.00075, 148 of these graph models are trees. However, 2 of the graphs contain a "bulk cycle", leaving open the question of whether equivalent models with tree topology exist, or if these extreme rays are counterexamples to the conjecture. The paper includes a detailed description of the algorithm used for the computation, which is presented in a general framework and can be applied to any situation involving a polyhedral cone defined by a set of linear inequalities and a partial order among them to find extreme rays corresponding to down-sets in this poset.</description>

Abstract: It was recently proposed (arxiv:2502.08887) that the time crystal Lagrangian introduced by Shapere and Wilczek in 2012 could be a model of dark energy. I point out that the model has an instability that drives its energy density to negative values, which may render it unsuitable as a model of dark energy.</description>

      <title>Two-loop renormalization group restrictions on the standard model and the fourth chiral family</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/9808396</link>
      <description>arXiv:hep-ph/9808396v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the framework of the two-loop renormalization group, the global profile of the Standard Model (SM) in its full parameter space is investigated up to the scale of the gauge singularity. The critical Higgs masses bordering the strong coupling, unstable and the safe regions are explicitly found. Restrictions on the Higgs boson mass as a function of a cutoff scale are obtained from the stability of the electroweak vacuum and from the absence of the strong coupling both in the Higgs and Yukawa sectors. The cutoff being equal to the Plank scale requires the Higgs mass to be M=(161.3+-20.6)+4-10 GeV and M&gt;=140.7+-10 GeV, where the M corridor is the theoretical one and the errors are due to the top mass uncertainty.
  The SM two-loop beta-functions are generalized to the massive neutrino case. Modification of the two-loop global profile of the SM extended by one new chiral family is studied, and bounds on the masses of the family are found. The requirement of self-consistency of the perturbative SM as an underlying theory up to the Planck or GUT scale excludes the fourth chiral family with the mass up to 250 GeV depending on the Higgs mass and the cutoff scale. Under precision experiment restriction M&lt;=200 GeV, the fourth chiral family, taken alone, is excluded. Nevertheless a pair of the chiral families constituting the vector-like one could still exist.</description>
