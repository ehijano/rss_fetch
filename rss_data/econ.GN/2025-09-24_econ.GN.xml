      <title>Research and development as a driver of innovation and economic growth; case of developing economies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this research is to uncover the channels through which research and development (R&amp;D) impacts economic growth in developing countries. The study employed nine variables from three broader categories in the World Economic Forum database, each covering 32 countries from the lower-middle-income group for the year 2019. The theoretical framework is based on the R&amp;D ecosystem, which includes components such as Institutions, Human capital, Capital market, R&amp;D, and Innovation. Each of these components can contribute to the economic development of the country. Using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM), we build a path diagram to visualize and confirm a potential relationship between the components. R&amp;D features had a positive impact on innovation (regression weight estimate: +0.34, p = 0.001), as did capital market institutions (regression weight estimate: +0.12, p = 0.007), but neither had a significant impact on growth. According to the Schumpeterian institutional interpretation, R&amp;D and innovation efforts may not lead to sustained growth in middle-income countries. We find no significant connection between innovation performance and economic growth. This suggests that while R&amp;D and capital markets may contribute to innovation through entrepreneurship, this contribution is not impactful enough to drive economic growth in developing countries. Our findings provide further evidence of the middle-income trap.</description>

      <title>Changes in varieties of capitalism within the OECD between 2010 and 2020</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to reveal different varieties of capitalism and to uncover new patterns of development that emerged between 2010 and 2020. A hybrid model is applied that quantifies three pillars of development (Future - F, Outside - O, Inside - I) using supply-side and demand-side indicators that measure norms, institutions, and policies. Investigating 34 OECD members, this study describes five varieties of capitalism: traditional, dualistic, government-led, open market-based, and human capital-based models. It is suggested that the most significant cut-off point in the development of OECD economies in this period was along the green growth dimension, where European countries with a tradition in coordinated markets outperform the rest. Using Israel and Estonia as an example, it is also suggested that institutional and policy changes that enhance the quality of governance and make coordination more effective are the way out of the middle-income trap.</description>

      <title>Gender and Agricultural Commercialization in Sub-Saharan Africa: Evidence from Three Panel Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agricultural commercialization is often promoted as a key driver of development in Sub-Saharan Africa, yet its benefits may not extend equally to all farmers. Using longitudinal household data from the LSMS-ISA and a two-way Mundlak fixed effects estimator, we examine the relationship between farmers' gender and agricultural commercialization in Ethiopia, Nigeria, and Tanzania. In Ethiopia and Nigeria, women-headed households and those with a higher share of women-managed land face substantial disadvantages in market engagement, particularly in households oriented towards self-consumption. Interestingly, in both countries, women-headed households that do engage in sales are more likely to sell to market buyers and less likely to sell to individual buyers compared to men-headed households. In contrast, in Tanzania, the negative associations between gender and commercialization are weaker and less robust across outcomes. Overall, these findings demonstrate that gender gaps in commercialization are highly context-specific rather than universal, highlighting the need for country-tailored policies that address the institutional and market constraints faced by women farmers.</description>

      <title>Healthy diets are affordable but often displaced by other foods in Indonesia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New methods for modeling least-cost diets that meet nutritional requirements for health have emerged as important tools for informing nutrition policy and programming around the world. This study develops a three-step approach using cost of healthy diet to inform targeted nutrition programming in Indonesia. We combine detailed retail prices and household survey data from Indonesia to describe how reported consumption and expenditure patterns across all levels of household income diverge from least cost healthy diets using items from nearby markets. In this analysis, we examine regional price variations, identify households with insufficient income for healthy diets, and analyze the nutrient adequacy of reported consumption patterns. We find that household food spending was sufficient to meet national dietary guidelines using the least expensive locally available items for over 98% of Indonesians, but almost all households consume substantial quantities of discretionary foods and mixed dishes while consuming too little energy from fruits, vegetables, and legumes, nuts, and seeds. Households with higher incomes have higher nutrient adequacy and are closer to meeting local dietary guidelines, but still fall short of recommendations. These findings shed new light on how actual food demand differs from least-cost healthy diets, due to factors other than affordability, such as taste, convenience, and aspirations shaped by marketing and other sociocultural influences.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Economic Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efforts to apply economic complexity to identify diversification opportunities often rely on diagrams comparing the relatedness and complexity or products, technologies, or industries. Yer, the use of these diagrams is not based on empirical or theoretidal evidence supporting some notion of optimality. Here, we introduce an optimization-based framework that identifies diversification opportunities by minimizing a cost function capturing the constraints imposed by an economy's pattern of specialization. We show that the resulting portfolios often differ from those implied by relatedness-complexity diagrams, providing a target-oriented optimization layer to the economic complexity toolkit.</description>

      <title>Comrades and Cause: Peer Influence on West Point Cadets' Civil War Allegiances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Do social networks and peer influence shape major life decisions in highly polarized settings? We explore this question by examining how peers influenced the allegiances of West Point cadets during the American Civil War. Leveraging quasi-random variations in the proportion of cadets from Free States, we analyze how these differences affected cadets' decisions about which army to join. We have four main findings. First, there was a strong and significant peer effect: a higher proportion of classmates from Free States significantly increased the likelihood that cadets from Slave States joined the Union Army. Second, the peer effect interacted with geography and economic circumstances: almost all cadets from Free States joined the Union Army (if they decided to join the war), and most cadets from Slave States that had more than a third of their population in slavery joined the Confederacy. The cadets who were most highly influenced were from Slave States that had less than a third of their population in slavery. Third, we analyze how cadets' decisions affected their military rank and career outcomes. Fourth, we show that having served together in the Mexican-American war increased the peer influence, providing additional evidence that peer interaction was influential.</description>
