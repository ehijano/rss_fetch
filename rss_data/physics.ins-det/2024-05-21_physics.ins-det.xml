      <title>A Compact Readout Electronics Based on Current Amplifier for Micromegas Detector in Muon Image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Muon imaging technology is an innovative imaging technique that can be applied in volcano imaging, heavy nuclear material detection, and archaeological research. The Micromegas detector is a promising choice for muon imaging due to its high spatial resolution and large area. However, the large number of readout channels poses a challenge for electronics. In this paper, a compact front-end electronics (FEE) for reading Micromegas detectors is presented. The electronics use a current-based readout chip, ADAS1128, which integrates 128 current amplifiers for multi-channel charge measurement. After noise and calibration tests, detector energy resolution tests were performed using 5.9 keV X-rays. The X-ray full energy peak and Ar escape peak can be observed; the energy resolution of the full energy peak is about 20.23%@5.9 keV. Additionally, a muon image system was set up to verify the imaging capacity of Micromegas detectors. Test results show that the spatial resolution of the system is better than 200 {\mu}m. The muon image system can reconstruct the boundaries for objects with a size of 2 cm.</description>

      <title>A High Compression Ratio Channel Multiplexing Method for Micro-pattern Gaseous Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Micro-pattern gas detectors (MPGD) find wide-ranging applications in particle physics experiments, industry, and medical services, owing to their large area, fine spatial resolution, and relatively low material content within the sensitive region. However, the demand for a large number of readout channels poses a bottleneck, limiting the application of MPGD to achieve higher accuracy and more extensive area. This requirement also presents significant challenges regarding system integration, power consumption, cooling, and cost.
  Previous studies have shown that, under sparse effective hits, a channel multiplexing method based on position encoded can address this issue.
  Nonetheless, improving the compression ratio and addressing the high event rate problem remain key challenges requiring further investigation.
  In this research, we have developed two types of high compression ratio multiplexing methods and their mathematical models. It is shown that a maximum of $n \times (n-1)/2 - (n - 2)/2 + 1$ detector channels can be read out with n electronics channels if n is even. Using these methods, several multiplexing boards were designed and implemented. Considering the real condition of the detectors, we achieved an multiplexing board with 64 readout electronics reading out 1024 detector channels, marking the highest compression ratio in current research. Moreover, these multiplexing circuits were utilized and verified in our cosmic-ray muon imaging facilities, demonstrating their advantage of reducing the required number of front-end electronics cards.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Electron Backscattering on Silicon Drift Detectors for the Sterile Neutrino Search with TRISTAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sterile neutrinos are hypothetical particles in the minimal extension of the Standard Model of Particle Physics. They could be viable dark matter candidates if they have a mass in the keV range. The Karlsruhe tritium neutrino (KATRIN) experiment, extended with a silicon drift detector focal plane array (TRISTAN), has the potential to search for keV-scale sterile neutrinos by measuring the kinematics of the tritium $\beta$-decay. The collaboration targets a sensitivity of $10^{-6}$ on the mixing amplitude $\sin^2{\Theta}$. For this challenging target, a precise understanding of the detector response is necessary. In this work, we report on the characterization of electron backscattering from the detector surface, which is one of the main effects that influence the shape of the observed energy spectrum. Measurements were performed with a tandem silicon drift detector system and a custom-designed electron source. The measured detector response and backscattering probability are in good agreement with dedicated backscattering simulations using the Geant4 simulation toolkit.</description>

      <title>Bounds on Distinguishing Separated Wires Using Magnetic Field Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic current imaging (MCI) is useful for non-destructive characterization of microelectronics, including both security analysis and failure analysis, because magnetic fields penetrate the materials that comprise these components to enable through-package imaging of chip activity. Of particular interest are new capabilities offered by emerging magnetic field imagers, such as the Quantum Diamond Microscope, which provide simultaneous wide field-of-view, high spatial resolution vector magnetic field imaging capabilities under ambient conditions. While MCI offers several advantages for non-destructive measurement of microelectronics functional activity, there are many limitations of the technique due to rapid falloff of magnetic fields and loss of high frequency spatial information at large sensor standoff distances. To understand spatial resolution as a function of standoff distance, we consider the problem of using magnetic fields to distinguish (1) between a single wire carrying current $I$ and a pair of wires carrying current $I/2$ in the same direction and (2) between no currents and a pair of wires carrying current $I/2$ in opposite directions. In both cases, we compare performance for a single point measurement, representative of typical magnetometers, to performance for an array of measurements found in emerging magnetic imaging devices. Additionally, we examine the advantage provided by measurement of the full vector magnetic field compared to measurement of a single component. We establish and compare for the first time the theoretical lower bounds on separability based on the wire separation and sensor standoff distance of the magnetic field measurements obtained from traditional and new microelectronics reliability tools.</description>

      <title>Kaonic lead feasibility measurement at DA{\Phi}NE to solve the charged kaon mass discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An HPGe detector equipped with a transistor reset preamplifier and readout with a CAEN DT5781 fast pulse digitizer was employed in the measurement of X-rays from kaonic lead at the DA$\Phi$NE $e^+e^-$ collider at the Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati of INFN. A thin scintillator in front of a lead target was used to select kaons impinging on it and to form the trigger for the HPGe detector. We present the results of the kaonic lead feasibility measurement, where we show that the resolution of the HPGe detector in regular beam conditions remains the same as that without the beam and that a satisfactory background reduction can be achieved. This measurement serves as a test bed for future dedicated kaonic X-rays measurements for the more precise determination of the charged kaon mass.</description>

      <title>All-fiber, near-infrared, laser system at 780nm for atom cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cold neutral atoms are a promising "architecture" for novel and innovative quantum technology applications. These range from quantum sensors for magnetic fields, interferometers for gravimetry measurements, to quantum computing and simulations. Within this technological landscape, reliable laser systems are crucial in order to cool and manipulate atoms efficiently. We present the design, experimental realization and characterization of a relatively simple, compact, and economical laser system for quantum technology applications. It operates at 780 nm in order to work with Rubidium atoms, and it is entirely based on fiber components. This improves its reliability, and makes it less complex and more versatile with respect to a free-space system.
  In order to cut costs, we take advantage of already available commercial fiber devices at 1560 nm: due to their ubiquity in telecom applications they are in fact cheap and standardized. To operate at Rubidium wavelengths the system employs Second-Harmonic Generation (SHG) of the 1560 nm infrared radiation: two semiconductor lasers at 1560 nm (one for cooling, one for repumping) are combined, amplified in an Erbium-Doped Fiber Amplifier (EDFA), and frequency-doubled in a Periodically-Poled Lithium Niobate (PPLN) crystal.
  We characterize the amplitude stability of the lasers, their frequency noise, and the SHG efficiency. The measured features (rms relative amplitude noise of 3$\times$10$^{-4}$ at 1 s; linewidths well below 1 MHz) make our system a suitable candidate for applications in quantum sensors and atom interferometers.</description>

      <title>Design and test for the CEPC muon subdetector based on extruded scintillator and SiPM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02553v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A combination of scintillator, wavelength shifting (WLS) fiber, and silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) shows an excellent performance in the `$K_{L}$ and $\mu$ detector (KLM)' of the Belle II experiment. In this study, we present the R&amp;D efforts for a similar detection technology utilizing a new scintillator and SiPM. This technology can be applied to a muon detector for the proposed CEPC experiment. The R&amp;D encompasses the investigation of the performance of a new 150 cm-long scintillator, the NDL SiPM with a sensitive surface of $\times$ 3 mm, or the Hamamatsu MPPC with a sensitive surface of 1.3 mm $\times$ 1.3 mm. Additionally, it includes the construction of a detector strip and the methods employed to achieve excellent light collection. Cosmic ray tests reveal efficient photon collections by NDL SiPM or MPPC, with efficiencies well above 90% using a threshold of 8 p.e.. The time resolutions for hits at the far end of a scintillator strip are better than 1.7 ns. The observed performance lays the foundation for advancing R&amp;D including prototype modules aiming for reference Technical Design Report of CEPC detector recently.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work from the last years has raised the possibility that a portion of Dark Matter could consist of exotic particles, such as axion (anti)quark nuggets (AQN, A\bar{Q}N). After a brief review outlining the main features of axion antiquark nuggets, we explore potential experimental signatures that can be leveraged to search for these stable supermassive particles in future surface and underground experiments using large liquid detectors. These expected signals are discussed in relation to the specific characteristics of each detection system.</description>
