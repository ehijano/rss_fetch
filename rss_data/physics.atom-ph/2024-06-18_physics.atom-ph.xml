      <title>In Situ Dynamic Four-Dimensional Strong Field Ionization Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an approach for in situ dynamic four-dimensional (4D=3D space + 1D time) laser induced strong field ionization tomography, particularly suited for measuring far-from-equilibrium systems, such as supersonic and hypersonic pulsed gas jets. The inherent physical nature of strong-field interaction leads to significantly enhanced spatial resolution, with unique intensity-resolution coupling and localization of measurement depth. By employing femtosecond laser, temporal resolution is primarily limited by electronic jitter, typically to a few tens of picoseconds.</description>

      <title>Coherent amplitude modulation of continuous-wave light in cesium vapor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on observations of coherent, sustained oscillations in the absorption of continuous-wave light at 388 nm that excites the $6S_{1/2}\rightarrow 8P_{3/2}$ transition in cesium vapor. The oscillation frequency is close to the spacing of hyperfine levels of the $8P_{3/2}$ level that are excited simultaneously by the 388 nm field. We observe threshold behavior of the oscillation amplitude with pump power, and suggest that the effect is associated with infrared directional emission due to amplified spontaneous emission from the $8P_{3/2}\rightarrow 8S_{1/2}$ transition, that is assisted by retro-reflections from the cell windows. The effect may be used to probe a lasing process in an atomic vapor, by checking the temporal properties of the pump field transmitted through the vapor.</description>

      <title>Relativistic coupled-cluster calculations for the molecular properties of AlX$^+$ (X: F, Cl, Br, I, At and Ts) ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, the molecular permanent electric dipole moments and components of static dipole polarizabilities for the electronic ground state of singly charged aluminum monohalides are reported. The coupled-cluster method by considering single and double excitations (CCSD) together with relativistic Dyall basis sets have been used to carry out these molecular property calculations. The contribution from triple excitations are incorporated through perturbative triples (CCSD(T)). The results from a series of progressively larger basis sets are extrapolated to the complete basis set limit. Further, the role of correlation and relativistic effects, and also the effect of augmentation over the considered basis sets on the valence molecular properties are studied. Our results are compared with those available in the literature.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Shifts in Deuterated Methanol Induced by Variation of me/mp</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical calculations of the sensitivity coefficients, Q_mu, of microwave molecular transitions in the ground torsion-rotation state of deuterated methanol (CH3OD, CD3OH, and CD3OD) to small variations in the fundamental physical constant mu = me/mp - the electron-to-proton mass ratio - are reported. Theoretical motivation for changes in mu comes from a variety of models beyond the Standard Model of particle physics which are invoked to explain the nature of dark matter and dark energy that dominate the Universe. The calculated values of Q_mu range from -300 to +73 and, thus, make deuterated methanol promising for searches for small space-time changes in mu. It is also shown that among the calculated sensitivity coefficients Q_mu using different Hamiltonians in the present and previous works, there are several pronounced outliers of unclear nature.</description>

      <title>Attosecond pulse synthesis from high-order harmonic generation in intense squeezed light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-order harmonic generation (HHG) provides a broad spectral bandwidth for synthesizing attosecond pulses. However, in the current HHG schemes, only part of the harmonics can be phase-locked, which limits the ability to achieve shorter attosecond pulses. Here, we study attosecond pulse synthesis from HHG of an atom driven by an intense quantum light, i.e., squeezed light. It is interestingly found that the harmonics in the whole spectrum can be phase-locked and, by using these harmonics, the width of the synthesized attosecond pulse is greatly reduced. By developing strong-field approximation theory in squeezed light, the physics of the phase-locked harmonic generation throughout the HHG spectrum is revealed and is found to be independent of the target system. Furthermore, we uncover the dependence of the synthesized attosecond pulse width on the squeezing parameter of the squeezed light. Our findings provide a robust tool for obtaining phase-locked harmonics throughout the HHG spectrum for synthesizing short attosecond pulses.</description>

      <title>Color-switching in an optical parametric oscillator using a phase-conjugate mirror</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a phase-conjugate resonator which passively produces stable pulses that alternate between the probe and the conjugate colors. The requisite phase-conjugate mirror inside the resonator is constructed using non-degenerate four-wave mixing (4WM) in rubidium vapor. The glancing-angle phase-conjugate mirror is a 100\% output coupler, and therefore this resonator is unusual in that no light circulates the cavity more than once. Without the gain of the phase-conjugate mirror, the cavity boundary conditions, and thus resonant modes, are not defined and therefore can be tuned by the pump. The output of the optical parametric oscillator that is formed above threshold can passively mode-lock. The phase-conjugate mirror removes thermal or acoustic instabilities that are on a MHz or slower timescale. This work provides a new method for stable pulsing using phase-conjugate optics, and suggests a platform for producing mode-locked pulses with squeezed light, as the 4WM process has already demonstrated quantum correlations.</description>

      <title>GHZ protocols enhance frequency metrology despite spontaneous decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of correlated states and measurements promises improvements in the accuracy of frequency metrology and the stability of atomic clocks. However, developing strategies robust against dominant noise processes remains challenging. We address the issue of decoherence due to spontaneous decay and show that Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states, in conjunction with a correlated measurement and nonlinear estimation strategy, achieve gains comparable to fundamental bounds for ensembles of up to 40 atoms. This result is surprising since GHZ states do not provide any enhancement under dephasing noise compared to the standard quantum limit of uncorrelated states. The gain arises from a veto signal, which allows for the detection and mitigation of errors caused by spontaneous emission events. Through comprehensive Monte-Carlo simulations of atomic clocks, we demonstrate the robustness of the GHZ protocol.</description>

      <title>Effective Faraday interaction between light and nuclear spins of Helium-3 in its ground state: a semiclassical study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the semiclassical evolution equations for a system consisting of helium-3 atoms in the $2^3S$ metastable state interacting with a light field far-detuned from the $2^3S-2^3P$ transition, in the presence of metastability exchange collisions with ground state helium atoms and a static magnetic field. For two configurations, each corresponding to a particular choice of atom-light detuning in which the contribution of either the metastable level $F=1/2$ or $F=3/2$ is dominant, we derive a simple model of three coupled collective spins from which we can analytically extract an effective coupling constant between the collective nuclear spin and light. In these two configurations, we compare the predictions of our simplified model with the full model.</description>

      <title>Estimating the D-line Energy Splitting of Alkali Metals Using a Modified Perturbation Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report here on how a known method from standard perturbation theory for estimating the energy of the D-line splitting in hydrogen can be modified to effectively approximate this quantity for all of the alkali metals. The approach utilizes a Rayleigh- Schrodinger perturbation theory first order correction to the energy. The perturbing Hamiltonian is the standard relativistically corrected spin-orbit Hamiltonian. From this, one derives an energy difference between the doublet lines that is theoretically appropriate for any one electron atom. This energy difference is written in terms of the Bohr energy. The results are good for hydrogen but, as expected, are significantly off from the experimental values for the multi-electron alkali metals. We show here that by replacing the Bohr energy with a first ionization potential, that the theory then gives greatly improved values for the D level splitting energy. However, this approach overestimates the splitting energy for the light alkali metals and underestimates it for the heavy ones. The best result was for Rb where the estimate only varied from the experimentally reported value by 3.2%. The modified theory is shown to yield accurate results for all of the alkali metals when the original Bohr energy is adjusted with an appropriate screening constant. Screening constants generated using the Slater scheme however, which yield accurate estimates for ionization potentials, do not give the correct results for the D line splitting energies. A method is given whereby effective screening constants can be computed. These screening constants are found to be a function of the atomic number with constant coefficients that can be estimated by the ratio of cation to atomic radii. We conclude that the discrepancy in screening constants is due to electron-relaxation, a phenomenon that occurs during ionization.</description>

      <title>Influence of catastrophes and hidden dynamical symmetries on ultrafast backscattered photoelectrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the effect of using potentials with a Coulomb tail and different degrees of softening in the photoelectron momentum distributions (PMDs) using the recently implemented hybrid forward-boundary CQSFA (H-CQSFA). We show that introducing a softening in the Coulomb interaction influences the ridges observed in the PMDs associated with backscattered electron trajectories. In the limit of a hard-core Coulomb interaction, the re-scattering ridges close along the polarization axis, while for a soft-core potential, they are interrupted at ridge-specific angles. We analyze the momentum mapping of the different orbits leading to the ridges. For the hard-core potential, there exist two types of saddle-point solutions that coalesce at the ridge. By increasing the softening, we show that two additional solutions emerge as the result of breaking a hidden dynamical symmetry associated exclusively with the Coulomb potential. Further signatures of this symmetry breaking are encountered in subsets of momentum-space trajectories. Finally, we use scattering theory to show how the softening affects the maximal scattering angle and provide estimates that agree with our observations from the CQSFA. This implies that, in the presence of residual binding potentials in the electron's continuum propagation, the distinction between purely kinematic and dynamic caustics becomes blurred.</description>

      <title>Quantum spin ice in three-dimensional Rydberg atom arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.04657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum spin liquids are exotic phases of matter whose low-energy physics is described as the deconfined phase of an emergent gauge theory. With recent theory proposals and an experiment showing preliminary signs of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order [G. Semeghini et al., Science 374, 1242 (2021)], Rydberg atom arrays have emerged as a promising platform to realize a quantum spin liquid. In this work, we propose a way to realize a $U(1)$ quantum spin liquid in three spatial dimensions, described by the deconfined phase of $U(1)$ gauge theory in a pyrochlore lattice Rydberg atom array. We study the ground state phase diagram of the proposed Rydberg system as a function of experimentally relevant parameters. Within our calculation, we find that by tuning the Rabi frequency, one can access both the confinement-deconfinement transition driven by a proliferation of "magnetic" monopoles and the Higgs transition driven by a proliferation of "electric" charges of the emergent gauge theory. We suggest experimental probes for distinguishing the deconfined phase from ordered phases. This work serves as a proposal to access a confinement-deconfinement transition in three spatial dimensions on a Rydberg-based quantum simulator.</description>
