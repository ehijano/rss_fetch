      <title>Coloring bridge-free antiprismatic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coloring problem is a well-research topic and its complexity is known for several classes of graphs. However, the question of its complexity remains open for the class of antiprismatic graphs, which are the complement of prismatic graphs and one of the four remaining cases highlighted by Lozin and Malishev. In this article we focus on the equivalent question of the complexity of the clique cover problem in prismatic graphs.
  A graph $G$ is prismatic if for every triangle $T$ of $G$, every vertex of $G$ not in $T$ has a unique neighbor in $T$. A graph is co-bridge-free if it has no $C_4+2K_1$ as induced subgraph. We give a polynomial time algorithm that solves the clique cover problem in co-bridge-free prismatic graphs. It relies on the structural description given by Chudnovsky and Seymour, and on later work of Preissmann, Robin and Trotignon.
  We show that co-bridge-free prismatic graphs have a bounded number of disjoint triangles and that implies that the algorithm presented by Preissmann et al. applies.</description>

      <title>On a Problem of Ramsey Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1955, Greenwood and Gleason showed that the Ramsey number R(3, 3, 3) = 17 by constructing an edge-chromatic graph on 16 vertices in three colors with no triangles. Their technique employed finite fields. This same result was obtained later by using another technique. In this article, we examine the complete graph on 17 vertices, K17, which can be represented as a regular polygon of 17 sides with all its diagonals. We color each edge of K17 with one of the three colors, blue, red or yellow. The graph thus obtained is called complete trichromatic graph K17^(3) (the superscript determines the number of colors). A triangle contained in graph K17^(3) with edges colored with one and only one color is called monochromatic. It has been shown that for any coloring of the K17^(3) edges, K17^(3) contains at least one monochromatic triangle. This article examines the problem of determining the minimum number of monochromatic triangles with the same color contained in K17^(3).</description>

      <title>On the Structure of Bad Science Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The bad science matrix problem consists in finding, among all matrices $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ with rows having unit $\ell^2$ norm, one that maximizes $\beta(A) = \frac{1}{2^n} \sum_{x \in \{-1, 1\}^n} \|Ax\|_\infty$. Our main contribution is an explicit construction of an $n \times n$ matrix $A$ showing that $\beta(A) \geq \sqrt{\log_2(n+1)}$, which is only 18% smaller than the asymptotic rate. We prove that every entry of any optimal matrix is a square root of a rational number, and we find provably optimal matrices for $n \leq 4$.</description>

      <title>Sandwiching Random Geometric Graphs and Erdos-Renyi with Applications: Sharp Thresholds, Robust Testing, and Enumeration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The distribution $\mathsf{RGG}(n,\mathbb{S}^{d-1},p)$ is formed by sampling independent vectors $\{V_i\}_{i = 1}^n$ uniformly on $\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$ and placing an edge between pairs of vertices $i$ and $j$ for which $\langle V_i,V_j\rangle \ge \tau^p_d,$ where $\tau^p_d$ is such that the expected density is $p.$ Our main result is a poly-time implementable coupling between Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi and $\mathsf{RGG}$ such that $\mathsf{G}(n,p(1 - \tilde{O}(\sqrt{np/d})))\subseteq \mathsf{RGG}(n,\mathbb{S}^{d-1},p)\subseteq \mathsf{G}(n,p(1 + \tilde{O}(\sqrt{np/d})))$ edgewise with high probability when $d\gg np.$ We apply the result to: 1) Sharp Thresholds: We show that for any monotone property having a sharp threshold with respect to the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi distribution and critical probability $p^c_n,$ random geometric graphs also exhibit a sharp threshold when $d\gg np^c_n,$ thus partially answering a question of Perkins. 2) Robust Testing: The coupling shows that testing between $\mathsf{G}(n,p)$ and $\mathsf{RGG}(n,\mathbb{S}^{d-1},p)$ with $\epsilon n^2p$ adversarially corrupted edges for any constant $\epsilon&gt;0$ is information-theoretically impossible when $d\gg np.$ We match this lower bound with an efficient (constant degree SoS) spectral refutation algorithm when $d\ll np.$ 3) Enumeration: We show that the number of geometric graphs in dimension $d$ is at least $\exp(dn\log^{-7}n)$, recovering (up to the log factors) the sharp result of Sauermann.</description>

      <title>Optimal Mixed Integer Linear Optimization Trained Multivariate Classification Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multivariate decision trees are powerful machine learning tools for classification and regression that attract many researchers and industry professionals. An optimal binary tree has two types of vertices, (i) branching vertices which have exactly two children and where datapoints are assessed on a set of discrete features and (ii) leaf vertices at which datapoints are given a prediction, and can be obtained by solving a biobjective optimization problem that seeks to (i) maximize the number of correctly classified datapoints and (ii) minimize the number of branching vertices. Branching vertices are linear combinations of training features and therefore can be thought of as hyperplanes. In this paper, we propose two cut-based mixed integer linear optimization (MILO) formulations for designing optimal binary classification trees (leaf vertices assign discrete classes). Our models leverage on-the-fly identification of minimal infeasible subsystems (MISs) from which we derive cutting planes that hold the form of packing constraints. We show theoretical improvements on the strongest flow-based MILO formulation currently in the literature and conduct experiments on publicly available datasets to show our models' ability to scale, strength against traditional branch and bound approaches, and robustness in out-of-sample test performance. Our code and data are available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>On locating and neighbor-locating colorings of sparse graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.13557v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A proper $k$-coloring of a graph $G$ is a \emph{neighbor-locating $k$-coloring} if for each pair of vertices in the same color class, the two sets of colors found in their respective neighborhoods are different. The \textit{neighbor-locating chromatic number} $\chi_{NL}(G)$ is the minimum $k$ for which $G$ admits a neighbor-locating $k$-coloring. A proper $k$-vertex-coloring of a graph $G$ is a \emph{locating $k$-coloring} if for each pair of vertices $x$ and $y$ in the same color-class, there exists a color class $S_i$ such that $d(x,S_i)\neq d(y,S_i)$. The locating chromatic number $\chi_{L}(G)$ is the minimum $k$ for which $G$ admits a locating $k$-coloring. Our main results concern the largest possible order of a sparse graph of given neighbor-locating chromatic number. More precisely, we prove that if $G$ has order $n$, neighbor-locating chromatic number $k$ and average degree at most $2a$, where $2a\le k-1$ is a positive integer, then $n$ is upper-bounded by $\mathcal{O}(a^2(k^{2a+1}))$. We also design a family of graphs of bounded maximum degree whose order is close to reaching this upper bound. Our upper bound generalizes two previous bounds from the literature, which were obtained for graphs of bounded maximum degree and graphs of bounded cycle rank, respectively. Also, we prove that determining whether $\chi_L(G)\le k$ and $\chi_{NL}(G)\le k$ are NP-complete for sparse graphs: more precisely, for graphs with average degree at most 7, maximum average degree at most 20 and that are $4$-partite. We also study the possible relation between the ordinary chromatic number, the locating chromatic number and the neighbor-locating chromatic number of a graph.</description>
