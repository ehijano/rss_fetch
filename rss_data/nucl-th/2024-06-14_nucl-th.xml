      <title>MURCA driven Bulk viscosity in neutrino trapped baryonic matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine bulk viscosity, taking into account trapped neutrinos in baryonic matter, in the context of binary neutron star mergers. Following the merging event, the binary star can yield a remnant compact object with densities up to $5$ nuclear saturation density and temperature upto $50$ MeV resulting in the retention of neutrinos. We employ two relativistic mean field models, NL3 and DDME2, to describe the neutrino-trapped baryonic matter. The dissipation coefficient is determined by evaluating the Modified URCA interaction rate in the dense baryonic medium, and accounting for perturbations caused by density oscillations. We observe the resonant behavior of bulk viscosity as it varies with the temperature of the medium. The bulk viscosity peak remains within the temperature range of $\sim 13-50$ MeV, depending upon the underlying equation of states and lepton fractions. This temperature range corresponds to the relevant domain of binary neutron star mergers. We also note that in presence of neutrinos in the medium the bulk viscosity peak shifts towards higher temperature and the peak value of bulk viscosity also changes. The time scale of viscous dissipation is dictated by the beta-off-equilibrium susceptibilities derived from the nuclear equation of state. The resulting viscous decay time scale ranges from $32-100$ milliseconds, which aligns with the order of magnitude of the post-merger object's survival time in some specific scenarios.</description>

      <title>Elastic scattering on a quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scattering probes the internal structure of quantum systems. We calculate the two-particle elastic scattering phase shift for a short-ranged interaction on a quantum computer. Short-ranged interactions with a large scattering length or shallow bound state describe a universality class that is of interest in atomic, condensed matter, nuclear, and particle physics. The phase shift is calculated by relating the ground state energy of the interacting particles in a harmonic trap. The relaxation method is used as the variational quantum eigensolver for the ground state calculation. Schmidt decomposition is used to reduce quantum circuits nominally requiring tens of qubits to 2-qubit circuits, thus reducing the noise in quantum measurements. Calculations in multi-particle systems with many-body interactions would benefit from this reduction of qubits in noisy quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Final-state interactions in neutrino-induced proton knockout from argon in MicroBooNE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrino event generators make use of intranuclear cascade models (INCs), to predict the kinematics of hadrons produced in neutrino-nucleus interactions. We perform a consistent comparison of different INCs, by using the same set of events as input to the NEUT, NuWro, Achilles and INCL INCs. The inputs correspond to calculations of the fully differential single-proton knockout cross section, either in the distorted-wave impulse approximation (DWIA) or plane-wave impulse approximation (PWIA), both including realistic nuclear hole spectral functions. We compare the INC results to DWIA calculations with an optical potential, used extensively in the analysis of (e,e'p) experiments. We point out a systematic discrepancy between both approaches. We apply the INC results to recent MicroBooNE data. We assess the influence of the choice of spectral function, finding that large variations in realistic spectral functions are indistinguishable with present data. The data is underpredicted, with strength missing in the region where two-nucleon knockout and resonance production contribute. However, the data is underpredicted also in regions of low transverse missing momentum, where one-nucleon knockout dominates. The inclusion of the interference with two-body currents could lead to additional strength in this region.</description>

      <title>Surface and curvature tensions of relativistic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, we show a simple method to obtain fittings for the surface and curvature tensions. The method uses the nuclear mass of a spherical fully ionized atom and a simple expression for the binding energy such that a least square fit is found when confronted with the Atomic Mass Evaluation (AME) 2020. The fittings are then used to evaluate the pasta phase free energy per particle, which is confronted with the one obtained with a Thomas-Fermi fitting. The results are very encouraging and suggest that this recipe can be safely used whenever the surface and curvature tensions are necessary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17409v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the propagation of ultraheavy (UH) nuclei as ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). We show that their energy loss lengths at $\lesssim300$~EeV are significantly longer than those of protons and intermediate-mass nuclei, and that the highest-energy cosmic rays with energies beyond $\sim100$ EeV, including the Amaterasu particle, may originate from such UH-UHECRs. We derive constraints on the contribution of UH-UHECR sources, and find that they are consistent with energy generation rate densities of UHECRs from collapsars and neutron star mergers.</description>

      <title>On the potential of probing the neutron star composition in accreting X-ray binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transiently accreting Low Mass X-Ray Binaries have the potential to probe the core composition of their neutron stars via deep crustal heating caused by nuclear reactions. We statistically assess this deep crustal heating scenario, taking into account the various microphysical and astrophysical uncertainties. We find that despite the sizable uncertainties there is the chance to discriminate different compositional scenarios. Several observed sources statistically challenge a minimal hadronic matter composition, where cooling proceeds exclusively via slow modified Urca reactions. Considering here two exemplary extended uniform compositions, namely ultra-dense hadronic matter with direct Urca emission and ungapped quark matter, we find that they are even within uncertainties distinguishable. We show that although exotic forms of matter are generally only expected in an inner core, which could in principle have any size, sufficiently large astrophysical data sets nonetheless have the potential to statistically discriminate compositional scenarios, in particular when further mass measurements become available.</description>

      <title>Color Coherence Effects in Dipole-Quark Scattering in the Soft Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Color coherence effects play a crucial role in the description of jet evolution at collider experiments. It is well known that the stimulated gluon emission suffered by energetic jets traversing deconfined QCD matter is also affected by color coherence effects. Through multiple soft scatterings with the medium constituents, an antenna will lose its color correlation, causing its legs to behave as independent emitters after the so-called decoherence time. In this work we provide the first computation of the properties of the recoils produced as a result of these soft scatterings between a color coherent dipole and the medium constituents. Our findings reveal that the angular phase-space of these soft recoils is strongly restricted by the opening angle of the dipole itself due to quantum interference effects. In this long wavelength limit, one can effectively consider that interactions take place with each of the legs of the dipole separately, provided that the angular constraints dictated by the corresponding color flow topologies are respected. This is in complete analogy with the case of soft gluon emission in vacuum, where the recoil quark plays the role of the emitted gluon. As a direct phenomenological application we estimate the collisional energy loss rate of a color antenna. Importantly, these results indicate the way in which color coherence effects can be implemented in jet quenching models that account for the recoils from elastic scatterings, improving in this way our description of medium response physics in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>The connection between Nucleon Energy Correlators and Fracture Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a sum rule that connects fracture functions to nucleon energy-energy correlators~(NEECs) in a one-to-one correspondence. Using this sum rule, we study the energy pattern in the target fragmentation region of deep inelastic scatterings. Through investigations up to twist-3, we express all eighteen energy-pattern structure functions in terms of associated NEECs, elucidating various azimuthal and spin asymmetries critical for nucleon tomography. Additionally, we investigate the perturbative matching of the twist-2 quark NEECs. We demonstrate that the Sivers-type and worm-gear-type quark NEECs match onto twist-3 multi-parton distributions. Our work provides a framework for examining energy-weighted observables through hadron production processes in the target fragmentation region, offering new insights into nucleon tomography.</description>

      <title>FastEEC: Fast Evaluation of N-point Energy Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energy correlators characterize the asymptotic energy flow in scattering events produced at colliders, from which the microscopic physics of the scattering can be deduced. This view of collisions is akin to analyses of the Cosmic Microwave Background, and a range of promising phenomenological applications of energy correlators have been identified, including the study of hadronization, the deadcone effect, measuring $\alpha_s$ and the top quark mass. While $N$-point energy correlators are interesting to study for larger values of $N$, their evaluation is computationally intensive, scaling like $M^N/N!$, where $M$ is the number of particles. In this letter we develop a fast method for their evaluation, exploiting that correlations at a given angular scale are insensitive to effects at other (widely-separated) scales. For concreteness we focus on the projected energy correlator, which projects onto the largest separation between the $N$ directions. E.g.~for $N=7$ we find a speed up of up to four orders of magnitude, depending on the desired accuracy. We also consider the possibility of raising the energy to a power higher than one in the energy correlator, which has been proposed to reduce soft sensitivity, and further cuts back the required computation time. These higher-power correlators are not collinear safe, but as a byproduct our approach suggests a natural method to regularize them, such that they can be described using perturbation theory. This letter is accompanied by a public code that implements our method.</description>

      <title>QCD constraints on isospin-dense matter and the nuclear equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the behavior of dense hadronic matter is a central goal in nuclear physics as it governs the nature and dynamics of astrophysical objects such as supernovae and neutron stars. Because of the non-perturbative nature of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), little is known rigorously about hadronic matter in these extreme conditions. Here, lattice QCD calculations are used to compute thermodynamic quantities and the equation of state of QCD over a wide range of isospin chemical potentials. Agreement is seen with chiral perturbation theory predictions when the chemical potential is small. Comparison to perturbative QCD calculations at large chemical potential allows for an estimate of the gap in the superconducting phase, and this quantity is seen to agree with perturbative determinations. Since the partition function for an isospin chemical potential, $\mu_I$, bounds the partition function for a baryon chemical potential $\mu_B=3/2\mu_I$, these calculations also provide rigorous non-perturbative QCD bounds on the nuclear equation of state over a wide range of baryon densities for the first time.</description>

      <title>Wave function matching transformation for solving the quantum many-body problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.17488v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new approach for solving quantum many-body systems called wave function matching. Wave function matching transforms the interaction between particles so that the wave functions up to some finite range match that of an easily computable interaction. This allows for calculations of systems that would otherwise be impossible due to problems such as Monte Carlo sign cancelations. We apply the method to lattice Monte Carlo simulations of light nuclei, medium-mass nuclei, neutron matter, and nuclear matter. We use high-fidelity chiral effective field theory interactions and find good agreement with empirical data. These results are accompanied by new insights on the nuclear interactions that may help to resolve long-standing challenges in accurately reproducing nuclear binding energies, charge radii, and nuclear matter saturation in ab initio calculations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.13203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nuclear saturation and the symmetry energy are key properties of low-energy nuclear physics that depend on fine details of the nuclear interaction. The equation-of-state around saturation is also an important anchor for extrapolations to higher densities and studies of neutron stars. Here we develop a unified statistical framework that uses realistic nuclear forces to link the theoretical modeling of finite nuclei and infinite nuclear matter. We construct fast and accurate emulators for nuclear-matter observables and employ an iterative history-matching approach to explore and reduce the enormous parameter domain of $\Delta$-full chiral interactions. We perform rigorous uncertainty quantification and find that model calibration including \nuc{16}{O} observables gives saturation predictions that are more precise than those that only use few-body data.</description>

      <title>A bridge between trace anomaly and deconfinement phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.14138v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the fact that both the dilaton potential encoding the trace anomalies of QCD and the Polyakov loop potential measuring the deconfinement phase transition can be expressed in the logarithmic forms, as well as the fact that the scale symmetry is expected to be restoring and colors are deconfined in extreme conditions such as high temperatures and/or densities, we conjecture a relation between the dilaton potential and the Polyakov loop potential. Explicitly, we start from the Coleman--Weinberg type potential of a real scalar field -- a dilaton or conformal compensator -- and make an ansatz of the relation between this scalar field and the Polyakov loop to obtain the Polyakov loop potential, which can be parameterized in Lattice QCD (LQCD) in the pure glue sector. We find that the coefficients of Polyakov potential fitted from Lattice data are automatically satisfied in this ansatz, the locations of deconfinement and scale restoration are locked to each other, and the first-order phase transition can be realized. Extensions to the low-energy effective quark models are also discussed. The conjectured relation may deepen our understanding of the evolution of the universe, the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking, the phase diagram of QCD matter, and the properties of neutron~stars.</description>

Abstract: Dilepton production provides a unique probe of the strong electromagnetic field produced in heavy-ion collisions. To map out the behavior of its transverse momentum broadening, we present a theoretical model based on the equivalent photon approximation, and then we update it to make direct comparisons with the recent experimental measurements. We find that the model calculations can describe well, not only the average transverse momentum squared of $e^{+}e^{-}$ pairs in Au--Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=200$ GeV, but also the acoplanarity of $\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ pairs in Pb--Pb collisions at$\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV. Furthermore, the model predictions are also able to reproduce the measured dependencies of the pair mass and the transverse momentum squared.</description>

      <title>Correlation between the charge radii difference in mirror partner nuclei and the symmetry energy slope</title>

Abstract: A correlation between the charge radii difference of mirror partner nuclei $\Delta{R_{\mathrm{ch}}}$ and the slope parameter $L$ of symmetry energy has been built to ascertain the equation of state of isospin asymmetric nuclear matter. In this work, the influences of pairing correlations and isoscalar compression modulus on the \Delta{R_{\mathrm{ch}}}$ are systematically investigated based on the Skyrme energy density functional theory. The calculated results suggest that the linear correlation between $\Delta{R_{\mathrm{ch}}}$ and $L$ is decreased by the surface pairing correlations. The slope parameter deduced from the difference of charge radii of mirror-pair nuclei $^{32}$Ar-$^{32}$Si, $^{36}$Ca-$^{36}$S, $^{38}$Ca-$^{38}$Ar, and $^{54}$Ni-$^{54}$Fe falls into the range of $L=42.57$-$50.64$ MeV, that is, the rather soft equation of state of asymmetric nuclear matter. Besides, the range of the slope parameter can also be influenced by the effective forces classified by various isoscalar incompressibility coefficients.</description>

      <title>Nucleon Isovector Axial Form Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11330v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present results for the isovector axial vector form factors obtained using thirteen 2+1+1-flavor highly improved staggered quark (HISQ) ensembles generated by the MILC collaboration. The calculation of nucleon two- and three-point correlation functions has been done using Wilson-clover fermions. In the analysis of these data, we quantify the sensitivity of the results to strategies used for removing excited state contamination and invoke the partially conserved axial current relation between the form factors to choose between them. Our data driven analysis includes removing contributions from multihadron $N \pi$ states that make significant contributions. Our final results are: $g_A = 1.292 (53)_\text{stat}\,(24)_\text{sys}$ for the axial charge; $g_S = 1.085 (50)_\text{stat}\, (103)_\text{sys}$ and $g_T = 0.991 (21)_\text{stat}\, (10)_\text{sys}$ for the scalar and tensor charges; $\langle r_A^2 \rangle = 0.439 (56)_\text{stat} (34)_\text{sys}$ fm${}^2$ for the mean squared axial charge radius, $g_P^\ast = 9.03(47)_\text{stat}(42)_\text{sys} $ for the induced pseudoscalar charge; and $g_{\pi NN} = 14.14(81)_\text{stat}(85)_\text{sys}$ for the pion-nucleon coupling. We also provide a parameterization of the axial form factor $G_A(Q^2)$ over the range $0 \le Q^2 \le 1$ GeV${}^2$ for use in phenomenology and a comparison with other lattice determinations. We find that the various lattice data agree within 10\% but are significantly different from the extraction of $G_A(Q^2)$ from the $\nu$-deuterium scattering data.</description>
