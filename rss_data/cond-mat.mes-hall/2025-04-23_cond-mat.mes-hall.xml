      <title>Optical-vortex-pulse induced nonequilibrium spin textures in spin-orbit coupled electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical vortex beams are a type of topological light characterized by their inherent orbital angular momentum, leading to the propagation of a spiral-shaped wavefront. In this study, we focus on two-dimensional electrons with Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit interactions and examine how they respond to pulsed vortex beams in the terahertz frequency band. Spin-orbital interactions play a vital role in transferring the orbital angular momentum of light to electron systems and generating spatiotemporal spin textures. We show that the spatiotemporal spin polarization of electrons reflects orbital angular momentum carried by optical vortex pulses. These findings demonstrate how optical vortices facilitate ultrafast spin manipulation in spin-orbit-coupled electrons. Our results can be straightforwardly extended to the case of higher-frequency vortex beams for other two-dimensional metals with a larger Fermi energy.</description>

      <title>Can we build a transistor using vacancy-induced bound states in a topological insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological insulators (TIs) have been considered as promising candidates for next generation of electronic devices due to their topologically protected quantum transport phenomena. In this work, a scheme for atomic-scale field effect transistor (FET) based on vacancy-induced edge states in TIs is promoted. By designing the positions of vacancies, the closed channel between source and drain terminals provided by vacancy-induced edge states can have the energy spectra with a gap between edge and bulk states. When gate terminal receive the signal, electric field applied by gate terminal can shift quasi Fermi energy of the closed channel from edge states into the gap, and hence open the channel between source and drain terminals. The energy spectra and the effect of electric field are demonstrated using Haldane model and density functional theory (DFT) respectively. This work suggest possible revolutionary applicational potentials of vacancy-induced edge states in topological insulators for atomic-scale electronics.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric performance of quantum dots embedded in an Aharonov-Bohm ring: a Pauli master equation approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within linear response theory using Pauli master equation approach, we have investigated the thermoelectric properties of quantum dots (QDs) embedded in an Aharonov-Bohm (AB) ring weakly coupled to two metallic electrodes. This study explores the impact of magnetic flux on thermoelectric transport, emphasizing the role of quantum interference induced by the flux. When the magnetic flux is varied from 0 to one quantum of flux $\Phi = \Phi_{0} = \frac{h}{e}$, both the electrical conductance and the thermoelectric figure of merit ($ZT$) significantly increase by two order of magnitude. Moreover, our investigation into the effects of onsite and inter-site Coulomb interactions in this nanojunction indicates that an optimal $ZT$ is attained with moderate onsite Coulomb interaction and minimal inter-site Coulomb interaction. We briefly discussed the effects of asymmetric arrangements of triple QDs within an AB ring. However, within our parameter regime, a symmetric arrangement offers superior thermoelectric performance compared to asymmetric configurations. Furthermore, we explored how increasing the number of QDs in the ring enhances the thermoelectric properties, resulting in a potential $ZT$ value of around $0.43$. This study shows that arranging multiple QDs symmetrically in an AB ring can result in significant thermoelectric performance in nanostructured system at low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Universal transparency and fine band structure near the Dirac point in HgTe quantum wells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-orbit coupling in thin HgTe quantum wells results in a relativistic-like electron band structure, making it a versatile solid state platform to observe and control non-trivial electrodynamic phenomena. Here we report an observation of universal terahertz (THz) transparency determined by fine-structure constant $\alpha \approx 1/137$ in 6.5 nm-thick HgTe layer, close to the critical thickness separating phases with topologically different electronic band structure. Using THz spectroscopy in magnetic field we obtain direct evidence of asymmetric spin splitting of the Dirac cone. This particle-hole asymmetry facilitates optical control of edge spin currents in the quantum wells.</description>

      <title>Interacting Chern insulator transition on the sphere: revealing the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In two spatial dimensions, the transition between topological and trivial Chern insulators exemplifies a class of beyond-Landau critical phenomena. We show that the interaction-driven multicritical point of this transition falls into the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa (GNY) universality class, a topic of considerable interest in both high-energy and condensed matter physics. In this work, we focus on the $N=2$ case of the GNY criticality. We employ exact diagonalization of Dirac fermions on a sphere to circumvent the parity anomaly, capitalize on full SO(3) symmetry to reduce finite-size effects, and directly extract operator scaling dimensions from the excitation spectrum. Despite working with only modest system sizes, our results closely match conformal bootstrap predictions for low scaling dimension operators and reveal several previously uncharacterized higher primaries. These findings highlight the efficacy of spherical geometry for probing interacting Dirac criticality.</description>

      <title>Long-lived entanglement of a spin-qubit register in silicon photonics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Color centers provide an optical interface to quantum registers based on electron and nuclear spin qubits in solids. The T center in silicon is an emerging spin-photon interface that combines telecom O-band optical transitions and a long-lived electron spin in a scalable photonics platform. In this work, we demonstrate the initialization, coherent control, and state readout of a three-qubit register based on the electron spin of a T center coupled to a hydrogen and a silicon nuclear spin. The spin register exhibits long spin echo coherence times of $0.41(2)$ ms for the electron spin, $112(12)$ ms for the hydrogen nuclear spin, and $67(7)$ ms for the silicon nuclear spin. We use nuclear-nuclear two-qubit gates to generate entanglement between the two nuclear spins with a fidelity of $F=0.77(3)$ and a coherence time of $T^*_2=2.60(8)$ ms. Our results show that T centers can realize a long-lived multi-qubit register with an optical interface in silicon photonics.</description>

      <title>Mapping molecular polariton transport via pump-probe microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15501v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate how the transport properties of molecular polaritons in optical cavities can be extracted from a microscopic modeling of pump-probe spectroscopy. Our approach combines a mean-field treatment of the light-matter Hamiltonian with a perturbative expansion of both light and matter components, along with spatial coarse-graining. This approach extends semiclassical cavity spectroscopy to multimode light-matter interactions, providing full access to spatially resolved transient spectra. By simulating a microscopy experiment with counter-propagating pump and probe pulses, we compute the differential transmission and show how molecular dephasing and persistent dark exciton populations drive sub-group-velocity transport of the root-mean-square displacement. We analyze transport across the polariton dispersion, showing how velocity renormalization correlates with excitonic weight, consistent with experimental observations, and further its dependence on the rate of molecular dephasing. Our results highlight the need to consider measured spectroscopic observables when characterizing transport in polaritonic systems.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Ultrashort Orbital Transport in Heavy Metals Revealed by Terahertz Emission Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The orbital angular momentum of electrons offers a promising, yet largely unexplored, degree of freedom for ultrafast, energy-efficient information processing. As the foundation of orbitronics, understanding how orbital currents propagate and convert into charge currents is essential - but remains elusive due to the challenge in disentangling orbital and spin dynamics in ultrathin films. Although orbital currents have been predicted to propagate over long distances in materials, recent theoretical studies argue that lattice symmetry may constrain their mean free paths (MFPs) to the scale of a single atomic layer. In this work, we provide the first direct experimental evidence for ultrashort orbital MFPs in heavy metals (HMs) - W, Ta, Pt - revealed by femtosecond terahertz emission spectroscopy. This is enabled by sub-nanometer-precision control of thin-film thickness using wedge-shaped HM|Ni heterostructures. By employing a multi-component terahertz-emission model, we quantitatively extract the orbital MFPs, consistently finding them shorter than their spin counterparts. Furthermore, control experiments rule out interfacial orbital-to-charge conversion as the dominant mechanism, confirming that the process is governed by the bulk inverse orbital Hall effect. Our findings resolve a central controversy in orbitronics and provide key insights into orbital transport and conversion mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Spin-dependent electronic transport in NiMnSb/MoS2(001)/NiMnSb magnetic tunnel junction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Half-metallic Heusler alloy compounds with Curie temperatures above room temperature are suitable candidate electrode materials for injecting large spin-polarised charge carriers into the semiconducting barriers at the ferromagnet semiconductor junction to obtain highly spin-polarised current. Combining the density functional theory and non-equilibrium Green's function method, the electronic structure, spin dependent electron transport in NiMnSb/MoS2(001)/NiMnSb is studied. The possibilities of injecting 100% spin-polarised electron into MoS2 using half metallic NiMnSb as an electrode, the layer dependent, and the effect of the type of interface on electronic structure and spin-transport properties in magnetic tunnel junction devices are studied. We show that the half-metallicity of NiMnSb(111) is preserved at the interface between the half-Heusler alloy NiMnSb and MoS2. NiMnSb keeps a fully spin-polarised state in the majority spin channel at the interface between NiMnSb and MoS2, injecting fully spin-polarised electrons into the semiconductor. The device based on NiMnSb/MoS2(single layer)/NiMnSb has a metallic interface. Metal-induced states in the spin-majority channel of MoS2 are seen after making an interface with half metallic NiMnSb. In contrast, the NiMnSb/MoS2(three layers)/NiMnSb interface with a multilayer of MoS2 has a band gap region, and electrons can tunnel through the junction. The Mn-S interface is more conducting than the Sb-S interface due to the strong bonding of Mn and S atoms at the Mn-S interface.</description>

      <title>Atomically-Thin Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Nanolasers: Challenges and Opportunities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low energy consumption nanolasers are crucial for advancing on-chip integrated optical interconnects and photonic integrated circuits. Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have emerged as an energy-efficient alternative to traditional semiconductor materials for nanolaser optical gain medium, promising ultralow lasing threshold powers. While several studies suggest that TMDs meet the criteria for lasing, whether true lasing has been achieved remains a topic of heavy debate within the scientific community. In this perspective, we offer an overview of the field, outlining the key characteristics of laser light and methods for testing these properties in TMD-based devices. We then conduct a thorough review of recent reports claiming lasing, assessing the findings against established criteria for laser light emission. Finally, we discuss future research directions and applications, highlighting the key challenges that must be addressed to realize practical TMD-based nanolasers.</description>

      <title>Full Crystallographic Imaging of Hexagonal Boron Nitride Monolayers with Phonon-Enhanced Sum-Frequency Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15939v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is an important 2D material for van der Waals heterostructures, single photon emitters, and infrared nanophotonics. The optical characterization of mono- and few-layer samples of hBN however remains a challenge as the material is almost invisible optically. Here we introduce phase-resolved sum-frequency microscopy as a technique for imaging monolayers of hBN grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and visualize their crystal orientation. A combination of femtosecond mid-infrared (IR) and visible laser pulses is used for sum-frequency generation (SFG), which is imaged in a wide-field optical microscope. The IR laser resonantly excites a phonon of hBN that leads to an ~800-fold enhancement of the SFG intensity, making it possible to image large 100x100 {\mu}m2 sample areas in less than 1 s. Implementing heterodyne detection in combination with azimuthal rotation of the sample further provides full crystallographic information. Through combined knowledge of topography and crystal orientation, we find that triangular domains of CVD-grown monolayer hBN have nitrogen-terminated zigzag edges. Overall, SFG microscopy can be used as an ultra-sensitive tool to image crystal structure, strain, stacking sequences, and twist angles, and is applicable to the wide range of van der Waals structures, where location and identification of monolayer regions and interfaces with broken inversion symmetry is of paramount importance.</description>

      <title>Thermal rectification and phonon properties in partially perforated graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, a thermal rectification ratio $\eta$ of 18.5% was observed in partially perforated graphene with the use of Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. In all cases studied here, heat preferentially flows from the porous to the pristine region and both $\kappa$ and $\eta$ increase upon increasing the length of the pristine region and upon decreasing the size of the pores. To interpret the results, the macroscopic "R-Series Model" is applied, attributing rectification to the different temperature dependence of $\kappa$ of perforated and pristine graphene. According to the model, $\eta$ is maximized when the two regions composing the structure have matching thermal resistances and mismatching temperature-dependence of $\kappa$. The model agrees qualitatively with the MD results, indicating that the latter is the principal rectification mechanism, but it can significantly underestimate $\eta$. Phonon analysis further reveals the appearance of new 'defect' modes localized around and between pores, resulting in the emergence of a new prominent peak in the phonon Density of States at 520 $cm^{-1}$. The study considers key geometric factors such as the length of the pristine region, and the pore size, shape, alignment, and orientation. Pore shape and alignment exert minimal influence on $\eta$, although alignment greatly influences $\kappa$. Eventually, arranged pores are deemed more efficient than randomly distributed defects for increasing rectification.</description>

      <title>Second harmonic generation due to spatial structure of radiation beam</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that spatially structured radiation generates second harmonic in a two-dimensional system even if the system is homogeneous and isotropic. The effect originates from non-locality of electric response to structured electromagnetic field. We develop an analytical theory of such a second harmonic generation in conducting two-dimensional systems. For the general type of structured radiation, we calculate the emerging electric currents at the double frequency and the emitted second harmonic radiation. The theory applied to twisted light reveals that the angular momentum of light doubles in the second harmonic emission. Our results pave the way for second harmonic generation and structuring in two-dimensional materials beyond the constraints imposed by crystal symmetry.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear planar magnetotransport as a probe of the topology of surface states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been recently established that transport measurements in the nonlinear regime can give direct access to the quantum metric (QM): the real part of the quantum geometric tensor characterizing the geometry of the electronic wavefunctions in a solid. In topological materials, the QM has been so far revealed in thin films of the topological antiferromagnet MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ where it provides a direct contribution to longitudinal currents quadratic in the driving electric field. Here we show that the Dirac surface states of strong three-dimensional topological insulators have a QM that can be accessed from the nonlinear transport characteristics in the presence of an externally applied planar magnetic field. A previously unknown intrinsic part of the longitudinal magnetoconductivity carries the signature of the QM while coexisting with the extrinsic part responsible for the so-called bilinear magnetoelectric resistance. We prove that the QM-induced nonlinear magnetotransport carries specific signatures of single Dirac cones. This allows to use it as an efficient diagnostic tool of the bulk topology of three-dimensional non-magnetic insulators.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Spin Nernst Effect and Chiral Edge Modes in van der Waals Ferromagnetic Insulators: Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya vs. Kitaev Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The thermomagnetic Nernst effect and chiral edge states are key signatures of nontrivial topology and emerging Berry curvature in magnonic systems. Implementing atomistic spin simulations, we theoretically demonstrate the emergence of chiral magnon edge states at the boundaries of a ferromagnetic hexagonal lattice in the presence of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya and Kitaev interactions, which are robust against nonlinear magnon interactions. In our simulations, we consider the spin parameters of CrI$_3$ as a prototype of van der Waals magnetic layers. We show that the spin accumulation is reduced in the presence of Kitaev spin interactions compared to systems governed by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. This reduction stems from the breaking of the $U(1)$ symmetry, which leads to a shorter spin coherence length imposed by the Kitaev interaction. We propose that measuring the angular dependence of the Nernst signal in a magnetic field provides an effective indirect method for identifying the microscopic origin of topological magnons. Our findings hold promising potential for advancing next-generation energy-harvesting Nernst materials and facilitating the integration of topological magnetic materials with spintronic-based quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Purely electrical detection of the N\'{e}el vector of $p$-wave magnets based on linear and nonlinear conductivities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A $p$-wave magnet has a momentum-dependent band structure and zero-net magnetization just as in the case of an altermagnet. It will be useful for high-density and ultra-fast memory. However, it is a nontrivial problem to detect the N\'{e}el vector of a $p$-wave magnet because time-reversal symmetry is preserved, while this is not a problem in an altermagnet because the anomalous Hall conductivity is present due to the breaking of time-reversal symmetry. Here, we show that it is possible to detect the in-plane component of the N\'{e}el vector of the $p$-wave magnet by measuring the transverse and longitudinal Drude conductivity. Remarkably, this measurement is possible without using magnetization. Furthermore, it is possible to detect the $z$-component by measuring nonlinear conductivity including the nonlinear Drude conductivity and quantum-metric induced nonlinear conductivity by introducing tiny magnetization along the $z$ axis. We obtain analytic formulae for them in the first-order perturbation theory, which agree quite well with numerical results without perturbation. Our results will pave a way to spintronic memory based on $p$-wave magnets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study theoretically the neutral and charged excitons in two-dimensional semiconductors with anisotropic dispersion of charge carriers. Such a situation is realized in CrSBr-based van der Waals heterostructures. We calculate the binding energies of excitons and trions and explore their dependence on the mass ratio, dielectric screening, and interlayer distance in bilayer structures. We also address the effects of exciton-light coupling, including the radiative decay and long-range electron-hole exchange interaction, and briefly analyze correlations between the excitons and the Fermi sea of resident electrons. The estimates for CrSBr bilayers are in reasonable agreement with recent experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a hybrid thermal machine based on a single closed quantum Hall edge channel forming a quantum dot. It is tunneling coupled with two quantum Hall states at $\nu = 2$ in contact with reservoirs at different temperatures and chemical potentials. One of these edge states is also driven out-of-equilibrium by means of a periodic train of Lorentzian voltage pulses. This device allows to explore various possible working regimes including the engine, the heat pump and the refrigerator configuration. Regions where two regimes coexist can also be identified. Moreover, the proposed set-up exhibits robustness and in some parameter regions also slightly enhanced performance in the presence of electron-electron interactions.</description>

Abstract: Amorphous graphene or amorphous monolayer carbon (AMC) is a family of carbon films that exhibit a surprising sensitivity of electronic conductance to morphology. We combine deep learning-enhanced simulation techniques with percolation theory to analyze three morphologically distinct mesoscale AMCs. Our approach avoids the pitfalls of applying periodic boundary conditions to these fundamentally aperiodic systems or equating crystalline inclusions with conducting sites. We reproduce the previously reported dependence of charge conductance on morphology and explore the limitations of partial morphology descriptors in witnessing conductance properties. Finally, we perform crystallinity analysis of conductance networks along the electronic energy spectrum and show that they metamorphose from being localized on crystallites at band edges to localized on defects around the Fermi energy opening the possibility of control through gate voltage.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic spin-split states with canted persistent spin textures in two-dimensional Janus $1T^{'}$ $MXX'$ ($M$ = Mo, W; $X\neq X'$= S, Se, Te) controlled by surface alloying</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional tungsten-based transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), $MX_{2}$ ($M$: W, Mo; $X$: S, Se, Te) monolayers (MLs) with a $1T'$ structure, serve as significant-gap quantum spin Hall insulators. However, due to the centrosymmetric nature of these crystals, spin degeneracy persists throughout their electronic band structures, limiting their potential for spintronic applications. By modifying the chalcogen ($X$) atoms in the TMDCs ML surface to create a higly stable Janus $MXX'$ MLs structure, we demonstrate through density-functional theory calculations that substantial spin splitting of the electronic states can be achieved. Taking the Janus $1T'$ WSTe ML as a representative case, we identify pronounced anisotropic spin-splitting bands, with maximum spin splittings of 0.14 eV and 0.10 eV occurring at the highest occupied states and lowest unoccupied states, respectively. These significant band splittings give rise to canted persistent spin textures (PST) in the spin polarization, which differ significantly from those in commonly studied PST materials. We demonstrate that this intricate spin splitting and unique spin textures stem from strong in-plane $p-d$ orbital interactions between tungsten (W) and the chalcogen atoms (Te and Se), driven by the reduced symmetry of the crystal's point group. Further analysis using a $\vec{k}\cdot\vec{p}$ model derived from symmetry considerations corroborates the origins of the observed anisotropic spin splitting and canted PST. the spin-split states are highly sensitive to surface imperfections caused by surface alloying effects, such as variations in the chalcogen composition on the monolayer surface. These findings underscore the potential of Janus $1T'$ $MXX'$ MLs as promising candidates for next-generation spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Floquet-Bloch Valleytronics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Driving quantum materials out-of-equilibrium makes it possible to generate states of matter inaccessible through standard equilibrium tuning methods. Upon time-periodic coherent driving of electrons using electromagnetic fields, the emergence of Floquet-Bloch states enables the creation and control of exotic quantum phases. In transition metal dichalcogenides, broken inversion symmetry within each monolayer results in a non-zero Berry curvature at the K and K$^{\prime}$ valley extrema, giving rise to chiroptical selection rules that are fundamental to valleytronics. Here, we bridge the gap between these two concepts and introduce Floquet-Bloch valleytronics. Using time- and polarization-resolved extreme ultraviolet momentum microscopy combined with state-of-the-art ab initio theory, we demonstrate the formation of valley-polarized Floquet-Bloch states in 2H-WSe$_2$ upon below-bandgap coherent electron driving with chiral light pulses. We investigate quantum path interference between Floquet-Bloch and Volkov states, showing that this interferometric process depends on the valley pseudospin and light polarization-state. Conducting extreme ultraviolet photoemission circular dichroism in these nonequilibrium settings reveals the potential for controlling the orbital character of Floquet-engineered states. These findings link Floquet engineering and quantum geometric light-matter coupling in two-dimensional materials. They can serve as a guideline for reaching novel out-of-equilibrium phases of matter by dynamically breaking symmetries through coherent dressing of winding Bloch electrons with tailored light pulses.</description>

Abstract: We investigate automated in situ optimization of the potential landscape in a quantum point contact device, using a $3 \times 3$ gate array patterned atop the constriction. Optimization is performed using the covariance matrix adaptation evolutionary strategy, for which we introduce a metric for how "step-like" the conductance is as the channel becomes constricted. We first perform the optimization of the gate voltages in a tight-binding simulation and show how such in situ tuning can be used to mitigate a random disorder potential. The optimization is then performed in a physical device in experiment, where we also observe a marked improvement in the quantization of the conductance resulting from the optimization procedure.</description>

      <title>The fate of $p$-wave spin polarization in helimagnets with Rashba spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has recently been realized that magnetic systems with coplanar magnetic order that are invariant under the combined operation of time-reversal and translation with half a unit cell feature energy bands with a symmetry-protected p-wave spin polarization. Such $p$-wave magnets are a sought-after spin analogy of unconventional triplet superconducting pairing and show promise for use in spintronics. Metallic helimagnets provide a realization of $p$-wave magnetism, but such order often occurs in systems lacking inversion symmetry so that Rashba spin-orbit interactions can be prominent. An important question is therefore how the magnitude and the existence of $p$-wave spin polarization is affected by Rashba spin-orbit interaction. Here, we prove that while the $p$-wave symmetry of the spin-polarized bands is strictly speaking removed by such spin-orbit interactions in helimagnets unless the period of the helix is fine-tuned, the actual quantitative deviation from $p$-wave symmetry is extremely weak unless the period of the helix is only a few lattice sites. Thereafter, we show that the $p$-wave magnetism becomes completely robust in pairs of antiferromagnetically coupled helices. More precisely, the $p$-wave spin-polarization of the bands then appears regardless of the periodicity and regardless of the strength of the spin-orbit interactions. This shows that antiferromagnetically coupled helimagnetic chains produce robust $p$-wave spin polarization free of fine-tuning requirements, making them attractive for potential spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Electric transport in doped Mott insulators dictated by a non-Ioffe-Larkin composition rule and spinons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15553v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The electric resistivity is examined in the constrained Hilbert space of a doped Mott insulator, which is dictated by a non-Ioffe-Larkin composition rule due to the underlying mutual Chern-Simons topological gauge structure. In the low-temperature pseudogap phase, where holons remain condensed while spinons proliferate, the charge transport is governed by a chiral spinon excitation, comprising a bosonic spin-$1/2$ at the core of a supercurrent vortex. It leads to a vanishing resistivity with the ``confinement'' of the spinons in the superconducting phase but a low-$T$ divergence of the resistivity once the spinon confinement is disrupted by external magnetic fields. In the latter, the chiral spinons will generate a Hall number $n_H =$ doping concentration $ \delta$ and a Nernst effect to signal an underlying long-range entanglement between the charge and spin degrees of freedom. Their presence is further reflected in thermodynamic quantities such as specific heat and spin susceptibility. Finally, in the high-temperature spin-disordered phase, it is shown that the holons exhibit a linear-$T$ resistivity by scattering with the spinons acting as free local moments, which generate randomized gauge fluxes as perceived by the charge degree of freedom.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00189v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many-body phenomena in quantum materials emerge from the interplay among a broad continuum of electronic states, and controlling these interactions is critical for engineering novel phases. One promising approach exploits fluctuations of the vacuum electromagnetic field confined within optical cavities to tailor electronic properties. Here, we demonstrate that cavity photons can mediate attractive interactions in a tunable van der Waals material and reorganize a continuum of electron-hole transitions into an exciton-like state. We introduce a broadband, sub-wavelength time-domain microscope that integrates exfoliated, dual-gated two-dimensional quantum materials into a terahertz cavity. This approach enables the first-ever measurement of the field-tunable bandgap of bilayer graphene at terahertz frequencies while revealing ultrastrong coupling with a vacuum Rabi frequency exceeding $\Omega_{Rabi}/\omega\approx 40\%$ of the bare photon energy. Crucially, we identify a novel cavity-induced resonance emerging from the interband continuum that resembles Coulomb-bound excitons and remains stable across a broad temperature range. By uniting longstanding theoretical predictions with advanced experimental techniques, our findings open new avenues for designing and probing unique light-matter states and realizing hybrid correlated phases in quantum materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16987v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of ferroelectrics with semiconductors is crucial for developing functional devices, such as field-effect transistors, tunnel junctions, and nonvolatile memories. However, the synthesis of high-quality single-crystalline ferroelectric nitride perovskites has been limited, hindering a comprehensive understanding of their switching dynamics and potential applications. Here we report the synthesis and characterizations of epitaxial single-phase ferroelectric cerium tantalum nitride (CeTaN3) on both oxides and semiconductors. The polar symmetry of CeTaN3 was confirmed by observing the atomic displacement of central ions relative to the center of the TaN6 octahedra, as well as through optical second harmonic generation. We observed switchable ferroelectric domains in CeTaN3 films using piezo-response force microscopy, complemented by the characterization of square-like polarization-electric field hysteresis loops. The remanent polarization of CeTaN3 reaches approximately 20 uC/cm2 at room temperature, consistent with theoretical calculations. This work establishes a vital link between ferroelectric nitride perovskites and their practical applications, paving the way for next-generation information and energy-storage devices with enhanced performance, scalability, and manufacturability.</description>

Abstract: The advent of 6G communication demands seamlessly integrated terminals operating above 100 GHz with low power consumption for human-centric applications. In this work, we report high-performance, flexible radio-frequency (RF) metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) based on aligned carbon nanotube (CNT) arrays, achieving, for the first time, as-measured current gain cutoff frequency (fT) and power gain cutoff frequency (fmax) both exceeding 100 GHz. Electro-thermal co-design improves both heat dissipation and RF performance, despite the low thermal conductivity of the flexible substrate. The transistors deliver 0.947 mA/$\mathrm{mu}$m on-state current and 0.728 mS/$\mathrm{mu}$m transconductance. Peak extrinsic $f_{\mathrm{T}}$ and $f_{\mathrm{max}}$ reach 152 GHz and 102 GHz with power consumption &lt; 200 mW/mm, setting new performance records for flexible CNT-based RF transistors by nearly 100$\times$, outperforming all other flexible RF MOSFETs. Additionally, flexible RF amplifiers achieve 64 mW/mm output power and 11 dB power gain in the K-band, marking a significant milestone in flexible RF technologies for next-generation wireless communication systems.</description>

      <title>Simulating lattice fermion doubling with a Floquet drive</title>

Abstract: We consider a recently discovered mathematical correspondence between the spectra of a naively discretized lattice fermion and that of a periodically driven (i.e., Floquet) quantum system and turn it into an infrared equivalence between the two systems. The equivalence can be framed as a duality relation, allowing us to simulate a two-flavor discrete-time fermion theory on the lattice side, where the two flavors arise from time discretization, using a single-flavor fermion theory on the Floquet side. Our demonstration establishes an equivalence between (i) the fermion content, (ii) the correlation functions, and consequently (iii) observables of the two theories in the infrared. We also show how interactions may be incorporated into this equivalence.</description>
