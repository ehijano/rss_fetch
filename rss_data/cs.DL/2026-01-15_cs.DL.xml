      <title>A Deep Dive into OpenStreetMap Research Since its Inception (2008-2024): Contributors, Topics, and Future Trends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: OpenStreetMap (OSM) has transitioned from a pioneering volunteered geographic information (VGI) project into a global, multi-disciplinary research nexus. This study presents a bibliometric and systematic analysis of the OSM research landscape, examining its development trajectory and key driving forces. By evaluating 1,926 publications from the Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection and 782 State of the Map (SotM) presentations up to June 2024, we quantify publication growth, collaboration patterns, and thematic evolution. Results demonstrate simultaneous consolidation and diversification within the field. While a stable core of contributors continues to anchor OSM research, themes have shifted from initial concerns over data production and quality toward advanced analytical and applied uses. Comparative analysis of OSM-related research in WoS and SotM reveals distinct but complementary agendas between scholars and the OSM community. Building on these findings, we identify six emerging research directions and discuss how evolving partnerships among academia, the OSM community, and industry are poised to shape the future of OSM research. This study establishes a structured reference for understanding the state of OSM studies and offers strategic pathways for navigating its future trajectory.The data and code are available at https://github.com/ya0-sun/OSMbib.</description>

      <title>Triples and Knowledge-Infused Embeddings for Clustering and Classification of Scientific Documents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing volume and complexity of scientific literature demand robust methods for organizing and understanding research documents. In this study, we explore how structured knowledge, specifically, subject-predicate-object triples, can enhance the clustering and classification of scientific papers. We propose a modular pipeline that combines unsupervised clustering and supervised classification over multiple document representations: raw abstracts, extracted triples, and hybrid formats that integrate both. Using a filtered arXiv corpus, we extract relational triples from abstracts and construct four text representations, which we embed using four state-of-the-art transformer models: MiniLM, MPNet, SciBERT, and SPECTER. We evaluate the resulting embeddings with KMeans, GMM, and HDBSCAN for unsupervised clustering, and fine-tune classification models for arXiv subject prediction. Our results show that full abstract text yields the most coherent clusters, but that hybrid representations incorporating triples consistently improve classification performance, reaching up to 92.6% accuracy and 0.925 macro-F1. We also find that lightweight sentence encoders (MiniLM, MPNet) outperform domain-specific models (SciBERT, SPECTER) in clustering, while SciBERT excels in structured-input classification. These findings highlight the complementary benefits of combining unstructured text with structured knowledge, offering new insights into knowledge-infused representations for semantic organization of scientific documents.</description>

      <title>Towards a Metadata Schema for Energy Research Software</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Domain-specific metadata schemas are essential to improve the findability and reusability of research software and to follow the FAIR4RS principles. However, many domains, including energy research, lack established metadata schemas. To address this gap, we developed a metadata schema for energy research software based on a requirement analysis and evaluated it through user testing. Our results show that the schema balances the need for formalization and interoperability, while also meeting the specific needs of energy researchers. Meanwhile, the testing showed that a good presentation of the required information is key to enable researchers to create the required metadata. This paper provides insights into the challenges and opportunities of designing a metadata schema for energy research software.</description>

      <title>Cloud-based digitization workflow with rich metadata acquisition for cultural heritage objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In response to several cultural heritage initiatives at the Jagiellonian University, we developed a new digitization workflow in collaboration with the Jagiellonian Library (JL). The solution is based on easy-to-access technological solutions -- Microsoft 365 cloud with MS Excel files as metadata acquisition interfaces, Office Script for validation, and MS Sharepoint for storage -- that allows metadata acquisition by domain experts regardless of their experience with information systems. The ultimate goal is to create a knowledge graph that describes the analyzed collections, linked to general knowledge bases, as well as to other cultural heritage collections, so careful attention is paid to the high accuracy of metadata and proper links to external sources. The workflow was evaluated in two pilot studies and in two workshops, which allowed for its refinement and confirmation of its correctness and usability for JL. The knowledge graph created as a result of these pilot studies was made available in a public git repository. As the proposed workflow does not interfere with existing systems or domain guidelines regarding digitization and basic metadata collection in a given institution, but extends them in order to enable rich metadata collection, not previously possible, we believe that it could be of interest to all GLAMs.</description>
