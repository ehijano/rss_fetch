      <title>Hot QCD matter around the chiral crossover: a lattice study with $O(a)$-improved Wilson fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using lattice QCD simulations with $O(a)$-improved Wilson quarks and physical up, down and strange quark masses, we investigate the properties of thermal QCD matter at the temperatures $T=\{128,154,192\}\mathrm{MeV}$ with a fixed lattice spacing $a=0.064\mathrm{fm}$ and volume $V=(6.1\text{fm})^3$. We find that the pion quasiparticle, defined as the low-energy pole in the two-point function of the axial charge, becomes lighter as the temperature increases and give an argument based on hydrodynamics as to why the pole becomes purely diffusive above the chiral crossover. We study the thermal modification of the isovector vector spectral function using the Backus-Gilbert method, finding an enhancement at low energies and a depletion at energies around $1\mathrm{GeV}$.The analogous study of the axial-vector channel reveals a larger enhancement at energies below $1\mathrm{GeV}$, and we show that these findings are consistent with rigorous spectral sum rules. The difference between vector and axial-vector correlators, an order parameter for chiral symmetry, turns out to be overall suppressed by more than an order of magnitude at the crossover.</description>

      <title>Scattering Amplitudes from Euclidean Correlators: Haag-Ruelle theory and approximation formulae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we provide a non-perturbative solution to the theoretical problem of extracting scattering amplitudes from Euclidean correlators in infinite volume. We work within the solid axiomatic framework of the Haag-Ruelle scattering theory and derive formulae which can be used to approximate scattering amplitudes arbitrarily well in terms of linear combinations of Euclidean correlators at discrete time separations. Our result generalizes and extends the range of applicability of a result previously obtained by Barata and Fredenhagen [Commun. Math. Phys. 138 (1991) 507-520]. We provide a concrete procedure to construct such approximations, making our formulae ready to be used in numerical calculations of non-perturbative QCD scattering amplitudes. A detailed numerical investigation is needed to assess whether the proposed strategy can lead to the calculation of scattering amplitudes with phenomenologically satisfactory precision with presently available lattice QCD data. This will be the subject of future work. Nevertheless, the numerical accuracy and precision of lattice simulations is systematically improvable, and we have little doubts that our approach will become useful in the future.</description>

      <title>Self-learning Monte Carlo with equivariant Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11527v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning and deep learning have revolutionized computational physics, particularly the simulation of complex systems. Equivariance is essential for simulating physical systems because it imposes a strong inductive bias on the probability distribution described by a machine learning model. However, imposing symmetry on the model can sometimes lead to poor acceptance rates in self-learning Monte Carlo (SLMC). Here, we introduce a symmetry equivariant attention mechanism for SLMC, which can be systematically improved. We evaluate our architecture on a spin-fermion model (\textit{i.e.}, double exchange model) on a two-dimensional lattice. Our results show that the proposed method overcomes the poor acceptance rates of linear models and exhibits a similar scaling law to large language models, with model quality monotonically increasing with the number of layers. Our work paves the way for the development of more accurate and efficient Monte Carlo algorithms with machine learning for simulating complex physical systems.</description>

      <title>Identification of a natural fieldlike entanglement resource in trapped-ion chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08842v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The electromagnetic trapping of ion chains can be regarded as a process of non-trivial entangled quantum state preparation within Hilbert spaces of the local axial motional modes. To begin uncovering properties of this entanglement resource produced as a byproduct of conventional ion-trap quantum information processing, the quantum continuous-variable formalism is herein utilized to focus on the leading-order entangled ground state of local motional modes in the presence of a quadratic trapping potential. The decay of entanglement between disjoint subsets of local modes is found to exhibit features of entanglement structure and responses to partial measurement reminiscent of the free massless scalar field vacuum. With significant fidelities between the two, even for large system sizes, a framework is established for initializing quantum field simulations via "imaging" extended entangled states from natural sources, rather than building correlations through deep circuits of few-body entangling operators. By calculating probabilities in discrete Fock subspaces of the local motional modes, considerations are presented for locally transferring these pre-distributed entanglement resources to the qudits of ion internal energy levels, improving this procedure's anticipated experimental viability.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference with Gaussian Processes for the Determination of Parton Distribution Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07573v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss a Bayesian methodology for the solution of the inverse problem underlying the determination of parton distribution functions (PDFs). In our approach, Gaussian Processes (GPs) are used to model the PDF prior, while Bayes theorem is used in order to determine the posterior distribution of the PDFs given a set of data. We discuss the general formalism, the Bayesian inference at the level of both parameters and hyperparameters, and the simplifications which occur when the observable entering the analysis is linear in the PDF. We benchmark the new methodology in two simple examples for the determination of a single PDF flavor from a set of Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) data and from a set of equal-time correlators computed using lattice QCD. We discuss our results, showing how the proposed methodology allows for a well-defined statistical interpretation of the different sources of errors entering the PDF uncertainty, and how results can be validated a posteriori.</description>

      <title>Dilaton Forbidden Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07601v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dilaton effective field theory (dEFT) describes the long distance behavior of certain confining, near-conformal gauge theories that have been studied via lattice computation. Pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons (pNGBs), emerging from the breaking of approximate, continuous, internal symmetries, are coupled to an additional scalar particle, the dilaton, arising from the spontaneous breaking of approximate scale invariance. This effective theory has been employed to study possible extensions of the standard model. In this paper, we propose a complementary role for dEFT, as a description of the dark matter of the universe, with the pNGBs identified as the dark-matter particles. We show that this theory provides a natural implementation of the "forbidden" dark matter mechanism, and we identify regions of parameter space for which the thermal history of dEFT yields the measured dark matter relic density.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories by dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulations of lattice gauge theories on noisy quantum hardware inherently suffer from violations of the gauge symmetry due to coherent and incoherent errors of the underlying physical system that implements the simulation. These gauge violations cause the simulations to become unphysical requiring the result of the simulation to be discarded. We investigate an active correction scheme that relies on detecting gauge violations locally and subsequently correcting them by dissipatively driving the system back into the physical gauge sector. We show that the correction scheme not only ensures the protection of the gauge symmetry, but it also leads to a longer validity of the simulation results even within the gauge-invariant sector. Finally, we discuss further applications of the scheme such as preparation of the many-body ground state of the simulated system.</description>
