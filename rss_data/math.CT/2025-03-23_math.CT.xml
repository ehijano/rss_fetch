      <title>Composable Uncertainty in Symmetric Monoidal Categories for Design Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Applied category theory often studies symmetric monoidal categories (SMCs) whose morphisms represent open systems. These structures naturally accommodate complex wiring patterns, leveraging (co)monoidal structures for splitting and merging wires, or compact closed structures for feedback. A key example is the compact closed SMC of design problems (DP), which enables a compositional approach to co-design in engineering. However, in practice, the systems of interest may not be fully known. Recently, Markov categories have emerged as a powerful framework for modeling uncertain processes. In this work, we demonstrate how to integrate this perspective into the study of open systems while preserving consistency with the underlying SMC structure. To this end, we employ the change-of-base construction for enriched categories, replacing the morphisms of a symmetric monoidal $\mathcal{V}$-category $\mathcal{C}$ with parametric maps $A \to \mathcal{C}(X,Y)$ in a Markov category induced by a symmetric monoidal monad. This results in a symmetric monoidal 2-category $N_*\mathcal{C}$ with the same objects as $\mathcal{C}$ and reparametrization 2-cells. By choosing different monads, we capture various types of uncertainty. The category underlying $\mathcal{C}$ embeds into $N_*\mathcal{C}$ via a strict symmetric monoidal functor, allowing (co)monoidal and compact closed structures to be transferred. Applied to DP, this construction leads to categories of practical relevance, such as parametrized design problems for optimization, and parametrized distributions of design problems for decision theory and Bayesian learning.</description>

      <title>The algebraic internal groupoid model of Martin-L\"{o}f type theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the model structure on the category $\mathbf{Cat}(\mathcal{E})$ of internal categories studied by Everaert, Kieboom and Van der Linden to an algebraic model structure. Moreover, we show that it restricts to the category of internal groupoids. We show that in this case, the algebraic weak factorisation system that consists of the algebraic trivial cofibrations and algebraic fibrations forms a model of Martin-L\"{o}f type theory. Taking $\mathcal{E} = \mathbf{Set}$ and forgetting the algebraic structure, this recovers Hofmann and Streicher's groupoid model of Martin-L\"{o}f type theory. Finally, we are able to provide axioms on a $(2,1)$-category which ensure that it gives an algebraic model of Martin-L\"{o}f type theory.</description>

      <title>Action accessible and weakly action representable varieties of algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main goal of this article is to investigate the relationship between action accessibility and weak action representability in the context of varieties of non-associative algebras over a field. Specifically, using an argument of J. R. A. Gray in the setting of groups, we prove that the varieties of $k$-nilpotent Lie algebras ($k \geq 3$) and the varieties of $n$-solvable Lie algebras ($n \geq 2$) do not form weakly action representable categories. These are the first known examples of action accessible varieties of non-associative algebras that fail to be weakly action representable, establishing that a subvariety of a (weakly) action representable variety of non-associative algebras needs not be weakly action representable. Eventually, we refine J. R. A. Gray's result by proving that the varieties of $k$-nilpotent groups ($k \geq 3$) and that of $2$-solvable groups are not weakly action representable.</description>

      <title>A Natural Transformation between the Model Constructions of the Completeness and Compactness Theorems, Enhanced by Rigidity and 2-Categorical Strengthening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present a mathematically rigorous and constructive framework that unifies two canonical model constructions in classical first order logic. In particular, we define two functors F and G from the category of consistent first order theories to the category of models. The functor F is constructed via the Henkin method, which extends any given theory to a maximal consistent theory by means of a fixed enumeration and the systematic introduction of Henkin constants, and then constructs a term model by taking the quotient of the term algebra with respect to provable equality. The functor G is obtained through a canonical compactness based construction, using either a fixed ultraproduct or a saturation procedure, ensuring that the resulting model is unique up to isomorphism.
  We prove the existence of a natural transformation eta from F to G such that each component is an isomorphism. Moreover, by leveraging the uniqueness of saturated (or prime) models in countable languages, we show that eta is rigid, meaning any other natural transformation between F and G must equal eta. Furthermore, we establish a strong natural equivalence between F and G in the two categorical sense, with eta and its inverse satisfying the required coherence conditions.
  This unification not only deepens our understanding of the interplay between proof theory and model theory, but also opens new avenues for applications in automated theorem proving, formal verification, and the study of alternative logical systems.</description>

      <title>A Categorical Integration of Logical Connectives via Higher Category Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a systematic framework for integrating local categories that model logical connectives using higher category theory. By extending these local categories into a unified two-category enriched with natural isomorphisms, the universal properties of logical operations such as negation, conjunction, disjunction, and implication are rigorously captured. Advanced techniques including pseudo-limits, pseudo-colimits, and strictification are employed to transform the resulting weak structure into a strict two-category, thereby simplifying composition rules and coherence verification without loss of semantic content. The framework is validated through detailed diagrammatic proofs and concrete examples, demonstrating its robustness and potential impact in areas such as type theory, programming language semantics, and formal verification.</description>

      <title>Distributive Laws of Monadic Containers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Containers are used to carve out a class of strictly positive data types in terms of shapes and positions. They can be interpreted via a fully-faithful functor into endofunctors on Set. Monadic containers are those containers whose interpretation as a Set functor carries a monad structure. The category of containers is closed under container composition and is a monoidal category, whereas monadic containers do not in general compose.
  In this paper, we develop a characterisation of distributive laws of monadic containers. Distributive laws were introduced as a sufficient condition for the composition of the underlying functors of two monads to also carry a monad structure. Our development parallels Ahman and Uustalu's characterisation of distributive laws of directed containers, i.e. containers whose Set functor interpretation carries a comonad structure. Furthermore, by combining our work with theirs, we construct characterisations of mixed distributive laws (i.e. of directed containers over monadic containers and vice versa), thereby completing the 'zoo' of container characterisations of (co)monads and their distributive laws.
  We have found these characterisations amenable to development of existence and uniqueness proofs of distributive laws, particularly in the mechanised setting of Cubical Agda, in which most of the theory of this paper has been formalised.</description>

      <title>Categories meet semigroups in various ways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper touches on several interaction points of semigroups and constructions from category theory: An adjunction is established between categories with selected arrows and semigroups. Regular semigroups are characterized by split epi - split mono factorization of the Karoubi envelope. We investigate how semigroupads (monads without requirement of unit transformation) map semigroups to semigroups and ensure certain properties provided they hold on meta level.</description>

      <title>Purity in compactly generated derivators and t-structures with Grothendieck hearts</title>

      <description>arXiv:1804.01326v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study t-structures with Grothendieck hearts on compactly generated triangulated categories $\mathcal{T}$ that are underlying categories of strong and stable derivators. This setting includes all algebraic compactly generated triangulated categories. We give an intrinsic characterisation of pure triangles and the definable subcategories of $\mathcal{T}$ in terms of directed homotopy colimits. For a left nondegenerate t-structure ${\bf t}=(\mathcal{U},\mathcal{V})$ on $\mathcal{T}$, we show that $\mathcal{V}$ is definable if and only if ${\bf t}$ is smashing and has a Grothendieck heart. Moreover, these conditions are equivalent to ${\bf t}$ being homotopically smashing and to ${\bf t}$ being cogenerated by a pure-injective partial cosilting object. Finally, we show that finiteness conditions on the heart of ${\bf t}$ are determined by purity conditions on the associated partial cosilting object.</description>

      <title>Yetter-Drinfeld post-Hopf algebras and Yetter-Drinfeld relative Rota-Baxter operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Li, Sheng and Tang introduced post-Hopf algebras and relative Rota-Baxter operators (on cocommutative Hopf algebras), providing an adjunction between the respective categories under the assumption that the structures involved are cocommutative. We introduce Yetter-Drinfeld post-Hopf algebras, which become usual post-Hopf algebras in the cocommutative setting. In analogy with the correspondence between cocommutative post-Hopf algebras and cocommutative Hopf braces, the category of Yetter-Drinfeld post-Hopf algebras is isomorphic to the category of Yetter-Drinfeld braces introduced by the author in a joint work with D. Ferri. This allows to explore the connection with matched pairs of actions and provide examples of Yetter-Drinfeld post-Hopf algebras. Moreover, we prove that the category of Yetter-Drinfeld post-Hopf algebras is equivalent to a subcategory of Yetter-Drinfeld relative Rota-Baxter operators. The latter structures coincide with the inverse maps of Yetter-Drinfeld 1-cocycles introduced by the author and D. Ferri, and generalise bijective relative Rota-Baxter operators on cocommutative Hopf algebras. Hence the previous equivalence passes to cocommutative post-Hopf algebras and bijective relative Rota-Baxter operators. Once the surjectivity of the Yetter-Drinfeld relative Rota-Baxter operators is removed, the equivalence is replaced by an adjunction and one can recover the result of Li, Sheng and Tang in the cocommutative case.</description>
