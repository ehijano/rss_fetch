      <title>Stylized facts in Web3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive statistical analysis of the Web3 ecosystem, comparing various Web3 tokens with traditional financial assets across multiple time scales. We examine probability distributions, tail behaviors, and other key stylized facts of the returns for a diverse range of tokens, including decentralized exchanges, liquidity pools, and centralized exchanges. Despite functional differences, most tokens exhibit well-established empirical facts, including unconditional probability density of returns with heavy tails gradually becoming Gaussian and volatility clustering. Furthermore, we compare assets traded on centralized (CEX) and decentralized (DEX) exchanges, finding that DEXs exhibit similar stylized facts despite different trading mechanisms and often divergent long-term performance. We propose that this similarity is attributable to arbitrageurs striving to maintain similar centralized and decentralized prices. Our study contributes to a better understanding of the dynamics of Web3 tokens and the relationship between CEX and DEX markets, with important implications for risk management, pricing models, and portfolio construction in the rapidly evolving DeFi landscape. These results add to the growing body of literature on cryptocurrency markets and provide insights that can guide the development of more accurate models for DeFi markets.</description>

      <title>Peer-induced Fairness: A Causal Approach to Reveal Algorithmic Unfairness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework, "peer-induced fairness", to scientifically audit algorithmic fairness. It addresses a critical but often overlooked issue: distinguishing between adverse outcomes due to algorithmic discrimination and those resulting from individuals' insufficient capabilities. By utilizing counterfactual fairness and advanced causal inference techniques, such as the Single World Intervention Graph, this model-agnostic approach evaluates fairness at the individual level through peer comparisons and hypothesis testing. It also tackles challenges like data scarcity and imbalance, offering a flexible, plug-and-play self-audit tool for stakeholders and an external audit tool for regulators, while providing explainable feedback for those affected by unfavorable decisions.</description>
