      <title>An automated occultation network for gravitational mapping of the trans-neptunian solar system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the potential of an array of O(100) small fixed telescopes, aligned along a meridian and automated to measure millions of occultations of Gaia stars by minor planets, to constrain gravitational signatures from a "Planet X" mass in the outer solar system. The accuracy of center-of-mass tracking for the occulters is limited by photon noise, uncertainties in asteroid shapes, and Gaia's astrometry of the occulted stars. Using both parametric calculations and survey simulations, we assess the total information obtainable from occultation measurements of main-belt asteroids (MBAs), Jovian Trojans and trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs). We find that MBAs are the optimal target population due to their higher occultation rates and abundance of objects above LSST detection thresholds. A 10-year survey of occultations by MBAs and Trojans using an array of 200 40 cm telescopes at 5 km separation would achieve $5\sigma$ sensitivity to the gravitational tidal field of a $5M_\oplus$ Planet X at 800 AU for $&gt;90\%$ of potential sky locations. This configuration corresponds to an initial cost of $\approx $15 million. While the occultation survey's sensitivity to tidal forces improves rapidly with increasing number of telescopes, sensitivity to a Planet X becomes limited by degeneracy with the uncertain masses of large moonless TNOs. The 200-telescope survey would additionally detect $\approx $1800 TNO occultations, providing detailed shape, size, and albedo information. The survey would also measure the Yarkovski effect on many individual MBAs, measure the masses of many asteroids involved in mutual gravitational deflections, and enable better searches for primordial black holes and departures from General Relativity.</description>

      <title>Giant branch systems: surveys and populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the recent discoveries of planets orbiting stars at all evolutionary stages, the evolution of planetary systems remains poorly understood. Studying planetary systems around red giant branch stars can reveal how main sequence planetary systems can change and evolve into white dwarf systems over time. Decades of radial velocity and transit surveys have yielded the detection of hundreds of planets and planet candidates orbiting evolved stars. These planetary systems have provided important insights into understanding how planetary atmospheres and orbits can be disrupted by stellar evolution, potentially being restructured at late stages, and how planets can be eventually engulfed by their stars, possibly reborn as white dwarf planetary systems. Evolved star targets will reveal planet occurrence at the largest distances and most varied environments across the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>HWO Yield Sensitivities in the NIR and NUV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) will search for biosignatures from Earth-size exoplanets in the habitable zones of nearby stars. The wavelength range for biosignatures used by the HabEx and LUVOIR mission concept studies was 200 nm to 2 microns and, as such, this is a candidate wavelength range for HWO. The visible wavelength range (500-1000 nm) provides for detection of water, oxygen, and Raleigh scattering; the near-ultraviolet is valuable for detection of ozone; and the near-infrared enables detection of carbon dioxide and methane for Earth-like atmospheres. Damiano et al. 2023 showed the significant improvement in spectral retrieval reliability when the NUV and NIR are both used with the visible. However, the challenge of the NUV, in addition to the technological and engineering challenges of starlight suppression in the NUV, is the drop in flux of host stars. In the NIR, the challenge is the geometric access to the habitable zone due to the wavelength dependency of the inner working angle limit of coronagraphs. For these reasons, exoplanet yields are lower in the NUV and NIR than in the visible (Morgan et al. 2023, Morgan et al. 2024) and some instrument parameters are more critical for improving NUV and NIR yields than others. In this paper we present a new capability for performing a large number of end-to-end yield modeling simulations to enable large, multivariate parameter sweeps. We utilize this capability to calculate the Visible, NIR, and NUV yield sensitivities to the instrument parameters: aperture diameter, coronagraph core throughput, contrast, and inner working angle (IWA). We find that parameter interactions are important in determining yield, the most important of which is the interaction between contrast and IWA, but that the strength of that interaction is different in each of the three wavebands.</description>

      <title>Searching for Planets Orbiting Vega with the James Webb Space Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The most prominent of the IRAS debris disk systems, $\alpha$ Lyrae (Vega), at a distance of 7.7 pc, has been observed by both the NIRCam and MIRI instruments on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). This paper describes NIRCam coronagraphic observations which have achieved F444W contrast levels of 3$\times10^{-7}$ at 1\arcsec\ (7.7 au), 1$\times10^{-7}$ at 2\arcsec\ (15 au) and few $\times 10^{-8}$ beyond 5\arcsec\ (38 au), corresponding to masses of $&lt;$ 3, 2 and 0.5 MJup for a system age of 700 Myr. Two F444W objects are identified in the outer MIRI debris disk, around 48 au. One of these is detected by MIRI, appears to be extended and has a spectral energy distribution similar to those of distant extragalactic sources. The second one also appears extended in the NIRCam data suggestive of an extragalactic nature.The NIRCam limits within the inner disk (1\arcsec\ --10\arcsec) correspond to a model-dependent masses of 2$\sim$3 \mj. \citet{Su2024} argue that planets larger even 0.3 MJup would disrupt the smooth disk structure seen at MIRI wavelengths. Eight additional objects are found within 60\arcsec\ of Vega, but none has astrometric properties or colors consistent with planet candidates. These observations reach a level consistent with expected Jeans Mass limits. Deeper observations achieving contrast levels $&lt;10^{-8}$ outside of $\sim$4\arcsec\ and reaching masses below that of Saturn are possible, but may not reveal a large population of new objects.</description>

      <title>Long-term Dynamical Stability in the Outer Solar System. II. Detailed Secular Evolution of Four Large Regular and Resonant Trans-Neptunian Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The long-term evolution of the outer Solar System is subject to the influence of the giant planets, however, perturbations from other massive bodies located in the region imprint secular signatures, that are discernible in long-term simulations. In this work, we performed an in-depth analysis of the evolution of massive objects Eris, 2015 KH$_{162}$, Pluto, and 2010 EK$_{139}$ (a.k.a. Dziewanna), subject to perturbations from the giant planets and the 34 largest trans-Neptunian objects. We do this by analysing 200, 1 Gyr long simulations with identical initial conditions, but requiring the numerical integrator to take different time steps for each realization. Despite the integrator's robustness, each run's results are surprisingly different, showing the limitations of individual realizations when studying the trans-Neptunian region due to its intrinsic chaotic nature. For each object, we find orbital variables with well-defined oscillations and limits, and others with surprisingly large variances and seemingly erratic behaviors. We found that 2015 KH$_{162}$ is a non-resonant and very stable object that experiences only limited orbital excursions. Pluto is even more stable and we found a new underlying constraining mechanism for its orbit; 2010 EK$_{139}$ is not well trapped in the 7:2 mean motion resonance in the long-term and cannot be trapped simultaneously in von-Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai resonance; and finally, we found that at present Eris's longitude of perihelion is stationary, tightly librating around 190$^\circ$, but unexpectedly loses its confinement, drifting away after 150 Myr, suggesting a missing element in our model.</description>

      <title>Reading Between the Rainbows: Comparative Exoplanet Characterisation through Molecule Agnostic Spectral Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rocky exoplanets are faint and difficult to observe due to their small size and low brightness compared to their host star. Despite this, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has allowed us new methods and opportunities to study them. Accurately characterising exoplanet atmospheres could offer insights not only into the planetary demographics of rocky worlds in the universe, but also how our own Earth compares. Previous work simulating the observational spectra of planets with various models of atmospheric composition has constrained conditions under which specific molecules would be observable. We seek a different approach that does not depend on specific molecular features, but rather on correlating "agnostic" spectral characteristics to each other. This study uses 42 synthetic transit transmission spectra in a range matching that of JWST's MIRI instrument. Spectra were de-noised, normalised and split into bands for which the enclosed areas were calculated. Using the HDBSCAN clustering algorithm, separation patterns and clusters were found across these bands, which correlated to various a priori planet characteristics, such as relative gas concentration. Using 0.7 $\mu$m bands between 7 and 12 $\mu$m, we are able to separate reducing vs. oxic atmospheres and constrain CO$_2$ and O$_2$ mixing ratios accurate to within two orders of magnitude in an unknown sample. Through this, we have demonstrated that it is possible to differentiate and analyse exoplanet atmosphere type from agnostic interrogation of their transit spectra with a method we call "Molecule Agnostic Spectral Clustering".</description>

      <title>Dust ring and gap formation by gas flow induced by low-mass planets embedded in protoplanetary disks $\rm II$. Time-dependent model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observed dust rings and gaps in protoplanetary disks could be imprints of forming planets. Even low-mass planets in the one-to-ten Earth-mass regime, that do not yet carve deep gas gaps, can generate such dust rings and gaps by driving a radially-outwards gas flow, as shown in previous work. However, understanding the creation and evolution of these dust structures is challenging due to dust drift and diffusion, requiring an approach beyond previous steady state models. Here we investigate the time evolution of the dust surface density influenced by the planet-induced gas flow, based on post-processing three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations. We find that planets larger than a dimensionless thermal mass of $m=0.05$, corresponding to 0.3 Earth mass at 1 au or 1.7 Earth masses at 10 au, generate dust rings and gaps, provided that solids have small Stokes numbers} (${\rm St}\lesssim10^{-2}$) and that the disk midplane is weakly turbulent ($\alpha_{\rm diff}\lesssim10^{-4}$). As dust particles pile up outside the orbit of the planet, the interior gap expands with time, when the advective flux dominates over diffusion. Dust gap depths range from a factor a few, to several orders of magnitude, depending on planet mass and the level of midplane particle diffusion. We construct a semi-analytic model describing the width of the dust ring and gap, and then compare it with the observational data. We find that up to 65\% of the observed wide-orbit gaps could be explained as resulting from the presence of a low-mass planet, assuming $\alpha_{\rm diff}=10^{-5}$ and ${\rm St}=10^{-3}$. However, it is more challenging to explain the observed wide rings, which in our model would require the presence of a population of small particles (${\rm St=10^{-4}}$). Further work is needed to explore the role of pebble fragmentation, planet migration, and the effect of multiple planets.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we analyzed the orbits of more than 35,000 (for 2024) near-Earth objects (NEOs) for the possibility of successive approaches to all pairs of planets: Earth, Venus, and Mars in the time range from 2020 to 2120. We have selected 120 candidates for Earth-Mars, Earth-Venus, Mars-Earth, Mars-Venus, Venus-Earth, and Venus-Mars fast transfers (within 180 days); 2 candidates for double transfers (consecutive approaches with three planets); 10 candidates for multiple transfers, when an asteroid has several consecutive paired approaches to planets in a hundred years.</description>

      <title>Towards a unified injection model of short-lived radioisotopes in N-body simulations of star-forming regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research provides compelling evidence that the decay of short-lived radioisotopes (SLRs), such as 26Al, provided the bulk of energy for heating and desiccation of volatile-rich planetesimals in the early Solar System. However, it remains unclear whether the early Solar System was highly enriched relative to other planetary systems with similar formation characteristics. While the Solar System possesses an elevated level of SLR enrichment compared to the interstellar medium, determining SLR enrichment of individual protoplanetary disks observationally has not been performed and is markedly more difficult. We use N-body simulations to estimate enrichment of SLRs in star-forming regions through two likely important SLR sources, stellar winds from massive stars and supernovae. We vary the number of stars and the radii of the star-forming regions and implement two models of stellar wind SLR propagation for the radioisotopes 26Al and 60Fe. We find that for 26Al enrichment the Solar System is at the upper end of the expected distribution, while for the more supernovae dependent isotope 60Fe we find that the Solar System is comparatively very highly enriched. Furthermore, combined with our previous research, these results suggest that the statistical role of 26Al-driven desiccation on exoplanet bulk composition may be underestimated in typical interpretations of the low-mass exoplanet census, and that 60Fe is even less influential as a source of heating than previously assumed.</description>

      <title>Effects of Planetary Parameters on Disequilibrium Chemistry in Irradiated Planetary Atmospheres: From Gas Giants to Sub-Neptunes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A primary goal of characterizing exoplanet atmospheres is to constrain planetary bulk properties, such as their metallicity, C/O ratio, and intrinsic heat. However, there are significant uncertainties in many aspects of atmospheric physics, such as the strength of vertical mixing. Here we use PICASO and the photochem model to explore how atmospheric chemistry is influenced by planetary properties like metallicity, C/O ratio, $T_{\rm int}$, $T_{\rm eq}$, and $K_{\rm zz}$ in hydrogen-dominated atmospheres. We vary the $T_{\rm eq}$ of the planets between 400 K- 1600 K, across ``cold",``warm," and `hot" objects. We also explore an extensive range of $T_{\rm int}$ values between 30-500 K, representing sub-Neptunes to massive gas giants. We find that gases like CO and CO$_2$ show a drastically different dependence on $K_{\rm zz}$ and C/O for planets with cold interiors (e.g., sub-Neptunes) compared to planets with hotter interiors (e.g., Jupiter mass planets), for the same $T_{\rm eq}$. We also find that gases like CS and CS$_2$ can carry a significant portion of the S- inventory in the upper atmosphere near $T_{\rm eq}$ $\le$ 600 K, below which SO$_2$ ceases to be abundant. For solar C/O, we show that the CO/CH$_4$ ratio in the upper atmospheres of planets can become $\le$1 for planets with low $T_{\rm eq}$, but only if their interiors are cold ($T_{\rm int}$$\le$100 K). We find that photochemical haze precursor molecules in the upper atmosphere show very complex dependence on C/O, $K_{\rm zz}$, $T_{\rm eq}$, and $T_{\rm int}$ for planets with cold interiors (e.g., sub-Neptunes). We also briefly explore fully coupling PICASO and photochem to generate self-consistent radiative-convective-photochemical-equilibrium models.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Sample of Spectra of M-type Stars with Homogeneous Atmospheric-Parameter Labels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discrepancies between theoretical and observed spectra, and the systematic differences between various spectroscopic parameter estimates, complicate the determination of atmospheric parameters of M-type stars. In this work, we present an empirical sample of 5105 M-type star spectra with homogeneous atmospheric parameter labels through stellar-label transfer and sample cleaning. We addressed systematic discrepancies in spectroscopic parameter estimates by adopting recent results for Gaia EDR3 stars as a reference standard. Then, we used a density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise to remove unreliable samples in each subgrid of parameters. To confirm the reliability of the stellar labels, a 5-layer neural network was utilized, randomly partitioning the samples into training and testing sets. The standard deviations between the predicted and actual values in the testing set are 14 K for Teff , 0.06 dex for log g, and 0.05 dex for [M/H], respectively. In addition, we conducted an internal cross-validation to enhance validation and obtained precisions of 11 K, 0.05 dex, and 0.05 dex for Teff , log g, and [M/H], respectively. A grid of 1365 high Signal-to-Noise ratio (S/N) spectra and their labels, selected from the empirical sample, was utilized in the stellar parameter pipeline for M-Type stars (LASPM) of the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST), producing an almost seamless Kiel distribution diagram for LAMOST DR10 and DR11 data. The atmospheric parameters for M-type stars from LAMOST DR11 show improved precision compared to the data from DR9, with improvements (for spectra with S/N higher than 10) from 118 to 67 K in Teff , 0.2 to 0.07 dex in log g, and 0.29 to 0.14 dex in [M/H].</description>

      <title>Formation of Retrograde Hot Jupiter Triggered by Close Encounter with Tidal Circularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09701v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new mechanism is proposed to account for the formation of retrograde hot Jupiter in coplanar star-planet system via close encounter between a Jupiter mass planet and a brown dwarf mass planet. After long timescale scattering between several Jupiter mass planets with inner orbits, the remaining planets still rotating around the star could have large semimajor with large eccentricity. If there exists a brown dwarf mass planet in distant orbit around the star, planetary encounter may happen. After encounter, the Jupiter mass planet may rotate around the star in a retrograde orbit with extremely large eccentricity and the periastron can reach about 0.01 AU, which means that, within the first several orbits around the star, tidal interaction from the star can shrink the semimajor axis of the planet quickly. Thus, the Jupiter mass planet is isolated from the brown dwarf mass planet due to the quick decrease of its apastron distance and eventually evolves into a retrograde hot Jupiter.</description>

Abstract: The selection of a landing site within the Artemis Exploration Zone (AEZ) involves multiple factors and presents a complex problem. This study evaluates potential landing sites for the Artemis III mission using a combination of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methodologies, specifically the TOPSIS algorithm. By integrating topographic, illumination, and mineralogy data of the Moon, we assess 1247 locations that meet the Human Landing System (HLS) requirements within 13 candidate regions and Site 004 near the lunar south pole. Criteria considered include surface visibility, HLS-astronaut line of sight, Permanently Shadowed Regions (PSRs), sunlight exposure, direct communication with Earth, geological units, and mafic mineral abundance. Site DM2 (Nobile Rim 2), particularly the point at latitude 84{\deg}12'5.61" S (-84.20156{\deg}) and longitude 60{\deg}41'59.61" E (60.69989{\deg}), is the optimal location for landing. Sensitivity analysis confirms the robustness of our approach, validating the suitability of the best location despite the MCDM method employed and variations in criteria weightings to prioritize illumination and PSRs. This research demonstrates the applicability of GIS-MCDM techniques for lunar exploration and the potential benefits they can bring to the Artemis program.</description>
