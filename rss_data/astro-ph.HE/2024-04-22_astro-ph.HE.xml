      <title>Coupled Disk-Star Evolution in Galactic Nuclei and the Lifetimes of QPE Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A modest fraction of the stars in galactic nuclei fed towards the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) approach on low-eccentricity orbits driven by gravitational-wave radiation (extreme mass ratio inspiral, EMRI). In the likely event that a gaseous accretion disk is created in the nucleus during this slow inspiral (e.g., via an independent tidal-disruption event; TDE), star-disk collisions generate regular short-lived flares consistent with the observed quasi-periodic eruption (QPE) sources. We present a model for the coupled star-disk evolution which self-consistently accounts for mass and thermal energy injected into the disk from stellar collisions and associated mass ablation. For weak collision/ablation heating, the disk is thermally-unstable and undergoes limit-cycle oscillations which modulate its properties and lead to accretion-powered outbursts on timescales of years to decades, with a time-averaged accretion rate $\sim 0.1 \dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$. Stronger collision/ablation heating acts to stabilize the disk, enabling roughly steady accretion at the EMRI-stripping rate. In either case, the stellar destruction time through ablation, and hence the maximum QPE lifetime, is $\sim 10^{2}-10^{3}$ yr, far longer than fall-back accretion after a TDE. The quiescent accretion disks in QPE sources may at the present epoch be self-sustaining and fed primarily by EMRI ablation. Indeed, the observed range of secular variability broadly match those predicted for collision-fed disks. Changes in the QPE recurrence pattern following such outbursts, similar to that observed in GSN 069, could arise from temporary misalignment between the EMRI-fed disk and the SMBH equatorial plane as the former regrows its mass after a state transition.</description>

      <title>Unequal-mass, highly-spinning binary black hole mergers in the stable mass transfer formation channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing database of gravitational-wave (GW) detections with the binary black holes (BHs) merging in the distant Universe contains subtle insights into their formation scenarios. One of the puzzling properties of detected GW sources is the possible (anti)correlation between mass ratio q of BH-BH binaries and their effective spin. We use rapid binary evolution models to demonstrate that the isolated binary evolution followed by efficient tidal spin-up of stripped helium core produces a similar pattern in Xeff vs q distributions of BH-BH mergers. In our models, the progenitors of unequal BH-BH systems in the stable mass transfer formation scenario are more likely to efficiently shrink their orbits during the second Roche-lobe overflow than the binaries that evolve into nearly equal-mass component systems. This makes it easier for unequal-mass progenitors to enter the tidal spin-up regime and later merge due to GW emission. Our results are, however, sensitive to some input assumptions, especially, the stability of mass transfer and the angular momentum loss during non-conservative mass transfer. We note that mass transfer prescriptions widely adopted in rapid codes favor the formation of BH-BH merger progenitors with unequal masses and moderate separations. We compare our results with detailed stellar model grids and find reasonable agreement after appropriate calibration of the physics models. We anticipate that future detections of unequal-mass BH-BH mergers could provide valuable constraints on the role of the stable mass transfer formation channel. A significant fraction of BH-BH detections with mass ratio q in range (0.4 - 0.7) would be consistent with the mass ratio reversal scenario during the first, relatively conservative mass transfer, and a non-enhanced angular momentum loss during the second, highly non-conservative mass transfer phase.</description>

      <title>The Peculiar Radio Evolution of the Tidal Disruption Event ASASSN-19bt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present detailed radio observations of the tidal disruption event (TDE) ASASSN-19bt/AT2019ahk, obtained with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA), the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), and the MeerKAT radio telescopes, spanning 40 to 1464 days after the onset of the optical flare. We find that ASASSN-19bt displays unusual radio evolution compared to other TDEs, as the peak brightness of its radio emission increases rapidly until 457 days post-optical discovery and then plateaus. Using a generalized approach to standard equipartition techniques, we estimate the energy and corresponding physical parameters for two possible emission geometries: a non-relativistic spherical outflow and a relativistic outflow observed from an arbitrary viewing angle. We find that the non-relativistic solution implies a continuous energy rise in the outflow from $E\sim10^{46}$ erg to $E\sim10^{49}$ erg with $\beta \approx 0.05$, while the off-axis relativistic jet solution instead suggests $E\approx10^{52}$ erg with $\Gamma\sim10$ erg at late times in the maximally off-axis case. We find that neither model provides a holistic explanation for the origin and evolution of the radio emission, emphasizing the need for more complex models. ASASSN-19bt joins the population of TDEs that display unusual radio emission at late times. Conducting long-term radio observations of these TDEs, especially during the later phases, will be crucial for understanding how these types of radio emission in TDEs are produced.</description>

      <title>Revisiting High-Energy Polarization from Leptonic and Hadronic Blazar Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray and MeV polarization can be powerful diagnostics for leptonic and hadronic blazar models. Previous predictions are mostly based on a one-zone framework. However, recent IXPE observations of Mrk~421 and 501 strongly favor a multi-zone framework. Thus, the leptonic and hadronic polarization predictions need to be revisited. Here we identify two generic radiation transfer effects, namely, double depolarization and energy stratification, that can have an impact on the leptonic and hadronic polarization. We show how they are generalized from previously known multi-zone effects of the primary electron synchrotron radiation. Under our generic multi-zone model, the leptonic polarization degree is expected to be much lower than the one-zone prediction, unlikely detectable in most cases. The hadronic polarization degree can reach a value as high as the primary electron synchrotron polarization during simultaneous multi-wavelength flares, consistent with the one-zone prediction. Therefore, IXPE and future X-ray and MeV polarimeters such as eXTP, COSI, and AMEGO-X, have good chances to detect hadronic polarization during flares. However, the hadronic polarization cannot be well constrained during the quiescent state. Nonetheless, if some blazar jets possess relatively stable large-scale magnetic structures, as suggested by radio observations, a non-trivial polarization degree may show up for the hadronic model after a very long exposure time ($\gtrsim 1$ year).</description>

      <title>First image of a jet launching from a black hole accretion system: Kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jets are endemic to both Galactic solar mass and extragalactic supermassive black holes. A recent 86 GHz image of M\,87 shows a jet emerging from the accretion ring around a black hole, providing the first direct observational constraint on the kinematics of the jet-launching region in any black hole jetted system. The very wide ($\sim280\mu\rm{as}$), highly collimated, limb-brightened cylindrical jet base is not predicted in current numerical simulations. The emission was shown to be consistent with that of a thick-walled cylindrical source that apparently feeds the flow that produces the bright limbs of the outer jet at an axial distance downstream of $0.4 \,\rm{mas}&lt;z&lt;0.65\, \rm{mas}$. The analysis here applies the conservation laws of energy, angular momentum, and magnetic flux to the combined system of the outer jet, the cylindrical jet, and the launch region. It also uses the brightness asymmetries of the jet and counterjet to constrain the Doppler factor. The only global solutions have a source that is located $&lt;34 \mu\rm{as}$ from the event horizon. This includes the Event Horizon Telescope annulus of emission and the regions interior to this annulus. The axial jet begins as a magnetically dominated flow that spreads laterally from the launch radius ($&lt;34 \mu\rm{as}$). It becomes super-magnetosonic before it reaches the base of the cylindrical jet. The flow is ostensibly redirected and collimated by a cylindrical nozzle formed in a thick accretion disk. The flow emerges from the nozzle as a mildly relativistic ($0.3c&lt;v&lt;0.4c$) jet with a significant protonic kinetic energy flux.</description>

      <title>Pulsar glitch activities: the spin parameters approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Glitch activity refers to the mean increase in pulsar spin frequency per year due to rotational glitches. It is an important tool for studying super-nuclear matter using neutron star interiors as templates. Glitch events are typically observed in the spin frequency ($\nu$) and frequency derivative ($\dot{\nu}$) of pulsars. The rate of glitch recurrence decreases as the pulsar ages, and the activity parameter is usually measured by linear regression of cumulative glitches over a given period. This method is effective for pulsars with multiple regular glitch events. However, due to the scarcity of glitch events and the difficulty of monitoring all known pulsars, only a few have multiple records of glitch events. This limits the use of the activity parameter in studying neutron star interiors with multiple pulsars. In this study, we examined the relationship between the activity parameters and pulsar spin parameters (spin frequency, frequency derivative, and pulsar characteristic age). We found that a quadratic function provides a better fit for the relationship between activity parameters and spin parameters than the commonly used linear functions. Using this information, we were able to estimate the activity parameters of other pulsars that do not have records of glitches. Our analysis shows that the relationship between the estimated activity parameters and pulsar spin parameters is consistent with that of the observed activity parameters in the ensemble of pulsars.</description>

      <title>Detecting gravitational-wave bursts from black hole binaries in the Galactic Center with LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar-mass black hole binaries (BHBs) in galactic nuclei are gravitationally perturbed by the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) of the host galaxy, potentially inducing strong eccentricity oscillations through the eccentric Kozai-Lidov (EKL) mechanism. These highly eccentric binaries emit a train of gravitational-wave (GW) bursts detectable by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) -- a planned space-based GW detector -- with signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) up to ${\sim}100$ per burst. In this work, we study the GW signature of BHBs orbiting our galaxy's SMBH, Sgr A$^*$, which are consequently driven to very high eccentricities. We demonstrate that an unmodeled approach using a wavelet decomposition of the data effectively yields the time-frequency properties of each burst, provided that the GW frequency peaks between $10^{-3}\,\,\mathrm{Hz}$--$10^{-1}\,\,\mathrm{Hz}$. The wavelet parameters may be used to infer the eccentricity of the binary, measuring $\log_{10}(1-e)$ within an error of $20\%$. Our proposed search method can thus constrain the parameter space to be sampled by complementary Bayesian inference methods, which use waveform templates or orthogonal wavelets to reconstruct and subtract the signal from LISA data.</description>

      <title>Physical Properties of Type II Supernovae Inferred from ZTF and ATLAS Photometric Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an analysis of a sample of 186 spectroscopically confirmed Type II supernova (SN) light curves (LCs) obtained from a combination of Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) observations. We implement a method to infer physical parameters from these LCs using hydrodynamic models that take into account the progenitor mass, the explosion energy, and the presence of circumstellar matter (CSM). The CSM is modelled via the mass loss rate, wind acceleration at the surface of the progenitor star with a $\beta$ velocity law, and the CSM radius. We also infer the time of explosion, attenuation (A$_V$), and the redshift for each SN. Our results favor low-mass progenitor stars (M$_{ZAMS}$\,$&lt;$14\,$M_\odot$) with a dense CSM ($\dot{M}$ $&gt;$ 10$^{-3}$ [M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$], a CSM radius of $\sim$ 10$^{15}$ cm, and $\beta$ $&gt;$ 2). Additionally, we find that the redshift inferred from the supernova LCs is significantly more accurate than that inferred using the host galaxy photometric redshift, suggesting that this method could be used to infer more accurate host galaxy redshifts from large samples of SNe II in the LSST era. Lastly, we compare our results with similar works from the literature.</description>

      <title>Making the invisible visible: Magnetic fields in accretion flows revealed by X-ray polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large scale, strong magnetic fields are often evoked in black hole accretion flows, for jet launching in the low/hard state and to circumvent the thermal instability in the high/soft state. Here we show how these ideas are strongly challenged by X-ray polarization measurements from IXPE. Quite general arguments show that equipartition fields in the accretion flow should be of order $10^{6-8}$ G. These produce substantial Faraday rotation and/or depolarization for photons escaping the flow in the 2-8 keV IXPE bandpass, which is not consistent with the observed data. While we stress that Faraday rotation should be calculated for each individual simulation (density, field geometry and emissivity), it seems most likely that there are no equipartition strength large scale ordered fields inside the photosphere of the X-ray emitting gas. Strong poloidal fields can still be present if they thread the black hole horizon rather than the X-ray emitting flow, so Blandford-Znajek jets are still possible, but an alternative solution is that the low/hard state jet is dominated by pairs so can be accelerated by lower fields. Fundamentally, polarization data from IXPE means that magnetic fields in black hole accretion flows are no longer invisible and unconstrained.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing radiation mechanisms and particle populations in blazar jets through long-term multi-band monitoring with RINGO3 and Fermi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of seven years of multicolour photometric monitoring of a sample of 31 $\gamma$-ray bright blazars using the RINGO3 polarimeter on the Liverpool Telescope from 2013--2020. We explore the relationships between simultaneous observations of flux in three optical wavebands along with Fermi $\gamma$-ray data in order to explore the radiation mechanisms and particle populations in blazar jets. We find significant correlations between optical and $\gamma$-ray flux with no detectable time lag, suggesting leptonic emission processes in the jets of these sources. Furthermore, we find the spectral behaviour against optical and $\gamma$-ray flux for many sources is best fit logarithmically. This is suggestive of a transition between bluer-/redder-when-brighter into stable-when-brighter behaviour during high activity states; a behaviour that might be missed in poorly sampled data, resulting in apparent linear relationships.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive study of compact stars with dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of compact stars admixed with non-self annihilating self-interacting fermionic dark matter, delineating the dependence on the nuclear equation of state by considering the two limiting parametrized equations of state for neutron star matter obtained by smoothly matching the low-density chiral effective theory and the high-density perturbative QCD. These two parametrizations are the limiting cases of a wide variety of smooth equations of state, i.e. the softest and stiffest possible one without a phase transition, that generate masses and radii compatible with 2M$_\odot$ observations and the tidal constraint from GW170817. With an exhaustive analysis of the possible stable mass-radius configurations, we determine the quantity of dark matter contained in stars with masses and radii compatible with the aforementioned astrophysical constraints. We find that for dark particle masses of a few tenths of GeV, the dark core collapses and no stable solutions are found irrespective on the chosen nuclear equation of state. For lower masses, the dark matter fraction is limited to 10%, being at most 1% for masses ranging from 0.1 to 10 GeV for the limiting soft nuclear equation of state. For the limiting stiff nuclear equation of state, the dark matter fraction can reach values of more than 10%, but the dark particle mass is being constrained to 0.3 GeV and 10 GeV for the weak self-interacting case and has to be at least 5 GeV for the strong self-interacting one. For dark particle masses of less than 0.1 GeV, stable neutron star configurations should have less than 1% of self-interacting dark matter to be compatible with the constraint of the tidal deformability from GW170817 irrespective on the chosen nuclear equation of state.</description>

      <title>Insights from the Gaussian Processes Method for the FRB-associated X-ray Burst of SGR 1935+2154</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian processes method is employed to analyze the light curves of bursts detected by Insight-HXMT, NICER, and GECAM from SGR 1935+2154 between 2020 to 2022. It is found that a stochastically driven damped simple harmonic oscillator (SHO) is necessary to capture the characteristics of the X-ray bursts. Variability timescale of the X-ray bursts, corresponding to the broken frequencies in the SHO power spectral densities (PSDs), are extracted. In particular, a high broken frequency of 35 Hz where the index of the SHO PSD changes from -4 to -2 is constrained by the HXMT-HE burst associated with FRB 200428. It is suggested that the corresponding timescale of 0.03 s could be the retarding timescale of the system driven by some kind of energy release, and the production of the HE photon should be quasi-simultaneous with the response. The other special event is a NICER burst with a retarding timescale of 1/39 Hz (0.02 s). In the normal X-ray bursts, no retarding timescale is constrained; a long relax/equilibrium timescale (corresponding to a broken frequency of 1-10 Hz where the index of the SHO PSD changing from -4/-2 to 0 in the SHO PSD) is obtained. The results indicate that the FRB-associated HXMT-HE X-ray burst could be produced immediately when the system is responding to the energy disturbance, far before the equilibrium state.</description>

      <title>Black Hole shadows of $\alpha'$-corrected black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the qualitative features induces by corrections to GR coming from String Theory, on the shadows of rotating black holes. We deal with the slowly rotating black hole solutions up to order $\mathcal{O}(a^3)$, to first order in $\alpha'$, including also the dilaton. We provide a detailed characterization of the geometry, as well as the ISCO and photon ring, and then we proceed to obtain the black hole images within the relativistic thin-disk model. We characterize the images by computing the diameter, displacement and asymmetry. A comparison with the Kerr case, indicates that all these quantities grow due to the $\alpha'$ correction, and that the departure from GR for different observable is enhanced depending on the angle of view, namely for the diameter the maximum departure is obtained when the system is face-on, while for the displacement and asymmetry the departure from GR is maximized for edge-on point of view.</description>

Abstract: Sharp structural variations induce specific signatures on stellar pulsations that can be studied to infer localised information on the stratification of the star. This information is key to improve our understanding of the physical processes that lead to the structural variations and how to model them. Here we revisit and extend the analysis of the signature of different types of buoyancy glitches in gravity-mode and mixed-mode pulsators presented in earlier works, including glitches with step-like, Gaussian-like, and Dirac-$\delta$-like shapes. In particular, we provide analytical expressions for the perturbations to the periods and show that these can be reliably used in place of the expressions provided for the period spacings, with the advantage that the use of the new expressions does not require modes with consecutive radial orders to be observed. Based on a comparison with two limit cases and on simulated data, we further tested the accuracy of the expression for the Gaussian-like glitch signature whose derivation in an earlier work involved a significant approximation. We find that the least reliable glitch parameter inferred from fitting that expression is the amplitude, which can be up to a factor of two larger than the true amplitude, reaching this limit when the glitch is small. We further discuss the impact on the glitch signature of considering a glitch in the inner and outer half of the g-mode cavity, emphasising the break of symmetry that takes place in the case of mixed-mode pulsators.</description>

      <title>Formation of a $33\,M_{\odot}$ black hole in a low-metallicity binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A $33\,M_\odot$ black hole (BH) was recently discovered in an 11.6-year binary only 590 pc from the Sun. The system, Gaia BH3, contains a $0.8\,M_\odot$ low-metallicity giant ($\rm [M/H]=-2.2$) and is kinematically part of the Galactic halo, suggesting that the BH formed from a low-metallicity massive star. I show that orbits similar to that of Gaia BH3 are naturally produced through isolated binary evolution. The system's period and eccentricity can result from a broad range of initial orbits with a modest natal kick ($v_{\rm kick}\lesssim 75\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$) to the BH. I construct MESA models for metal-poor massive stars with initial masses ranging from $35-55\,M_{\odot}$, which reach maximum radii of $1150-1800\,R_{\odot}$ as red supergiants. Stars of this size would fit inside most plausible pre-supernova orbits for the system without overflowing their Roche lobes. In addition, models with moderately rapid initial rotation ($\Omega/\Omega_{\rm crit} \gtrsim 0.45$) undergo chemically homogeneous evolution and never expand to radii larger than $10\,R_{\odot}$. There are thus multiple channels through which a low-metallicity, extreme-mass ratio binary could produce a system like Gaia BH3. Dynamical formation scenarios are also viable, and there is little doubt that both isolated and dynamically-formed BH binaries with orbits similar to Gaia BH3 will be discovered in Gaia DR4. Only about 1 in 10,000 stars in the solar neighborhood have metallicities as low as Gaia BH3. This suggests that BH companions are dramatically over-represented at low-metallicity, though caveats related to small number statistics apply. The fact that the luminous star in Gaia BH3 has been a giant - greatly boosting its detectability - only for $\sim$1% of the time since the system's formation implies that additional massive BHs remain to be discovered with only moderately fainter companions.</description>

      <title>Rapid Black Hole Spin-down by Thick Magnetically Arrested Disks</title>

Abstract: Black hole (BH) spin can play an important role in galaxy evolution by controlling the amount of energy and momentum ejected from near the BH into the surroundings. We focus on radiatively-inefficient and geometrically-thick magnetically-arrested disks (MADs) that can launch strong BH-powered jets. With an appropriately chosen adiabatic index, these systems can describe either the low-luminosity or highly super-Eddington BH accretion regimes. Using a suite of 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations, we find that for any initial spin, a MAD rapidly spins down the BH to the equilibrium spin of $0&lt; a_{\rm eq} \lesssim 0.1$, very low compared to $a_{\rm eq} = 1$ for the standard thin luminous (Novikov-Thorne) disks. This implies that rapidly accreting (super-Eddington) BHs fed by MADs tend to lose most of their rotational energy to magnetized relativistic outflows. In a MAD, a BH only needs to accrete $20\%$ of its own mass to spin down from $a=1$ to $a=0.2$. We construct a semi-analytic model of BH spin evolution in MADs by taking into account the torques on the BH due to both the hydrodynamic disk and electromagnetic jet components, and find that the low value of $a_{\rm eq} $ is due to both the jets slowing down the BH rotation and the disk losing a large fraction of its angular momentum to outflows. Our results have crucial implications for how BH spins evolve in active galaxies and other systems such as collapsars, where BH spin-down timescale can be short enough to significantly affect the evolution of gamma-ray emitting BH-powered jets.</description>

      <title>XMM-Newton --NuSTAR monitoring campaign of the Seyfert 1 galaxy IC 4329A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00783v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the results of a joint {\it XMM-Newton} and {\it NuSTAR} campaign on the active galactic nucleus (AGN) IC 4329A, consisting of 9 $\times$ 20 ks {\it XMM-Newton} observations, and 5 $\times$ 20 ks {\it NuSTAR} observations within nine days, performed in August 2021. Within each observation, the AGN is not very variable, with the fractional variability never exceeding 5%. Flux variations are observed between the different observations, on timescales of days, with a 30% ratio between the minimum and the maximum 2-10 keV flux. These variations follow the softer-when-brighter behavior typically observed in AGN. In all observations, a soft excess is clearly present. Consistently with previous observations, the X-ray spectra of the source exhibit a cut-off energy between 140 and 250 keV, constant within the error in the different observations. We detected a prominent component of the $6.4$\,keV Fe~K$\alpha$ line consistent with being constant during the monitoring, consisting of an unresolved narrow core and a broader component likely originating in the inner accredion disc. We find that the reflection component is weak ($R_{\rm max}=0.009\pm0.002$) and most likely originating in distant neutral medium. We also found the presence of a warm absorber component together with an ultra-fast outflow. Looking at their energetic, these outflows have enough mechanical power to exercise a significant feedback impact on the AGN surrounding environment.</description>

      <title>A discovery of Two Slow Pulsars with FAST: "Ronin" from the Globular Cluster M15</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05868v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Globular clusters harbor numerous millisecond pulsars, but long-period pulsars ($P \gtrsim 100$ ms) are rarely found. In this study, we employed a fast folding algorithm to analyze observational data from multiple globular clusters obtained by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), aiming to detect the existence of long-period pulsars. We estimated the impact of the median filtering algorithm in eliminating red noise on the minimum detectable flux density ($S_{\rm min}$) of pulsars. Subsequently, we successfully discovered two isolated long-period pulsars in M15 with periods approximately equal to 1.928451 seconds and 3.960716 seconds, respectively. On the $P-\dot{P}$ diagram, both pulsars are positioned below the spin-up line, suggesting a possible history of partial recycling in X-ray binary systems disrupted by dynamical encounters later on. According to timing results, these two pulsars exhibit remarkably strong magnetic fields. If the magnetic fields were weakened during the accretion process, then a short duration of accretion might explain the strong magnetic fields of these pulsars.</description>

      <title>What Is the Black Hole Spin in Cyg X-1?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a detailed study of the black hole spin of Cyg X-1, using accurate broad-band X-ray data obtained in the soft spectral state by simultaneous NICER and NuSTAR observations, supplemented at high energies by INTEGRAL data. We use the relativistic disk model kerrbb together with different models of the Comptonization high energy tail and the relativistically-broadened reflection features. Unlike most previous studies, we tie the spin parameters of the disk and relativistic broadening models, thus combining the continuum and reflection methods of spin determination. We also consider a likely increase of the disk color correction due to a partial support of the disk by large scale magnetic fields. We find that such models yield the spin parameter of $a_*= 0.87^{+0.04}_{-0.03}$ if the disk inclination is allowed to be free, with $i= 39^{+1}_{-1}$ degree. Assuming $i=27.5$ degree, as determined by optical studies of the binary, worsens the fit, but leads to similar values of the spin, $a_*= 0.90^{+0.01}_{-0.01}$. In addition, we consider the presence of a warm Comptonization layer on top of the disk, motivated by successful modeling of soft X-ray excesses in other sources with such a model. This dramatically lowers the spin, to $a_*\lesssim 0.1$, consistent with the spin measurements from black-hole mergers. On the other hand, if the natal spin of Cyg X-1 was low but now $a_*\approx 0.9$, a period of effective super-critical accretion had to take place in the past. Such accretion could be facilitated by photon advection, as proposed for ultraluminous X-ray sources.</description>

      <title>Including a Luminous Central Remnant in Radiative Transfer Simulations for Type Iax Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Type Iax supernovae (SNe Iax) are proposed to arise from deflagrations of Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs (WDs). Previous deflagration simulations have achieved good agreement with the light curves and spectra of intermediate-luminosity and bright SNe Iax. However, the model light curves decline too quickly after peak, particularly in red optical and near-infrared (NIR) bands. Deflagration models with a variety of ignition configurations do not fully unbind the WD, leaving a remnant polluted with $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$. Emission from such a remnant may contribute to the luminosity of SNe Iax. Here we investigate the impact of adding a central energy source, assuming instantaneous powering by $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$ decay in the remnant, in radiative transfer calculations of deflagration models. Including the remnant contribution improves agreement with the light curves of SNe Iax, particularly due to the slower post-maximum decline of the models. Spectroscopic agreement is also improved, with intermediate-luminosity and faint models showing greatest improvement. We adopt the full remnant $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$ mass predicted for bright models, but good agreement with intermediate-luminosity and faint SNe Iax is only possible for remnant $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$ masses significantly lower than those predicted. This may indicate that some of the $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$ decay energy in the remnant does not contribute to the radiative luminosity but instead drives mass ejection, or that escape of energy from the remnant is significantly delayed. Future work should investigate the structure of remnants predicted by deflagration models and the potential roles of winds and delayed energy escape, as well as extend radiative transfer simulations to late times.</description>

      <title>Discovery of the optical and radio counterpart to the fast X-ray transient EP240315a</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast X-ray Transients (FXTs) are extragalactic bursts of soft X-rays first identified &gt;10 years ago. Since then, nearly 40 events have been discovered, although almost all of these have been recovered from archival Chandra and XMM-Newton data. To date, optical sky surveys and follow-up searches have not revealed any multi-wavelength counterparts. The Einstein Probe, launched in January 2024, has started surveying the sky in the soft X-ray regime (0.5-4 keV) and will rapidly increase the sample of FXTs discovered in real time. Here, we report the first discovery of both an optical and radio counterpart to an FXT, the fourth source publicly released by the Einstein Probe. We discovered a fast-fading optical transient within the 3 arcmin localisation radius of EP240315a with the all-sky optical survey ATLAS, and our follow-up Gemini spectrum provides a redshift, z=4.859+/-0.002. Furthermore, we uncovered a radio counterpart in the S-band (3.0 GHz) with the MeerKAT radio interferometer. The optical (rest-frame UV) and radio luminosities indicate the FXT most likely originates from either a long gamma-ray burst or a relativistic tidal disruption event. This may be a fortuitous early mission detection by the Einstein Probe or may signpost a mode of discovery for high-redshift, high-energy transients through soft X-ray surveys, combined with locating multi-wavelength counterparts.</description>

      <title>NNNLO pressure of cold quark matter: leading logarithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:1807.04120v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At high baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$, the equation of state of QCD allows a weak-coupling expansion in the QCD coupling $\alpha_s$. The result is currently known up to and including the full next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) $\alpha_s^2$. Starting at this order, the computations are complicated by the modification of particle propagation in a dense medium, which necessitates non-perturbative treatment of the scale $\alpha_s^{1/2} \mu_B$. In this work, we apply a Hard-Thermal-Loop scheme for capturing the contributions of this scale to the weak-coupling expansion, and use it to determine the leading-logarithm contribution to NNNLO: $\alpha_s^3 \ln^2 \alpha_s$. This result is the first improvement to the equation of state of massless cold quark matter in 40 years. The new term is negligibly small, and thus significantly increases our confidence in the applicability of the weak-coupling expansion.</description>

      <title>Soft Leptogenesis with Primordial Black Holes and Natural Solution to Gravitino Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.02604v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of the production of sneutrinos through Hawking evaporation of primordial black holes (PBH), we have studied soft leptogenesis in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) with heavy right handed neutrinos. Depending upon different conditions on the Hawking evaporation temperature of the PBH and the initial Hawking temperature of the PBH with the sneutrinos's mass which has lepton number violating decay modes, we have discussed how the gravitino problem could be easily avoided in leptogenesis in SUSYGUT theories. For this, one is required to consider that the PBH energy density dominates the energy budget of the universe over the inflaton field. We have shown three possible cases for which the successful generation of baryonic asymmetry is possible. In one case, for the generation of baryonic asymmetry, Shakharov's out-of-equilibrium condition is required whereas in the other two cases, it is found to be not required. The first case is somewhat similar to conventional soft leptogenesis, where for avoiding gravitino problem, $B$ parameter is required to be lower than the weak scale. However in those later two cases, gravitino problem can be easily avoided and the soft breaking $B$ parameter could be naturally at the weak scale for PBH mass greater than about $3 \times 10^{26}$ GeV. From experimental constraint of non-observation of $\mu \rightarrow e \gamma$, the allowed region of typical mass scale of some supersymmetric particles and the $|A|$ parameter is also discussed.</description>
