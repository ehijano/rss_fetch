      <title>Gated-Channel Conductivity Modulation by Hole Storage Effect Under Pulsed Conditions in p-GaN Gate Double Channel HEMT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a p-GaN gate double channel HEMT (DC-HEMT) with conductivity modulation has been reported. The conductivity modulation is realized by hole storage in the gate stack and observed under quasi-static measurements. In this work, pulsed measurement and transient simulations of the DC-HEMT are carried out to disclose the conductivity modulation at high frequency and build-up time of hole storage. It takes 150 ns for the hole storage to be completely established despite a Schottky gate in the DC-HEMT with low gate leakage. The fast build-up of hole storage is attributed to the AlN insertion layer's strong confinement capability of holes and suppressed electron-hole recombination in the DC structure.</description>

      <title>Compact Meandered Dipole Array Presenting Super-Realized Gain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study of a compact two-element meandered dipole array aimed at achieving super-realized gain. An optimization was performed using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) implemented in MATLAB, targeting the maximization of the realized gain in the end-fire direction. Three primary excitation schemes were evaluated: the conventional optimization to achieve superdirectivity (signal magnitude and phase angle), phase-only optimization, and uniform excitation (characterized by equal amplitude and no phase shift). The results show that by carefully optimizing both the signal magnitudes and phase angles, the array could achieve a substantial improvement in realized gain. Phase-only optimization provided a competitive realized gain with only minor reductions compared to conventional optimization, suggesting that optimizing the signal phase alone can be an effective strategy in practical implementations.</description>

      <title>A numerical study on the buckling of near-perfect spherical shells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results from a numerical investigation using the finite element method to study the buckling strength of near-perfect spherical shells containing a single, localized, Gaussian-dimple defect whose profile is systematically varied toward the limit of vanishing amplitude. In this limit, our simulations reveal distinct buckling behaviors for hemispheres, full spheres, and partial spherical caps. Hemispherical shells exhibit boundary-dominated buckling modes, resulting in a knockdown factor of 0.8. By contrast, full spherical shells display localized buckling at their pole with knockdown factors near unity. Furthermore, for partial spherical shells, we observed a transition from boundary modes to these localized buckling modes as a function of the cap angle. We characterize these behaviors by systematically examining the effects of the discretization level, solver parameters, and radius-to-thickness ratio on knockdown factors. Specifically, we identify the conditions under which knockdown factors converge across shell configurations. Our findings highlight the critical importance of carefully controlled numerical parameters in shell-buckling simulations in the near-perfect limit, demonstrating how precise choices in discretization and solver parameters are essential for accurately predicting the distinct buckling modes across different shell geometries.</description>

      <title>Artificial Neural Network based Modelling for Variational Effect on Double Metal Double Gate Negative Capacitance FET</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we have implemented an accurate machine-learning approach for predicting various key analog and RF parameters of Negative Capacitance Field-Effect Transistors (NCFETs). Visual TCAD simulator and the Python high-level language were employed for the entire simulation process. However, the computational cost was found to be excessively high. The machine learning approach represents a novel method for predicting the effects of different sources on NCFETs while also reducing computational costs. The algorithm of an artificial neural network can effectively predict multi-input to single-output relationships and enhance existing techniques. The analog parameters of Double Metal Double Gate Negative Capacitance FETs (D2GNCFETs) are demonstrated across various temperatures ($T$), oxide thicknesses ($T_{ox}$), substrate thicknesses ($T_{sub}$), and ferroelectric thicknesses ($T_{Fe}$). Notably, at $T=300K$, the switching ratio is higher and the leakage current is $84$ times lower compared to $T=500K$. Similarly, at ferroelectric thicknesses $T_{Fe}=4nm$, the switching ratio improves by $5.4$ times compared to $T_{Fe}=8nm$. Furthermore, at substrate thicknesses $T_{sub}=3nm$, switching ratio increases by $81\%$ from $T_{sub}=7nm$. For oxide thicknesses at $T_{ox}=0.8nm$, the ratio increases by $41\%$ compared to $T_{ox}=0.4nm$. The analysis reveals that $T_{Fe}=4nm$, $T=300K$, $T_{ox}=0.8nm$, and $T_{sub}=3nm$ represent the optimal settings for D2GNCFETs, resulting in significantly improved performance. These findings can inform various applications in nanoelectronic devices and integrated circuit (IC) design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $^{7}Be$ an isotope emanating from cosmogenic origins due to high energy cosmic rays, is studied from its production to its detection in the surface, in order to elucidate atmospheric circulation phenomena and analyze the vertical transport of air masses. This can be illustrated briefly by the monsoon model in Kerala in India, where the application of the $^{7}Be$ detection methods in stations in Russia and Australia offered predictions of the debut and retreat of moonsoon saison in contrast to the meteorological methods.</description>

      <title>Fast determination of the tilt of Raman lasers using the tilt-scanned fringe for atom gravimeters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sensitive axes of atom gravimeters are defined by the directions of the respective Raman lasers. Any tilt of the Raman lasers with respect to the vertical direction introduces errors in gravity measurements. In this work, we report a fast determination of the tilt of Raman lasers, where the fringe of the atom interferometer is scanned by varying the tilt, rather than the phase, of the Raman lasers. Unlike the periodic cosine fringes typically used in atom interferometers, the fringe obtained by changing the tilt, referred to as the tilt-scanned fringe, is aperiodic and symmetric with respect to zero tilt. The tilt-scanned fringe is highly sensitive to asymmetries caused by non-zero tilt, enabling fast and precise determination of the Raman laser tilt in atom gravimeters. We demonstrate that one tilt-scanned fringe, corresponding to a measurement cycle time of 13 s, can determine the tilt with a typical precision of about 30 $\mu$rad in our developed atom gravimeter. Further investigation proves that the tilt-scanned fringe approach shortens the measurement cycle time by over an order of magnitude while keeping comparable precision with conventional tilt determination techniques. The fast tilt determination presented here is significant for the application of atom gravimeters, particularly in absolute gravity surveys.</description>

      <title>Thermal circuit model for silicon quantum-dot array structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temperature rise of qubits due to heating is a critical issue in large-scale quantum computers based on quantum-dot (QD) arrays. This leads to shorter coherence times, induced readout errors, and increased charge noise. Here, we propose a simple thermal circuit model to describe the heating effect on silicon QD array structures. Noting that the QD array is a periodic structure, we represent it as a thermal distributed-element circuit, forming a thermal transmission line. We validate this model by measuring the electron temperature in a QD array device using Coulomb blockade thermometry, finding that the model effectively reproduces experimental results. This simple and scalable model can be used to develop the thermal design of large-scale silicon-based quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Resistance of high-temperature superconducting tapes triggered by alternating magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic resistance occurs in a superconducting tape carrying a dc transport current while being exposed to an alternating magnetic field. This effect is caused by flux movements interacting with the transport current. The dynamic resistance is already applied in many superconducting applications, for example superconducting flux pumps or persistent current switches. The resistance is highly dependent on the magnetic field and the frequency the superconductor is subjected to and its properties. When the dynamic resistance exceeds a certain value and thus enters the magnitude of the resistances of the normal conducting layers of the HTS tape, these normal conducting layers play a significant role in the total resistance of the tape. In this paper, modifications were made to the silver stabilizer and the total resistance of the HTS tape has been investigated. The experimental results with frequencies up to 1000 Hz and magnetic field up to 277 mT show significant increases in resistance. Additionally, a multilayer model based on H-formulation is presented to calculate the losses of the superconductor. The results also show significant heating due to the losses and therefore a temperature rise, which effects the measured total resistance. These results can be further used for applications where high switchable resistances are required with zero dc resistance when the magnet is turned off.</description>

      <title>Ultrastable optical frequency dissemination over a branching passive optical network using CDMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a technique for ultrastable optical frequency dissemination in a branching passive optical network using code-division multiple access (CDMA). In our protocol, each network user employs a unique pseudo-random sequence to rapidly change the optical frequency among many distinct frequencies. After transmission through the optical network, each user correlates the received sequence with the transmitted one, thus establishing a frequency-hopping spread spectrum technique that helps reject optical signals transmitted by other users in the network. Our method, which builds on the work by Schediwy et al. [Opt. Lett. {\bf 38}, 2893 (2013)], improves the frequency distribution network's capacity, helps reject phase noise caused by intermediate optical back scattering, and simplifies the operational requirements. Using this protocol, we show that a frequency instability better than ~$10^{-18}$ while having more than 100 users operating in the network should be possible. Finally, we theoretically explore the limits of this protocol and show that the demonstrated stability does not suffer from any fundamental limitation. In the future, the CDMA method presented here could be used in complex time-frequency distribution networks, allowing more users while, at the same time, reducing the network's complexity.</description>

      <title>Possible High temperature Superconductivity above 200K mediated by Bose Einstein Condensation of exciton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exciton mediated superconductor is a fascinating quantum phase of matter that occurs when excitons become the dominant excitation in materials, which is also very promising for high temperature superconductor. However, there is no experimental report of exciton mediated superconductivity. Herein, we realize exciton mediated superconductivity from exciton insulator, where the onset transition temperature can reach larger than 200 K. More profoundly, Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of exciton can facilitate the formation of exciton insulator and a transition happened from extremely high resistivity of 107 {\Omega} at 153.5 K to 100 {\Omega} at 125 K, indicating a superconducting transition. The resistance of exciton mediated superconductivity can not be absolutely reach zero possibly as a result of drag effect between electrons/holes and excitons. We reveal one rule for exciton mediated superconductivity is that the resistivity is an inverse linear function of the current through the BEC superfluid state, which should be ascribed to the Andreev-Bashkin effect, which reflects the coupling between the BEC state of exciton and Cooper pairs mediated by excitons. Furthermore, a record transition temperature above 200 K has been found for one superconducting sample, which shows the Josephson oscillation dominated by a pendulum-like equation caused by the quantum coupling between superconductor and BEC superfluid of exciton.</description>

      <title>Numerical analysis and simulation of lateral memristive devices: Schottky, ohmic, and multi-dimensional electrode models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the numerical analysis and simulations of a multi-dimensional memristive device model. Memristive devices and memtransistors based on two-dimensional (2D) materials have demonstrated promising potential as components for next-generation artificial intelligence (AI) hardware and information technology. Our charge transport model describes the drift-diffusion of electrons, holes, and ionic defects self-consistently in an electric field. We incorporate two types of boundary models: ohmic and Schottky contacts. The coupled drift-diffusion partial differential equations are discretized using a physics-preserving Voronoi finite volume method. It relies on an implicit time-stepping scheme and the excess chemical potential flux approximation. We demonstrate that the fully discrete nonlinear scheme is unconditionally stable, preserving the free-energy structure of the continuous system and ensuring the non-negativity of carrier densities. Novel discrete entropy-dissipation inequalities for both boundary condition types in multiple dimensions allow us to prove the existence of discrete solutions. We perform multi-dimensional simulations to understand the impact of electrode configurations and device geometries, focusing on the hysteresis behavior in lateral 2D memristive devices. Three electrode configurations -- side, top, and mixed contacts -- are compared numerically for different geometries and boundary conditions. These simulations reveal the conditions under which a simplified one-dimensional electrode geometry can well represent the three electrode configurations. This work lays the foundations for developing accurate, efficient simulation tools for 2D memristive devices and memtransistors, offering tools and guidelines for their design and optimization in future applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integrated photonics CMOS-compatible silicon nitride (SiN) platform is praised for its low propagation loss, but is limited by its lack of active functionalities such as a strong Pockels coefficient and intrinsic \c{hi}(2) nonlinearity. In this paper, we demonstrate the integration of centimetre-long thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) devices on a SiN platform using the micro-transfer printing (uTP) method. At a wavelength of 1550 nm, propagation losses of approximately 0.9 dB/cm and transition losses of 1.8 dB per facet were measured. Furthermore, the TFLN was integrated into an imbalanced push-pull Mach-Zehnder modulator, achieving a V{\pi} of 3.2 V. The electro-optics nature of the observed modulation is confirmed by measuring the device up to 35 GHz, showing that the printing does not affect the high-speed LN properties.</description>

      <title>Parallel mechanical computing: Metamaterials that can multitask</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decades after being replaced with digital platforms, analogue computing has experienced a surging interest following developments in metamaterials and intricate fabrication techniques. Specifically, wave-based analogue computers which impart spatial transformations on an incident wavefront, commensurate with a desired mathematical operation, have gained traction owing to their ability to directly encode the input in its unprocessed form, bypassing analogue-to-digital conversion. While promising, these systems are inherently limited to single-task configurations. Their inability to concurrently perform multiple tasks, or compute in parallel, represents a major hindrance to advancing conceptual mechanical devices with broader computational capabilities. In here, we present a first attempt to simultaneously process independent computational tasks within the same architected structure. By breaking time invariance in a set of metasurface building blocks, multiple frequency-shifted beams are self-generated which absorb notable energy amounts from the fundamental signal. The onset of these tunable harmonics, enables distinct computational tasks to be assigned to different independent "channels", effectively allowing an analogue mechanical computer to multitask.</description>

      <title>Generalized Scattering Matrix Formulation and its Relationship with TARC and Maximum Power Transfer Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a rigorous framework for analyzing arbitrary passive matching networks using a generalized Thevenin-Helmholtz equivalent circuit. Unlike prior formulations, which often impose restrictive assumptions such as diagonal matching impedance matrices, our approach accommodates fully passive and interconnected multiport matching networks in their most general form. We first establish the mathematical conditions that any Linear Time Invarient, LTI, passive matching network must satisfy, starting from a $N \times N$ impedance matrix and continuing to $2N \times 2N$ and modified to follow the Thevenin-Helmholtz equivalent network. Using the Maximum Power Transfer Theorem (MPTT), we derive the scattering matrix $\mathbf{S}$ explicitly, showing its general applicability to arbitrary impedance configurations. Furthermore, we demonstrate the connection between the Total Active Reflection Coefficient (TARC) and the MPTT, proving that the TARC is inherently tied to the power conservation principle of the MPTT. This formulation not only unifies existing approaches, but also broadens the scope of applicability to encompass arbitrary physical passive systems. The equations and relationships derived provide a robust mathematical foundation for analyzing complex multiport systems, including interconnected phased arrays and passive antenna networks.</description>

Abstract: A caustic is a mathematical concept describing the beam formation when the beam envelope is reflected or refracted by a manifold. While caustics are common in a wide range of physical systems, caustics typically exhibit a reciprocal wave propagation and are challenging to control. Here, we utilize the highly anisotropic dispersion and inherent non-reciprocity of a magnonic system to shape non-reciprocal emission of caustic-like spin wave beams in an extended 200 nm thick yttrium iron garnet (YIG) film from a nano-constricted rf waveguide. We introduce a near-field diffraction model to study spin-wave beamforming in homogeneous in-plane magnetized thin films, and reveal the propagation of non-reciprocal spin-wave beams directly emitted from the nanoconstriction by spatially resolved micro-focused Brillouin light spectroscopy (BLS). The experimental results agree well with both micromagnetic simulation, and the near-field diffraction model. The proposed method can be readily implemented to study spin-wave interference at the sub-micron scale, which is central to the development of wave-based computing applications and magnonic devices.</description>

      <title>Graded lithium-ion battery pouch cells to homogenise current distributions and mitigate lithium plating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spatial distributions in current, temperature, state-of-charge and degradation across the plane of large format lithium-ion battery pouch cells can significantly impact their performance, especially at high C-rates. In this paper, a method to smooth out these spatial distributions by grading the electrode microstructure in-the-plane is proposed. A mathematical model of a large format pouch cell is developed and validated against both temperature and voltage experimental data. An analytical solution for the optimal graded electrode that achieves a uniform current distribution across the pouch cell is then derived. The model predicts that the graded electrodes could significantly reduce the likelihood of lithium plating in large format pouch cells, with grading increasing the C-rate at which plating occurs from 2.4C to 4.3C. These results indicate the potential of designing spatially varying electrode architectures to homogenise the response of large format pouch cells and improve their high rate performance.</description>

      <title>Quantum machine learning for multiclass classification beyond kernel methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02913</link>

Abstract: Quantum machine learning is considered one of the current research fields with immense potential. In recent years, Havl\'i\v{c}ek et al. [Nature 567, 209-212 (2019)] have proposed a quantum machine learning algorithm with quantum-enhanced feature spaces, which effectively addressed a binary classification problem on a superconducting processor and offered a potential pathway to achieving quantum advantage. However, a straightforward binary classification algorithm falls short in solving multiclass classification problems. In this paper, we propose a quantum algorithm that rigorously demonstrates that quantum kernel methods enhance the efficiency of multiclass classification in real-world applications, providing quantum advantage. To demonstrate quantum advantage, we design six distinct quantum kernels within the quantum algorithm to map input data into quantum state spaces and estimate the corresponding quantum kernel matrices. The results from quantum simulations reveal that the quantum algorithm outperforms its classical counterpart in handling six real-world multiclass classification problems. Furthermore, we leverage a variety of performance metrics to comprehensively evaluate the classification and generalization performance of the quantum algorithm. The results demonstrate that the quantum algorithm achieves superior classification and better generalization performance relative to classical counterparts.</description>

      <title>Exploring lattice thermal conductivity models via interpretable deep learning to accelerate the discovery of novel materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05948v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lattice thermal conductivity, being integral to thermal transport properties, is indispensable to advancements in areas such as thermoelectric materials and thermal management. Traditional methods, such as Density Functional Theory and Molecular Dynamics, require significant computational resources, posing challenges to the high-throughput prediction of lattice thermal conductivity. Although AI-driven material science has achieved fruitful progress, the trade-off between accuracy and interpretability in machine learning continues to hinder further advancements. This study utilizes interpretable deep learning techniques to construct a rapid prediction framework that enables both qualitative assessments and quantitative predictions, accurately forecasting the thermal transport properties of three novel materials. Furthermore, interpretable deep learning offers analytically grounded physical models while integrating with sensitivity analysis to uncover deeper theoretical insights.</description>
