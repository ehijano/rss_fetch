      <title>Hypergraph C*-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a definition of hypergraph C*-algebras. These generalize the well-known graph C*-algebras as well as ultragraph C*-algebras. In contrast to those objects, hypergraph C*-algebras are not always nuclear. We provide a number of non-nuclear examples, we prove a Gauge-Invariant Uniqueness Theorem for a subclass of hypergraph C*-algebras and we study moves on hypergraphs which generalize the moves in the theory of graph C*-algebras.</description>

      <title>Positive operator-valued kernels and non-commutative probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove new factorization and dilation results for general positive operator-valued kernels, and we present their implications for associated Hilbert space-valued Gaussian processes, and their covariance structure. Further applications are to non-commutative probability theory, including a non-commutative Radon--Nikodym theorem for systems of completely positive maps.</description>

      <title>On representations and topological aspects of positive maps on non-unital quasi *-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a representation of a certain class of C*-valued positive sesquilinear and linear maps on non-unital quasi *-algebras. Also, we illustrate our results on the concrete examples of non-unital Banach quasi *-algebras, such as the standard Hilbert module over a commutative C*-algebra, Schatten p-ideals, and noncommutative L2 spaces induced by a semifinite, nonfinite trace. As a consequence of our results, we obtain a representation of all bounded positive linear C*-valued maps on non-unital C*-algebras. We also deduce some norm inequalities for these maps. Finally, we consider a noncommutative L2 space equipped with the topology generated by a positive sesquilinear form and we construct a topologically transitive operator on this space.</description>

      <title>Linearizing holomorphic functions on operator spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of completely bounded holomorphic functions defined on the open unit ball of an operator space. We endow the set of these functions with an operator space structure, and in the scalar-valued case we identify an operator space predual for it which is a noncommutative version of Mujica's predual for the space of bounded holomorphic functions and satisfies similar properties. In particular, our predual is a free holomorphic operator space in the sense that it satisfies a linearization property for vector-valued completely bounded holomorphic functions. Additionally, several different operator space approximation properties transfer between the predual and the domain.</description>

      <title>Minimal compact operators, subdifferential of the maximum eigenvalue and semi-definite programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate the issue of minimality of self-adjoint operators on a Hilbert space as a semi-definite problem, linking the work by Overton in [1] to the characterization of minimal hermitian matrices. This motivates us to investigate the relationship between minimal self-adjoint operators and the subdifferential of the maximum eigenvalue, initially for matrices and subsequently for compact operators. In order to do it we obtain new formulas of subdifferentials of maximum eigenvalues of compact operators that become useful in these optimization problems. Additionally, we provide formulas for the minimizing diagonals of rank one self-adjoint operators, a result that might be applied for numerical large-scale eigenvalue optimization.

      <title>Tracially Complete C*-Algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.20594v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of operator algebras -- tracially complete C*-algebras -- as a vehicle for transferring ideas and results between C*-algebras and their tracial von Neumann algebra completions. We obtain structure and classification results for amenable tracially complete C*-algebras satisfying an appropriate version of Murray and von Neumann's property gamma for II_1 factors. In a precise sense, these results fit between Connes' celebrated theorems for injective II_1 factors and the unital classification theorem for separable simple nuclear C*-algebras. The theory also underpins arguments for the known parts of the Toms-Winter conjecture.</description>

      <title>Non-traditional Cartan subalgebras in twisted groupoid C*-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Well-known work of Renault shows that if $\mathcal{E}$ is a twist over a second countable, effective, \'etale groupoid $G$, then there is a naturally associated Cartan subalgebra of the reduced twisted groupoid C*-algebra $C^*_{r}(G; E)$, and that every Cartan subalgebra of a separable C*-algebra arises in this way. However twisted C*-algebras of non-effective groupoids $G$ can also possess Cartan subalgebras: In work by the first author together with Gillaspy, Norton, Reznikoff, and Wright, sufficient conditions on a subgroupoid $S$ of $G$ were found that ensure that $S$ gives rise to a Cartan subalgebra in the cocycle-twisted C*-algebra of $G$. In this paper, we extend these results to general twists $\mathcal{E}$, and we refine the conditions on the subgroupoid in such a way that they are not just sufficient but also necessary for $C^*_{r}(S;\mathcal{E}_S)$ to be a Cartan subalgebra of $C^*_{r}(G;\mathcal{E})$. In other words, we have found all possible Cartan subalgebras that arise from subgroupoids.</description>

      <title>Shafarevich-Tate groups of abelian varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.09970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2005.09970v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Shafarevich-Tate group $W (\mathscr{A})$ measures the failure of the Hasse principle for an abelian variety $\mathscr{A}$. Using a correspondence between the abelian varieties and the higher dimensional non-commutative tori, we prove that $W (\mathscr{A})\cong Cl~(\Lambda)\oplus Cl~(\Lambda)$ or $W (\mathscr{A})\cong \left(\mathbf{Z}/2^k\mathbf{Z}\right) \oplus Cl_{~\mathbf{odd}}~(\Lambda)\oplus Cl_{~\mathbf{odd}}~(\Lambda)$, where $Cl~(\Lambda)$ is the ideal class group of a ring $\Lambda$ associated to the K-theory of the non-commutative tori and $2^k $ divides the order of $Cl~(\Lambda)$. The case of elliptic curves with complex multiplication is considered in detail.</description>

      <title>$M$-ideals in $H^\infty(\mathbb{D})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article intends to initiate an investigation into the structure of $M$-ideals in $H^\infty(\mathbb{D})$, where $H^\infty(\mathbb{D})$ denotes the Banach algebra of all bounded analytic functions on the open unit disc $\mathbb{D}$ in $\mathbb{C}$. We introduce the notion of analytic primes and prove that $M$-ideals in $H^\infty(\mathbb{D})$ are analytic primes. From Hilbert function space perspective, we additionally prove that $M$-ideals in $H^\infty(\mathbb{D})$ are dense in the Hardy space. We show that outer functions play a key role in representing singly generated closed ideals in $H^\infty(\mathbb{D})$ that are $M$-ideals. This is also relevant to $M$-ideals in $H^\infty(\mathbb{D})$ that are finitely generated closed ideals in $H^\infty(\mathbb{D})$. We analyze $p$-sets of $H^\infty(\mathbb{D})$ and their connection to the \v{S}ilov boundary of the maximal ideal space of $H^\infty(\mathbb{D})$. Some of our results apply to the polydisc. In addition to addressing questions regarding $M$-ideals, the results presented in this paper offer some new perspectives on bounded analytic functions.</description>
