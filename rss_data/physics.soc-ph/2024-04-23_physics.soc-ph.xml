      <title>Hypergraphs and political structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on previous work, this paper extends the modeling of political structures from simplicial complexes to hypergraphs. This allows the analysis of more complex political dynamics where agents who are willing to form coalitions contain subsets that would not necessarily form coalitions themselves. We extend topological constructions such as wedge, cone, and collapse from simplicial complexes to hypergraphs and use them to study mergers, mediators, and power delegation in political structures. Concepts such as agent viability and system stability are generalized to the hypergraph context, alongside the introduction of the notion of local viability. Additionally, we use embedded homology of hypergraphs to analyze power concentration within political systems. Along the way, we introduce some new notions within the hypergraph framework that are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>superblockify: A Python Package for Automated Generation, Visualization, and Analysis of Potential Superblocks in Cities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: superblockify is a Python package for partitioning an urban street network into Superblock-like neighborhoods and for visualizing and analyzing the partition results. A Superblock is a set of adjacent urban blocks where vehicular through traffic is prevented or pacified, giving priority to people walking and cycling. The Superblock blueprints and descriptive statistics generated by superblockify can be used by urban planners as a first step in a data-driven planning pipeline, or by urban data scientists as an efficient computational method to evaluate Superblock partitions. The software is licensed under AGPLv3 and is available at https://superblockify.city.</description>

      <title>A Compositional Approach to Higher-Order Structure in Complex Systems: Carving Nature at its Joints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relating microscopic interactions to macroscopic observables is a central challenge in the study of complex systems. Addressing this question requires understanding both pairwise and higher-order interactions, but the latter are less well understood. Here, we show that the M\"obius inversion theorem provides a general mathematical formalism for deriving higher-order interactions from macroscopic observables, relative to a chosen decomposition of the system into parts. Applying this framework to a diverse range of systems, we demonstrate that many existing notions of higher-order interactions, from epistasis in genetics and many-body couplings in physics, to synergy in game theory and artificial intelligence, naturally arise from an appropriate mereological decomposition. By revealing the common mathematical structure underlying seemingly disparate phenomena, our work highlights the fundamental role of decomposition choice in the definition and estimation of higher-order interactions. We discuss how this unifying perspective can facilitate the transfer of insights between domains, guide the selection of appropriate system decompositions, and motivate the search for novel interaction types through creative decomposition strategies. More broadly, our results suggest that the M\"obius inversion theorem provides a powerful lens for understanding the emergence of complex behaviour from the interplay of microscopic parts, with applications across a wide range of disciplines.</description>

      <title>Deep Overlapping Community Search via Subspace Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Community search (CS) aims to identify a set of nodes based on a specified query, leveraging structural cohesiveness and attribute homogeneity. This task enjoys various applications, ranging from fraud detection to recommender systems. In contrast to algorithm-based approaches, graph neural network (GNN) based methods define communities using ground truth labels, leveraging prior knowledge to explore patterns from graph structures and node features. However, existing solutions face three major limitations: 1) GNN-based models primarily focus on the disjoint community structure, disregarding the nature of nodes belonging to multiple communities. 2) These model structures suffer from low-order awareness and severe efficiency issues. 3) The identified community is subject to the free-rider and boundary effects. In this paper, we propose Simplified Multi-hop Attention Networks (SMN), which consist of three designs. First, we introduce a subspace community embedding technique called Sparse Subspace Filter (SSF). SSF enables the projection of community embeddings into distinct vector subspaces, accommodating the nature of overlapping and nesting community structures. In addition, we propose a lightweight model structure and a hop-wise attention mechanism to capture high-order patterns while improving model efficiency. Furthermore, two search algorithms are developed to minimize the latent space's community radius, addressing the challenges of free-rider and boundary effects. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first learning-based study of overlapping community search. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance of SMN compared with the state-of-the-art approaches. SMN achieves 14.73% improvements in F1-Score and up to 3 orders of magnitude acceleration in model efficiency.</description>

      <title>Analysis and Visualization of Musical Structure using Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, a framework for defining and analysing a family of graphs or networks from symbolic music information is discussed. Such graphs concern different types of elements, such as pitches, chords and rhythms, and the relations among them, and are built from quantitative or categorical data contained in digital music scores. They are helpful in visualizing musical features at once, thus leading to a computational tool for understanding the general structural elements of a music fragment. Data obtained from a digital score undergoes different analytical procedures from graph and network theory, such as computing their centrality measures and entropy, and detecting their communities. We analyze pieces of music coming from different styles, and compare some of our results with conclusions from traditional music analysis techniques.</description>

      <title>Detection Method for Social Subsets Consisting of Anti-Network Construction for Unilateral Preference Behavior on Directed Temporal Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In existing research, as an example of one-sided preference, a conversation structure in which a person who is assumed to be an adult mainly sends one-sided messages to a person who is assumed to be a minor was observed. If subgraphs composed based on such unilateral preferences could be automatically extracted from the network structure, it would be possible to automatically detect communication conducted based on specific motivations from a vast amount of conversation data. In this study, we construct a bottom-up method to detect subgraphs composed of unilateral preferences in Greedy, and discuss the subset of unilateral preferences detected in this simulation.

      <title>Deciphering Unilateral Communication Patterns in Directed Temporal Networks: Network Role Distribution Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the vast expanse of online communication, identifying unilateral preference patterns can be pivotal in understanding and mitigating risks such as predatory behavior. This paper presents a comprehensive approach to dissect and visualize such patterns in social networks. Through the lens of a directed network model, we simulate a scenario where a predominant cluster 'A' disperses information unilaterally towards a much larger, but passive, cluster 'B', while being overseen by a vigilant cluster 'C', restricted by an information blocking cluster 'D', and countered by an alerting cluster 'E'. Incorporated into this study is a simulation framework that models the flow of information across a directed network comprising various clusters with distinct roles and communication behaviors. The simulation employs a dynamic system where clusters 'A' through 'E' interact over a series of time steps, with each cluster's activity shaped by both intrinsic message-generation rules and external media influences. By tracking the accumulated media influence on each cluster, we gain a nuanced understanding of the long-term effects of media on communication patterns. The results provide a window into the cyclical nature of influence and the propagation of information, with potential applications in detecting and mitigating unilateral communication patterns that could signal harmful activities such as online predation.
  This study, therefore, presents a comprehensive approach that combines network theory, simulation modeling, and dynamic media influence analysis to explore and understand the complexities of unilateral preference communication within social networks.This paper is partially an attempt to utilize "Generative AI" and was written with educational intent.

      <title>Phase Field Modeling in Social Media Dynamics:Simulation of Opinion Evolution with Feedback, Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces a new numerical model to simulate how information is comprehended and processed on social networks, using continuous "Phase Field Modeling" variables (phiA, phiB, phiC) to represent individual users' opinions. It captures the immediate and two-way nature of social media interactions, reproducing the spread and feedback of information. The model incorporates psychological and social factors like confirmation bias and opinion rigidity to analyze information processing and opinion development among users. It also explores the dynamics of opinion segregation and interaction in and out of filter bubbles, offering a quantitative view of opinion dynamics on platforms like social networking services (SNS). This approach combines theoretical models with real-world social network data to study the effects of information concentration on opinion formation and the phenome Phase Field Modeling of opinion polarization and echo chamber effects on SNS.

      <title>The behavior of rich-club coefficient in scale-free networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rich-club phenomenon, which provides information about the association between nodes, is a useful method to study the hierarchy structure of networks. In this work, we explore the behavior of rich-club coefficient (RCC) in scale-free networks, and find that the degree-based RCC is a power function of degree centrality with power exponent \b{eta} and the betweenness-based RCC is a linear function of betweenness centrality with slope {\theta}. The findings from the New York metro network further validate our conclusions. Moreover, we calculate the value of RCC in a BA network by deleting nodes and obtain a general expression for RCC as a function of node sequence. On this basis, the solution of RCC for centrality is also obtained, which shows that the curve of RCC is determined by the centrality distribution. In order to find out what affects \b{eta} and {\theta}, we conduct numerical simulations in scale-free networks, and observe: \b{eta} and {\gamma} (the degree distribution exponent) increase together, {\theta} increases with m (the number of new edges) and decreases to convergence as {\gamma} increases.</description>
